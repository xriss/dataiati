   <narrative xml:lang="EN">As a joint organisation of the Finnish parliamentary parties, Demo Finland is in a unique position to promote interest and debate on development policy within and between the parties and it offers opportunities for party members to participate in democracy
 support and expose themselves to the realities of state of development and democracy elsewhere. The constructive cooperation and participation of member parties make a strong foundation and serve as an example in Demo Finlands work abroad.  the outcome of
 the work set as Finnish parliamentary parties have stronger visions on development policy and democracy support. This outcome builds from three pillars, development education, communications and advocacy, each with their own activities. The result of Demo
 Finlands development education as stated in the ToC is Party members knowledge on development policy and democracy support has increased. The ToC is based on an assumption that Finnish politicians are willing to change their opinions and attitudes towards
 development policy when they gain new information on the current state of development, democracy and development policies. #Development policy courses for member party politicians form the cornerstone of development education in 2018  2021. These courses 
continue the legacy of Demo Finlands study visits developing them into more programmatic, informative and influential. #The courses combine two main aims of Demo Finland, they advance debate and knowledge on development and democracy among the member parti
es, and support democratic development in partner countries since the participants will also act as trainers during the study visits that are included in the course curriculum. The objective of development communications is to raise awareness on the import
ance of democracy and functioning multiparty systems, contributing to the parties ability to create stronger visions on development policy.</narrative>
