   <narrative xml:lang="EN">1. Project: 11756 Promoting Access to Quality Education in Northern Kenya for OOSC (Bringing back Out Of School children to school) #2. Project area and Country: Marsabit County (Laisamis and Loyangalani sub-county),  #Turkana County (Turkana East and Sout
h sub-county), Garissa County (Ijara sub-county) #3. Project justification: #The communities traditional lifestyle in the targeted counties is largely based on pastoralism. The majority of parents have their children herd livestock rather than go to school
 and do not value education highly. In some cases, the schools are far away, poorly equipped and the quality of teaching is affected by poor teaching methods. Due to understaffing and poor quality of teaching, learning performance in the targeted communiti
es in the national examination has generally been poor. As a result, very few children graduate to high school or access other learning institutions. Girls access to quality education is even more constrained than that of boys. They are often exposed to nu
merous risks and rights violations, including early marriage, sexual exploitation, crime, and child labour. They also undertake difficult chores, such as the transport of water from distant water sources, the collection of firewood and caring for their sib
lings at home. Overall, children who are out of school are more vulnerable to exploitation, recruitment to militia groups, abuse and poverty.#4. The main objective and the expected results:#The main objective of the project is to improve school enrolment, 
retention, attendance and learning outcomes for 13500 children in Northern Kenya. This will be accomplished through improved community awareness of the importance of OOSC enrolment in school, improved learning environments and infrastructure in the targete
d primary schools. The work will also focus on the development and implementation of integrated retention strategies in the targeted primary schools.   #5. Right-holders/ beneficiaries: 13,500 out of school children (OOSC) in Northern Kenya #    Duty beare
