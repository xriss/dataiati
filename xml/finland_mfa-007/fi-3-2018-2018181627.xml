   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The school system of Senegal is French. Children start school without understanding the teaching language which impacts their learning results negatively. Literacy rates are low in Senegal (for the whole population 55,6% and among women 34,1% in 2015). Dur
ing the project the following activities are implemented: Pre-school program in sereer, teacher&apos;s training, production of teaching materials and litterature in sereer and pulaar as well as dictionary production in sereer in collaboration with the universit
y of Dakar, literacy classes for women in pulaar and advocacy for official school programs in mother tongue. The learning results improve with mother tongue program among children. In adult literacy classes mostly women are being taught and their livelihoo
d and participation in decision making improves. Production of teaching materials and litterature in local languages increase the level of appreciation of national languages. Advocacy work streghtens the approach of school program in mother tongue on a nat
ional level. The beneficiers are in rural areas where learning results are weak. Our partner is the Lutheran Church of Senegal which has a long experience in literacy work and grassroot contact with the population of rural areas.</narrative>
