  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Malnutrition, health problems and inadequate food security affects the most vulnerable peoples lives, including lives of women and children. The Outcome of the Country Programme is the increased fulfilment of the rights of children to adequate nutrition an
d health in the selected areas in DPRK. The output of the food security component is the increased capacity of authorities and partner farms to produce more good quality seed and food potatoes for improving nutrition in a sustainable way. The output of the
 health component is the improved capacity and skills of partner hospitals and their staff to diagnose and treat the most relevant health problems of their catchment area and neighbouring districts. The Country Programme is implemented in close collaborati
on with Korea-EU Cooperation Coordinating Agency (KECCA). The Programme is carried out in cooperation of the leadership and the personnel of five cooperative farms and six hospitals as well as Korean Academy of Agriculture and Science. The Country Programm
e directly affects the lives of over 6500 people and indirectly there will be more than 2,2 million beneficiaries. There are still over 10 million people lacking adequate nutrition in North Korea. The food security component is developing sustainable potat
o production as well as food security in five cooperative villages situated in remote mountainous areas of North Korea in three different counties, improving the situation especially during the food gap months of August and September. Fida International is
 planning a new 4-year programme combining the good results of the old programmes as well as bringing some new elements and ideas for the Programme. The Health care system in North Korea is still in need of external assistance in order to provide the essen
tial basic services. The Programmes health component improves the rights of children and adults in the catchment areas of the six hospitals to get essential health care services. The Programme trains the local doctors to improve their major clinical specia
lties, such as cardiology, surgery, gastroenterology and radiology, to diagnose and treat serious illnesses in a modern way. Linked with training, the Programme provides the hospitals with essential equipment. The Programme benefits poor and vulnerable fam
ilies with children as well as adults, who are ordinary farmers and workers.</narrative>
