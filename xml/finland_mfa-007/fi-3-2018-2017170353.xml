  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project will install BettaFour solar light kits in the homes of community members, altogether 130 households in Kwadlakuse and Esikhuthwaneni, two deeply rural villages in Northern KwaZulu-Natal, which is one of the poorest regions in South Africa larg
ely due to its history as a marginalised homeland. Access to electricity is important for the rural poor as it reduces especially women&apos;s work burden, improve people&apos;s standards of living and children&apos;s educational outcomes. Earlier the households have met
 their energy needs using fossil fuels and/or biomass. Project will contribute to climate change mitigation, as fossil fuels will be replaced by solar power. Project&apos;s solar kits were selected as they offer a practical and cost effective way to provide lig
ht to rural households living in isolated areas. The system consists of four 1 watt LED lights, a controller with lead crystal battery, a 10 watt solar panel and a 10Ah 6 Volt Lead crystal battery. Solar power provides communities lightning without costs.T
he installation will involve members from each household and basic training on the use of the unit will be provided to promote long term sustainability. Each household will also be required to sign a social contract which explains that (unless defective) t
he property becomes their responsibility. In addition to overseeing the installation of the lighting kits, ACT mentors will provide assistance in the development of homestead food gardens, as well as offer advice in ways to store and save water when they v
isit the households. The proposed project will be four months in duration and budget is inclusive of all equipment, administration costs and tax. Monitoring will take place throughout the project and periodic visits will also be conducted by ACT teams once
 the project has been completed. In 2011, ACT began implementing the Mkuze River Conservation Project. The project aimed to work in conjunction with the three communities bordering the reserve to develop an environmentally, socially and economically benefi
cial plan to expand the protected area. The two communities in this project take part in the Mkuze River project.</narrative>
