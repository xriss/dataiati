  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Over six decades of armed conflict in Myanmar border areas have had a severe impact on the development of the areas and allowed only a limited space for active and inclusive civil society, and dialogue between the Union Government and Ethnic communities, a
nd among different groups, including ethnic and religious groups, in conflict affected areas. People and communities in conflict-affected border areas are denied their rights to basic services such as education and healthcare, as well as meaningful partici
pation in decision-making and the peace process. The absence of peace and dialogue has left Civil Society Organizations (CSO) from conflict affected ethnic area largely outside of official peace process. Additionally, CSOs in the remote areas, still lack t
he capacities and space to participate in local and national development, and effectively represent their communities.  The project aims to contribute to promoting active and inclusive civil society, and supporting CSOs in Kayah States to participate in pe
aceful development and promote the rights of their communities. More specifically, the project will work closely with CSOs to improve their organizational capacity by assessing and addressing capacity gaps and continuously mentoring the development of key 
processes. There will be a special attention paid to inclusive participation of vulnerable groups. Human Rights Approach gives a focus to rights of the people in concern including the most vulnerable members of the communities. The project will support tar
geted CSOs to increase their capacity to support their members, particularly youth and women including IDPs and returnees, to exercise their rights to education, livelihood and participation. The project will also provide funds to small projects for CSOs t
o implement their activities to support their communities. The project will the Karenni National Women Organization in organizing skill trainings to create livelihood opportunities for the vulnerable, particularly disadvantaged women and the Kayah State Yo
uth Network in providing civic education to youth to increase their knowledge and skills in active participation in development of their communities. The overall goal is to support strong and active CSOs in contributing to diverse and active civil society 
in Kayah State. Therefore, capacity development trainings and mentoring, including the project design, is available for both targeted CSOs</narrative>
