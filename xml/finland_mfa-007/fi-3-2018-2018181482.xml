   <narrative xml:lang="EN">F.a: Protecting rights for enhanced livelihoods of workers in the value chain of bananas</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project will promote and protect the rights of workers within banana value chain in Ghana. Although Ghana gained lower middle-income status in 2010, inequality is on the rise and poverty remains prevalent in many areas. Ghana is a small player in the g
lobal banana market, but exports have increased sharply. Export banana production is concentrated to two companies and they employ around 3,150 banana workers. Generally, opportunities to engage in full-time waged employment are in short supply in Ghana, m
aking the jobs created by the banana industry of significant value for the local population. However, living wage study carried out in 2017 revealed, that basic wages for general banana workers averaged 74% of the living wage estimate and clearly insuffici
ent for decent life in Southern Ghana. The fear of losing employment as a result of agitating for rights has created vulnerabilities that limit the exercise of the freedoms by workers as they feel that making too many demands on the company will lead to re
dundancies. Despite being aware of their rights, workers are unable to speak about their rights and do not want to join the worker organization because of fear of being victimized if they were to voice the issues. Supervisory and management positions are d
ominated by men while women work in lower level positions in sections considered as lighter duties. This is due to socio-cultural factors as well as very low literacy levels among women workers; women fear to be leaders because their peers will intimidate 
them due to their inability to read and write. Most meetings are conducted in English and women feel uncomfortable because they do not understand much English. Project?s goal is to improve living conditions of workers in the banana value chain in Ghana. Th
e purpose of the project is improved employee satisfaction on Ghana?s banana plantations. The project?s expected outputs are enhanced awareness of gender equality, greater awareness of labour rights, strengthened capacity of workers to organize, companies?
 greater commitment towards living wage and workers? enhanced negotiation skills. The project is implemented by Fairtrade Africa in cooperation with trade unions TUC, GAWU and TWU. http://www.fairtradeafrica.net/</narrative>
