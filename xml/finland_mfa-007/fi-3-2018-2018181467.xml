   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Demo Finland/ NIMD project in Myanmar to support democratic transition focuses on strengthening the democratic role of political parties in a cross-party setting at the regional/state level of Myanmar. The current programme of Myanmar School of Politics (M
ySoP) started in 2016. The basic element of the programme are core courses, oganized 3 times a year. The core courses are 4-week-long and all the parties in particular regions/states of Myanmar, send their participants into the course, according to criteri
a set by MySoP. Politicians gain practical experience in policy development, public consultation, strategic policy planning, human rights, gender equality, debating, speech writing and multiparty dialogue. This contributes to a culture of dialogue amongst 
political parties, leading to the facilitation of dialogue. Moreover, a permanent Multiparty Dialogue Platform has been created in Shan State to support multiparty dialogue in practise among 12 parties in a sustainable and participatory way. MySoP alumnis 
will receive specific support through tailor made workshops, focusing on enhancing skills in debating, advocacy and planning policies etc. Additionally, peer exchange between international and Myanmar politicians will create further support on multiparty c
o-operation on the basis of experience sharing and mutual learning.##Outcomes of the project 2016-2020:#1. Safe space for dialogue btw. all relevant political actors#2. Political actors voice and monitor citizen&apos;s interests#3. Improved capacity of local pa
rtner#4. Increased interest in collaborating among and btw political and civic actors, fostering inclusiveness of women and youth.#The achievement of the outcomes and results are monitored against pre-set indicators throughout the project. #The direct targ
et groups are the state level politicians taking part in the MySoP courses, but also the political parties as institutions. In the end, the people of Myanmar are the final beneficiaries of improved governance and democracy in their country.#NIMD and Demo F
inland are currently implementing the programme directly through our joint country based country representative and supporting staff, building on the work of the pilot phase in 2014-2015. NIMD and Demo Finland will further develop a strategy to set-up a co
untry office. Identification of an impartial, skilled and efficient local partner organisation for future implementation has not yet been succesful in the country.</narrative>
