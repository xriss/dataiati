   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project consists of core support towards implementation of ISER?s activities over three years as guided by its strategic plan for the period July 2018 ? June 2022. The overall goal of the organisation for the next five years as articulated under the s
trategic plan is improving enjoyment of Economic and Social Rights (ESRs) by everyone regardless of social status with a focus on the most vulnerable groups including women, children, Persons With Disability (PWD) and older persons. ISER will build on prev
ious successes and compliment ongoing efforts to create awareness for promotion and protection of ESRs in order for the right holders to demand these rights from duty bearers. ISER will also engage in advocacy at different levels to strengthen the legal pr
otection and enforcement of ESRs by generating credible and consistent information on ESRs to influence policy, legislation and programs. This will extend to regulation of private actors to ensure they do not undermine ESRs. The extension to private actors
 stems from the background that as Uganda increasingly focuses on private sector led growth and Public Private Partnerships (PPPs) to deliver key services like health and education, the state has not put in place adequate measures to regulate private provi
ders and to ensure they do not detrimentally impact on the realisation of especially ESRs. ISER will engage in budget advocacy as well as analyse economic and fiscal policy through a human rights lens. Doing so will promote greater accountability, particip
ation and responsiveness in fiscal policy and ensure greater resources for ESRs. ISER will be working towards strengthening citizen engagement for government accountability by creating platforms for dialogue between duty bearers and rights holders as well 
as building the capacity of community accountability structures to improve their effectiveness. Though participation is provided for as a right in Uganda?s Constitution, ISER?s research has found that there are few mechanisms to enable people to meaningful
ly participate and hold their leaders accountable for realisation of ESRs. ISER will also maintain the multi-layered advocacy strategy that covers local government, national, regional and international levels in order to maximise impact.</narrative>
