   <narrative xml:lang="EN">There is no shortage of creativity and ability among the youth and children of this world. What is lacking is the right kind of learning experience that can not only build the fundamentals (literacy numeracy etc) but also develop their creative capacities 
in a way that can lead to self-expression fulfillment and employment in an ever-changing digital world.Humans are inherently social and part of the secret to unlocking human potential is to create the right kind of learning experience that engages peers to
 work with (and for) each other. Especially in locations where there are not enough trained teachers to cater for all of the young people leveraging the power of peer-to-peer learning will be essential for skill development.What is missing for engaging cou
ntless young people is a combination of the right social/fun training model software to track/reward effort and digital content that can make the jobs of coaches/trainers easier or even enable people to learn skills on their own. This project is designed t
o accomplish several objectives:Engage Tunapanda Institute team members in developing and testing new micro-courses within their communities. This content can support schools and other facilities (including Tunapanda Institute) to develop sustainable data-
driven business models around training. 50% of the cost to be provided by the Embassy of Finland in Nairobi with the other 50% to come from other sources and in-kind contributions of time from team members.Perform additional software development and custom
ization. 46% of the cost to be provided by the Embassy of Finland in Nairobi with 54% coming from a partnership with Xavier Project in a project funded by GIZ.Support one cohort of Tunapanda Institutes flagship 3-month intensive training program as it is m
odified to focus on training coaches/trainers who will then be able to promote the material</narrative>
