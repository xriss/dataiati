   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In November 2020, the Public International Law &amp; Policy Group (PILPG) received funding for a 17-month program to support Sudanese stakeholders in the establishment and implementation of inclusive national, regional, and local transitional justice mechanisms that reflect international best practices and the diverse interests of the Sudanese people.  PILPG is currently engaging in conversations with the funder to extend the program to March 31, 2023.

This program builds upon PILPG&#x2019;s 14 years of experience working on issues of peace and justice with the Sudanese Opposition as well as its legal support to the Parties at the Juba Peace Talks. The outputs of the program include: 

Support the development of a transitional justice framework that reflects the interests of the Sudanese people as identified through an inclusive needs assessment that analyzes the existing legal and institutional frameworks, maps existing transitional justice efforts, and incorporates the inputs of constituents throughout Sudan;  

Provide legal support and mentorship to national, regional, and local stakeholders engaged in the establishment and implementation of national, regional, and local transitional justice institutions that meet the needs of the people of Sudan, reflect international best practices, and complement and reinforce Sudan&#x2019;s peace process and political transition by: 
Conducting ongoing in-person and remote consultations with key stakeholders on the organization and establishment of transitional justice institutions.
Convening  capacity-building workshops for key stakeholders; and
Providing ongoing support to the drafting of legal, regulatory, and institutional frameworks for relevant transitional justice mechanisms, including facilitating drafting sessions with national, regional or local stakeholders. 

Support the establishment of formalized mechanisms for citizen participation and feedback on transitional justice mechanisms, including the development and implementation of a public education and outreach campaign to improve stakeholder understanding and engagement by: 
Providing ongoing support to crafting formalized mechanisms, including strategic action plans;
Convening  town hall meetings designed to obtain constituent and citizen views on transitional justice in Sudan; and 
Facilitating  public education sessions to raise awareness of transitional justice concepts and context in Sudan, including mechanisms for public engagement in accountability mechanisms, access to compensation and reparations mechanisms, and the role of individuals and civil society organizations in transitional justice programs. 

This program is designed to be responsive to the needs of the Sudanese people. As such, the substance and approach to each of the workshops, drafting sessions, and outreach mechanisms is closely coordinated with  civil society stakeholders.  PILPG thanks all of the Sudanese stakeholders who contributed to the design of this program and n who contribute to implementation of this program toward the achievement of peace with justice throughout Sudan.

As a result of the change in political environment following the October 25, 2021 military coup, PILPG has paused its engagement with current government actors and has pivoted this program to enable PILPG to focus more on engagement and mobilization of civil society, periphery groups, youth groups, victims, women, academicians, and other change actors in Sudan. However, PILPG remains actively aware of a potential return to civilian governance, and in this respect will ensure it is ready to help should this occur.</narrative>
