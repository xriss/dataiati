   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Integrated health and nutrition response to IDPs at Al Mukha district (Priority 1)</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">International Medical Corps propose to respond to increased humanitarian needs of conflict affected populations and IDPs in the West Coast region through implementation of lifesaving health care and nutrition services in  Az Zahari  and  Al Makha sub districts in Al Mukha district.The urgent humanitarian support will target priority locations  that are in severe need of health care and nutrition interventions, especially following the increased conflict in the region as well as the influx of IDPs to Al Mukha. Interventions  are aimed at reducing maternal and child morbidity and mortality while increasing access of the vulnerable populations to the minimum service package and providing quality curative and preventive nutrition services. The interventions will be implemented through supporting seven static health facilities (Al Mukha hospital, Nobet Al Ameri, Yahktul, Al Kadiha , Al Saherah, Al Zohari,Hasi Saleem)  and two mobile teams that reach will target about 7,939 IDPs located in hard-to-reach locations. In terms of health services, primary health care interventions will be in line with Yemen MSP including OPD consultations, IMCI , ANC/PNC, FP , EPI , NCD  support of normal delivery and essential newborn care while secondary health care will be implemented through the major hospital in the region (Al Mukha hospital) to serve the catchment population as well as the surrounding communities, which is also in line with the objective of the project as access to health care will be improved. This in turn will reduce referrals to neighboring governorates as well as serve the economically challenged beneficiaries who cannot afford private facilities or referral services attainable in other governorates. The populations within these locations are among the poorest with extremely limited sources of income to sustain their basic needs, much less for health services. These communities continue to be considered as hard-to-reach areas due to the security risks such as mine fields, proximity to frontlines and distance from basic services. Two mobile teams will be supported to provide life-saving integrated services 5 days a week for a total population of about 12,964 beneficiaries  in the second and third catchment zone and those in hard-to-reach areas including 13 IDP (internal displaced persons) camps (Al Shatheli, Al Hali site, Al Rouwis site, Al Oshaira site, Al Zahera site, Al Qahirah Site, Al Hasseb, Al Sowais, Al Shaed Hamood, Al Qatabia, Al Nibia, Al Holaibi and Old Government Building IDP). Community health volunteers (CHVs) will work at the community level to raise awareness on key health and nutrition messages including COVID-19 preventive messages serving as a key preventive intervention. In terms of nutrition, IMC will continue to support the treatment of severe acute malnutrition (SAM) and moderate acute malnutrition (MAM) for children (ages 0-59 months) and pregnant and lactating women (PLW) through  OTPs) and  TSFP. SAM cases) with medical complications will be referred to the nearest stabilization center that is being supported by UNICEF (United Nations International Children S Emergency Fund). In addition, IMC will promote   (IYCF-E) and hygiene practices among women and caregivers as a strategy to prevent and treat malnutrition. Micronutrient powders (MNPs) will be provided to infants and young children 6&#x2013;59 months to prevent micronutrient deficiencies. IMC will build on the achievements of the currently implemented project within the same areas of intervention for fast roll out  of the services in response to the acute emergency needs. In order to address other identified priority needs such as WASH, Food Security, NFIs, IMC will collaborate with Solidarities International who will deliver these service (WASH, food security and NFIs) targeting the same operational areas and communities so as to ensure  delivery of comprehensive lifesaving humanitarian assistance.</narrative>
