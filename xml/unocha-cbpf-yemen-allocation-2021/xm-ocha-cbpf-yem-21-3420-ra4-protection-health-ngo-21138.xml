   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In line with the inter-cluster gaps and needs assessment and in response to the 4th YHF RA to provide critical assistance to the most vulnerable people in Al Bayda and Marib Governorates. The proposed intervention will cover critical Health and Protection programs in an integrated manner at HFs and MT levels across 5 amongst the identified intersectoral severity 5 and 4 districts, As Sawmah, Radman, Al Bayda city, and Rada&#x2019;a in Al Bayda governorate and Al Abdiah in Marib governorate. 

The project will focus on scaling up the support of primary health care in 5 HFs (As Sawmah DH, Alshaeed Alawadi rural hospital in Radman, Mother and Child HC in AL Bayda city, AlGhoil Alsfule HC in Radman, and Oiean HC in As Sawmah) while covering limited secondary support to Al Thawra hospital with 2 specialists to cover referred cases. Also, to cover the widely spread catchment areas in Al Avdya and the IDPs load in Rada&#x2019;a, 3 Mobile teams will be deployed and supported through these projects to cover the health needs. 

Psychologists, GPs, midwives, and nurses from the targeted HFs and MMTs will be trained on introduction to case management and referral pathways, and Psychological First Aid. In coordination with Yemen Women Union, the national and subnational clusters of Protection and GBV and other partners BFD will provide psychological support and referral for identified cases and cases in need of financial empowerment. Furthermore, awareness material will be highly disseminated in the targeted areas increasing participation and knowledge of the services provided and the service providers.  

This project was designed and coordinated with the Health and Protection Clusters, and locations were chosen for their vulnerability in collaboration with NFDHR whom are going to respond to the acute WaSH and Education needs aspects within the targeted districts as well. In consultation with the Health and MoSAL offices, and the respective local authorities, BFD will support the 5 prioritized districts with MSP, activation of MT, Referral, RH, HFs rehabilitation and maintenance activities, and mental health, in line with the protection services represented in the provision of Case Management services and psychosocial support, PFA and MHPSS, GBV assistance, and appropriate referral assistance to proper services providers in the targeted districts, all of which will be mainly conducted through the MT (in Al Abdiah) and the targeted HFs as they support a broad conflict-affected population of both IDPs and host community, children and their families with estimated overall target of 29,686 beneficiaries.</narrative>
