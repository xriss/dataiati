   <narrative xml:lang="EN">BCFHD through the current twelve-month project aims, through a series of activities planned and would be implemented to be in line with the WASH cluster&apos;s objectives and the WASH cluster strategy for the 1st SA of YHPF 2021, at providing comprehensive emergency and life-saving WASH assistance including safe drinking water, appropriate sanitation facilities, right hygiene practices to the most recent acutely vulnerable IDPs and host communities affected by conflict and recent displacements in two high priority districts: Salh district which is still considered a conflict area with population of 84080 and 71468 total people in need) and Al-Mudhaffar (a population of 180,466 and with 153396 PIN ) of Taiz city. Both districts have been prioritized for YHF 2021 SA1 of WASH. Number of the IDPs in the said districts is living in Hosting sited estimated by 12000 individuals according to CCCM Assessment May, 2021 and 25000 IDPs based on BCFHD&#x2019;s Shelter assessment in the host community.

The life &#x2013;saving and equitable access to safe water for (80000 individuals) of IDPs and vulnerable host communities in the said districts will be reflected by water supply to (91) water distribution points in (12) IDPs sites and in frontline areas in Salh district where HHs of IDPs and host community live (about 13333 individuals) monitoring water quality in water distribution points purchasing and installation of (8) water tanks to IDPs sites in Salh district (this will serve 5000ndividuals) maintaining and supply chlorine injectors for 30 wells that feed water network in the targeted areas in Salh and Al-Mudhaffar districts and chlorinating, testing and monitoring water quality in the wells covering (61667)individuals .

In relation to Sanitation Targeted HHs of IDPs and host communities have support to safe sanitation and improved hygiene practices for (93000 individuals), the project activities involves connecting an open sewage line in Al-Haqir area in AlMudhaffar district (a densely populated areas with around 10000 IDPs and host community) with the nearby sewage network rehabilitating the blocked sewage line in the Health Institute area in Salh and connecting it to the public network in Al-Mushiki area (about (5000) individuals live in the area) opening the blocked manholes in Salh and Almudhaffar and conducting cleaning campaigns in IDPs hosting sites, host communities and marginalized groups and endemic areas in Salh and Al-Mudhaffar districts on daily basis (this will serve about 50000 individuals in the two districts). In relation to hygiene, the project activities involves providing consumable hygiene kits with jerry cans to 4000 SAM HHs (2000 HHs in Salh and 2000 HHs in Al-Mudhaffar) training (26) community volunteers in key hygiene messages and community engagement approaches to conduct hygiene promotion/community mobilization and RCCE for Covid -19 in endemic areas in Salah and Al-Mudhaffar districts (28000 individuals will be reached by hygiene promotion).

What is special about the project is that many of its activities will be implemented through Cash-for-Work, including the cleaning campaigns (420 workers 30% of them are women from ALmohamasheen), cleaning blocked manholes (25 workers), and chlorinating the water sources (35 workers). This can enhance the income of a huge number of HHs.</narrative>
