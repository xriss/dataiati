  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">After more than six years of ongoing conflict in Yemen, The health system is overwhelmed: only 51 per cent of health facilities in Yemen are functioning (many have been damaged or destroyed due to the conflict) and those that continue to operate are severely understaffed and unable to provide critical health services. Al-Jawf is among the most affected areas by the conflict and lack of health services. 

The proposed project has been designed to address the Health needs of the targeted vulnerable IDPs and other conflict affected population in Al-Hazem and Barat Al-Anan districts, Al-Jawf.  The following IDP sites in Al-Hazem: Al Salam, Al Saed, Wadi Shajen, Al-Mehzam Al Gharbi, Al Mehzam Al Sahrqi, Al Jarr, A&apos;al A&apos;aiedh and sites in Barat: Safareen, Thuailibah, Janoob Al-Jiblah, Shamal Al Jiblah, AlKhaleef, Afa, Saih, Al-Wadeyayen, Tho Ali, Alqarm, Nuhm Mountain, Khsherban, Makheem, Araer, Makheem AlGharbeen, Al Murrah, Al-Hnao, Makheem Al Nmasah, Makheem Al Khabab are exoecred to benefit from the services of the targeted health facilities. ADRA will not only be focused on providing Health services but will also coordinate with other partners like the Yemen Family Care Association (YFCA) and Yemen Alkhair for Relief amp Development Foundation (YARD) to ensure that the targeted communities have access to comprehensive lifesaving assistance.

Through the proposed project, ADRA will provide the Minimum Service Package (MSP) of health services in both Al-Hazem and Barat Al-Anan hospitals. The main outcome of this project are 1) Targeted vulnerable community has increased access to the minimum health services. To achieve the project outcomes and ultimately the project objectives, the project will operationally support the targeted hospitals through running cost, hazard allowances for the health workers as well as medications, medical supplies and the necessary equipment for service delivery. The project will also ensure that those in need for tertiary level services are not left behind by establishing a referral system. Furthermore, ADRA will build the capacity of the health workers in the agreed hospitals to ensure delivery of quality assistance. Outreach services will be conducted biweekly to the nearby IDPs sites. The project will be implemented in close coordination with other NGOs. ADRA will work closely with YFCA and YARD to cover the other sectors. YARD will cover protection and food need while YFCA will carry out major WASH interventions, some of it within the same targeted health facilities of ADRA. The projects are planned to be implemented simultaneously. 

The project will ensure equal access of all vulnerable groups including women, men, boys and girls. ADRA will hire gender balanced staff and volunteers to ensure that. Gender will be mainstreamed throughout the project. The project activities are designed to address the needs of the different community members where women, men, boys and girls needs are treated equally. The project will be implemented over a period of 8 months and will at least reach 80,000 beneficiaries through its different services however, it is planned for 12 months to ensure having sufficient time to get project agreement signed with the concerned authorities and have enough time for completion of all project activities and proper project closing. The project team will be present in the targeted areas to closely follow up and monitor project activities</narrative>
