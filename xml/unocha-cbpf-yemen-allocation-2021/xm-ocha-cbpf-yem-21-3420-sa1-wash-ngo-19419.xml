   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Emergency WASH Response to reduce acute needs and provide sustainable access to water in Zinjibar District, Abyan Governorate.(Priority 4)</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">AYF aims to respond to the basic WASH needs of the most vulnerable crisis-affected population so that men, women, boys, and girls have access to safe and clean drinking water that will reduce excess morbidity and mortality related to water-borne diseases. The project objective is to restore or maintain sustainable water and sanitation systems to improve public health and resilience of vulnerable community members in Zinjibar district, Abyan governorate. The Action will also look at those vulnerable from famine, cholera, and IDP households. There will also be a great focus on women and girls as they are the most vulnerable in terms of needs, in particular in those regarding WASH. The project will provide a ten-month lifesaving intervention in the sector of WASH targeting
12742 individuals ( 6910 host communities &#x2013; 1203 men, 1407 women, 2000 boys, 2300 girls )(5832 IDPs &#x2013; 900 men, 1300 women, 1750 boys, 1882 girls) this number includes the total of persons with disabilities which is 93 beneficiaries ( 20 men, 10 women, 30 boys, 33 girls ) in Zinjibar districts, Abyan governorate. AYF has chosen to focus on the districts of Zinjibar, which is classified as famine/cholera and a district with extremely high needs for men, women, boys, and girls. Women and children are disproportionately affected by a lack of access to water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH), and have the largest burden in water collection. AYF aims to address the WASH needs of the most vulnerable with a special focus on women and children which will provide direct and indirect benefits to the entire community, including health, education, and economic productivity. 

The project will aim to achieve the following
1- Three-month&#x2019;s water trucking for 500 HH in the camps for the in Hosen Shaddad, Aryaf Bajadar and AL-Tamisi areas, where most of the surveyed 500 HH from this village reported that they are travelling more than 30 minutes to bring water.
2- Repair , rehabilitation augment water supply system in Huson Shadad area.
3- Supply and transportation 140 of PPc tank 500 litres.
4- Water quality surveillance. 
5- Training of 20 CHVs (50% female) on hygiene messages, community engagement, household water treatment and safe storage, and RCCE for COVID-19
6- Hygiene promotion and community engagement in targeting areas.
7- Assist the targeted host communities and IDPs in conducting monthly cleaning campaigns.
8 - Provision of 2,500 in-kind basic hygiene kits for most vulnerable households (for one time).
9 - Provision of 2,500 in-kind consumable hygiene kits for most vulnerable households (during 3 months).
10 - Rehabilitate/ upgrade of 80  family latrines and septic tank for the most vulnerable IDPs and SAM cases in targeted areas.
11- Build 50 family Latrines for the most vulnerable IDPs and SAM cases in targeted areas (during 3 months).
12- Provision in-kind water treatment chemicals for 2500HHs affected households&#x2019; in targeted areas.
13- Ensure desludging regularly overflowing septic tanks within the targeted IDPs sites and host communities in Zinjibar district.
*The cost is the standard price in the region for the collection of sewage

To ensure the accountability to the affected population and active participation of WASH Cluster at the sub-national level in all project implementation phases as well as to create ownership for the outputs, AYF will work closely with the targeted host communities and active groups. Equally male and female of all ages including those with disabilities will be targeted. However, malnutrition among children and women is widespread in most sites displaced due to the lack of sources of income, adequate food and undrinkable water from unclean pots, all this leads to the spread of persistent diarrhea and malnutrition. Hence, households headed by women, children disabled persons and elderly will be prioritized during identifying the beneficiaries from the proposed activities.</narrative>
