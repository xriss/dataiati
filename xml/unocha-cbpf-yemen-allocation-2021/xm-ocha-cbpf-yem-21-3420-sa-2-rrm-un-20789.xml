   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Yemen&apos;s situation continues to deteriorate. It has been over six years of conflict, economic decline, and institutional collapse that have resulted in significant increases in demand in all areas. Approximately 80 percent of the population needs humanitarian assistance. The ongoing conflict in Yemen has resulted in the displacement of over 4 million people since 2015, with approximately 3.2 million displaced people observed since the beginning of 2021 from highly conflicted areas to safer ones. The ongoing clashes in Ma&#x2019;rib, Al Jawf, Shabwa, and more recently, Al Bayda and other locations have exacerbated the vulnerability of the population and the interruption of basic services.

Many of those who have been displaced lack access to basic services and are vulnerable to a variety of protection issues. The RRM reached over 50,028 households between January and November 2021. (350,196 Individuals). Given the ongoing fighting in Ma&#x2019;rib, these displacement trends are expected to worsen. According to the OCHA contingency plan&apos;s worst-case scenario, an escalation in Ma&apos;rib could result in the displacement of 455,400 people mainly towards southern governorates of Yemen.

The trend has seen a change among those newly displaced in 2021, of which there are stranded populations in Ma&#x2019;rib, Al Jawf Al Bayda, Shabwa. During the recent ongoing escalation, where more than 455,000 people will be displaced, local authorities estimate that 80 percent of them will live in collective sites before being relocated to newly established camps/settlements in Ma&#x2019;rib and surrounding governorates.

In Ma&#x2019;rib, Shabwah, Al Jawf, and Al Bayda, the affected populations are more vulnerable as a result of sudden displacement. This is especially true in Yemen, where the people are already in a precarious situation as a result of the protracted conflict. Women and children are particularly vulnerable. As families are uprooted suddenly from their homes with no time to pick anything, the most critical immediate needs of the displaced persons are usually food and basic personal items needed for their hygiene and dignity. As fully-fledged emergency response actions through the clusters are being organized, there is an obvious need to provide an immediate life-saving response to newly displaced families based on lessons learned from the ongoing response. During this time, preliminary information on the affected populations and baseline conditions are gathered and clarified. To meet this need, the Rapid Response Mechanism (RRM) was activated as a first responder (line of response) until other clusters&apos; humanitarian response could take effect.

The project will support the replenishment of stocks of RRM&#x2019;s food component. This will be accomplished through pre-positioning, timely delivery of kits, and assistance to distribution partners across Yemen. Within 72 hours of receiving the notice of displacement, this will ensure an immediate and effective response to those who have recently been displaced.

The project will strive to support newly displaced people enrolled in Ma&#x2019;rib,

This project will most likely target 15,000 displaced HHs families, totaling 105,000 people. This will be accomplished over a four-month period. These people are Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) fleeing the front lines. Distributions are implemented by UNFPA-contracted partners as part of the integrated multi-sectoral rapid response mechanism.</narrative>
