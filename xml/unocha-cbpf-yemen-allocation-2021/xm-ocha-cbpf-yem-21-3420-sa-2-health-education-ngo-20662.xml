   <narrative xml:lang="EN">An uptick in infighting has led to massive civilian displacement as internally displaced persons (IDPs) seek refuge deeper in the Marib&#x2019;s interior. The rapidly increasing number of IDPs has exhausted the resources and expanded the gaps. So this project was designed to provide health and education services and assistance to vulnerable conflict-affected households in Marib district of Marib governorate which were chosen in coordination with the health and education clusters. This project is aligned with the overall objective of the 2nd Standard Allocation 2021 and is under both priority 1 of this allocation strategy. The needs were determined according to the health and education needs assessments that were conducted in Nov 2021 by YDN in coordination with the health and education clusters, the executive unit, GHO, and the other authorities in Marib governorate. The health intervention will be supported to provide the health minimum services package including the provision of medical consultations. In addition, the capacities of the health workers will be enhanced through different refresher training courses. The support includes the provision of operational costs, health hazard allowances, medications, equipment, supplies, medical and office furniture, for nutrition services, they are covered by the GHO/DHO in the targeted HFs with support from UNICEF and this will be coordinated with them during implementation. The education intervention will be supported to provide non-formal productive education services to school-aged children in IDPs sites, provision of furniture for the classrooms, provision of school kits for targeted students, provision of school kits for targeted students and with teaching materials for teachers, and providing incentives to teachers according to education cluster standards. 

YDN coordinated with the relevant clusters, local authorities and other partners in the targeted areas to ensure complementarity in the targeted areas, YDN coordinated with NFDHR who will cover education services in the same targeted areas with other services to avoid duplication and ensure complementarity in addition, YDN coordinated with other partners including PAH who will cover health CCCM, WASH and Shelter services and, and OXFAM will cover WASH and FSAC and Protection services in the same district to integrate the intervention, and UNICEF will support the DHO to cover the nutrition services in the targeted HFs. YDN with VHI have implemented a need assessment for all sectors in the targeted sites to provide a comprehensive package of minimum services in prioritized IDP camps to improve dignified living conditions.

The project will target a total of (6,362) host communities, (8,238) IDPs by health intervention, and target a total of 400 children and 40 teachers in three sites by education intervention. The differentiated needs of women and girls, men and boys of different ages, and disparities are addressed by providing reproductive health services for PLW, providing basic health services for all age and gender groups, providing child health care for U5 Children in the targeted HFs, and improving access to temporary safe, healthy, protective education spaces for school-age children.
