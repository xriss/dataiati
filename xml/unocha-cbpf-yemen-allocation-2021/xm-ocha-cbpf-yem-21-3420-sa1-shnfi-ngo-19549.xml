   <narrative xml:lang="EN">YARD is one of the most remarkable humanitarian actors in Al-Jawf. Since 2017, YARD was implementing activities related to assist, protect, support and save the dignity of the IDPs and the affected community in Al-Jawf gov. YARD has been a UNHCR, OCHA, UNFBA and UNICEF partner for the past few years, covering all the districts of Al-Jawf ,and providing WASH, Shelter/NFIs, Protection and CCCM services, as well as the continual RRM interventions. Meanwhile, YARD is currently covering 40 IDP Sites in Al-Jawf and fully aware of the context and situation of the IDPs. It&#x2019;s worth mentioning that YARD has a strong communication and coordination line with local authorities and local community in Al-Jawf, which supports the access capability and intervention facilitation. Additionally, YARD has field team from the local community and based in different districts in Al-Jawf, which facilitate the coordination and the implementation process remotely. 
YARD designed this project to address the humanitarian crisis by ensuring adequate access to Shelter/NFIs to IDPs and most vulnerable community groups, targeting 2 districts in Al-Jawf governorate. The overall goal of this project is to mitigate protection, safety and dignity risks through provision of Shelter/NFIs and winterization access to IDPs and vulnerable host communities. The governorate and the districts are selected based on the YHF SA1 Strategy of 2021. 
In coordination with the relevant Shelter Cluster of Sa&#x2019;ada HUB, it was decided to select Khab Wa Sha&#x2019;af and Rajuzah districts of Al-Jawf, as they are of high priority in need for Shelter/NFIs, and with less humanitarian implementing counterparts. Likewise, YARD has already coordinated this project with Al-Jawf local authorities and SCMCHA, at governorate and district levels, providing very clear and transparent explanation on the nature and the geographic targeted areas of the project.
YARD anticipates that the project will target a total of 950 HHs = 6650 individuals, avoiding double count as much as possible. The activities will be implemented through provision of Shelter/NFIs and Winterization support as detailed below: 
	Al-Hazm District: Under Priority (1)
 Provision of Bedding/ NFIs Kits to (450 HHs of IDPs)
Al-Hazm district is located right besides Ma&apos;reb governorate border. The conflict is getting escalated in Ma&apos;reb that makes the residents move from the conflict frontline all the way to the nearest safe place. Obviously, Al-Hazm district of Al-Jawf governorate is the considered as the one of the nearest safe places, so it is witnessing a huge displacement movement. Therefore, YARD selected Al-Hazm district for this intervention.
YARD will consider the Market Assessment outcomes and go for the In-Kind Modality of implementation for the 450 the bedding and NFIs distribution as best practice in the target district.
	Rajuzah District: Under Priority (3)
 Provision of Winterization to (500 HHs of IDPs, HCs, CAHC)
As Rajuzah district of Al-Jawf governorate is bordering Khab wa Asha&apos;f district, it witnesses IDPs movement waves form Al-Salbah sub-district (conflict zone) &#x2013; Khab wa Asha&apos;f district. On the other hand, as per mentioning in the Shelter Cluster Winterization recommendation, Wadi Bani Nawf, Dahyah and Rajuzah sub-districts of Rajuzah district are known with it harsh and cold weather, and that&#x2019;s the main reason of targeting it for the winterization intervention. 
YARD will undergo the distribution of Winterization support activity through Cash Modality
These activities will ensure addressing the needs of different groups, women, men, girls and boys alike, while placing the needs of special groups and those most vulnerable into consideration. As well, selection criteria will take into account access issues for all generations, including those with special needs, as to identify safe, secure and easy to access locations and times for distributions.</narrative>
