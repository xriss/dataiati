   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Yemeni conflict is entering its seventh year. The humanitarian situation is only worsening, and the conflict becoming more complex. During the course of 2020, the number of active frontlines increased from 32 to 48 (UN sources), while the COVID-19 pandemic further loaded an already collapsed health system, and had other impacts on the Yemenis. Recent trend analyses of gender-based violence indicate increased numbers of women and girls (widows, orphans) engaging in negative coping mechanisms (especially child marriage) and an increase in reported cases of sexual violence, physical and psychological assault. GBV partners have seen an increased demand for GBV services by 37% (GBV sub-cluster). Furthermore, the Rapid Response Mechanism estimates that 23% of newly displaced households are headed by females

The conflict in Ma&#x2019;rib extended to the outskirts of Shabwah has continued to be a major driver of displacement in Yemen and the humanitarian situation remains of serious concern. Since the first major offensive in January 2020, the conflict has forced more mass displacements out of their homes or displacement sites to add on the already estimated 1 million IDPs residing in Marib - scattered over 125 IDPs Camps/settlements. With frontlines remaining active, local populations and IDPs have continued to bear the brunt of hostilities, seeing their homes destroyed, fleeing their communities and displacement sites, and facing uncertainties over their safety, especially women and girls. Almost all new IDPs are being displaced for the second or third time. Camps&apos; population has nearly doubled three times the size they used to host. The influx has strained the existing resources, with many of the current population finding it difficult to share their few resources with new arrivals, many arrived with little to nothing and are sharing shelters and resources with other IDPs. 

Shabwah on the other hand is triggered by tribal and local conflicts, especially in areas bordering Marib, displacement from Marib to Shabwah is an additional burden to the limited resources of the governorate, where women and girls needs are among the highest, source GBV Dashboard trend analysis 2021.

Equally the situation in AdDali remains fluid where tribal conflicts erupting periodically causing more vulnerability among women and children. The current situation in the three governorates continues to lead to an increase in the negative coping mechanisms within families, including child marriage and child labor. These factors are also associated with higher risks of domestic violence, neglect, and physical or sexual abuse of children and women. The most vulnerable IDPs are obliged to opt for collective shelter arrangements, subjecting women, girls, and children in particular to an increased risk of GBV.

The project will address GBV needs in the below-mentioned districts as per the priority map highlighted by the GBV SC, through running &quot;existing&quot; 7 Women Girls Safe Spaces and Safe Shelter: 
- 1 WGSS in Marib Gov. - Marib city District (Human Access) AlMugama Square. (7,461 beneficiaries)
- 1 WGSS in Marib Gov. - Marib AlWadi AlRawdah sub District (Human Access) (6,356 beneficiaries)
- 1 WGSS in Marib Gov. - Hareeb District (Human Access) (4,808 beneficiaries)
- 1 WGSS in Marib Gov. - Marib AlJoobah District (Human Access) (5,020 beneficiaries)
- 1 WGSS in AdDali Gov. - AlHussain District (CARE International) (5,511 beneficiaries)
- 1 WG Safe Shelter House in Marib Gov. Rahabah (Human Access through a subcontract with Enough Org) (5,365 beneficiaries)
- 1 WGSS in Shabwah Gov. - Attak District (Human Access) (5,479 beneficiaries)
The above districts fall among the priority needs for GBV interventions as per the &#x201C;GBV cluster service mapping&quot;. The project will prioritize its services to the most needed vulnerable women and girls among the communities in the selected sites.</narrative>
