   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In line with the HRP 2021, DRC aims to contribute to the delivery of a holistic multi-sectoral area-based interventions. The interventions are designed to address comprehensive needs of both IDP and host communities in terms of providing safe, dignified and meaningful access to life-saving and quality humanitarian services ensuring prioritization of the most underserved and vulnerable groups focusing on needs, age, gender and diversity. Interventions proposed under this action, are designed to strengthen access to services while maintaining strong accountability elements. In line with the HRP strategy, DRC&apos;s area based approach equally emphasizes on holistic identification and addressing of needs, leveraging multi-sectoral interventions under the proposed and complementary actions. This project in particular, proposes a multi-sectoral intervention under CCCM Shelter/NFIs and integrated WASH as a last resort while creating linkages and synergies with complementary progammes delivered by DRC and other actors in the area of intervention such as protection and economic recovery. Locations targeted under this project are proposed in line with the cluster highest priority areas based on severity needs. DRC will build on its presence as an Area Based Coordinator, as well as its presence in these locations expanding into hard-to-reach areas. Within the integrated CCCM, WASH and Shelter/NFIs components of the proposed project, DRC will use its presence and extensive community networks to establish and/or strengthen site management and coordination (SMC) mechanisms, representative community committees, improve shelter conditions in high priority IDP hosting sites, as well as improve provision and access to basic services through area based coordination approaches. Through the procurement and warehousing of Emergency Enhanced Shelter Kits (EESK) and Non-Food Item (NFI) kits, DRC will increase the scope and speed of the provision of critical emergency items in response to new displacement, natural disasters, and other emerging needs. The overall Shelter objective of the proposed project is Improving living conditions for displaced persons and other conflict affected population through integrated site and area coordination, shelter maintenance and upgrades, construction of transitional shelters,the distribution of Non-food Items (NFIs) and Enhanced Emergency Shelter Kits (EESK). Deterioration of shelters directly affect IDPs sense of safety, protection, hygiene, and health conditions. The response is centered around three cluster objectives: 1) strengthening safe access to services at the site level through improved site supervision and coordination, 2) strengthening community self-organization and community cohesion, and 3) establishing access to information for displaced populations. WASH will be delivered as a last resort to address critical gaps of water and sanitation systems based on critical gaps and needs in areas of interventions targeting Host and Displaced communities equally when possible and relevant. Key beneficiaries will include internally displaced persons as well as associated host communities. Particular emphasis will be placed on vulnerable and people with special needs including women, girls, boys, and people with disabilities. DRC will support in maintenance and enhancement of national and local coordination structures and ensure the prioritized IDP hosting sites meet acceptable standards. The proposed locations/sectors for this intervention are as follows: Al-Hudaydah (Hays) - CCCM, Shelter, CCCM integrated with WASH. Al-Hudaydah (Al-Khawkhah) - CCCM, Shelter/NFIs and WASH. Al-Hudaydah (Tuhayta) - CCCM, Shelter /NFIsand WASH. Lahj (Tuban) &#x2013; CCCM, Shelter and WASH. Hajjah (Abs) &#x2013; CCCM, Shelter and CCCM integrated with WASH. These sectors and locations were identified as high priority areas by the cluster. DRC will use alternative funding sources to address WASH and Shelter gaps not included under this action.</narrative>
