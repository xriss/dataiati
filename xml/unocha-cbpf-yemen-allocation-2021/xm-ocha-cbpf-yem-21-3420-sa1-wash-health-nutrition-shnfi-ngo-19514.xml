   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project will provide integrated HampN, WASH, and Shelter life-saving assistance, and ensure accessibility of the most vulnerable communities in As Sawadiya, Al Bayda and Kushar, in Hajja. 
As Sawadiya was selected based on inter-cluster severity 5, IPC phase 4, presence of people in acute need of intervention under Priority 2, including SAM HHs and cholera prevalence, need of healthcare support, proximity to frontlines, and being underserved in addition to mixed community of IDPs and Muhamasheen (Marginalized) present in 2 major camps and at district outskirts. Also, Kushar was selected based on inter-cluster severity under priority 3. Moreover, the districts suffering aggravated with spread of COVID-19. 
HampN:
NFDHR has active presence in Al Bayda since 2016. We have implemented several projects and targeted 57 HFs in all districts including As Sawadiya. We have strong relations with authorities, and experienced team in implementing various projects and working in the target area.
H amp N alleviation will be in all targeted HFs, and will be visible with rehabilitating 6 HFs namely Al Wahbia Hospital, Al Khanaq HC, As Sawadiya HC, Al- Zahraa HU, Al Qa&apos;qaa HU, and Al Abs HU to provide MSP package to the whole community especially the most vulnerable and prone to diseases. The intervention also includes providing equipment and medicine, besides the hazard allowance for HWs, who will also conduct the outreach activity weekly to provide HampN services in the level 2 and 3 to enhance the accessibility of vulnerable people, and HWs will be covered with transportation cost. HFs were selected after close coordination with the clusters, consulting MoPHP/GHOs, SCAMCHA, and local authorities and based on the RNA finings conducted by NFDHR in June 2021. NFDHR filed staff will be present in HFs (2visits a week for each HFs) to ensure smooth implementation. This will reflect a high-quality performance of the provided health services.
WASH:
The project will contribute to enhancing the quality of WASH services to 9,200 individual of underserved people in 3 mapped sub-districts   with highest SAM (Al Saddah, Al Hasan, and Al Taheryia of As Sawadiya), besides to scaling up conducting water sources mapping, rehabilitating 3 water schemes   within targeted sites, and providing water filters to SAM HHs. The project will support providing healthy environment for vulnerable communities by constructing and rehabilitating latrines, conducting cleaning campaigns along with providing HKs, and hygiene promotion sessions including COVID-19 messages, with possibly installing solar pumping systems for water schemes.
Shelter:
Under priority 2amp3, this project will reduce pressures faced by the Marginalized, HCs, and IDPs by providing emergency, life-saving assistance and protection. With the presence of mixed groups of IDPs and Marginalized in 2 main camps (Al Jamea Al Kabeer and Al Ghathmah) in AS Sawadiya and at the district outskirts, NFDHR will distribute basic NFIs (455 HHs) and bedding kits  (546 HHs).
NFDHR will also deliver life-saving aid to populations affected by conflict and natural hazards and will provide mid-and long-term shelter solutions to people in need. Shelter support will provide 575 basic NFIs and 690 bedding kits, and 50 HHs Tehamah emergency shelter  in Kushar.
Based on our experience, the project may face some risks, including delay in signing sub-agreement with authorities, IDPs moving from targeted sites, security complications, etc. Aware of the risks, NFDHR plans mitigations such as regular security assessment, regular communications and coordination, updated team about situation, etc.</narrative>
