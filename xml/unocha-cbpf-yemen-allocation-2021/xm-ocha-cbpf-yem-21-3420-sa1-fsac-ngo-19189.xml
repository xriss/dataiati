  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Nahda Makers Organization (NMO) is proposing a 12-month food emergency response via cash to enable (1029) HHs of the most vulnerable IDPs and food insecure people in Qa&#x2019;atabah district at Ad Dali&#x2019; governorate.
The main activities of this project will include:
- Coordination with stakeholders.
- Market assessment (through which the modality will be decided).
- Community formation and training.
- Beneficiary selection via community committees and NMO field team.
-Set-up of gender-sensitive, independent, transparent, inclusive and community-based complaints and feedback mechanisms.
- Monthly distribution of Cash for food for 6 consecutive rounds.
- PDMs.
The intervention addresses the priority criteria as defined by the allocation strategy amp FSAC in terms of highest priority geographical location (Ad Dali&#x2019; governorate). The First Standard Allocation &#x2013; Strategy June 2021 gave priority to distribution of food, cash on a monthly basis for 6 consecutive months to the recent IDPs.  Qa&#x2019;atabah district is one of the districts classified as IPC 4+ where the IDPs and hosting community&apos;s population experience catastrophic conditions. This intervention is to alleviate the situation of the IDPs as a live-saving measure. The project intends to contribute to the reduction of severe hunger among highly vulnerable families by distributing unconditional cash for food to 1029 HHs from IDPs classified as IPC 4+ and who face extreme hunger in Qa&#x2019;atabah district.

To respond to those acute needs, an assessment was done by NMO. The assessment discusses the risks and interests related to GENDER and VULUNERABLITIES in terms of protection, responsibilities, participation and access to sources where it was found that women and other at-risk groups do not participate in any community-based activities related to agriculture or taking leadership positions.
Including food shares (quality/ quantity), the families were found to follow a moderate pattern in which they have enough food, yet they get to share it sometimes. This, however, affects women accessing food in terms of the price inflation especially in areas that are not accessible to get food where food sources are quite distant.
Not only does this affect women, but it also contributes to a major damage to kids&apos; inclusion in fetching food especially when they have to skip schools rating between 30%-50% during the day spending 6- 12 hours daily which exacerbates the risk to a max level.
In case of food distribution, specified and appropriate timing is ensured to guarantee safety, however they claim the lack of food distribution points which, to some extent, does not harm the mean of transporting food as they go walking or using bikes. When transporting food by trucks, they report a convenient yet not safe. No sufficient facilities to guarantee the needs of the affected population. No sexual incidents were ever reported, though.</narrative>
