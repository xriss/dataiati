The pandemic has disrupted education in Yemen and the world at large, impeding millions of children&apos;s access to learning. Therefore, this proposal aims to facilitate access to educational services for 11773 children (45 percent of female) and schoolteachers, in 9 schools, 4 in Salah district (30th November, 22 May, Osouran, and Al&apos;amal aljadid-marginalizes schools), and 5 in Al-Tazyiah district(Al Noor-Al Hashma, AL-Imam Malik, Abdullah bin Omar, Al-Saeed and disabilities development Schools), under Priority 1and 3, which will contribute to preventing the outbreak of infectious diseases, reducing starvation in schools, and providing protection for school-aged children, In line with the objectives (1and3) of Education Cluster SA1 2021, the YHF SA1 2021, and the YHRP 2021.

Also, will receive Support with school transportation. Also, 161 (88 boys and 73 girls) marginalized students will receive school bags and recreational kits.

As defined in the Education Cluster framework, a minimum package of interventions will address emerging needs, as well as address the ongoing, critical, and burden-specific needs of the target cases.
The targeted districts are among the priority sites for education Cluster (the degree of severity of need is more than 3), Salah and Al-Ta&#x2019;aziyah districts have a first priority (critical) of sites in Yemen (according to the classification of education cluster, YHF SA1and IPC), to alongside other high-priority sites, which makes the intervention through this project so important to save lives and reduce human suffering for the people in acute need.
The service provision targeting children with disabilities, Muhamasheen, and other minority groups have not been given enough attention. As educational services are seldom close to households this poses a key barrier for persons with disabilities, and female children and teachers and families cannot afford costs of transportation or learning materials. Through this project, MDF will strengthen educational services aiming at increasing inclusive education for targeted vulnerable groups in partnership with schools that are now providing services with limited capacity.</narrative>
