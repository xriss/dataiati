   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Integrated response to improve dignified living conditions through specialized protection services needs for vulnerable persons, including persons with disabilities and/or injuries, affected by the conflict in IDP camps and host communities in Al Hodeidah and Ta&#x2019;iz governorates, Yemen (priority 1)</narrative>

  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed project contributes to improving the dignified living conditions of vulnerable persons affected by the Yemen conflict in IDP sites and surrounding host community areas of the Ta&#x2019;iz and Al Hodeidah governorates (Al Makha, Al Khukhah amp Az Zuhrah districts) by providing an integrated and comprehensive response to specialized protection and inclusive services. Among the vulnerable IDP camp population, specific needs of persons with disabilities and/or injuries will be prioritized with the aim to ultimately enhance their dignified living conditions.

Providing specific support with an integrated approach to vulnerable conflict-affected population in Yemen, the proposed project will be implemented in IDP camps and host community areas in Al Makha, Al Khukhah amp Az Zuhrah districts with 3 expected outcomes:
1. Increased knowledge and capacity of the community and humanitarian actors on inclusion practices and protection of persons with disabilities/injuries. 
2. Improving access to comprehensive rehabilitation in immediate need of rehabilitation by promoting continuity of care.
3. High-quality assistance provided in full adherence to the principles of AAP and PSEA.

A comprehensive response will be delivered to the identified needs of persons with disabilities and injuries in the hard-to-reach IDP camps and host areas, based on two complementary pillars: inclusion mainstreaming and tailored services for all age groups with disabilities and injuries. Corresponding and integrated coordination with Clusters, CCCM and other actors of the targeted areas will be maintained to successfully implement the project.

The first pillar aims at promoting inclusion of persons with disabilities in the Yemen humanitarian response and improving accessibility of services. Awareness trainings, assessments, recommendations and capacity development will be conducted to selected humanitarian actors to improve accessibility of their services in the targeted IDP camps. 

Through the second pillar (as a complementary component of the first), HI will provide protection specialized services to adults and children with disabilities and injuries. Direct and comprehensive rehabilitation services will be delivered to all age groups with disabilities and specific needs. These services also include necessary psychological support required for persons with injuries and disabilities to improve their psychosocial wellbeing, provisions of assistive devices, and Prosthesis and Orthoses. 

Although HI remains in charge of the direct implementation of activities, increasing the capacity of humanitarian actors, service providers and community will be focused to ensure a complementary approach and sustainable impact of the proposed intervention. 

To ensure an integrated approach, HI will continuously coordinate and follow-up with relevant humanitarian actors, CCCM and Cluster level including OCHA throughout the project. This will be maintained and achieved through internal and external referral mechanisms, responsive and effective communication, active participation in working groups, task forces, and CCCM, Health, WASH, amp Protection Cluster meetings. HI will also partner with MOPIC, GHO and DHO of Ta&#x2019;iz, and GHO and DHO of Al Hodeida governorates, and will focus on partnerships with health facilities of the targeted districts. To maximize the impact, HI&#x2019;s proposed activities will complement with already existing primary healthcare and services of humanitarian actors in the targeted district locations. 

Ensuring sex, age and disability disaggregated data (SADDD) collection and analysis, the project targets 4,800 crisis-affected persons (estimated 1,440 IDP and 3360 host community members 2160 men, 1200 women, 720 boys and 720 girls), including 120 staff of different humanitarian actors, and 2,400 adults and children with specific needs and their caregivers from Al Makha, Al Khukhah amp Az Zuhrah districts in Ta&#x2019;iz and Al Hodeidah governorates.</narrative>
