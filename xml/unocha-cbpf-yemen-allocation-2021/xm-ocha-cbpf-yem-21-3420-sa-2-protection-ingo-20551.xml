Improving conflict and displacement affected communities&#x2019; (host and displaced) movements and access to services through mine action interventions on the West Coast (Taiz (Mawsa, Mocha, Dhubab) and Al-Hudaydah (Al Khokha, Al Omaisy, Al Dawbalah, Hays and Tuhaita)).</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In line with the Priority 3 of this allocation strategy and with the third strategic objective of the Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP) 2021 for Yemen, which seeks to protect and assist civilians, DRC&#x2019;s Humanitarian Disarmament and Peacebuilding (HDP) sector will seek to improve movement and access to basic services for conflict and displacement affected communities by reducing the risk of death and injury caused by Explosive Ordnances (EO) and facilitate early recovery, by setting up multi-task clearance teams to respond to EO disposal needs in communities where surveys have been conducted, with a complementary EORE capacity to offer continuous information to men, women, boys and girls living in the proximity of EO. To this end, DRC propose to train and deploy one EO clearance and EO risk education team covering Taiz and Al-Hudaydah governorates. The operational implementation will fall under the land release process as a cost-efficient methodology to conduct mine action activities. To support the humanitarian response and with the aim to contribute to the development of a strong and effective mine action capacity in Yemen, DRC is requesting the amount of USD 718,476.28 for 12 months. The funds requested will be used in complementarity with existing YHF support for Non-Technical Survey (NTS) and clearance in the targeted governorates.

DRC-HDP seeks to reduce the risk of injuries, disability and loss of life from explosive ordnance through the removal of EO from productive land, and by raising awareness of women, girls, boys, and men, with the expected outcome to improve access to basic services and infrastructure through the release of land contaminated by EO and Risk Education on safe areas and behaviours. The proposed project will address immediate, emergency clearance needs (Output 1.1) with a trained mobile EOD team, and reduce the risk of accidents caused by EO through the provision of tailored, gender and age sensitive EORE to vulnerable people living in and/or transiting through EO contaminated areas (Output 1.2). 

Cross cutting themes in this year&#x2019;s standard allocation outline the vital need for gender considerations as well as inclusion and consideration for the most marginalized groups. DRC Yemen will combine its localized expertise in protection mainstreaming as well as age, gender and diversity mainstreaming (AGDM) with DRC&#x2019;s global expertise, to further strengthen efforts in the area of inclusion and diversity representation across all DRC sectors.

DRC-HDP expects this project to directly benefit 3,940 people, while an estimated 18,300 people will benefit indirectly from EORE sessions and EOD spot tasks, attending the communities&#x2019; need to avoid accidents from EO. Specific target groups include host and displaced communities living and transiting through contaminated areas, with a particular emphasis on people engaged in activities with a high level of risk, such as farming, travelling (trade) and construction/rehabilitation work. Children, in particular boys and young males, will also be specifically targeted as they make up a high proportion of recorded victims. Particular attention will be paid to include People with Disabilities (PwD) and older people by ensuring EORE sessions are made accessible physically and in format to them, and to ensure they are consulted when planning and conducting clearance activities.</narrative>
