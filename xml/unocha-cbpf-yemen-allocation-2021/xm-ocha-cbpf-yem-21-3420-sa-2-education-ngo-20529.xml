In this project, a two-pronged approach will be adopted in delivering the essential services 1. Supporting operation and services within the selected schools 2. Supporting community mobilization. Five schools were nominated as targeted locations for the proposed interventions after close coordination with local authorities and relevant national and sub-national clusters (Edu. Annex 2.1). 
The targeted schools: As-Salam School (102 Students), An-Noor School (978), Salah Ad-Deen School (735), At-Tasheeh School (1419), Al-Wahdah School (2124).

Project interventions were developed based on a Rapid Multi-sectoral Need Assessment (RMNA) conducted in Nov. 2021 at IDPs households amp leaders&#x2019; level. Results revealed that most IDP households are unable to meet their basic needs in most sectors and/or are relying on negative, unsustainable coping mechanisms to meet these needs. The most common gaps were in health, nutrition, education, Food insecurity amp livelihood and WASH, for more information please refer to the Need assessment section below or Annex 4 the RMNA final report. In parallel with RMNA, TYF has conducted a rapid assessment of the schools that are situated near these new IDP sites. 

Education: The project will support the construction/rehabilitation interventions in 5 schools, The targeted schools&apos; rehabilitation works for classes and WASH facilities. rehabilitation of 25 latrines in 4 out of 5 targeted schools.( 3 in As-Salam, 6 in Al-Noor school, 8 in Al-Tasehih School, 8 in Al-Wahdah School) and construction of 4 latrines ( 2 latrines for females and 2 latrines for males) in Salah Ad-Deen school.  incentivizing 36 school volunteer teachers, training 18 teachers on active learning, and training 18 teachers on EiE. The project aims to reach 5,358 students (1064 IDPs, 4294HC). Additionally, Referral pathways between sectors and other humanitarian actors in the same area will be prepared at the beginning of the project. 
TYF conducted a site integration coordination exercise to prevent any duplication with any other partners, where we surveyed the IDPs sites located within the targeted schools and determined the partners supporting them (Annex1). Results show that all the targeted schools have no support currently. However, FSL, Shelter, and CCCM services will be covered by NRC and TYF , INTERSOS  will cover protection, NMO will cover WASH services, and health and nutrition services will be covered by QRC.</narrative>
