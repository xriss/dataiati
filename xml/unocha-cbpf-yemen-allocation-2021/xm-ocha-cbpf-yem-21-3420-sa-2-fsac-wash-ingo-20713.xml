   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Supporting conflict-affected and vulnerable people for their sustainable local reintegration through integrated and durable solutions in Amran (Al asha district) and Hodeidah (Al Zuhra district) Governorates in Yemen (Under Priority 2)</narrative>

  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Consistent with the specific objectives of Priority 2, as well as the strategic objectives of 2021 HRP, this 12-month proposed project&#x2019;s theory of change posits that the well-being of approximately 39,500 vulnerable and conflict-affected people (10,920 women, 11,700 men, 8,580 boys and 7,800 girls) in Al Asha district in Amran and Al Zuhrah district in Hodeidah will be improved, their suffering alleviated and they can be sustainably reintegrated in communities by enhanced capacity of highly vulnerable households to meet their basic needs (Sector 1: FSL), and increased and more equitable access to safe water supply and sanitation facilities, and improved hygiene practices of vulnerable women, men, girls and boys (Sector 2: WASH). The needs and gaps are identified through a combination of CARE&#x2019;s MSNAs in targeted locations, rapid gender analysis, consultations with local authorities, clusters and community members, as well as secondary data from a range of humanitarian actors.
 
CARE will mainstream protection-related concerns across these two sectors by training staff and volunteers on risk reduction approaches and safe programming (e.g. safe referrals), conducting regular risk analysis, defining cross-impairment indicators for monitoring and ensuring that support is given to people with different impairments, and working in close coordination with existing protection coordination mechanisms (detailed protection mainstreaming activities are discussed in the succeeding sections). CARE will also work and coordinate closely with Health amp Nutrition (ACF and Islamic Relief in Hodeidah and UNICEF in Amran), Shelter (DRC in Hodeidah and Amran), Education (NRC in Amran) and Protection (NRC and JAAHD in Hodeidah and Yemen Red Crescent in Amran) actors on the ground to ensure complementarity and integration of services, and to maximize the impact of these services to the population.
 
Enhanced capacity of 1,400 highly vulnerable households to meet their basic needs through the provision of gender-sensitive cash for work (CFW) in Al Asha district in Amran and Al Zuhrah district in Hodeidah. CFW creates temporary employment and income, which supports households to meet their basic needs and also restores   assets in the community which can contribute to more sustainable income-generating activities. CARE will link the CFW beneficiaries to livelihood partners operating in the targeted districts so that they will be able to have more sustainable and longer-term sources of income when the project ends. 
 
Increased and more equitable access to safe water supply and sanitation facilities, and improved gender sensitive hygiene practices will be realized through the rehabilitation of 4 strategic water points, by establishing and training water management committees (WMCs), conducting regular water quality tests, construction/rehabilitation of 100 family latrines, carrying out hygiene promotion and providing hygiene kits through UNICEF in Al Asha district in Amran. The project will also support access to safe sanitation by assisting communities in the rehabilitation of WASH structures in public institutions, such as in schools and hospitals in Al Asha district.</narrative>
