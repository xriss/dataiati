   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed project aims to improve food security through provision of immediate integrated life-saving emergency food assistance cash/value voucher assistance to the most vulnerable and at highest risk groups and underserved populations residing, facing conflict and having the highest response gaps to meet their critical basic food needs focusing on the displaced families and most vulnerable host communities in As Sawadiya district of Al Bayda governorate.

In complementarity with current interventions implemented by RDP&#x2019;s Emergency General Food Assistance (GFA) project in partnership that is implemented in partnership with WFP providing in-kind food assistance to 2,332 households in As Sawadiya districts of Al Bayda governorate. In addition, the project will be in integration with the interventions that will be implemented by NFDHR in As Sawadiya district in WASH, Health, Nutrition, and NFIs. As Sawadiya district is one of the districts that have multi-vulnerabilities identified by the four clusters (FSAC, Health, WASH and Nutrition clusters) as priority two that need urgent integrated interventions 

The proposed project interventions fall under Yemen Humanitarian Response Plan (YHRP 2021) objectives SO2: Preventing famine, malnutrition and restoring livelihoods to pursue specific objective 2.1 to improve the food consumption status of vulnerable populations and decrease the proportion of populations facing IPC Phase 3 and above conditions. Moreover, the proposed project will adhere to FSAC objective 1 to increase availability and access to food for highly vulnerable households across the country. 
As well as contributing to FSAC and YHF Strategy on priority 2 by targeting the most food insecure and vulnerable groups facing IPC Phase 3 and above conditions through the provision of immediate integrated life-saving emergency food assistance to the most vulnerable food insecure households allowing them to meet their basic food needs.

The proposed project will be implemented in 12 months period including the following main activities: 

-Conduct comprehensive market and contextual assessment
-Conduct baseline survey to assess the primary level of food security among the targeted beneficiaries
-Conduct introductory and sensitization sessions for the community and stakeholders in the targeted district about the project&#x2019;s objectives, outcomes, and activities
-Establish Food Assistance Committees (FACs) of 10 people (5 Men and 5 Women) with 50% representation of women and ensure women in leadership positions and train them on their potential roles and responsibilities. 
-Provision of unconditional cash/value vouchers assistance to 450 HHs (3,150 individuals including 617 Men, 643 Women, 926 Boys and 964 Girls) of the most vulnerable host community and IDPs households for six consecutive months/rounds adhering to FSAC guidance and standards.
-Conduct six Post Distribution Monitoring (PDMs) survey
-Conduct end-line survey to assess the level of food security that will be achieved by the unconditional cash/value vouchers assistance activities.

RDP will implement the project in total commitment to DO NO Harm Principle through targeting the most vulnerable population based on FSAC selection criteria with no discrimination based on age, gender, religion, ethnicity, or disability. Additionally, Protection will be mainstreamed in all of the project&#x2019;s activities and will be in line with SPHERE standards.</narrative>
