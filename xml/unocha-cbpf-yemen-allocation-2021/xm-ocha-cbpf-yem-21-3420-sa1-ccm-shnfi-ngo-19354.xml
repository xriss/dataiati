   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This 12-month Shelter/NFIs and CCCM project aims - through a set of activities planned and would be implemented in line with the objectives of the two clusters and their strategy for the SA1 of YHF 2021, giving priority to the most vulnerable and affected HHs in the light of the cluster&apos;s vulnerability criteria - at improving the living conditions and safe access to services and assistance with dignity of vulnerable HHs of IDPs in ten hosting sites in Salh district through strengthening site management and coordination. This will be achieved through carrying out SMC package intervention under CCCM cluster in the 10 sites: Al-Mansoori Hotel, Health Institute, Upper Jahmalia, Lower Jahmalia, Middle Jahmalia, Tha&apos;abat, Upper Alharaziya, Lower Alharaziya, AlHarithi, and AlAskari. The total number of the HHs in the ten sites is 1,598 HHs (10,976 individuals: 2871 boys, 3522 men, 2917 girls, and 3312 women).The activities of this package include establishing IDPs self-governing structures, conducting functional mobile/static site monitoring teams, distributing IEC materials, establishing functional CRM, conducting mass information campaigns, training volunteers on monitoring population movements and mass information campaigns, conducting sites mapping and multi-cluster needs assessment survey, and registering new arrivals and updating site populations, training and meetings with CCs, organizing monthly coordination meetings with CCs in sites and partners, fixing fire extinguishers at hosting sites, providing cash assistance for basic maintenance to (200) HHs of IDPs in sites, conducting end line assessment for IDPs sites, which can enhance self-management of the targeted hosting sites and responding to their needs.
The project also targets (2100) vulnerable HHs (500 in Al-Yaman (Algabgab and Altwaer) of Maqbanah district and 1600 HHs in Al-Gahmaleah, Al-harazeah, Alharethey, and Al-Mahwa (Muhamasheen area) of Salh district with shelter/NFIs assistance with a view to providing emergency and life-saving assistance to (500) HHs of the most acutely vulnerable and new IDPs and host communities affected by displacements and conflict in Maqbanah (200HHs with cash voucher for bedding kits, 200 HHs with cash voucher for NFI basic kits, and 100 HHs with cash for rent) and improving the living conditions and access to assistance for (1600) vulnerable HHs (PWD, minority groups, persons with specific needs) in Salh (800 HHs with cash for bedding kits 800 HHs with cash for NFI basic kits). According to activities, the project targets 1000 vulnerable HHs with NFI bedding kits (800 in Salh through cash modality amp 200 in Maqbanah through cash voucher modality) 1000 vulnerable HHs with NFI basic kits (800 in Salh through cash modality amp 200 in Maqbanah through cash voucher) and 100 vulnerable HHs with cash for rent in Maqbanah.
Responding to the recommendation of SA1 - 2021 and the nature of the targeted areas, cash-based modality will be adopted where the results of the market assessment indicated there are enough NFIs stores as well as cash transfer agencies to be requested to provide cash transfer service for the targeted BNFs in Salh district. In line with this, the results of previous PDMs and interviews of projects implemented by BCFHD in the same district revealed that BNFs prefer getting NFIs assistance through cash based modality rather than in-kind modality as that gives the affected people the choice to buy the NFIs they need, which will contribute to supporting more sustainable solutions.
Based on the project&apos;s context and BCFHD&apos;s experience, some risks have been expected and procedures to mitigate determined as indicated in the Assumptions and Risks tab.
Being an area-coordinator of the CCCM cluster and an active partner of Shelter/NFIs and other clusters, carrying out several projects in the targeted districts in various sectors, and having experienced staff BCFHD can implement the project activities successfully.</narrative>
