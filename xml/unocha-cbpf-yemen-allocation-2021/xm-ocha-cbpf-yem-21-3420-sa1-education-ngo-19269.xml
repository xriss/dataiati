   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Emergency Education Intervention for vulnerable Communities Including IDPs  marginalized persons in Al Ma&apos;afer District in Taizz Governorate Under YHF 3rd Priority</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This is an Emergency Education Project targeting highly vulnerable communities of Al-Ma&apos;afer district in Taizz Gov. The proposal is planned based on beneficiaries needs as well as communication with the Education Cluster and the relevant authorities at different levels. 10 schools were studied for their urgent needs in a Sector Specific In-Depth Assessment in coordination with West Cost Sub-Cluster amp Education Offices. 6 schools were prioritized to be targeted in this intervention for their urgent needs. 

6 school-aged children primary amp secondary schools will be provided by Lifesaving services. 7,159 children (2,820 girls amp 4,339 boys) as well as 500 males amp 500 females ( i.e. parents/caregivers, teachers amp education staff) will benefit from the project. Equipped by YHF assistance amp support, SOUL will be able to reach out to give a hand to the neediest including IDPs, marginalized amp with disabilities. Through this project, SOUL will be able to contribute to the Education cluster efforts to remain the schools operational and functional and children at school age to have improved access to education services. This will be accomplished through providing support to ensure schools remain open and operational, restore damaged and destroyed schools, and ensure that targeted beneficiaries acquire knowledge about better life quality. What&#x2019;s more is that with YHF support amp as a SAG member of the Global amp National Education Clusters, SOUL will join EC efforts for localization.

The planned Education project is to cover gaps under priority 3 in the following schools:
1. AlShaheed Abdo Qasim School.
2. Alfaqeed Ali bin Ali Qasim School.
3. 26 September Belkiami School.
4. Alfajer Aljadeed Shigaz School.
5. Alwehdah Bani Surur School.
6. Altashih kla&apos;ebah School.

The proposed activities include the following:
1.	Establishing, expanding new Temporary Classrooms TLCs.
2.	Supporting volunteer teachers by providing incentives.
3.	Provision of new and repaired school desks.
4.	Provision of essential school furniture for TLCs (markers amp erasers).
5.	Provision of white/black boards.
6.	Provision of Teachers kits.
7.	Provision of Recreational Kits.
8.	Provision of basic learning materials (School Bags) to vulnerable amp needy students.
9.	Building the capacities of school management, Education staff at district level amp representatives of Mothers&#x2019; amp Fathers&#x2019; Councils on 11. Education in Emergency.
10.	Building the capacities of schoolteachers on the basics of active learning as well as student center classes.
11.	Building the capacities of schoolteachers on Early Learning Approach.
12.	Establishing amp supporting of Parents Teachers Association (PTA) amp enhancing women efficient participation.
13.	Supporting children with disabilities to be able to get their education through case management.
14.	Delivering awareness raising messages on: good hygiene practices, good nutrition practices amp COVID-19 prevention amp control.


As of 2011, SOUL maintains its presence in Taizz mainly through Nutrition, Health, WASH, FSAC amp Education interventions in around 15 districts Thus, this project will utilize SOUL&#x2019;s multi sectorial experience, amp its very good connections.
Accessibility risks are inevitable. However, since the projects&#x2019; staff will be recruited from the targeted areas amp SOUL maintains its intense pre-coordination, the project will certainly avoid grave risks.</narrative>
