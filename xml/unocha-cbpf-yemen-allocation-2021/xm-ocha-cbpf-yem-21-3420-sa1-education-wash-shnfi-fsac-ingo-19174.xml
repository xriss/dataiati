  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed integrated FSAC, WASH, Education, Shelter, and HLP intervention is under the YHF first standard allocation for 2021 and in line with priorities 2,3, and 4. The food security and WASH action is in line with priority 3 Provision of Emergency, life-saving assistance, and protection to the most acutely vulnerable IDPs, refugees, migrants and host communities most at risk due to recent displacements and conflict. The shelter and HLP are in line with priority 4 aims at improving the protection safety and dignity of vulnerable conflict-affected men, women, boys, and girls.  And the Education sector is in line with priority 2 aims to provide affected and most vulnerable girls and boys with equitable access to safe, protective child-friendly learning environments. NRC will provide life-saving emergency food assistance and protection to 1397 acutely vulnerable IDP households (9779 people) living in collective centers and in host communities in Washha district. NRC will provide cash (or value vouchers), depending on market functionality for 6 rounds to the targeted households. 

The WASH activities aim to address the needs of conflict-affected people in the ongoing emergency response under priority 3 covering the IDP response in the two governorates. The intervention will improve access to adequate and safe water, sanitation facilities and improve hygiene awareness and thus hygiene behaviors. The WASH activities have been designed to respond to the critical WASH needs through, rehabilitating and upgrading of existing WSS to solar system, construction of temporary latrines, cleaning campaigns, and training of CHVs on hygiene messages in Azuhura and Abs districts. The WASH intervention will thus reach 46883 people, of which 10783 men, 11252  women, 12190 boys and 12658 girls

The proposed shelter interventions aims at improving protection, safety and dignity of vulnerable conflict affected men, women, boys and girls, in Hajjah governorate in Abs and Washhah districts. The target population includes IDPs and host communities that have been affected by displacements. The protection, safety and dignity of the target beneficiaries will be promoted through improved access to appropriate shelter solutions including the construction of transitional shelters and essential household items (bedding kits and core NFIs kits). NRC plans to bring a complimentary housing, land and property component that aims to improve security of tenure of shelter infrastructures, while at the same time strengthening community-based dispute resolution structures to tackle HLP issues arising from transitional shelters. The shelter intervention will thus reach 18900 people, of which  4347 men,   4536 women, 4914 boys and  5103 girls.

The proposed education component under this proposal aims to provide immediate access to quality basic education to conflict affected children in Abs district. It aims to provide affected and most vulnerable girls and boys with equitable access to safe, protective child friendly learning environments in two targeted schools. The target district is selected based on the Education Cluster locations&#x2019; prioritized for this allocation under priority 2 based on its inter-cluster severity score, its proximity to frontlines, being under-served areas, hosting IDPs and NRC adequate presence on the ground. This project will support 1,200 school age children ( 600 boys and 600 girls) in Abs, Hajja. The target population will be supported to access education services through providing classrooms TLSs will be constructed and furnished to address the challenge of overcrowding. Teaching and learning materials, recreational and hygiene materials will be provided to students, teachers, and schools. WASH facilities in schools will be constructed and/or rehabilitated, providing gender-segregated latrines. In addition, NRC will keep support the coordination mechanism in Hodeida sub education cluste</narrative>
