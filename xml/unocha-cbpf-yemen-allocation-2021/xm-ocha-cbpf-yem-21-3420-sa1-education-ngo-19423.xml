   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Improving access to safe education in Salh district - Taiz Governorate under priority 3.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This eight&#x2013;month project is aligned with YHF 1st Standard Allocation Strategy 2021 and prioritizes activities of Education Cluster under Priority 3 to provide education in emergency response to conflict-affected school-aged population and displaced children. This intervention comes to support access to safe and inclusive learning environment that promotes well-being and resilience in 13 schools of Salh district operating temporarily in deserted and unfinished buildings as their original buildings are under conflict. This objective will be achieved through implementing a set of activities as follows:
1. Supporting 13 affected schools by the provision of school furniture including 155 white boards with markers and erasers, solar power systems, hygiene kits and cleaning materials which will serve 5294 students disaggregated as 2592 boys and 2702 girls.
2. Providing 200 volunteer teachers (40 men and 160 women) with incentives for 6 months and training on EiE, accelerated learning program, active learning and Hygien-Covide-19 prevention practices and safe school protocols.
This project has been designed to complement another WASH project by BCFHD under the current allocation targeting the same district. The targeted schools receiving hygiene kits and cleaning materials under this proposed education project will be provided with awareness on Covid-19 epidemic and hygiene practices under the WASH intervention. Generally this will ensure the deliverance of an integrated and consolidated response to the affected population and particularly contribute to keep the schools clean ensuring safe and healthy environments for all boys and girls to learn.
The project activities will be implemented in coordination with Education Cluster, Education office in Taiz Governorate and Salh District, School councils and targeted schools managements in order to ensure participatory response and smooth deliverance of the assistance. The implementation of the project activities will be informed by COVID&#x2013;19 preventive measures. BCFHD will put in place a set of procedures to protect the BENFs from the risk of Coronavirus particularly during the inputs distribution process and the training activities. 
This project is designed based on the findings of an initial rapid needs assessment conducted in 19 schools in Salh district by BCFHD during 20 -25 May to reflect  the need of all age and gender groups including  young students (boys and girls), volunteer teachers (men and women)  and other adults from the targeted community represented by SC members (men and women).
To implement this project, BCFHD has the technical expertise as well as the geographical and the operational presence in the targeted district. From the expertise perspective, BCFHD has implemented several YHF-funded projects in different sectors including two in education in Taiz Governorate during 2019 and 2020 which were evaluated by the third Party Monitoring (TPM) as &quot;good performance&quot;. Besides, BCFHD is currently the focal point of the education cluster for South Taiz and this will help in coordination and collaboration with the cluster partners to ensure smooth implementation of the project. At the geographical and operational level, the headquarters of BCFHD is based in Taiz city where the targeted district is located and this ensures easy access to the targeted areas. Additionally, BCFHD has implemented several interventions in the same district including four YHF-funded projects during 2019/2020 and could establish good relationship with them and gain their trust. This can help BCFHD in getting smooth access to the targeted areas in Salh district, obtaining approvals and permits required for implementing the project activities.</narrative>
