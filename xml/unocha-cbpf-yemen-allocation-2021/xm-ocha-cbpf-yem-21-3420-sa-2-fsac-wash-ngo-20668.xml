   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Provision of Integrated Food  WASH assistance to IDP households living in IDP sites in  Rub Al Sham sub district  of Al Zuhra district, Al Hodeida (Priority 1)</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Project falls under the Priority 1 of the 2021 2nd allocation strategy. It targets Al Zuhra district in Al Hodeida governorate: A frontline district prioritised by this allocation amp within the district: Al Qam, Maqraa, Al Basra, Al Gurab, Deer Al Fenjan amp Habil IDP sites from Rub Al Shaam sub district. All the targeted sites are underserved amp living conditions are below standard. A rapid needs assessment conducted by Life Makers Meeting Place Organisation (LMMPO), showed that there are many HHs who do not have access to food, safe drinking water amp safe sanitation. HHs do not have sufficient food in their houses amp are resorting to skipping meals to cope up with the situation, which is affecting the health of women amp children amp increasing their risk of malnutrition amp diseases Women amp children fetch water from about 1 kilometer, from unprotected farm wells And there is  open defecation. Also, personal amp environmental hygiene is poor attributed to low hygiene awareness, high prices of hygiene materials amp absence of good waste disposal practices, which is increasing the risk of outbreak of diseases amp morbidity.
The Overall Objective of the project is to ensure that people living in the target IDP sites witness an improvement in their living conditions. The project achieves this objective through a holistic amp integrated response to needs of IDPs living in the target areas with Food amp WASH as the main components complemented by coordinated referral to other humanitarian actors working in the district to cover gaps. Total 384 underserved HHs (2304 individuals: 530 men, 576 women, 553 boys and 645 girls, including 92 elderly persons) will benefit from the project amp have improved living conditions as a result of the project interventions as follows:
(i) Food Component: 384 acutely food insecure amp underserved HHs from the target sites will have improved food security because of Food assistance (unconditional cash transfers) provided by the project, monthly, for 6 months. 
(ii) WASH Component: 381 HHs (2286 individuals: 526 men, 571 women, 549 boys, 640 girls including 91 elderly persons) will benefit from rehabilitation of 2 wells amp extension of pipelines to 4 water points within the target IDP sites 90 HHs (488 individuals above 5 years of age: 103 men, 112 women, 108 boys, 125 girls including 21 elderly) will benefit from construction of 30 latrines 10 community volunteers will benefit from training on hygiene promotion amp community participation 381 HHs will benefit from hygiene promotion
(iii) Coordination amp Complementarities: The project will complement the food amp WASH interventions with referrals to humanitarian partners such as WFP, WHO, ACF, NRC and UNICEF  who are working in the targeted sites amp in Al Zuhra district to ensure an integrated response to the needs of the beneficiaries. The approach will include: Establishing a referral mechanism Collecting data on gaps amp needs in multiple sectors during the baseline amp referring highly vulnerable HHs to partners for support Monitoring the HHs referred for outcome of the referral during the PDMs Promoting nutrition, health, protection amp education messages during hygiene awareness raising, distribution amp monitoring activities.
The project looks at the needs of the target HHs holistically. WASH interventions will ensure increased amp sustainable access to Safe Drinking Water amp Safe Sanitation amp improved hygiene for the target HHs. The 2020 IPC has classified Al Zuhra district in Phase 3 (crisis) with an estimated 60% population having Phase 3 amp higher needs. Food interventions will provide selected HHs with improved access to food, consequently improving their health amp reducing their risk of malnutrition. Poor nutrition and living conditions, lack of access to health care amp protection services is increasing the vulnerabilities of the target HHs.  Complementary referral for multisector support, will ensure an integrated response to their needs amp improve their condition.</narrative>
