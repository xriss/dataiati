   <narrative xml:lang="EN">PAH will implement this 12-months emergency response in 4 sectors: CCCM, Health, WASH and Shelter/NFI to serve 16,369 IDPs directly and provide support to 15,981 people from the host community living in the catchment areas of the supported two health facilities. PAH provide CCCM support to the 4 sites, overseeing the site-level coordination of basic services delivery, referral system, site infrastructure development and maintenance, population monitoring, data collection and reporting, and, in particular, implementing a site-specific strategy for Communication with Communities / Accountability to Affected Population (CwC / AAP) plan, to ensure inclusion of the voices of all girls, women, boys and men, including those coming from marginalised groups or with special needs. The site-specific CwC / AAP plans will be established based on the identification, consultations and involvement of the most excluded members of the IDP community. They will be represented in the Community Committees and have a say in selection of community-led initiatives, as well as in two-way communication about services provision across all sectors. An integrated Complaint and Response mechanism and PSEA / AAP awareness raising campaign will be applied throughout the sites, including schools and health facilities.

Second component of this response is life saving health support to IDPs and people living in the areas affected by the influx where health facilities are not functional and they do not have access to already stretched services. Since health facilities and their coverage areas do not follow the boundaries of the IDP sites, PAH will support two health facilities in neighboring sites, Al Phida health centre and Al Khasha&#x2019;a health unit, providing health and nutrition services in the two sties directly but in 16 sites serving 16,369 people as overall catchment population together with 15,981 people as host communities. Health facilities will benefit from capacity-building and payment of hazard allowances to health workers and support staff, Community Health Volunteers (CHVs), provision of essential medicines, medical consumables and WASH supplies. Infrastructure of Khasha&#x2019;a Health Unit and its WASH facilities will be expanded and rehabilitated and provided with solar equipment.

As part of the response, also Shelter needs of the populations will be targeted with this response and 248 families will be supported by provision of household kits and emergency shelter kits. Additionally, 155 families will be supported by maintenance and upgrade support for their shelters. 

The project will be implemented in partnership with National Foundation for Democracy and Humanitarian Response (NFDHR) as implementing partner for WASH component in one of the 4 targeted sites (Al Arsh). The WASH assistance in three other targeted sites will be implemented by Oxfam, within a separately submitted proposal. The two proposals apply a complementary approach PAH, NFDHR and Oxfam will closely coordinate their activities to ensure synergy of programs, also coordination mechanism will be established to ensure proper cooperation on the ground.</narrative>
