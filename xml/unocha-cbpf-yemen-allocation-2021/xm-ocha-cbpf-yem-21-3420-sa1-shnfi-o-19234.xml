   <narrative xml:lang="EN">QRCS has a presence, easy access, remarkable reputation, and a good relationship with the local authority, IDPs with the host community in the targeted governorates. For various reasons the offices that QRCS has in the targeted governorates, the qualified team who has a great network on the ground, moreover, the success and the high-quality shelter projects that were implemented in the past years in different targeted governorates (projects funded by YHF amp Qatar)
Under the YHF allocation priority 3, this proposed project will address the provision of emergency, life-saving assistance, and protection to the most acutely vulnerable IDPs, amp host communities who are at risk due to recent displacements and conflict, by focusing on 2 main activities: (I) Providing bidding and essential NFIs kits (in-kind) for (3180) HHs. (ii)Providing rental subsidies for (700) HHs. The sub-details are as follow:
700 HHs (NFI Bedding and essential Kits in-kind) Taiz, AlMa&#x2019;afer
1400 HHs (NFI Bedding and essential Kits in-kind) Taiz, Jabal Habashi
580 HHs (NFI Bedding and essential Kits in-kind) AlDhale&apos;e, Qatabah
500 HHs (NFI Bedding and essential Kits in-kind) Marib Jubah
500 HHs (Cash for Rental Subsidies) Taiz, AlMa&#x2019;afer
200 HHs (Cash for Rental Subsidies) AlDhale&apos;e, Qatabah
Entirely during the project, QRCS will prioritize groups with special needs such as women, children, pregnant and lactating women, the elderly, people with disabilities, and under the component Shelter/NFIs, the projects activities will reach the following beneficiaries 26810 people of which 7238 men,6971 women, 6166 boys amp 6435 girls. QRCS too will address the needs of households living in IDP hosting sites and the vulnerable host community in target Gov. To ensure high quality of implementation, QRCS will recruit the registration and verification teams, where males and females will be involved in the process. The team will be chosen from the targeted governorates to ensure easy access and mobilization, good background of the local context, effective targeting of people in need
To ensure that the project is going well in all phases, Monitoring visits, PDMs, information sharing, complaints, and feedback mechanisms will be adhered to and applied, in accordance to the commonly known QRCs system, supported by previous projects practice lessons learned
Moreover, QRC will undertake DDMs for gathering information on the efficiency of the assistance provided of which it will reinforce accountability, confirming if assistance has reached the proposed beneficiaries.
Finally, risks that could pose within the implementation are as follow:
Risk1: price fluctuating and increase against Dollar. The NFI&apos;s final cost will be higher than the cluster estimated cost. Mitigation: QRC will ensure to coordinate early with the cluster about the specifications of the NFI materials and a fair advertised tender will be published in order to have as many suppliers as we can. Assumptions: all the processes will be implemented smoothly for the NFI materials and for the tender
Risk2: Increased displacement due to the ongoing conflict in target Gov. Mitigation: QRCs will coordinate with community committees on the field, besides that our team will sensitize them about the selection criteria that will help in increasing the awareness of IDPs, HHs and community committee about the selection criteria to avoid any trouble within the activity&#x2019;s implementation. Assumptions: People will understand the selection criteria which will enable the most vulnerable to get assistance
Risk3: Currency and price fluctuating in South during the cash transfer for rental. Mitigation: Preserving dignity is the slogan of QRC. Dealing and contracting with any service providers in dollars not in YR is the strategy that QRCs adopt, to ensure the impartiality and the dignity of all the beneficiaries. Assumptions: Any transfer cash provider will adhere to the contract between us and him/her, otherwise the contract will</narrative>
