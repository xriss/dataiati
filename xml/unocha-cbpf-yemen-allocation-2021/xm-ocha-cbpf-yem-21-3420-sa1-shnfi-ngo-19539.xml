The targeted district is located within Marib Hub where YFCA has its main sub-office, well trained team on shelter amp protection who strictly adhere to all necessary shelter amp protection requirements of the beneficiaries to carry out the main implementation task with backstopping support from the main office in Sana&#x2019;a. good relation with the Executive Unit of Marib amp coordination with Shelter, Protection amp WASH clusters, RRM and IOM has already been done to support and facilitate the planned interventions and to avoid any duplication with other partners.

YFCA will closely coordinate with IRG central authorities as well as with the  Executive Unit and corresponding local authorities at Marib Gov. to sign the agreement and to obtain the permission within the first month of the project. 
Specific and precise MampE plan was set to monitor the project activities using concentrated modalities and tools at the central, hub, gov., and field level to ensure the maximum level of implementation quality and thus achieve the planned goals.</narrative>
