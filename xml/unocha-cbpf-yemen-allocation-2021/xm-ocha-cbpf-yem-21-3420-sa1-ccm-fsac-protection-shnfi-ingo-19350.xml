   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Proposal 1: Integrated Response (Shelter,Protection, LFS, CCCM) for the conflict affected population- Taiz, Hodidah, Hajja and Abyan/ Priority1, Priority2,Priority3, and Priority4</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed intervention aims at providing emergency life assistance and improving the living conditions of the conflict affected population and where possible provide sustainable solutions. Through that NRC will be working within the four priorities set for the YHF allocation to support a total of 58,909 individual IDPs, HC and returnees. The proposed response will provide the targeted HHs with a holistic set of services under Shelter, LFS, Protection and CCCM in Taizz, Hodeidah, Hajja and Abyan. 

Under Shelter, the intervention will focus on the provision of essential household items (bedding kits and Core NFI kits), provision of T. shelters, EES kits, provision of flood mitigation solutions and provision of cash grant for rental subsidy in Taizz and Hodeidah to 31,150 individuals across the four priorities. 

As for of the food security intervention in Hodedah, NRC will provide immediate live-saving food assistance to 6,297 individuals who are acutely food insecure and under-served. Based on FSAC guidance, this will be achieved through the provision of 6 rounds of monthly unconditional cash transfers to the targeted households. Hays district has been prioritized for this action based on the severity of needs, as it has populations in IPC Phase 4. 

As part of the protection component, NRC teams will focus on providing protection services to 6,333 IDPs living in and around IDP sites in Khanfar (Abyan) and Beyt Al Faqih and Ad Duraihimi (Hodeidah). The proposed intervention will target women, men, boys and girls from both IDPs and host communities. With consideration to age, gender and diversity, NRC will place special emphasis on assisting female-headed household, people with disabilities (physical and developmental), and elderly persons, with particular attention paid to those individuals who are displaced. The project will further target marginalized minority ethnic groups, such as the Al Muhamasheen, severely affected by the conflict through displacement..

The (MSNA) conducted by NRC in Abyan and Hodeidah during the month of May, has showed that protection needs are massive in the district targeted under this action. Protection data has shown that the most vulnerable individuals and/or groups including female-headed household, elderly, people with disabilities and children lack adequate support mechanisms and often resort to harmful negative coping mechanisms, including engaging in child labor practices, cutting food rations, taking on high level of debts and/or begging. Existing community and kinship-based social protection networks have also broken down. Consequently, the coping capacity of conflict-affected individuals is under severe pressure, particularly for persons with specific needs and vulnerabilities, including female or child headed households, older persons, persons with disabilities or chronic illnesses, and marginalised groups (Muhamasheen).

Lastly, CCCM in Hodeidah and Abyan will targted a total of 8 sites to provide coordination and management service to a total of 15,127  IDPs. NRC CCCM teams will focus on establishing CCCM coordination structures and mechanisms and monitoring of service provision in the sites. This will include attending the area based coordination meeting. Also, generating updated sites profile and capture protection concerns, update service mapping of partners operating in sites and establish help desks for the communities in the IDPs site to help needy people to access assistance. In addition, NRC CCCM activities will focus on capacity building of site committees, support/advocate for the active participation of women in IDP leaderships/site governance. NRC will ensure complementarity and cooperation with others external stakeholders in referring amp responding to sectors&#x2019; gaps within sites.</narrative>
