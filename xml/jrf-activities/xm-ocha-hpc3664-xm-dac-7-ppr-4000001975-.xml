   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project aims to address the interlinked nature of livelihood and protection threats by empowering women economically to become part of the workforce, and by addressing cases of GBV and domestic violence. JRF&#x2019;s innovative approach focuses on achieving a lasting positive trickle-down effect on families and communities at large; by addressing each family as a functional healthy family unit &#x2013; merging both livelihood and family protection tracks. Using JRF&#x2019;s holistic approach, the project aspires to help vulnerable families improve resilience and achieve self-reliance through: &#x2022; Access to livelihoods: Improve access to practical skills and gainful employment; this is managed through JRF&#x2019;s Community Empowerment Program (CEP), offering two tracks: generation/expansion of micro and small enterprises, and job placement in private sector organizations. &#x2022; Child safety and family protection: Identify at-risk children, including those engaged in child labor and victims of sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV), such as early marriage, and increase access to preventative and protective case management interventions. The project also aims to build and reinforce a healthy and functional family unit and home environment to ensure child safety through the provision of effective women empowerment and parenting sessions.
