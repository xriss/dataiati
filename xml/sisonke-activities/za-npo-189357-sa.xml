       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Sisonke has implemented outreach actions to ensure documentation of human rights violations and linking sex workers to health services . Through the outreach with Mobile Clinic from partners working on sex work program, Sisonke has ensured that sex workers access the services provided ART treatment and SRHR. The outreach will contribute to serve as a mechanism to monitor human rights violation cases that are reported, to evaluate referrals, and to relay important information to sex workers about organisations that can assist them.  Its an ongoing activity to make sure that Sisonke reaches sex workers to gain information on what is happening on the ground. This has a big impact on advocating for the decriminalisation of sex work and SRHR.</narrative>

      <narrative xml:lang="EN">There are not initial CSOs strengthened in order to set up a functional baseline. CSOs will be counted according to the capacity strengthening by taking part of the Love Alliance. South Africa has well-developed civil society and community-led organisations, with communities of sex workers and LGBTIQ+ communities displaying world-class organizing and advocacy. The country&#x2019;s LGBTIQ+ movement has an estimated 10-15 organisations. Approximately 10% of the organisations are youth-led and 60% refer to women-led CSOs in the country. Despite a restrictive policy environment, sex workers are also well-organised. The community of people who use drugs, while more recent in their organizing, also serves as a regional leader.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">The &#x201C;Show Me Your Number Community Radio: Sisonke Online Radio Podcast&#x201D;, is a collaboration between Sisonke and Civil Society Forum. This series of podcasts focus on Health and Human Rights issues for sex workers and how to address these through sports, arts and culture. The podcasts will reach a wide range of people, especially those who have never engaged with sex workers before. One change that was apparent through this activity is that sex workers were able to speak out more and share their lived experiences within the sex work industry. Sisonke&#x2019;s role was to work with Show Me Your Number Community Radio to train them in the decriminalisation of sex work and create content for the show (audio content), mobilise sex workers to participate (through interviews) and listen to the shows.</narrative>
