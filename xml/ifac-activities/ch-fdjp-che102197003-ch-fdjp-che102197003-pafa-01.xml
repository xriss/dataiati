   <narrative xml:lang="EN">A project to build the capacity of the regional accountancy organization, the Pan-African Federation of Accountants (PAFA).
IFAC has identified nine elements that, when properly addressed, enable a PAO to successfully deliver on its remit. The elements are inter-connected and context-dependent, but fall into three categories, or &#x201C;pillars&#x201D;:
A)Sustainability: availability of the appropriate legal foundation(s), an effective governance structure, and operational, financial and technical capacity;
B)Standards and enforcement: facilitating the adoption and implementation of standards for accountancy education, ethics, audit, and public sector accounting based on international benchmarks, and monitoring compliance
C)Relevance: connectivity between a PAO and its membership base and broader society to understand, and respond to, the needs of its key stakeholders and constituents across the private and public sectors.
The project to support PAFA focuses on Sustainability-Intellectual and professional capacity. 

Launched under the International Federation of Accountants (IFAC) Professional Accounting Organization (PAO) Capacity Building Program funded by DFID.</narrative>
