   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This award strives to conserve biodiversity and manage natural resources in ways that maintain their long-term viability and preserve their potential to meet the needs of present and future generations. Activities include combating illegal and corrupt exploitation of natural resources and the control of invasive species. This includes This award period of performance will be one year; however the project is expected to extend over a two-year period. Pending receipt of financial and performance reports and availability of funds, the award may be extended for an additional year and the balance of the total request in the amount of $23,230.50 will be obligated at that time. Despite being reviewed and ranked a top tier proposal, due to budget constraints, this project was funded at 60% the requested amount ($45,094.50 rather than $68,325.00) due to the high budget request and the number of excellent proposals that were given high scores. The applicant was asked to spread the work and the budget over two years with the funds obligated over two fiscal years. Had sufficient funds been available, the proposal would have been funded fully in FY15, the award was made with the understanding that pending availability of funds and receipt of financial and performance reports the award would be extended and the balance of funds obligated if they become available. Augmenting this award allows the recipient to complete the full scope of work outlined in the original proposal and on the original timeline..</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">India is the anchor of South Asia, one of the United States&apos; most important bilateral partners, and a rising global power with a multi-billion dollar economy. In the last several years the relationship has risen to a new level of cooperation, where the United States and India are working positively across a multitude of sectors to advance shared national interests. One common area of interest is the pursuit of sustainable development, and the United States and India are now working jointly to achieve their shared development goals for India, the Asia Pacific Region, and global progress. New commitments include initiatives to mitigate the impact of climate change, achieve global health and food security objectives, and ensure continued regional integration and stability. U.S. assistance in India is used to advance this shared agenda by engaging a range of stakeholders to end extreme poverty - which affects 21.3 percent of India&apos;s population, according to the World Bank - and increase citizens&apos; access to quality health care, education, water and sanitation, and energy. Through this assistance, the United States also helps to support and protect vulnerable women, girls, and minority groups. With assistance, the United States is piloting a new model of development, whereby partnerships and platforms created jointly with the Government of India (GOI), private sector stakeholders, and civil society organizations are used to scale proven solutions locally and globally.</narrative>
