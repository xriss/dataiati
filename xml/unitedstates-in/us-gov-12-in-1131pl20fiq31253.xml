    <narrative xml:lang="EN">India is the anchor of South Asia, one of the United States&apos; most important bilateral partners, and a rising global power with a multi-billion dollar economy. In the last several years the relationship has risen to a new level of cooperation, where the United States and India are working positively across a multitude of sectors to advance shared national interests. One common area of interest is the pursuit of sustainable development, and the United States and India are now working jointly to achieve their shared development goals for India, the Asia Pacific Region, and global progress. New commitments include initiatives to mitigate the impact of climate change, achieve global health and food security objectives, and ensure continued regional integration and stability. U.S. assistance in India is used to advance this shared agenda by engaging a range of stakeholders to end extreme poverty - which affects 21.3 percent of India&apos;s population, according to the World Bank - and increase citizens&apos; access to quality health care, education, water and sanitation, and energy. Through this assistance, the United States also helps to support and protect vulnerable women, girls, and minority groups. With assistance, the United States is piloting a new model of development, whereby partnerships and platforms created jointly with the Government of India (GOI), private sector stakeholders, and civil society organizations are used to scale proven solutions locally and globally.</narrative>
