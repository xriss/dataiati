   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This award strives to conserve biodiversity and manage natural resources in ways that maintain their long-term viability and preserve their potential to meet the needs of present and future generations. Activities include combating illegal and corrupt exploitation of natural resources and the control of invasive species. This includes This project will monitor the recovery of the tiger and its prey base in Manas National Park. This would be done by a) estimating tiger population densities in the Park using photographic captures and recaptures, b) estimating the densities of key large mammal herbivores that constitute prey species of the tiger in the Park using line transect sampling, and c) sustaining the monitoring and research program on vegetation dynamics in the Park to inform habitat management. Specifically, the Recipient will: (1) carry out camera trapping in six blocks of the Park over three camera trapping sessions (1.5 to 2.0 months per session) using 30-40 camera trap locations per block; (2) construct capture histories for each adult tiger and analyze these histories using CAPTURE to estimate abundance; (3) carry out line transect sampling to estimate tiger prey densities using 2 km long transects in all three ranges located in areas where camera traps are located; (4) analyze the count and distance data obtained from the transect sampling using the program DISTANCE; (5) install over 120 permanent vegetation quadrats of 30 m X 30 m size each spread across the entire landscape of the park and assess these plots for woody plant species; (6) conduct a one-time soil sampling in each plant quadrat and assess soil physical and chemical parameters; and (7) utilize the vegetation data to (a) develop a supervised land cover classification using high resolution satellite imagery, (b) characterize the distribution of plant species and diversity across the MNP landscape, and (c) develop a spatially explicit model of the environmental determinants of vegetation type and vegetation change in a GIS framework..</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">India is the anchor of South Asia, one of the United States&apos; most important bilateral partners, and a rising global power with a multi-billion dollar economy. In the last several years the relationship has risen to a new level of cooperation, where the United States and India are working positively across a multitude of sectors to advance shared national interests. One common area of interest is the pursuit of sustainable development, and the United States and India are now working jointly to achieve their shared development goals for India, the Asia Pacific Region, and global progress. New commitments include initiatives to mitigate the impact of climate change, achieve global health and food security objectives, and ensure continued regional integration and stability. U.S. assistance in India is used to advance this shared agenda by engaging a range of stakeholders to end extreme poverty - which affects 21.3 percent of India&apos;s population, according to the World Bank - and increase citizens&apos; access to quality health care, education, water and sanitation, and energy. Through this assistance, the United States also helps to support and protect vulnerable women, girls, and minority groups. With assistance, the United States is piloting a new model of development, whereby partnerships and platforms created jointly with the Government of India (GOI), private sector stakeholders, and civil society organizations are used to scale proven solutions locally and globally.</narrative>
