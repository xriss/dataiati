    <narrative xml:lang="EN">Romania remains a steadfast strategic partner in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and international peace and security operations, as demonstrated by its significant contributions of troops, equipment, and other assistance to Afghanistan, Kosovo, and the European Union (EU) Mission to Bosnia and Herzegovina. Romania continues to improve its capabilities to participate in NATO and other multinational operations and has repeatedly demonstrated its willingness to provide forces and assets in support of U.S.~national security interests. The U.S.-Romania agreement authorizing U.S.~access to military facilities in Romania provides a strategic location for combined training and rapid deployment to unstable regions to the east and south. Romania&apos;s efforts to promote greater cooperation among its Black Sea neighbors in the areas of defense, law enforcement, energy, economic development, environment, and democratic values complement the U.S.~goal of enhancing stability in this sensitive and important region. Romania is hosting deployment of the U.S.~ballistic missile defense (BMD) capabilities under the European Phased Adaptive Approach, which is the U.S.~contribution to NATO&apos;s BMD. FY~2017 assistance will help Romania complete its military modernization, improve its interoperability with U.S.~and NATO forces, and increase its expeditionary deployment capabilities in support of NATO&apos;s collective defense and coalition operations. U.S. assistance will advance defense reform, build capacity, and strengthen partnerships in the region to more effectively counter Russian aggression and other emerging threats.</narrative>
