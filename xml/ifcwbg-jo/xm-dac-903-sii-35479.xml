  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Jordan Solar One is a 20 MW solar PV power plant located in Al Mafraq, north of the Jordanian capital, Amman, with an estimated project cost of US$70 million (the Project). All output generated by the Project will be sold to Jordans National Electric Power Company (NEPCO) under a 20-year Power Purchase Agreement (PPA). The Project also comprises the construction of a 13km 33kV transmission line connecting to Al Hassan substation 13km away from the Project site. The Project is part of the GoJs Renewable Energy Program, which aims to increase renewable energy contribution to 10% of the countrys generation mix by 2020.</narrative>

  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Project will: (i) generate over 47 GWh (at P50), meeting the growing demand for electricity in Jordan, serving approximately 9,000 customers annually based on a per capita consumption of 2,289 kWh; (ii) diversify the fuel mix for Jordan and provide for energy security by generating electricity from a domestic resource; (iii) displace thermal power that has a marginal cost of approximately 30% above the tariff helping to alleviate the losses borne by NEPCO; and (iv) avoid greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) of approximately 30,720 tons of CO2 per annum.</narrative>
