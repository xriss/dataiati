   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project consists of the design, construction, ownership and operation of a 485MW combined cycle gas fired power plant located in the Zarqa Industrial Zone, the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan (the Project). The Project will replace the Hussein Thermal Power Station (HTPS), one of the oldest and most inefficient power plants in Jordan (which is currently being decommissioned), with a more efficient power plant.   The Project is being developed by Mahatat Al Zarqa Le Tawleed Al Takah Al Kahrabaieyaha, a special purpose company that was incorporated in the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan.</narrative>
