   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed project consists of a 3-year secured senior loan facility/social bond for up to US$40 million in IDR equivalent; provided for PT Bank Sahabat Sampoerna (BSS, or the Bank)  under the Base of the Pyramid Program (BOP Program), part of Fast Track COVID-19 Facility. The BOP Program is designed to support lending to micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) by financial institutions in emerging markets in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.  The proceeds from the proposed secured senior loan facility/ social bond will be utilized by BSS to support lending to MSMEs, which are underserved and significantly impacted by COVID-19 pandemic.   BSS is a private bank sponsored by the PT Sampoerna Strategic Group (SSG, the Group, or the Sponsor) which is a large conglomerate established by Sampoerna family in Indonesia. The Bank is controlled by SSG through PT Sampoerna Investama, which currently holds 64.24% stake in the Bank.  &#xA0;  The Bank has exhibited a strong and proven track record in the MSMEs segment, which constitutes more than 70% of the Banks loan portfolio through a network of 21 branches. To boost its business, BSS also developed a loan acquisition scheme whereby it partnered with its affiliated cooperative partner, Koperasi Simpan Pinjam Sahabat Mitra Sejati since 2011.</narrative>
