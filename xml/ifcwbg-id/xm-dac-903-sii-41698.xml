   <narrative xml:lang="EN">International Finance Corporation (IFC) is proposing to extend a local currency senior debt facility of US$150million to PT. Bank BTPN Tbk (BTPN or the Bank). The project exhibits strong fit with IFC&apos;s and World Bank Group (WBG) strategic priority in Indonesia to achieve Sustainable and Inclusive Growth. The proceeds will be used by the Bank to expand green financing and to increase lending to Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) with a focus on two areas, addressing MSME financing gaps through Supply Chain Finance (SCF) and promoting lending to women owned MSMEs (Women MSMEs).  The Bank is a valued client of IFC since 2009 and was formerly known as PT Bank Tabungan Pensiunan Nasional Tbk, a mid-size commercial bank in Indonesia with focus on financial inclusion and targets low income pensioners, MSMEs and women entrepreneurs at the base of the pyramid. The Bank was rebranded after it was merged with PT Bank Sumitomo Mitsui Indonesia on February 1st, 2019 and became a universal bank serving full spectrum of Indonesias customer segments from the retail to corporate. Supported by 19,465 employees, BTPN serves close to 12million customers throughout Indonesia as of Sep-19.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The expected development impacts of the Project are as follows: (1) Introduction of new financial products and demonstration effect: The proceeds from the facility will be used by BTPN to grow its SCF and green financing business, two products that are at a very nascent stage in Indonesia despite the growing need and large gap. Based on BTPN&apos;s reputation and track record as a leading innovator in the industry supported by a strong and committed Sponsor (SMBC), the Project is expected to have a demonstration effect and encourage the replication of green financing and SCF products by other banks; (2) Increased access to finance for MSMEs: The Project is expected to address the significant financing gap faced by MSMEs through SCF program, which has been identified to be able to effectively tackle information asymmetry and lack of collateral, which typically hinder FIs from expanding reach to the segment; (3) Improve financial access for women-owned SMEs: A portion of the proceeds will be earmarked  to finance Women-SMEs, which are still largely underserved by the Financial Institutions in Indonesia; (4) Promote sustainable economic growth: IFC anticipates the Project will contribute to the Indonesia&apos;s cumulative GHG reduction targets and towards achieving Indonesia&apos;s target to control environmental degradation.</narrative>
