   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Strengthening the Micro and Small Business Sector:   A large number of motorcycle owners use these as part of their SME/ micro businesses as an efficient mode of transportation to deliver goods and services. The project will facilitate the increase of motorcycle financing available to SME/micro businesses which is necessary to expand their operations.  Deepening NBFI Sector:  Indonesias financial sector is still heavily dominated by banks, which account for 80% of the financial sector assets. Indonesia needs to develop Non-Banking Financial Institutions (NBFI) sector, which can efficiently provide financing to consumers and SMEs by lowering operational costs and serving smaller customers than most banks target. Additionally, NBFIs can provide healthy competition to banks which will eventually further foster the development of the financial sector. The project will provide the company with long-term fixed rate financial resources for its growth. The support IFC provides to SOF will help it develop its own funding sources which can provide it with the ability to compete with the banking system on an ongoing basis and provide efficient, competitive financing to consumers.  Create Significant Job Opportunities:   The vast majority of motorcycles sold in Indonesia have a significant local value added component involving assembly within local factories as well as parts sourced from local suppliers. Not only does the project support job creation within the company, but also as the demand for motorcycles increases due to more availability of financing, the project will also indirectly support job creation along the value chain from local suppliers to distributors.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed project consists of an IFC loan in fixed rate Indonesian Rupiah to PT. Summit Oto Finance (SOF or the company), a motorcycle finance company based in Jakarta, Indonesia, and part of Sumitomo Corporation Group. The proposed investment is consistent with all aspects of IFCs strategy. It would represent a stable source of funding which would help SOF to:  - expand its motorcycle financing activities to low income consumers,  - diversify its funding base, and - reduce interest rate risks and better match its assets and liabilities.</narrative>
