   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project will support the sponsors ongoing efforts to expand internationally and enter the increasingly competitive two-wheeler industry in Indonesia.  The sponsor will invest significantly in personnel development and training, and the project is expected to create an estimated 500 new jobs at the end of third year of its operations. In addition, the project is expected to result in significant knowledge sharing and transfer of know-how to the Indonesian subsidiary, not just in terms of manufacturing and quality processes, but also the establishment and management of a sales and service network, dealer channel etc., knowledge which has been built up over the years in the highly competitive Indian market. Furthermore, given the sponsors focus on product innovation and its ability to meet stringent quality standards, the project is expected to lead to technology transfer not only at the project company but also at the supplier level as well. Some of the sponsors key suppliers in India are exploring the possibility of establishing Indonesian operations in future to support the company.  Non-quantifiable development impacts will include benefits to the consumers through improvement in the quality of products and increased competition in Indonesia, the creation of 500 new, trained employment, benefits to the local economy as a result of localization of production and development of the local supply chain, and attraction of foreign direct investment.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed project consists of establishment and start-up of operations of a green-field, two-wheeler manufacturing plant in Karawang, about 55 km east of Jakarta, Indonesia, by PT TVS Motor Company Indonesia (PT TVS, or the company).  The plant will have an initial manufacturing capacity of 300,000 vehicles per annum. 

The project will cater mainly to the Indonesian market, which is the worlds third largest after China and India with a demand of 4.5 million units in 2006. Although the current two-wheeler market in Indonesia is highly competitive, low per capita ownership in the country (of only 80 motorcycles per 1000 people, in 2005) compared to its neighbors (of 545 in Taiwan, 286 in Thailand, 258 in Malaysia, and 125 in Vietnam) reinforces a strong market growth potential for the future. In addition to its large domestic market, Indonesia is also a strategic exports base given low labor cost, and availability of competitive sourcing of components.</narrative>
