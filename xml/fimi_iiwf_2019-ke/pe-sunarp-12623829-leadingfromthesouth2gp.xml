       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Since the data was calculated based on the participation of Indigenous Women Organizations in the 2WCIW, actual values will be updated once processing mid-term and final partner&#x2019;s reports. Disaggregation will be updated accordingly.During the Second World Conference of Indigenous Women, 9 AYNI&#xB4;s partners including 5 regional/large level namely Continental Network of Indigenous Women of the Americas (ECMIA), Alianza de Mujeres Ind&#xED;genas de Centro Am&#xE9;rica y M&#xE9;xico (AMICAM),  Network of Indigenous Women in Asia (NIWA), Asia Indigenous Women Network  (AIWN) and African Indigenous Women&#x2019;s Organization(AIWO) and 4 national/medium level namely National Indigenous Women&#x2019;s Federation(NIWF), South Vihar Welfare Society for Tribal (ASHRAY), National Indigenous Disabled Women Association Nepal (NIDWAN) and BIWN (Bangladesh Indigenous Women Network) received grants as part of their institutional strengthening process. In this process, they were able to identify their own creative initiatives based on their needs prior to and during the conference. AYNI Partners organized the parallel sessions covering the issues of Land, territories and Resources, Climate Change, IW Resilience Power for Violence free life, Migration and COVID-19, Economic empowerment and so on  in 2WCIW which was first from them over their lifetimes. Also, 13 IW representing 10 Asian AYNI Partners were panelists in 2WCIW&#x2019;s different sessions. More than 100 (12%)  IW from tentatively 30 AYNI Partners participated in 2WCIW conference as a whole and/or in different parallel sessions. IWO&#xB4;s participation in the 2WCIW allowed them to strengthen internally, acquired greater project management and administration capacities and increased their leadership and participation in decision-making spaces to the enforcement of women&apos;s rights and gender equality. In this process, regional networks of Indigenous Women have come together to bring a &#x201C;Global Political Declaration of Indigenous Women- that presents their priorities and recommendations as well as add the Indigenous woman&#x2019;s voice on to the global statement. The collective document was presented to different organizations and stakeholders at national, regional and global level.  Through capacity building and indigenous women&#x2019;s meaningful participation, their participation elevated indigenous women&#x2019;s self confidence and capacity in critical areas, improving their participation in decision-making processes and promoting self-confidence of their cultural and gender identities.
