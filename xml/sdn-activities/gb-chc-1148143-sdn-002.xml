   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Civil society monitoring of the Ogoniland clean-up by SDN</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project will strengthen the ability of civil society to hold the Federal Government of Nigeria to account for a major clean-up of oil spills in the Niger Delta, focusing on the Ogoniland clean-up resulting from more than fifty years of oil spills in the region. It will do this by running an independent monitoring initiative to scrutinise the progress of the clean-up and make this information more accessible to the public.The track record of oil spill clean-ups in Nigeria in general is poor, and so ensuring the Ogoniland clean-up proceeds according to agreed standards &#x2013; and documenting this if it does not take place &#x2013; is vital to ensure the remediation of decades of damage to human and environmental health. Doing so will also help rebuild trust in government to protect Nigerians from the negative impact of the oil industry. This is a major obstacle to long to peace and social development in the Niger Delta, which has seen decades of conflict and instability.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">&quot;Key target groups include: &#x25CF;       Local communities, civil society organisations and their staff working on pollution-related issues in Ogoniland. In particular, this will include around 21 community members and at least 10 staff who will be trained as environmental monitors to take part in the project. They will have improved knowledge and capacity to implement technical environmental assessments, as well as increased links and trust with HYPREP officials and local impacted communities. This will lay the groundwork for further support to the long-term restoration of Ogoniland. &#x25CF;       6 NOSDRA staff who will benefit from the same environmental monitoring training as civil society organisations. The project will also therefore build the capacity of relevant Nigerian regulators to carry out their mandate. &#x25CF;       Approximately 6 HYPREP staff, who will have improved understanding of the effectiveness of their work, and the opportunity to discuss the challenges with the clean-up in a constructive forum with civil society. This is significant, given the lack of confidence among all parties in Ogoniland, and may help &#x2018;reset&#x2019; relations in a way that would support long term stability and development in the region. Beneficiaries will include: &#x25CF; Approximately 850,000 people across Ogoniland, who will be able to have confidence that work to clean up their communities is being properly monitored. This in turn should lead to proper restoration of their land and water sources.</narrative>
