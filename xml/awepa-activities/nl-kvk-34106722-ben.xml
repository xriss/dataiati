   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Strategic Partnership between NIMD, AWEPA and the Netherlands Ministry of Foreign Affairs aims to contribute to a conducive environment in which political and civic actors can effectively lobby and influence political and policy processes to advocate for inclusive and equitable social change. The partners concentrate on a selected number of countries in Africa: Benin, Ethiopia, Kenya, Mali, Mozambique, Uganda and Zimbabwe. In Benin, the partners jointly contribute to three specific goals: i. To improve the enabling environment for effective policy influencing, by creating a level playing field for all political actors and civic actors wanting to influence politics. ii. To strengthen the policy influencing capacities and responsiveness of political parties, parliaments, MPs and civil society actors. iii. Increasing general interest in consulting and collaborating among and between political and civic actors. iv. Strengthening the voice and position of women and youth in the consultation processes. The departing point for the Strategic Partnership in Benin is a joint NIMD-AWEPA Theory of Change and Baseline. The country programme is embedded in strong local political networks, underpinned by a deep rooted knowledge of the local political economy and a solid institutional infrastructure for programme implementation. To acknowledge the importance of cross-border themes and regional interdependencies that increasingly shape national policy agendas and to stimulate peer learning and exchange, dedicated strategies and instruments for peer learning, knowledge and innovation and PME have been developed as part of the strategic partnership. Furthermore, to maximize opportunities for regional and international lobby and advocacy on issues that emanate from national policy agendas, the programme foresees in the development of dedicated strategies for potential upstream policy influencing at regional and global fora and bodies.</narrative>

   </title>
   <description>
    <narrative xml:lang="EN">Benin&apos;s Seventh Parliament opened on 16 May 2015 against a background where political parties and civil society actors did not have any real ability to influence public policy; in short the playing field was not level and even if they wanted to do so they could not influence public policy. Political parties do not enter into structured working relationships with their MPs and help them develop a policy position when voting for laws. With respect to civil society organisations, their general distrust of and removal from the political scene and its actors considerably limits their ability to influence public policy. The political actors within the National Assembly (who have been elected by virtually all of the political alliances) vote on draft laws, which places them in a different league - that is to say a much more privileged position - when it comes to influencing public policy in comparison to members of civil society and the political parties. Currently the way the National Assembly is set up means there is no way to tell who is with the opposition and who is in the majority. In this case it is too early to say whether the parliamentary opposition and majority have equal footing in terms of influencing Beninese public policy.</narrative>

      <narrative xml:lang="EN">Following the opening of the Seventh Parliament neither political actors nor members of civil society have yet to undertake an inclusive think tank-style initiative on how to draft public policy. Currently informal exchanges on the conclusions reached in the recent report published by the Reform Committee are proving a motivational force for each of the rather isolated actors within their own environments. The official delivery of this report on reform to the Head of State constitutes a solid opportunity to stimulate inclusive dialogue (involving political actors and members of civil society) on political reform in the country.</narrative>

     <comment>
      <narrative xml:lang="EN">No structural changes which would stimulate engagement between political and civic actor have been noted since the start of the Seventh Parliament. According to the MPs interviewed the dialogue practices during parliament (which occurred during the Sixth Parliament) did not lead to any innovations. New measures to help stimulate dialogue between the various sensibilities, including revising the rules of procedure for the National Assembly, have yet to be taken. There are two major recent political events which have shaken up the current political environment in Benin, leaving it somewhat in flux: - The legislative elections held in 2015 weakened the FCBE and propelled the opposition to the fore of national politics. The FCBE alliance, which was the clear majority for the Sixth Parliament, was reduced to some twenty MPs. The opposition, in addition to seeing the number of seats held greatly increase, were able to capture the presidency and vice presidency of the National Assembly. - The 2016 election saw a candidate which did not belong to a political party run for head of State, who at the same time was supported by political parties, the opposition and the former majority, which has shaken up the landscape of the Beninese National Assembly. The political actors have taken a &quot;wait and see&quot; approach in terms of how they should position themselves within this new context, which may explain the hesitancy in producing mechanisms which would stimulate multi-actor engagement in terms of influencing public policy. The idea of a platform for dialogue which would stimulate momentum amongst the various actors to generate a vast overhaul of the system has been in the works since 2014, although the actual implementation thereof has been disrupted by preparation for the 2015 and 2016 general elections.</narrative>

None of the questioning government members were subject to over their first year in power led to debates during sessions, with the government successfully postponing the consideration of matters. The ministers in question always tend to say they have only just taken up the position and ask the MPs for the time needed to obtain documents and look over them. Upon presentation of the first report (covering October 2015 - March 2016) by the president of the National Assembly, the MPs themselves complained about their inability to hold the government to account. To improve this situation, they decided to hear oral questions on current affairs every Thursday (in the afternoon), although this decision has not had the desired effect.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">The current political situation in Benin is striking in the absence of structured political proposals made by political parties. In addition to the inability of political actors to provide polices based on a specific theme there is also tangible disinterest in how important programmes are. Several studies have shown how large is the role played by money as part of the electoral process in Benin, which the last legislative and presidential elections have only confirmed.</narrative>

   <description>
    <narrative xml:lang="EN">The distance between political actors outside of National Assembly sessions is huge in Benin. Occasions when political actors getting in touch with civil society organisations are generally limited to elections and whenever a crisis or social tension arises. As an example the repeated pushing back of local elections, social tension as a result of corruption being exposed in public recruitment practices in 2013, and rumours of a revised constitution being drafted have all been instances where political parties have had to deal with trade unions towards the end of Yayi Boni&apos;s mandate. This gap between political actors and civil society actors (not to mention the gap between political actors themselves) can easily be explained by the lack of confidence in the processes in place as well as the poor perception of the need to work together to consolidate democracy and resuscitate politics for the common good. In the opinion of the individuals interviewed, the current context forces political actors to reposition themselves within society (the rebuilding of bases after making choices which have not been shared during the last elections) and creating new political alliances following the election of a new president. According to the MPs interviewed this repositioning would require cooperating with various actors.</narrative>

      <narrative xml:lang="EN">MPs stated they did work together with governmental actors as part of their parliamentary work, particularly during the hearings of National Assembly standing committees. Furthermore, MPs stated they regularly work with actors from their political parties although the quality of this relationship is not what it could be as parties are not consulted by parliamentary groups when voting on the texts for laws.</narrative>

   <description>
    <narrative xml:lang="EN">Young people and women do not have political representation which is proportional to their vast numbers within Beninese society, with the renewal of the political class also proving a slow process. The last general elections have not seen the situation improve: out of 83 MPs only two are under the age of 40 (i.e. just over 2%) and during the Seventh Parliament women represent a bit less than 10% of the total sum of MPs. The importance of money within political life is once again given as the main factor keeping young people and women from moving up the ranks in politics. A more general awareness is emerging amongst young people and women compared to (older) men in politics. The young people active in politics are motivated to ensure qualitative succession, believing their elders to be out of touch and old-fashioned and their approach to politics being dark and dense, which is not conducive to the major, courageous overhauls required to consolidate democracy as it stands in Benin. It is against this background the AWEPA/NIMD joint programme with the School of Politics began in 2015, being targeted at young people (both men and women) and tasking them with seeing social groups better represented as part of political and electoral processes.</narrative>
