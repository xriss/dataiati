   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Strategic Partnership between NIMD, AWEPA and the Netherlands Ministry of Foreign Affairs aims to contribute to a conducive environment in which political and civic actors can effectively lobby and influence political and policy processes to advocate for inclusive and equitable social change. The partners concentrate jointly on a selected number of countries in Africa: Benin, Kenya, Mali, Mozambique, Uganda and Zimbabwe and other African countries under the flexible fund. Within this broad overarching goal, the partners jointly contribute to three specific goals: i. To improve the enabling environment for effective policy influencing on inclusive and equitable development in 10 countries in Africa and South-East Asia and 1 region (Central America) (system level change). ii. To strengthen the policy influencing capacities and responsiveness of political parties, parliaments, parliamentarians and civil society actors as drivers for inclusive social change through trust building, gender-sensitive agenda setting and inclusive dialogue in 10 countries and 1 region (actor and culture level change). iii. To develop the organisational capacities of a selected number of southern partner organizations (implementing partners, political parties and parliament) to autonomously and effectively advocate for effective policy influencing in partnership with civil society (actor level change). The themes of gender equality and inclusiveness are identified as important crosscutting themes for all proposed country and regional programmes. The departing point for the Strategic Partnership is a joint NIMD-AWEPA Theory of Change and the existing country programmes of both organizations. These country programmes &#x2013;underpinned by a country specific ToC and baseline&#x2013; are embedded in strong local political networks; are underpinned by a deep rooted knowledge of the local political economy and have a solid institutional infrastructure for programme implementation. To acknowledge the importance of cross-border themes and regional interdependencies that increasingly shape national policy agendas and to stimulate peer learning and exchange, dedicated strategies and instruments for peer learning, knowledge and innovation and PME will be developed as part of the strategic partnership. Furthermore, to maximize opportunities for regional and international lobby and advocacy on issues that emanate from national policy agendas, the programme foresees in the development of dedicated strategies for potential upstream policy influencing at regional and global fora and bodies.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">A second approach to capacity development for lobby and advocacy is focused on supporting inclusive policy-making. Parliaments and political parties need to be well equipped to perform their core functions and should have the skills and knowledge to engage in L&amp;A around policy development and improvement. In this regard, the following interventions are foreseen to capacitate political actors programmatically, in outreach and rootedness in society and individually in terms of knowledge and skills: Programmatic capacity - Support professional legal and committee support staff (in parliaments) - Provision or support of policy officers (in parties) - Support campaign message drafting, manifesto development and strategic planning (for parties and parliaments) Policy making based on outreach - Support dedicated outreach officers (parties) - Organise tours of Public Hearings and other outreach visits (parliaments) - Support use of interactive radio for dissemination - Provide media and training for parliamentary staff (parliamentarians) - Facilitate multi-stakeholder dialogue processes that link to existing knowledge on inclusive development Besides general capacity development, special attention is given to skills and knowledge on gender-sensitive policy making. It essential to especially work with men and convince them to take the views and perspectives of women and other marginalised groups into account in policymaking. By interacting with relevant interest groups from civil society that work on gender equality and inclusion issues, expertise and realities on the ground can be shared, enriching the policymaking process.</narrative>

   <description>
    <narrative xml:lang="EN">After the joint analysis of key challenges, NIMD-AWEPA facilitate the formulation of a shared national agenda for political and policy change. This reform agenda can target only one or two priority themes or legislations, but can also be an extensive agenda for change with regard to the formal democratic space and the possibilities for political and civic actors to engage in policy influencing. For instance in Mozambique, previous initiatives already identified key issues around the electoral law that the dialogue will focus on, creating space for the production of a more consensual and inclusive electoral legislation encompassing the aspirations and interests of all political actors and civil society. In order for political actors to become effective advocates and lobbyist for policy change, they need to understand policy processes and have the knowledge, tools and skills to understand the policy issues that form a barrier to effective social change and inclusive development. To assist stakeholders to build up this knowledge base, the NIMD-AWEPA alliance complements the dialogue process with trainings for political and civic actors on policy and budget processes, by organising thematic debates on relevant issues on the basis of papers and expert engagement, and provides skills training on dialogue, communication and negotiation. When concrete proposals for change (draft legislation, amendments, codes of conduct etc.) have been agreed-on a process can be started for actual joint lobby supported by the multi-stakeholder dialogue platforms. By linking these proposals to the existing network of contacts in parliaments this lobby has a higher chance of being successful. Similarly when thematic issues, for instance around inclusion and gender equality, are relevant in a country context and are identified as such by key actors, the dialogue mechanisms and platforms can also act as the supportive hub for coordinated lobby activities. For instance the gender equality mechanism that the Kenyan constitution prescribes will be high on the lobby agenda in the Kenya programme. A second approach in the strategy to support the enabling environment is to ensure better involvement of citizens and other civic actors in the policymaking work of political actors. Parliament has a clear role in scrutinizing government, drafting and enacting legislation and in representing and being accountable to their constituents. Parties need to link to supporters and other interest groups and translate their interest into party political positions that are in line with their objectives and principles. Since this approach tackles the capacity of actors but also contributes to enriching the democratic space it takes primarily place on the system and the actor level:</narrative>

   <description>
    <narrative xml:lang="EN">In many countries NIMD and AWEPA work in, political parties and parliamentarians tend to suffer from gender blindness when defining the agenda for formulating policies. For the large part, they do not demonstrate the capacity or political interest to include the needs of minority and marginalized groups. NIMD and AWEPA therefore offer a set of instruments and encourage strategic planning and policy analysis from a gender and diversity perspective that is responsive to various needs, interests and desires of all different groups in society. Next to that NIMD and AWEPA work with key stakeholders in the democratization process like election and parliamentary commissions, media and civil society organizations. Special attention is given to building the capacities of (potential) female candidates, women&#x2019;s benches and parties that represent marginalized groups. Through capacitating political actors in gender sensitive policy making the aim is to ensure parties&#x2019; and parliaments are equipped to develop inclusive policies. Furthermore, by specifically engaging with male political leaders on this theme, the views and perspectives of women and other marginalised groups are more likely to be taken into account in policymaking.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">One of the key roles for political parties is to aggregate and articulate interests from citizens, while similarly MPs are elected to represent constituencies and relate to them. In this process it is therefore essential to have the right outreach and contact systems that can guide this contact with citizens. By linking to civic organizations or networks and groups of supporters a political party can check and test policy ideas or come up with new ideas that are in line with the party&#x2019;s position. By meeting constituents MPs have better ideas on what might work or how policies are perceived in practice. As part of the capacity development of political actors this support to the responsiveness also directly contributes to the role of political actors in shaping the enabling environment.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">Safe (and institutionalised) space for dialogue between all relevant political and civic actors</narrative>
   </title>
   <description>
    <narrative xml:lang="EN">One of the reasons why there is a weak or absent enabling environment in a country is because political actors often do not have the opportunity to informally interact and engage on policy issues. There is a need to relieve tensions and provide reassurance to the different political actors on the commitment to finding lasting solutions based on an assessment of underlying causes of tension and conflict. To assist in this, the NIMD-AWEPA alliance supports and facilitates the setup of (informal) dialogue consultations or safe spaces for politicians from all parties to meet, get to know each other, and gradually overcome barriers between them. Once basic levels of trust and confidence have been secured, NIMD-AWEPA facilitates a joint analysis of the deficits and challenges in having an enabling environment between the different stakeholders participating in the dialogue process. This includes explicit inputs from other civic actors. Building trust and relationships in an informal setting is often a critical precondition for political stability and subsequent dialogue on policy reforms. For instance in Mozambique, the programme aims to create space for the production of a more consensual and inclusive electoral legislation encompassing the aspirations and interests of all political actors and civil society. By investing in physical safe spaces with dedicated support structures where the dialogue process is underpinned and can be consolidated or institutionalised. These platforms can either be located at an existing local organisation, within a newly set up platform organisation, or form part of an NIMD or AWEPA country office. NIMD-AWEPA encourages diversity in the formation and make up of these spaces so that they are representative of and can accommodate the different views, interests and needs of all citizens, including those of minority and marginalized groups. Also especially in fragile and conflict settings, it is essential to have conflict mitigating mechanisms and fora to let of steam and solve issues before they become violent. The NIMD-AWEPA operated dialogue platforms can play this role. The section detailing the strategy for capacity development of partners and target group further elaborates on this. In 7 out of 11 country/regional programmes dialogue platforms will be supported.</narrative>

   <description>
    <narrative xml:lang="EN">Parliaments and parties need to be professional bodies accessible to receive and to process civic lobby &amp; advocacy efforts. In this regard there is a need to capacitate the general operational professionalism of parliaments and parties, such as organisational rules and regulations, structures and tools, as well as to professionalize staff and their skills. For example in Mali the programme includes trainings on legislative processes for commission secretaries and direct policy development support to the 5 parliamentary groups. Other examples of institutional capacity support offered by NIMD-AWEPA include: - Parliamentary development plans and policy analysis - Professionalization of supporting functions (finance, branches, logistics, human resources) - Material support (PC&#x2019;s, printers, or providing to print manuals, IT-support) Besides basic functioning, political actors need to be responsive to their supporters, their constituents and wider society. A first step includes awareness raising among the political actors in order to be open to receive and to process civic lobby and advocacy efforts as well as to hold governments accountable. A number of approaches are targeted in this regard: - Advisory and support on transparency of procedures and information of /for parliaments - Advisory / dialogue on internal deliberative culture and structure (rules and procedures in internal party constitutions and by-laws) for parties (internal &#x2018;democracy&#x2019;) - Highlighting the importance of rootedness in society - Working with local branches, thematic or constituent group platforms as well as bottom up input for party position determination - Content-specific training for MPs, parliamentary staff and women in politics, for example on parliamentary policy and procedures on public consultation - Theme or topic-based training for relevant committees and research capacity development for parliamentary staff to support evidence-based engagement - Broad-based learning for political actors through &#x201C;schools of politics&#x201D; and skills on how to engage audiences, interact with other actors on an open platform, and advocate from an evidence base.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">Specific attention in strengthening the enabling environment for political actors is given to ensuring a level playing field. For a political system to operate according to democratic norms and which can accommodate inclusive policy making it is essential that all political actors have equitable access and freedom to operate in the political arena. This often relates to skewed legislation favouring ruling parties or state and party resource overlaps.</narrative>
