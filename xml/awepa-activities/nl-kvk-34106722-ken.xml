   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Strategic Partnership between NIMD, AWEPA and the Netherlands Ministry of Foreign Affairs aims to contribute to a conducive environment in which political and civic actors can effectively lobby and influence political and policy processes to advocate for inclusive and equitable social change. The partners concentrate on a selected number of countries in Africa: Benin, Ethiopia, Kenya, Mali, Mozambique, Uganda and Zimbabwe. In Kenya, the partners jointly contribute to four specific goals: i. To improve the enabling environment for effective policy influencing, by creating a level playing field for all political actors and civic actors wanting to influence politics. ii. To strengthen the policy influencing capacities and responsiveness of political parties, parliaments, MPs and civil society actors. iii. Increasing general interest in consulting and collaborating among and between political and civic actors. iv. Strengthening the voice and position of women and youth in the consultation processes. The departing point for the Strategic Partnership in Kenya is a joint NIMD-AWEPA Theory of Change and Baseline. The country programme is embedded in strong local political networks, underpinned by a deep rooted knowledge of the local political economy and a solid institutional infrastructure for programme implementation. To acknowledge the importance of cross-border themes and regional interdependencies that increasingly shape national policy agendas and to stimulate peer learning and exchange, dedicated strategies and instruments for peer learning, knowledge and innovation and PME have been developed as part of the strategic partnership. Furthermore, to maximize opportunities for regional and international lobby and advocacy on issues that emanate from national policy agendas, the programme foresees in the development of dedicated strategies for potential upstream policy influencing at regional and global fora and bodies.</narrative>

Actors seek interaction dependent on the issues at hand and that are in their own immediate interest. The relations between the actors are not always characterized by trust or a sense of mutual understanding, but are rather strategic alliances aimed at progressing political gains.</narrative>

      <narrative xml:lang="EN">The average frequency of inter-party collaboration over the past one year: 21 times a year, i.e. 0.4 times a week. It emerged from the study that the level or frequency of interaction between political actors and government/other political parties was determined largely by the burning issue of the day. In light of the prevailing electoral reforms discussions, this topic has dominated the types and topic of interaction/collaboration between political parties and government. Feedback from the political parties indicated that there is a high level of interaction with the frequency of interaction dependent on the thematic issue. This would range from a frequency of daily with the current debate and controversy around electoral reforms to about quarterly for other issues such as internal dispute resolution. It however was noted that the level of interest and interaction for the political actors was largely determined by political economics i.e. will the party gain materially from the interaction and less by the interests of the citizenry.</narrative>

Through the inter-party consultative forums organized by CMD as well as other civil society actors, most political parties reported to having regular interactions. Most of the interaction between political parties and CSs was skewed towards interaction with CSs that were in the democratic capacity enhancement space e.g. The National Democratic Institute (NDI), Institute for Education in Democracy (IED), Electoral Institute for Sustainable Democracy in Africa (EISA) among others where as CSs that were focused on governance oversight appeared not to feature in the list of collaborators mentioned.</narrative>

      <narrative xml:lang="EN">On the 28th of April out of 242 members of the National Assembly present, 195 voted in favour of the gender equality bill, 28 against and 19 abstained. 195 makes 55.9% of 349. On the 5th 178 MPs voted in favour of the two-third gender bill whilst 16 voted against and there were 5 abstentions. 178 makes 51% of 349. The average of 55.9% and 51% = 53.4%. Thus it could be said that the support for gender equality among political leaders in Parliament averages about 53.4%. Interviews with the leaders of political parties indicated that all political leaders are willing to and are actively taking measures towards gender mainstreaming. Very few if at all, of the political leaders in and outside of Parliament, including male leaders, speak negatively about realization of gender equality. However, a key and clear test is of how many and what percentage of those in Parliament actually vote in favour of policies geared to realizing gender equality. This is particularly crucial since stipulations such as that required to realize that each gender has at least 1/3 and not more than 2/3 of representation in Parliament can only be realized if passed in Parliament. Key leaders outside Parliament such as the President and leaders of the opposition CORD Coalition may speak in favour, but in the final analysis this ball is very much in Parliament. On the 28th of April and 5th of May 2016 a Bill to amend the constitution to ensure that no less than 1/3 and no more than 2/3 of either gender was presented in Parliament but failed to garner the 2/3 majority of 233 out of the 349 members of the National Assembly in order to be enacted into law.</narrative>

      <narrative xml:lang="EN">Over the past one year the political debate has been dominated with reforms around the electoral process and the body in charge of the electoral process. In the last one year, three bills have been tabled in Parliament that touch on civil and political rights. These are; (i) The Elections Laws (Amendments) (No. 3) Bill 2015 No. 3; (ii) The Constitution of Kenya (Amendment) Bill 2016; (iii) The Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (Amendment) Bill 2016. The three bills were introduced by the Chair of the Justice and Legal Affairs Committee (JLAC) of the National Assembly Hon. Samuel Chepkonga, meaning that they are bills from the JLAC and hence bipartisan. JLAC has members from the following ruling Jubilee coalition parties: the National Alliance (TNA), United Republican Party (URP), and New FORD- Kenya (NFK). JLAC also has representation from the Kenya National Congress (KNC), and Federal Party of Kenya (FPK) which are opposition parties. The principal object of the first Bill was to amend the Elections Act, 2011 and the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission Act, 2011, in order to address the concerns that resulted following the general election held on 4th March 2013, which was the first under the new constitutional dispensation. Central to the conduct of the elections are the constitutional role and responsibility of the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC), and the Judiciary. However the delivery of the 2013 elections, like many aspects of public administration and management involved interplay of several agencies, both State and non-state actors. It is these aspects that this Bill sought to redress. The principal object of the second amendment bill is to amend various provisions of the Constitution dealing with electoral disputes. It is based on experiential lessons obtained from the challenges previously experienced (particularly the presidential election petition of 2013) in the determination of electoral disputes. This amendment seeks to provide for mechanisms that will facilitate seamless determination of election petitions. Principally the bill seeks to extend the period of hearing a presidential election petition from 14 to 30 days. The principal object of the third bill is to amend the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission Act (No. 9 of 2011), in order to reorganize the procedure for appointment of chairperson and members of the Commission. The bill seeks to establish a Selection Panel that shall be drawn from parliamentary parties on account of their relative strength in the National Assembly. The bill aims to have the commissioners serve on part-time basis. It provides for the formation of a seven-member selection panel approved by Parliament to recruit commissioners. That would mark a departure from the current arrangement that gives the President leeway in appointing the commissioners.</narrative>
