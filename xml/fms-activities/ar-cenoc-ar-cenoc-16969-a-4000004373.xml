   <narrative xml:lang="EN">LFS is a feminist resource alliance that supports feminist activism and lobbying efforts by women, girls, and trans led organisations, movements, and networks at the regional, national, and grassroots levels in the Global South. Recognising that women, girls, and trans people are best placed to determine ways in which to address injustice and unequal power relations in their own communities, LFS resources and supports those who lead change and transform societies towards the full achievement of gender equality and human rights in the Global South. In addition to recognising the critical leadership of the South in guiding resources to address the experience of the Global South, it also values the impact of southern feminism in claiming resources on grounds of equality and non-discrimination to ensure women&#x2019;s access to and enjoyment of human rights. In its first phase, LFS was financed through a special grant of  &#x20AC;42 million from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Netherlands over four years. By renewing their financial commitment and increasing it to &#x20AC;80 million over the next five years, the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs has demonstrated its commitment to leadership from the Global South in addressing women&#x2019;s rights and gender equality. This strengthened relationship between the Dutch Government and the LFS Consortium also makes a vital contribution to the reframing of bilateral relationships with Southern-led feminist funders. 
Based on this, LFS is implemented through 3 main strategies: 
1- REGULAR GRANTMAKING (to Southern Women Rights Organisations -SWROs- and  consortia though Latin America en the Caribbean).
2- SPECIAL GRANTMAKING (to Southern Women Rights Organisations -SWROs- and  consortia though Latin America en the Caribbean).
3- LINKING AND LEARNING ACTIVITIES  (directed to Southern Women Rights Organisations -SWROs- and  consortia though Latin America en the Caribbean).

Additionally, SUPPORT tasks are implemented in order to make the implementation of the previous activities possible.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Women&#x2019;s rights, feminist and LBTIQ+ people&#x2019;s organisations and movements play crucial civil society roles that drive transformative social change.  Strengthening their power and leadership will contribute to improve preconditions leading to an enabling environment in which their activism can thrive. As such, LFS-LAC strategic programme&#x2019; objective is to strengthen the ability of SWRO, networks and alliances to lead change and transform societies towards the full achievement of gender equality and human rights in LAC.
LFS-LAC programme will pursue an interconnected approach grounded in human rights, gender equality, empowerment, intersectionality and interculturalism. It incorporates interconnected strategies for strengthening L&amp;A capacity and agency among small, medium, and large SWRO, building on momentum garnered in Phase l to further strengthen cross-movement alliances.</narrative>
