    <narrative xml:lang="EN">During the reporting period, the team of the Center for Civil Liberties (hereinafter referred to as CCL) worked on strengthening the organizational capacity of the Center for Civil Liberties by implementing the audit recommendations, taking into account consultations and training from Nordic Consulting Group, i.e. introducing gender mainstreaming and a human rights-based approach at all levels of the work of the organization. Introduced changes are described below by clustered category. Structural changes in the organization. The recommendations to change the management structure of the organization to ensure more stable operation were assessed to be among the most significant. Therefore, a new Charter has been developed that was eventually discussed at all levels in the team and at the General Meeting of members of the organization. Consequently, the new edition of the Charter has been approved. In December 2018, the organization&#x2019;s new Charter was registered by the Ministry of Justice of Ukraine. Hence, the work of the organization&#x2019;s statutory bodies of the was aligned with the new Charter and a Supervisory Board was formed. The non-staff members of the organization were included to the Supervisory Board, allowing for greater independence from internal processes and objectivity in the organization strategy developing. Besides, functions of the strategic and operational management have been separated, for which the Management Board appointed the Executive Director of the organization. The appointment of the Executive Director launched separation of the work structuring and motivation of personnel, as well as a systematization of the CCL project portfolio management into different processes. Coordination of the projects from the CCL portfolio is distributed among team members (except for the financial sector) under the general coordination of the Executive Director. The substantial and financial reports on the results of the organization&apos;s work for 2018 and 2019 were finalized, taking into account the recommendations from the Management Board and the Supervisory Board, and approved as per the procedure stipulated in the new Charter. Procedures for the organization&apos;s work planning and quality assessment: strategic, tactical, and operational components. During the reporting period, the organization held three strategic meetings for the team. In December 2018, the team developed a draft operational plan for 2019, in RAF format, on the recommendation of Nordic Consulting Group advisors. The plan also included HRBA and gender mainstreaming elements. In February 2019, the first team strategic session was held to develop a 3-year strategic plan for 2021-2023. To ensure that the management principles based on the RBM methodology are consciously applied by the team at all levels of work planning, detailed RAFs, both current and future (strategic), were developed for each project area in consultation with the Nordic Consulting Group. In December 2019, the CSO managed to finalize a 3-year strategic plan for 2021-2023 in RAF format, based on the recommendations of Nordic Consulting Group advisors, including HRBA and gender mainstreaming elements. As a result, the plan for 2021-2023 was approved by the CCL General Meeting on 5 March 2020. &#xA0; The partner organization also introduced new tools for operational planning and monitoring of the team tasks, with a cycle of weekly and monthly meetings. Monthly operational planning forms have also been designed in the context of the annual RAF allowing the team to regularly check whether operational activities are in line with tactical objectives and strategic areas. Beginning in 2020, an annual system for assessing staff competencies and evaluating performance have been launched. A Communication Policy with a separate section of the SMM management has been developed, a financial audit conducted, and a website redesign comissioned according to the communication part of the strategy described in the Strategic Plan 2021-2023. The CSO Team conducted a digital audit and training for the staff members on digital security principles and personal data management. A responsible team member was also appointed to implement the audit recommendations for this area. Financial accounting in the organization. Changes in the financial management of the organization were in response to the recommendations to update the tender procurement procedures. Now, the regulation on tender procedures is developed and approved, the composition of the Tender Board is updated, and in 2019, the tender offer competition for service providers for the next 3-5 years was held as per the new procedure. Operational activity plans and operational budgets for 2019-2020 were developed and approved by the CCL Management Board. Changes have also occurred to the new accounting policy, which includes new financial control measures, was adopted. At the recommendation of the auditors, the accounting program 1C:Accounting, which allows maintaining separate accounting of project finances, was updated. The second control signature was introduced for all accounts in the banking system. A staff timesheets have been introduced.&#xA0; The annual external independent audit of the organization activities was carried out based on the results of 2018 and 2019 by the auditor selected through a tender procedure. Personnel management. Since the human rights area, as any public activity area, is featured by high involvement and motivation of employees, there is a problem of job burnout due to failure to comply with the regime of resource recovery and overtime work. The organization created its own system for recording team workloads in response to comments about the lack of an effective runtime distribution analysis and recording system. It shows both the planning of annual leaves and periods of business trips, as well as the cases of required work during the weekend and compensatory time. In addition, during the reporting period, the CSO has developed a regulation on volunteering and internships in the organization. As part of the Personnel Management Policy, an annual assessment of employee competencies and results stared to be carried out, resulting in the creation of an individual development plan /IDP for each employee. Also, since May 2019, the Organization conducted three training courses for the team: on planning and communication tools, project management, and job burnout prevention. Following up upon the work within gender mainstreaming, the CSO developed a policy on the prevention of sexual harassment and bullying of employees, volunteers, and interns of our organization. Also, during the reporting period, the organization introduced back-stopping function to substitute the function of an Executive Director, during annual leave, sick leave, business travel, etc.</narrative>
