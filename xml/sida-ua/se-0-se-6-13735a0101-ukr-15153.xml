   <narrative xml:lang="EN">NPBU formulated Project objectives as follows:
1)&#xA0;Completed transition from manual management (micromanagement) to process management (through goals and workflows)
2) Launch of automated workflows at UA:PBC&#xA0;
3)&#xA0;Transformed corporate culture compliant with UA:PBC&#x2019;s values and mission&#xA0;
4)&#xA0;UA:PBC becomes a reliable and more reputable source of information by using information on public opinion.
Effectiveness and competitiveness of a media company is based on a proper functioning of 3 main pillars: people, management system and content (see the chart below).

UA:PBC faces big challenges in every of these spheres, namely:
1) Management system: Following the drastic downsizing, the company is revising its internal structure and management system in accordance with international management principles and current best international practices at broadcasting companies. As of now, there is manual management in a company. Management team members have different views on the framework for building a business process/management system. Business processes of the company are not defined or regulated. For 26 years, the company had been state owned and consisted of 31 independent companies which were united only in 2017. The most widespread tools at the company are still Excel and Google documents. Data is stored in different formats and is not interrelated. The management needs to wait for reports or entry data relevant for management decision-making from two hours to several days. All this is exacerbated by inflated number of staff, excessive and obsolete bureaucracy, poor confidentiality of information, inefficient use of resources and limited information for management decisions.
2) Human resources:UA:PBC inherited corporate culture, which is typical for a dependent and controlled state institution and is inconsistent with the current values of the company. This culture has been hampering changes and demotivating the best staff.
3) Content:The old system of state television was oriented at the government and focused on the interests of officials. To work for the benefit of the people and be a source of credible and truthful information about society UA: PBC needs effective tools to measure public opinion. Currently, the company does not have such tools and decisions what content to produce are taken without having sufficient evidence-based information. This significantly influences the quality and format of the content as well as the ways of its distribution.Becoming an effective company is possible only after solving all the above-mentioned challenges, i.e. full transformation of UA:PBC&#x2019;s management system, corporate culture and change of content production approaches.These needs for changes are the basis for the implementation of UA:PBC&apos;s development Strategy for 2020-2022. Four vectors of transformation were chosen for implementation of this Strategy: organizational, technological, content transformation and transformation of corporate culture. Project&#x2019;s outcomes cover an important part of the success factors that must be achieved in all transformation vectors.
There is a good common ground, joint understanding and commitment of the key stakeholders to work on organizational, digital, and corporate culture transformations as well as on enhancing audience outreach and engagement. The plan for this intervention is to make a concentrated effort to conduct full organizational transformation of the public service media system in Ukraine.
Theory of changeThe following objectives are proposed:Development objective: Effective and competitive public service broadcaster in Ukraine as a tool for democracy and empowerment.Project objective: Transformed management system, corporate culture and approaches to content production of public service broadcaster in Ukraine
The draft Result-based management (RBM) matrix for the project puts forward four outcomes and several outputs. The proposed outcomes are closely interlinked and causal relations can be traced in the programme document. Workflow automation is impossible without transition to system management. Transformation of corporate culture should be strengthened by providing appropriate tools for staff, namely clear &#x201C;rules of game&#x201D; (workflows); and IT systems for implementing these rules. The cooperation partner plans to finalize the RBM Matrix with realistic numbers added at the output, activities and indicators level after the inception period, as soon as the procured consultants for each component process the results of their initial diagnostics and audits. The application of RBM matrix as a steering tool implies regular follow up and adjustments to stay on track and reach the intended results.
The Embassy assesses this as a feasible plan. However, the cooperation partner obviously lacks RBM application knowledge, e.g. separate &quot;theories of change&quot; were suggested for every component of the project, but an umbrella vision has not been framed properly in the respective section of the proposal, even though it can be elicited from the programme document in its other parts. The Embassy suggests additional RBM training for the staff of this cooperation partner during the inception phase of the project, preferably the one organized by Sida Partnership Forum.&#xA0;
Project contentFull organizational transformation will take time and considerable effort. Therefore, the Embassy assesses&#xA0; that a proposed project time span of three years will be necessary to conduct the transformation. Detailed project outcomes, outputs, activities, baselines, indicators and time frame are described in the draft RBM matrix.
Outcome 1. Conducted transition from manual management (micromanagement) to process management (through goals and workflows)UA:PBC&#x2019;s goal is to transform the existing management system to a fundamentally new level, focused on efficiency, clarity and transparency. The evolution of the transformation of UA:PBC&#x2019;s management system can be seen in the chart below. Currently, UA:PBC aims to make a transition to process management.
Evolution of the transformation of the management system:Process management is a management approach in which a company is viewed as a network of interconnected business processes rather than distinct functions, as opposed to a functional approach. The advantage of process management is its focus on the end result of each individual business process, which is a sequence of operations, and set of processes. Process approach allows evaluating the contribution of each business process to the end result of the company&#x2019;s activities, which triggers positive effect for employees&#x2019; motivation. Optimization of business processes will contribute to the company&apos;s sustainable opreation as an independent and effective institution.More than 20% of the Roadmap&apos;s recommendations are devoted to the design of business processes and are included in this project. Their implementation is one of the most complex and largest tasks, since it concerns almost the entire company and will have noticeable impact. Processes will be not only described but also optimized showing how to use employees&#x2019; time more effectively. This can lead to the improvement of organization&#x2019;s structure and, hence, to optimization of human resources. It also foresees the reduction of the level of bureaucracy as well as effective distribution of authority. Launch of the process approach will reduce timeframes of decision-making as well as enhance decision-making efficiency. This will all also lead to savings of financial resources.
Outcome 2. Automated workflowsDigital transformation involves creating databases, developing products, automatization of business processes, integration of accounting financial and personnel systems of the central directorate and branches into a single system, and developing a cross-cutting analytics system that will enhance the company&#x2019;s efficiency.The chart below shows how single information space should look like:
Automatization would enable optimization of human and financial resources and increase of transparency of financial and personnel processes. Since single information storage is envisioned in this system, the reliability and confidentiality of information would increase. As a result, NPBU&apos;s would stregthen its competitiveness and improve its image as a modern innovative institution. Technological changes will affect all the staff and will lead to significant improvement of the quality of financial and personnel services. Employees will also have a platform for internal communication, which increases openness. The company will be fully digitalized.
Outcome 3. Transformed corporate culture fitting UA:PBC&#x2019;s values and missionFormation and development of the corporate culture is an important task and a prerequisite for the effective implementation of changes at UA:PBC and its sustainable development.The external influence of the organization is directly related to its internal integrity and ideology. That is why the internal culture of the public broadcaster must be as consistent as possible and not only contribute to the effectiveness of the organization itself, but also to the strengthening of UA:PBC&#x2019;s position and its role in the formation of national consciousness. Corporate culture also creates employees&#x2019; engagement and is a key to managing the organization.UA:PBC&#x2019;s goal is to create the desired vision of the organization&#x2019;s culture in order to achieve an influential position of UA:PBC outside and have attractive image as an employer inside and outside as well as to set up HR system so that the desired organization culture is built up as efficiently as possible.After the transformation of corporate culture employees&#x2019; engagement, motivation, loyalty as well as efficiency will significantly increase, managers at any level will understand where and how the company changes and what is required from them. This will also increase the speed of internal communication as well as its quality.
Outcome 4. UA: PBC becomes a reputable source of information by using public opinion trendsUA:PBC needs to know exactly what is bothering Ukrainians and discuss these issues. This is a fundamental function of the public service broadcaster, a key component of the brand and its reputation.By establishing a well-functioning and innovative marketing department, UA:PBC will be able to:&#x2022; get quick public opinion on current issues;&#x2022; systematically cooperate with experts who generate issues that need actualization in society;&#x2022; discuss all current issues and topics on the air and create socially important content;&#x2022; disseminate the received data in the country&apos;s information space.The products&apos; menu should include analytics, data, metrics, ratings, value orientations which will be used internally by program director, producers, editors, PR department, Management Board and externally by leaders of public opinion, mass media, think tanks, and public authorities.A well functioning and innovative marketing department will be able to help NPBU shape the social agenda, produce annual reports on social trends and set standards. At the internal level UA:PBC will be able to control the achievement of its marketing goals, generate evidence-based themes for the creative team, study regional audiences and their needs.</narrative>
