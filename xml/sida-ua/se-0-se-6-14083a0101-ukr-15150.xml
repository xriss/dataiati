    <narrative xml:lang="EN">Main achievementsALI&apos;s governance structure ALI developed the new Charter and registered it following national legislation on 16October 2020.New Charter provides for changes in ALI&apos;s governance structure and functions of itsgoverning bodies following recommendations provided in the SBA Report and hasnumerous other improvements. The main changes are as follows.It was ensured that only the GA approves and dismisses ALI&apos;s members (previously, itwas within the Board&apos;s power).New Charter stipulates that the ALI&apos;s Board, elected by the GA for three years, shall be&#xA0;independent, so that each member of the Board who has the right to vote, shall not be&#xA0;ALI&apos;s employee or person economically dependent on ALI (the previous edition of the&#xA0;Charter did not have such limitations, so the full composition of the Board could be&#xA0;members of ALI&apos;s staff and/or members of ALI). This requirement does not apply for the Secretary of the Board because the person occupying this position shall not have the right&#xA0;to vote and shall perform only technical functions (like taking minutes of the Board&apos;s&#xA0;meetings, preparation of the Board&apos;s meetings, interacting with ALI&apos;s staff and other&#xA0;ALI&apos;s governing bodies while preparing documents for the Board&apos;s consideration, etc.).The GA elected all the members of the new Board in December 2020.The new Charter stipulates that the Audit Commission is accountable exclusively to the&#xA0;GA (and not to the Board). Also, the Regulation on the Audit Committee was amended&#xA0;to set time frames for conducting inspections, preparing reports, and their presentation to&#xA0;the GA.The Regulation states that the Audit Committee should conduct regular checks ofimplementing projects/programmes on ALI&apos;s compliance with both donor requirements&#xA0;and national legislation and present the results of such inspections to the GA (at least for&#xA0;one project/programme per year).Updated draft Board Regulation and Regulation on the Audit Committee were prepared&#xA0;for the GA&apos;s consideration, and were considered and approved by the highest ALI&apos;s&#xA0;governing body in December 2020 and January 2021, respectively.The new Charter provides for establishing a new ALI&apos;s executive body &#x2013; the ExecutiveDirector (ED) with day-to-day management functions who is accountable to the Boardand the GA. The ED shall be appointed for three years and dismissed by the Board, and&#xA0;he or she shall not be a member of the Board and/or Head of the General Assembly.The ED has a right to take part in the Board meetings with a consultative vote.According to the new Charter, the ED was appointed by the new Board in December2020.Thus, the new Charter clearly distributes functions and responsibilities between ALI&apos;sfour governing bodies &#x2013; the GA (the highest governing body; should have meetings atleast once per year), the Board (the administrative-managerial body that manages ALI&#xA0;between the GA meetings; should have meetings at least once per quarter), the Audit&#xA0;Commission (internal audit), and the ED (day-to-day management of all operations) that&#xA0;is in line with SBA Report recommendations, national legislation and international&#xA0;experience in CSO sector.Newly-elected governing bodies &#x2013; the Board and the ED &#x2013; were registered in the SUR in&#xA0;accordance with national legislation in December 2020. As of March 2021, the newBoard had 3 meetings (two in December 2020 and one in March 2021). StrategyALI updated or developed its key strategic documents (Strategy for 2021 &#x2013; 2023,including RAF, Fundraising Strategy for 2021 &#x2013; 2023, Communication Strategy for 2021&#xA0;&#x2013; 2023). Strategy for 2021 &#x2013; 2023, including RAF, Fundraising Strategy for 2021 &#x2013; 2023,Communication Strategy for 2021 &#x2013; 2023 and Operational Plan for 2021 wereconsidered and approved by the new Board in December 2020 and then, in January2021, Strategy and Operational Plan were considered and approved by the GA.Current Strategy has 4 strategic areas:Good Governance (particularly, support to Parliamentary reform, public administrationreform, implementation of the Ukraine &#x2013; EU Association Agreement, and other reforms);Justice and Security (support to reform of Prosecution, Ministry of Internal Affairs,Judiciary, improvement of educational process for legal professions);Civics and Political Culture (including USPS Annual Programme and other events; support&#xA0;to implementation of social audit instrument at the level of territorial communities;&#xA0;dissemination of innovative knowledge and approaches in humanitarian and socio-political areas);ALI&#x2019;s Institutional Capacity (further strengthening of ALI&#x2019;s communication capacity,internal policies and procedures, HR development and development of infrastructure).Updated strategic documents were drafted using the RBM approach, SMART criteria,and Theory of Changes. The Strategy contains context analysis, including cross-cutting&#xA0;issues like gender analysis, conflict sensitivity, environmental issues etc. Strategic goals,&#xA0;outcomes, impacts and subsequent indicators that allow to monitor and evaluate the&#xA0;progress of implementation of activities in all ALI&#x2019;s strategic areas are reflected in the&#xA0;updated RAF.It should be also mentioned that stemming from factual ALI&apos;s activities, another statutory&#xA0;area was added in the new Charter &#x2013; &quot;editing and publishing&quot;, which encompasses&#xA0;preparation and publishing of different materials, books, and monitoring of political&#xA0;processes of public importance and informing the public about results of the monitoring.ProcurementNumerous changes were made to procurement policy and practice of procurementprocedures.In August 2020, the Procurement Specialist was hired by ALI. The ProcurementSpecialist is responsible for conducting procurement procedures and submitting tender&#xA0;proposals to the tender committee&apos;s consideration. ALI adheres to its Procurement Policy&#xA0;and documents all decisions on procurement procedures. The Procurement Specialist&#xA0;stores all documentation related to procurement procedures.Simultaneously, amendments to ALI&apos;s Procurement Policy were developed, covering all&#xA0;the recommendations provided by the SBA Report. Notably, the rule to prevent that one&#xA0;supplier is contracted directly under a contract of less than EUR 1 000 several times&#xA0;during a year (if accumulated) is added; criteria for exemptions when tender procedures&#xA0;could not be used were clarified; selection of external auditor under general rules is&#xA0;included (also reflected in the amended Audit Regulation). Numerous practical templates&#xA0;were added to the Procurement Policy. To simplify procurement procedures for some&#xA0;types of purchases (like internet services, rent of office, expert, or consultative services),&#xA0;mechanism of procurements from regular suppliers selected via tender procedure (for 2-year period or for the period of project implementation) was introduced.Updated Procurement Policy (in a form of Procurement Manual) was considered andapproved by the new Board in December 2020. Following the practice of itsimplementation in January &#x2013; March 2021, the ED submitted for the Board&#x2019;sconsideration several improvements (like amendments to some templates) that wereconsidered and approved by the Board on 26 March 2021. New composition of theTender Committee was approved by the Order of the ED in December 2020. Financial policy and related issuesAmendments were made to the draft Financial Policy and practice of its implementation.It should be mentioned that some of the recommendations regarding improvements in&#xA0;financial policy and related issues had been implemented just before the start of the Pre-Core Support.In particular, ALI&apos;s Financial Director initiated an internal check to identify andeliminate the non-conformance with the procedure of filling up the payment vouchers to&#xA0;ensure that payment vouchers are completed and signed before actual payment and that&#xA0;payment vouchers have the correct dates (actual), which should be handwritten (not pre-printed). Furthermore, due to the support within the Project, since 2021 ALI introduced&#xA0;e-payment vouchers and mechanism of their remoted preparation and processing.Also, amendments were made to the Financial Policy to require two signatories to allbank transactions. Then, the obligation of ALI&apos;s Financial Director to verify all types offinancial reports before their submission to interested parties and time frames forapproval of annual reports were clarified in the draft Financial Policy. It is stated thatALI shall make public its financial information (this statement is also reflected in the new&#xA0;ALI&apos;s Charter).Regarding the payment vouchers, it is defined that these should be prepared for alltransactions and transfers of funds, except salary and tax payments. Rule of twosignatories for bank cash transactions, monthly bank reconciliation, and general-purpose&#xA0;financial statements are established in the draft Financial Policy and implemented.Updated draft Financial Policy was considered by the new Board in December 2020.The Board agreed with main norms of the draft Financial Policy and obliged the ED tobe guided by its principles. Then, updated Financial Policy was considered and approved by the Board on 26 March&#xA0;2021. Also, approved Financial Policy was improved by establishing templates for draft&#xA0;budgets and templates for monitoring budgets (budget vs. actual reports). AuditAs for the external audit, the Provision on External Audit was amended to reflect all the&#xA0;SBA Report&apos;s recommendations and became a part of broader Audit Policy developed&#xA0;within the Project. These amendments regulate that ALI shall necessarily conduct&#xA0;external independent audits of its general-purpose financial statements, establish&#xA0;timeframes for conducting external audits, and present the results of these audits to the&#xA0;GA.Also, the updated Audit Policy designates the persons responsible for interaction withauditors (mainly, it shall be the responsibility of the Financial Director), in particular the&#xA0;mechanism of preparing responses to the auditor&apos;s findings. The Audit Policy requires&#xA0;that ALI shall carry out an open tender procedure to select an auditor.The Audit Policy has annexes with model terms of reference for auditing general purpose&#xA0;financial statements and project financial reports, Professional Code of internal auditor&#xA0;and parameters of different types of audits that could be used by ALI regarding&#xA0;international audit standards.Draft Audit Policy was considered and approved by the new Board at the meeting on 27&#xA0;December 2020, and it is active since 01 January 2021. HR policy and related issuesUpdated draft HR policy was developed as a framework for all key processes related to&#xA0;management of ALI&#x2019;s personnel, particularly: selection, adaptation, assessment of staff;&#xA0;training and development of staff, management of staff&#x2019;s effectiveness; management of&#xA0;remuneration; career planning and professional growing; social development of&#xA0;employees.Also, HR policy sets basic principles for: health and safety of work; social responsibility of&#xA0;ALI and employees; documentation of working relations between ALI and employees;&#xA0;equality and non-discrimination; work and rest regime; redundancy; internal&#xA0;communications; organisational ethics and culture, and other areas.To improve procedures on travelling for ALI, particularly concerning the SBA Reportrecommendations, a draft Business Trip Manual covering the main issues related toALI&apos;s staff travelling was developed. Thus, the Manual sets rules for initiation andauthorisation of travel in different cases (like planned travelling within theimplementation of the certain project or if ALI&apos;s employee is invited to visit some event&#xA0;by some stakeholder); eligible costs while travelling for ALI; rules for reimbursement of&#xA0;travel costs; rules for reporting on travel; a set of templates (like a budget template for&#xA0;travelling). To improve the commitment of ALI&apos;s employees, the HR Policy establishes monthlytimesheets to be signed by the employee and his or her supervisor. Updated draft HRPolicy and draft Business Trip Manual were considered by the new Board in December2020. The Board approved Business Trip Manual and agreed with main norms of thedraft HR Policy obliging the ED to be guided by its principles.Then, updated HR Policy was considered and approved by the Board on 26 March2021. Also, at that Board&#x2019;s meeting Regulation on Working Time Tracking wasconsidered and approved.</narrative>
