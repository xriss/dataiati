  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed project is a comprehensive investment and advisory services program for Sogebank (or the Bank), the largest banking group in the Republic of Haiti with total assets of approximately $750 million. In a country were only 1% of the population has access to formal credit, the support of IFC in one of the soundest financial institutions will help improve access to finance by the population by promoting the creation of new products, increasing the lending capacity of the institution and promoting greater competitiveness and efficiency in the local market. IFCs investment would include equity in the Bank as well as guarantees for trade confirmation lines.   Sogebank is the leading bank in Haiti, with market shares of 28% and 34% in loans and deposits respectively. The Bank is a commercial bank with activities spanning retail and corporate banking, SME and microfinance, remittance distribution, and factoring which are operated as independent businesses through separate subsidiaries.  Sogebank was founded in 1986 by a group a Haitian businessmen who took over the operations of the former Royal Bank of Canada, which was present in Haiti since 1917.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project is expected to have a high developmental impact by strengthening the Haitian banking sector through the presence of institutional ownership in the largest bank, which will foster stronger governance, improved operational efficiency, and boost product innovation and service quality thereby fostering competition in the sector, which in turn will result in increased and improved access to finance, especially to currently underserved market segments of micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs).     The combination of IFCs advisory services in the area of MSME financing, coupled with Sogebanks scale and outreach in Haiti will be key in reinforcing the impact of the project. Finally, given that Haiti is an impoverished country with an undiversified economy that is dependent on imports for food, energy and manufactures and has few exports (apparel industry, agriculture), a GTFP line is expected to be highly developmental, both for Sogebank, and for the Haitian economy as it will facilitate imports of goods and equipment to support the economy, while at the same time scaling up an important line of business for the Bank. As such, this initiative is in line with IFCs strategy to focus on IDA countries.</narrative>
