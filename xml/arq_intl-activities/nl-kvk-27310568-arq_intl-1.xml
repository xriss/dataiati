  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In response to the crisis in Ukraine, ARQ International is launching a 3-year programme with the overall objective to support mental health professionals in Ukraine to contribute to the long-term resilience of Ukrainian communities. The initial 6 months of the programme are designed to provide a rapid response to the needs of Ukrainian mental health professionals, including by providing targeted training in psychotrauma approaches and community-based care, supervision and consultation on specific cases, and staff support to manage the ongoing stressors faced by mental health professionals. The programme will also seek to improve the access of Ukrainian mental health professionals to MHPSS tools and resources and strengthen their networks to international training opportunities and local avenues of support. 

The second phase of the programme (months 7-36), will invest in Ukrainian mental health professionals&#x2019; ability to contribute to the recovery of Ukrainian communities by strengthening their capacity to provide medium and long-term interventions for psychotrauma and related disorders, and will also identify opportunities to integrate MHPSS into long-term efforts toward recovery, social stabilisation, and peacebuilding.</narrative>
