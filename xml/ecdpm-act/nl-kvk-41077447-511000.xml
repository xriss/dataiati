   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This workstream aims to contribute to the following impact areas or our ECDPM theory of change:&#x25CF;       Effective international cooperation frameworks and tools for tackling global challenges&#x25CF;       Peaceful societies based on the rule of law, social cohesion and human dignity&#x25CF;       Sustainable economic transformation with shared prosperity and decent jobs&#x25CF;       Accountable institutions and engaged citizensMore concretely, the programme aims to help advance to the following key changes:Balancing the narratives around migration and mobility with the EU, the AU, the RECs and respective member states.EU institutions and EU MS have knowledge about the risks and opportunities of their chosen external action strategies in relation to migration. EU international cooperation and external action policies towards Africa are based on improved understanding of complex African migration realities, their relationship to development processes and drivers for successful implementation.Understanding of European migration policies and implications for African regional migration governance by African policy-makers is enhanced. African states and institutions play a vocal role in promoting African migration narratives in the EU-Africa migration discourse and in forming policies.The implementation of African intra-regional migration governance and labour mobility is strengthened in a way that is beneficial for migration and development in Africa.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Summary and Context           ECDPM established a Migration programme in 2017 to consolidate its existing ad-hoc work on migration and to strategically focus on the workstream &#x2018;Towards a forward-looking approach to governance of mobility in and between the EU and Africa&#x2019;. This workstream aims to help inform, communicate evidence and broaden narratives around migration dynamics in Africa and between Africa and Europe as well as investigate policy approaches and their impacts on migration and development in EU-Africa relations. Within the one and a half year as self standing workstream, the Migration programme has worked towards establishing itself as recognized programme with expertise on EU-Africa migration relations. One result is that funders as well as external partners are calling on the programme for expertise on the topic of migration in EU-Africa relations in a more systematic way and aligned to our areas of work. Through these opportunities and independent work, the Migration Programme has contributed to a broader dialogue on the topic of migration and has helped strengthening evidence base on which policy discussions and guidance for EU external cooperation on migration and development can be built.           Our contributions           Understanding better the African migration agenda           In order to improve understanding of complex African migration realities, one of the main work areas has been to bring stronger voices from Africa (both on existing migration realities as well as the policy and implementation landscape) to European debates. With Discussion Paper 203 on African and European narratives on migration, the team provided a conceptual basis through clarifying the different objectives concerning migration and development. The paper discusses the different policy options that emerge from prevailing narratives both in Europe and in Africa. While researched and written at the end of 2016, throughout the reporting period we drew on its content in presentations and engagement with policy actors in government as well as researchers and found it a useful frame to discuss migration governance. We expanded on this work by looking at African migration governance from a political economy perspective: To highlight the different perspectives, interests, existing cooperation and policy implementation around migration governance in Africa and to inform stakeholders about the approaches of the AU we published an analysis on this topic titled &#x2018;AU migration governance: non-aligned views on migration governance in Africa&#x2019;. Both these outputs contributed to supporting an improved understanding of African migration and migration governance realities within the EU. Given the salience of Northern Africa regions in the questions on migration between Europe and Africa, we have also started to explore the political economy of migration governance in Tunisia, Morocco and Egypt, through a series of blogs, disseminated to and ready by a number of EU institutional actors. By changing the perspective and reporting on the interests and political dynamics in North African countries we aimed to inject different perspectives into the EU policy debates on how to address irregular migration. To this effect, we also helped facilitate dialogue on the smuggling dynamics in Libya in cooperation with the Global Initiative on Transnational Organized Crime and commented on EU&#x2019;s policy agenda with regards to Libya in Dutch Media. More recently we have been working to shed light on the cooperation agreements between the AU, the EU and the UN with regards to emergency support to Libya in order to inform about recent developments and the policy dilemmas these actors face. Our gained in-depth knowledge on African processes regarding migration governance helped inform policy events and debates on the EU&#x2019;s external action addressing migration in Africa, in which we took part. These efforts may not directly result in specific changes in policy outcomes, yet they can contribute to an improved understanding of complex African migration realities and how these relate to drivers important for successful implementation of policy approaches.            Informing EU institutions and EU MS and African actors on EU developments on migration           At the beginning of 2017, the Migration programme published a study on the fast changes concerning European aid and international development policy as a result of the increase in irregular migration to Europe. Our research provided a comprehensive overview of the changes in EU aid spending and policies as well as the dimensions of the impact. The report provided the evidence-base for further discussions on implications for the wider allocation of Official Development Assistance as well as risks and opportunities regarding tackling migration through EU development cooperation. The team used the reports&#x2019; insights in several follow-up activities (including articles, interviews, public and closed-door presentations and advice) feeding the policy debate. The report has been appreciated by researchers, EU policy-makers, development practitioners as well as NGOs mainly in Europe but also in Africa. We received feedback from a variety of actors that they felt better informed and used the analysis for their own academic and policy related work. It also allowed us to feed evidence to the International Organisation for Migration assessment report on DG DEVCOs approach to mainstreaming migration into development cooperation, a hearing in the EU Parliament, and the work of the EU Court of Auditors. We informed a variety of actors and possibly - through providing sound evidence and highlighting crucial policy questions - helped prepared the ground for an improved policy debate and more coherent policies and practices in the future. It led to follow-up demands and opportunities to broaden and nuance the debate on migration and development. The report also highlighted specific issues where further work, discussion and guidance was needed. One opportunity emerged to work - within a consortium - on a Dutch-funded real-time learning evaluation of the Regional Development and Protection Programme (RDPP) in the Horn of Africa. This work started at the end of 2017 and is still ongoing. The emerging findings have strong potential to inform topics such as humanitarian and development joint approaches to displacement, integration of refugee and host community support in situations of displacement as well as how to connect with private sector actors. While having this learning evaluation puts emphasis on closing the policy to practice gap, it in addition provides first insights into the working of the EU Trust Fund as a new modality. Baseline findings will feed the annual EU Steering Committee Meeting of the RDPP discussing the way forward for the RDPP.            Outreach to reinforce balanced narratives around migration and mobility           ECDPM&#x2019;s role is to broker and build bridges, ensure that gained insights from research are widely shared and that lessons learned are not lost, especially as debates became more political than fact-based. The programme chose to increase its efforts on outreach and to engage with actors other than working on development and active in the field of migration and international development. With the renewed spotlight on the topic in EU-Africa relations, more stakeholders entered into the debates, each coming from different angles and not all having been exposed to migration or development aspects or the African context before. Our engagement in particular focused on framing migration as part of broader development processes thereby reinforcing more positive narratives around migration and development amidst an increasingly negative picture in European public and policy debates due to the &#x2018;migration crisis&#x2019;. We engaged in outreach through several channels: * We chose to engage more strongly as speakers in externally organised events, seminars and expert group meetings (for example taking part in expert groups organised by EU Joint Research Centre, the EU Parliament, as part of a Strategy Group on International Migration and Development organised by the Robert Bosch Foundation and the Bertelsmann Foundation, the University of Pretoria etc.), gave interviews for radio, TV and for magazines . We chose these carefully and engaged specifically when we knew that the audience or other participants came from a backgrounds also other than development and when we thought we can reach actors not necessarily familiar with migration realities in Africa and/or the nuances of EU policies on migration. We also provided training to African and European young journalists on the topic of migration in Senegal in 2018. 
* We contributed to facilitating debate ourselves through co-organising events, e.g. as part of the ETTG Group, the Global Initiative on Transnational Organised Crime as well as other research organisations. 
* We dedicated a GREAT Insights on the topic of migration which reflected the breadth of the topic and which was well received by policy actors in Africa and Europe (EU MS, RECs, ACP, etc.). Given ECDPM&#x2019;s diverse audience, this also helped to bring recent evidence and policy developments on migration closer to a actors working in different thematic fields.           
Building bridges between migration and other thematic areas            Migration touches on several other thematic areas and is thus also identified as one of the areas where coherence of policies is important. Understanding and acting upon the risks and opportunities that migration offers involves various actors working on themes other than migration, different line ministries and non-governmental organisations spanning various topics. Yet, policy areas often remain siloed and a comprehensive understanding of each others&#x2019; agenda is not always the case. We aim to build bridges through analysis and knowledge brokerage across policy areas. In the reporting period we specifically focused on peace, security and displacement through working on smuggling of migrants and investigating the role of the African Union Peace and Security Architecture in addressing displacement in Africa resulting in commissioned reports and ECDPM Discussion Paper 228. The analysis fed German deliberations on their support to APSA. DP 228 has also been shared with a community of practitioners of the Dutch Knowledge Platform on Security and the Rule of Law during a well-attended event. Another publication explored the intersection between food systems and migration dynamics and governance. We seized opportunities to inject knowledge on migration in circles focused mainly on food security, which, according to received feedback, helped broaden horizons and connect policy debates.           Considering gender aspects in migration           In this workstream we made an effort to put a strong focus on gender aspects. On the one hand we considered how gender dynamics affect migration patterns through including it in our research and analysis when adequate (e.g. in the work on displacement and the role of African Governance Architecture, the African Peace and Security Architecture as well as in the Briefing note on the link between food security and migration). On the other hand we are working on a specific research report (to be published in October 2018) focusing on gender in the EU development cooperation response to irregular migration. We aim to contribute to closing the gap from policy to practice in relation to the EU Gender Action Plan. We have been able to provide evidence and suggestions to the EU Practitioners Network Meeting on gender in June 2018 based on our findings. Moreover, in our GREAT Insights Migration edition we made sure that perspectives on how gender affects migration success and challenges are included and that the message of needing diverse and gender sensitive policies when responding to migration is heard.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Migration has remained a politically important topic in the relationship between Africa and Europe during the reporting period. Between 2019 and 2021, the Migration programme has continued to contribute to four key changes:- Balancing the narratives around migration and mobility both in Europe and Africa and in particular highlighting the development benefits of migration and mobility.- Contributing to better knowledge of EU institutions and EU member states about the risks and opportunities of their chosen external action strategies in relation to migration and in particular towards African countries.- EU international cooperation and external action policies towards Africa are based on improved understanding of complex African migration realities, their relationship to development processes and drivers for successful implementation.- The implementation of African intra-regional migration governance and labour mobility is strengthened in a way that is beneficial for migration and development in Africa.The COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 altered a number of parameters and influenced mobility patterns and policies. With the exception of movement for essential reasons at the discretion of border agents, lockdown measures halted the flow of both regular and irregular migrants. Migrants have been stuck in transit and resettlement and family reunification were also halted due to the closure of public services in Europe and abroad. Countries have adopted prohibitive responses to irregular migration, which has led to more precarity and a loss of migrant lives during the pandemic. Some European countries, such as Greece, Italy and Malta, have used the pandemic as a basis to reinforce hostile migration policies, while other countries like Italy and Spain used the pandemic as a basis to carry out regularisation procedures for certain categories of irregular migrants within their countries, especially those working in &#x2018;essential sectors&#x2019;. The pandemic has exacerbated salient and often ignored failures of migration governance within and between Europe and third countries. This has also influenced the work of the migration programme. Simultaneously the value of mobility and the contributions migrants make in host societies have been apparent throughout the pandemic resulting in opportunities for progressive migration policies.ECDPM has established a relevant niche on migration by playing on some of its strengths:a) Concentrating on EU/EU member state international cooperation policies, EU-AU and Europe-Africa processes in which ECDPM has a particular track record (e.g. EU-Africa institutional relations and frameworks, EU - Organisation of African, Caribbean and Pacific States (OACPS) partnership, EU seven-year budget, Policy coherence for sustainable development) and focusing on migration within theseb) Looking at migration from a development perspective in the context of Europe-Africa relationsc) Combining different thematic areas in which ECDPM already engages (e.g. food security, private sector and peace and security) with migration.To some extent, we have managed this and have received positive feedback as well as follow-up demands, requests to present our work and provide evidence and inputs, invitations to join tenders (e.g. for evaluations etc.), which showed that our target audiences and institutional funders perceive us as credible contributors. ECDPM institutional partners also identify migration as one of the strategic priorities and increasingly our funders turn to ECDPM on this topic. Over the reporting period, there has been high interest and demand for our work by EU institutions, EU member states, civil society and networks. We have provided inputs into processes of our institutional partners (e.g. Belgian Ministry of Foreign Affairs) and also informed positions taken by parliamentary groups, NGOs and foundations.Given the wider societal interest in migration and an increasing amount of fake news in the public discourse, we continued to invest more time in reaching a slightly wider audience than the usual more technical policy community on migration and development issues (e.g. actors working on domestic affairs, private sector). Most of our work aimed to balance narratives around migration and mobility and provide various perspectives in the context of often politicised debates. Migration and migrants indeed tend to be increasingly used as scapegoats for political gain. Yet, migration and mobility can stimulate development as drivers of social and economic change &#x2013; this is the type of discussion that we aim to foster.The team has also engaged more with a range of different players affecting or shaping EU external action and its implementation. For instance with DG NEAR and DG Home (Needs Assessment West Africa (https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/sites/homeaffairs/files/dr0618306n_en.pdf); through our cross-thematic work on private sector and migration (https://ecdpm.org/publications/mapping-private-sector-engagement-migration-cycle-full-report/) given EU member states&#x2019; increasing focus on working with private actors in international cooperation, including in the field of migration; and through the involvement of interior ministries in workshops and discussions facilitated by the ECDPM migration team. Given that migration is one of the areas where internal factors have had a great influence, achieving some of our outlined objectives made this a necessity.We also continued our work on the use of development aid (and ODA) in the context of EU migration cooperation. For instance, the team contributed with analysis on migration in the Multiannual Financial Framework 2021-2027 (https://ecdpm.org/publications/migration-next-eu-long-term-budget-key-choices-external-action/) and provided timely information during the negotiation process to the Danish MFA (see internal paper sent to the Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs in February 2019 after their specific demand (accessible on request)) in order to help inform their positioning. This work not only enabled us to provide a balanced narrative for migration-related spending for the next seven years, but also to engage with various actors (OECD, NGOs) through briefings or webinars (that we moderated or where we presented our work) up until 2021. Similarly, throughout 2019-2020, we have received a number of follow-up invitations for the &#x201C;Making Waves study&#x201D; (https://ecdpm.org/publications/making-waves-irregular-migration-refugee-oda-europe/) of 2017, media requests (leading to radio interviews/quotes) and extensive feedback from policy-makers, NGOs and researchers about the continued usefulness and timeliness of the study.This wider engagement enabled us to build bridges between various players (including those beyond the development and migration fields), ensuring that insights gained from our research were widely shared and lessons learned were not lost. Our engagement contributed to reinforcing positive narratives around migration and development.We also sought to build bridges between different thematic areas and migration, as migration is a cross-cutting issue impacting and being impacted by various sectoral policies. Since ECDPM is working on several of them, part of our efforts have been to connect topics such as food security (https://ecdpm.org/publications/nexus-between-food-nutrition-security-and-migration/), trade and private sector engagement (https://ecdpm.org/publications/mapping-private-sector-engagement-migration-cycle/), gender (https://ecdpm.org/publications/promoting-gender-eu-external-response-migration-trust-fund-africa/) as well as peace and security (https://ecdpm.org/publications/tackling-the-triggers-of-violence-induced-displacement-apsa-aga/) with migration. For example, in 2019, after discussions with the Migration team of the Swiss Development Cooperation (SDC), we invested efforts to promote public-private cooperation in the different phases of the migration cycle (https://ecdpm.org/publications/mapping-private-sector-engagement-migration-cycle-full-report/) and in support of the Global Compact for Migration. While there is already growing cooperation between public and private actors in the field of migration, we observed that donors seeking to engage with private actors still face a number of challenges and have questions. We therefore produced an overview mapping (https://ecdpm.org/publications/mapping-private-sector-engagement-migration-cycle/) with concentrated information on the different interests and challenges and entry points for cooperation between public and private actors in engagement areas along the migration cycle. We have discussed this mapping and guide so far with Swiss actors (SDC and the State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO), both in Bern and in field offices) and published it in 2020. Throughout 2020, we engaged with various actors on different aspects of the study and have received valuable feedback from donors on the relevance and comprehensive nature of the study. For example, in April 2020, we presented the mapping study to the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs. A webinar involving the private sector, migration and development organisations and donors will be organised in May 2021. As this is a new area for ECDPM, this overview guide also provides us with entry points to dig deeper and to enter more concrete processes working with both public and private actors.These pieces of work connecting different policy areas to migration point to trade-offs and challenges, with the aim to contribute to making well-informed choices and strengthening coherence between different fields. Combined with the engagement with different types of actors that look at migration from different perspectives, we not only contributed to more balanced narratives but also to policies that are more integrated and coherent as a result, understanding migration as a complex phenomenon and not following a single, narrow narrative. Yet, migration is also a highly political field and the direct influence of think tanks (especially ECDPM, which does not engage in strong lobbying) to change narratives and strengthen integrated policy-making clearly has its limits.Following up on our work carried out during 2017-2018, we wanted to dig deeper and understand the impact in practice of changes in EU migration and development policy in the EU&#x2019;s partner countries. We contributed to two evaluations between 2017 and 2020, together with partner organisations in consortia, which focused on EU-funded programmes in the area of migration: a) Dutch-funded real-time learning evaluation of the Regional Development and Protection Programme in the Horn of Africa (2017-2021; ongoing) and b) European Commission-funded evaluation of EU External Action Support in the Area of Migration (2019-2021; ongoing). The work on these evaluations has been relevant and timely. Though still ongoing, the Regional Development and Protection Programme real-time evaluation already provided direct inputs to the Regional Development and Protection Programme Steering Committee and its strategic decisions and provided information to the EU Delegations and implementing partners in the various Horn of Africa countries. The EU evaluation of External Action Support in the Area of Migration will provide inputs into the new programming cycle of external action resources (in which migration plays a larger role) and its terms of reference have been discussed at the highest level of the EU Commission. These two evaluations also provide lessons learned and aim to point out how policies relate to realities on the ground and how they can be better implemented or adjusted.Since 2018, we have extensively engaged with one of our institutional donors, the Belgian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, on their journey to devise a whole-of-government approach to migration, which fits well with our objective to discuss trade-offs and support a good balance in EU and EU member states approaches to migration. Already in 2018/19, we supported the Ministry of Foreign Affairs through an analysis of viewpoints of different stakeholders on a whole-of-government approach (Belgian ministries and agencies) as well as an analysis of lessons from integrated and whole-of-government-type approaches in Germany, the Netherlands, Canada and Switzerland. This work provided useful insights also for other EU member states. Utilising our analysis as input, we facilitated a whole-day seminar for various relevant Belgian stakeholders to come closer to a common approach and bridge some existing divides between ministries. From the workshop emerged the recommendation for the Belgian Ministry of Foreign Affairs to adopt a strategy on migration and development and we engaged in follow-up support to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the process of drafting this new strategy. We worked on this input in 2019 and 2020 accompanying their strategy drafting process (outputs as part of this work are not published but can be accessed internally).In 2020, the Swedish Ministry of Foreign Affairs asked ECDPM to explore and analyse the issues of return and sustainable reintegration from a development cooperation and aid effectiveness perspective. We published the study (https://ecdpm.org/wp-content/uploads/Sustainable-Development-Approach-Return-Reintegration-Dilemmas-Choices-Possibilities-ECDPM-Discussion-Paper-291-2020-1.pdf) early 2021 and presented it in a roundtable organised by the Swedish Ministry of Foreign Affairs including representatives from the Swedish Ministry of Justice, Sida &#x2013; the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency, and the Swedish Migration Agency. This allowed us to inform the Swedish approach to return and reintegration as well as advance whole-of-government discussions on the topic. We received very positive feedback from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on our contribution to these internal discussions.Several of our outputs highlight interests, political economy factors and possible opportunities or entry points to overcome adverse factors (examples include the project on the political economy of dynamics of regional organisations in Africa (https://ecdpm.org/publications/au-migration-governance-non-aligned-views-migration-governance-africa/), work on North Africa (https://ecdpm.org/dossiers/changing-relations-europe-north-africa/).Our work on North Africa (https://ecdpm.org/dossiers/changing-relations-europe-north-africa/) included a study of the asylum, reception and migrant protection systems in Morocco, Tunisia, Algeria and Egypt (https://ecdpm.org/publications/protecting-migrants-refugees-in-north-africa-challenges-opportunities-reform/) to understand some of the dynamics driving or preventing reform of these systems and propose some initial entry points for international cooperation. This was timely and relevant given the increasing focus on better cooperation on the topic of migration and the political pressure for EU states to increase engagement. These efforts may not directly result in specific changes in policy outcomes, yet they can contribute to an improved understanding of complex African migration realities and how these relate to drivers important for successful implementation of policy approaches.The paper and its case studies were presented to the Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs as well as Danish embassies in the respective countries, and we were invited to brief the Middle East and North Africa working group of the European Asylum Support Office (EASO) as well as the Danish embassy in Cairo. The paper was widely shared within the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the European Commission and EU Agencies (EASO, Frontex). The UNHCR Special Envoy for the Central Mediterranean Route reportedly recommended the paper to many colleagues.We received very positive feedback on the usefulness of such analysis and have contributed to increased knowledge and improved understanding of policy-makers of the risks and opportunities of their choices The relevance of our work is demonstrated by the many requests for briefings to present our work, as well as our presence in strategic meetings with decision-makers or implementers.Given the European interest in the topic, there has been a stronger pull to work on the European side than a strong and consistent demand from African actors for ECDPM&#x2019;s work on migration. The team found opportunities to support the work of EU actors, as well as to a lesser extent inform African actors about the EU. Yet, playing a direct role in informing processes of African actors on migration and their cooperation policies with the EU has been more difficult, especially as concerns African institutions. Nevertheless, a number of important interactions took place, especially as we have increasingly reached out to build networks with African researchers and policy makers on migration. One team member has in 2019 been part of two fellowship groups and networks &#x2013; the Merian Institute for Advanced Studies in Africa (https://www.ug.edu.gh/mias-africa/interdisciplinary-fellow-group-%E2%80%98migration-mobility-and-forced-displacement%E2%80%99) and the Migration and International Law in Africa, the Middle East &amp;amp; Turkey (https://portal.research.lu.se/portal/en/projects/migration-and-international-law-in-africa-the-middle-east--turkey-milamet-research-networkreseau-de-recherche-migration-et-droit-international-en-afrique-au-moyen-orient-et-en-turquie-mediamot(409d801f-2fc9-49a1-a618-275566d690c3).html) &#x2013; which led to stronger cooperation with African researchers, including inputs in our work and invitations to participate in meetings and webinars hosted by African researchers. Another team member contributed to a book project initiated by the University of Pretoria (published by Routledge in 2021) and presented at conferences in Pretoria and Johannesburg (https://ecdpm.org/events/implementation-un-global-compact/) on migration in the Europe-Africa context, engaging with African policymakers and researchers.Our research has also focused on relevant themes in African migration. We have examined the effects of externalisation of EU policies (https://ecdpm.org/talking-points/crafting-african-response-european-external-migration-policies/) on migration and development in African countries (https://brussels.fes.de/fileadmin/public/editorfiles/events/2020/Q3/201012_Final_CE_FES_Policy_brief__The_impact_of_EU_external_migration_policies_on_sustainable_development_.pdf), and spoken severally on this topic in different forums, including the State of the Arts Conference organised by the Dutch Ministry of Justice and Security. Our research on the effects of externalisation in African countries has contributed to the ongoing discussions on externalisation and conditionalities in EU migration policy programming and migration governance with third countries. Actors we have engaged with in our discussions through webinars and roundtables include European and African policy makers, European and African civil society organisations, researchers and academia. We have also examined the migration between Africa and the Gulf Cooperation and Middle East countries (https://ecdpm.org/publications/regional-solutions-regulating-recruitment-protection-african-migrant-workers-gulf-middle-east/), proposing recommendations on how regional organisations can address the current challenges faced by migrants along that route. With our work on Somalia, we were able to shed light on the complexities of migration and displacement in the Horn of Africa and propose solutions towards building a national migration governance system. We have received positive feedback from the African Union colleagues in the Department of Social Affairs and several Regional Economic Communities, including ECOWAS and IGAD, on the relevance and usefulness of our analysis in shedding light on the complexities of African migration. Intra African migration is very important for African countries as the bulk of migratory movements still occur within the continent, between regions and with neighbouring countries. There are several legal instruments and policies that provide the African Union (AU), Regional Economic Communities (RECs) and the member states with guidance on migration governance. These policies focus on migration and development and promoting labour mobility in the context of the AU&#x2019;s Agenda 2063.In view of this, our research has focused on migration and development in Africa. For example, we have examined the status of free movement in West Africa (https://ecdpm.org/publications/free-movement-west-africa-juxtapositions-divergent-interests/) together with colleagues from a project funded by the Mercator Dialogue on Asylum and Migration (MEDAM). Our work also aims to explore the opportunities for labour mobility in the context of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) (https://ecdpm.org/talking-points/connecting-people-markets-africa-2021/). This research involved collaboration with a wide range of actors including African based academia. For example, in the MEDAM research, we participated in the consultation meeting held in Accra with representatives of the academia, civil society and policy makers. Also, the report fed into the larger MEDAM research project which was presented in Brussels to European policy makers. For the research on labour mobility in the context of the AfCFTA, we raised the attention of policy makers at the AU and African RECs to the current issue of compartmentalising trade liberalisation and free movement of persons.However, migration in Africa also occurs in the context of fragility and conflicts, resulting in forced displacement. Consequently, our work has aimed to provide an insight into the dynamic nature of intra-African migration in response to exogenous changes including conflicts, pandemics and climate-related crises.Moreover, our work on the real-time Regional Development and Protection Programme impact evaluation (https://ecdpm.org/publications/regional-development-protection-programme-rdpp) meant that we conducted research on the perceptions of migrants and refugees in case study countries which contributed to the inclusion of their voices into information, which we fed back to implementers of programmes and policy-makers, so indirectly supporting more inclusive processes.We have included gender analysis in our workstream through a dedicated publication on gender inclusion in the EU response to migration through the EU Trust Fund for Africa (https://ecdpm.org/publications/promoting-gender-eu-external-response-migration-trust-fund-africa/). We were invited to present this work in the EU Practitioner&apos;s network migration working group where it was appreciated.A key contribution to the European Commission Evaluation on &#x2018;External Action on migration&#x2019; has been the role as gender focal point injecting gender-sensitive evaluation approach and methodology. We have more recently contributed to the European Commission-funded Evaluation of the EU Gender Action Plan II, which helped feed the deliberations for the EU Gender Action Plan III.These various outputs have helped us to better integrate gender in our work and will serve as useful inputs for our future work, allowing us to ensure that gender issues are considered in our research.</narrative>
