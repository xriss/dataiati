   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The key ECDPM impact areas that this work stream refers to are a) effective international cooperation frameworks; b) accountable institutions engaged citizens; and c) sustainable economic transformation with shared prosperity.ECDPM will seek to contribute to, including:1: Governance changes: Policymakers in resource-rich countries design and implement desirable and feasible industrial and diversification policies, based on  politically sensitive, informed and evidence-based research and cross-country experiences of success and failures as well as public-private dialogue. Particular attention will be given to artisanal small scale mining (ASM), which is a major source of employment in the extractive sector..2: Changes at the implementation level: Local actors (local institutions, private sector, civil society organisations etc.) are better equipped to address concerns related to the governance of natural resources, including through multi-stakeholder partnerships. ECDPM will accompany local actors to effectively participate in and implement resource-based industrialisation and development, notably in ASM..&#x2028;&#x2028;3: Changes in European support strategies: Assist development partners, particularly in Europe, in adopting a more systematic and effective approach to support resource-based policies and strategies in Africa including the sustainability dimension of resources, industrialisation questions, private sector engagement and support to local communities, notably in ASM. This would be informed by analysing the (socio-economic as well as political) context in which the resource sector finds itself so that strategies are devised that are best-suited to the local realities and feasible than simply adopting good frameworks and practices.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">1. Contextualisation and importance     Many developing countries are rich in natural resources. As a result, they have traditionally been exporters of raw commodities, too often leading to commodity dependence and rent-seeking economies, and a source of corruption and conflicts. Efforts towards sustainable economic transformation over the last two decades has focused the attention on economic diversification and industrialisation opportunities. To avoid the common resource curse, endeavours towards improved governance and resource-based industrialisation have been pursued, in Africa (notably along the African Mining Vision) and by donors. In parallel, greater attention to political economy dynamics is needed to understand the underlying interests and resistance to reforms and transformation. While local context matters, sectoral differences (e.g. mining, oil, gas) also matter, as well as the diversity within sectors. For instance, while resource-based industrialisation tends to focus on large scale industrial mining and their linkages to the rest of the economy, artisanal small-scale mining (ASM) also play an important role in the economy of some countries, in terms of employment and economic opportunities (e.g. ASM in the gold sector occupies about 10 to 15 million gold miners worldwide, including 4.5 million women and 600,000 children, and account for about 17&#x2013;20% of the gold produced globally). Yet, in spite of reform processes, huge challenges remain, with the IMF recently stressing (in the Sub-Saharan Africa Regional Economic Outlook of April 2019) that for most resource-intensive African countries, economic growth and improvements in living standards will be slower than in most other African countries.     2. Contributions made to the main changes envisaged     1) Governance changes: Policymakers in resource-rich countries design and implement desirable and feasible industrial and diversification policies, based on politically sensitive, informed and evidence-based research and cross-country experiences of success and failures     ECDPM has engaged in research supporting evidence-based policy processes and solutions related to natural resource extraction and trading, with a particular focus in mining (gold), for more inclusive governance at national, sub-national and international levels. The aim is to inform stakeholders and identify more transformative dynamics, notably in territorial development and industrialisation, involving mining companies and the business community, civil society, state actors and development partners. Building on our past work and experience, we have pursued different paths.     We have engaged with the ECOWAS Secretariat and building on their regional industrial agenda, which included cement as one of the key promising sectors, we have conducted a (market and political) analysis (&#x2018;Regional markets, politics and value chains: The case of West African cement&#x2019;) of that key sector in West Africa in terms of value addition to low-value minerals, construction sector employment, and high levels of public spending. The analysis, which stressed the lack of competition of the cement market in West Africa and the related vested interested which may hamper the ECOWAS industrial ambitions in that sector, also fed into the ACP-UNDP process on fostering strategies for development minerals (which includes low-value minerals for cement).     We have also engaged in the economic and political dynamics of artisanal small-scale mining (ASM), with a focus on the gold sector. We have started by identifying key lessons (&#x2018;Artisanal gold mining in DRC: Time to get down to earth?&#x2019;) for ASM reforms and linkages, drawing from the experience of the Democratic Republic of Congo. Building on our participation to various mining related events, we have then engaged on a multi-stakeholder forum (&#x2018;Capitalizing on experiences for future actions: contributions of development partners to sustainable artisanal and small-scale mining&#x2019;) organised together the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC), which aimed to capitalizing on the experiences of development partners to ASM for future actions. On this basis, we have started to engage, in partnership with SDC, on transformation and governance dynamics of ASM in Burkina Faso. Drawing on SDC interventions in the field of &#x201C;governance and democracy&#x201D; and &#x201C;local socio-economic development&#x201D;, the aim is to help identify inclusive intervention options for all stakeholders and support from SDC, based on a political economy understanding of ASM in Burkina, unpacking the systemic linkages between ASM and other economic sectors, at the local and national level, in particular with the agricultural sector, with a view to foster the development of responsible sourcing options in the small-scale gold sector. This multi-annual project is still at an initial phase.     ECDPM has also contributed to facilitate and inform the process towards a multi-stakeholder platform on responsible mining for development initiated by the International Group of Mining Companies (IGMC), an informal coalition of four major resource companies, Anglo American, BHP Billiton, Glencore and Rio Tinto. These have included closed-door and public events and meetings, including at the European Development Days, and publication of an article. The process has not yet come to fruition yet.     Besides the publication on several papers and articles, an issue of ECDPM GREAT Insights magazine has been dedicated to mining for development.     In parallel, ECDPM has addressed the related issue of illicit financial flows commonly associated to the extractive sector and commodity trading, starting to document experiences in Tanzania.     2) Changes at the implementation level: Local actors (local institutions, private sector, civil society organisations etc.) are better equipped to address concerns related to the governance of natural resources. ECDPM will accompany local actors to effectively participate in and implement resource-based industrialisation.&#x2028;     We have been searching for pertinent and sustainable entry points to engage with local actors, and have identified two main opportunities on which we engaged on.     The first one has been to participate in the assessment, selection and follow up peer reviewing of research projects on the development dimension on natural resources (and notably illicit financial flows), as part of the Swiss Programme for Research on Global Issues for Development (r4d programme), a joint funding initiative by the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC) and the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF).     The other has been in the context of our partnership with SDC in ASM in Burkina in the project described above.     3) Changes in EU support strategies: Development partners to support resource-based policies and strategies in Africa. This includes that development partners take a more systematic approach to the sustainability dimension of resources, industrialisation questions and support to local communities     ECDPM has been engaged in the European discussions on the governance of the extractive sector and responsible mining. Building on our work on private sector engagement with civil society and multi-stakeholder partnerships, we have focused on the European Partnership for Responsible Minerals (EPRM), a multi-stakeholder initiative designed as an &#x201C;accompanying measure&#x201D; to the EU Conflict Minerals Regulation, adopted in 2017 and which will enter into force in 2021. We engaged with the EPRM to help them identify the main drivers for actors to join the partnership as well as the opportunity to enhance the effectiveness of the partnership and potentially grow. We also published a paper (&#x2018;Responsibly sourcing minerals from conflict-affected and high-risk areas: Lessons from the European Partnership for Responsible Minerals&#x2019;) drawing more general lessons from the EPRM experience for partnerships for responsible mining.     This was also complemented by the ECDPM Consultation roundtable (&#x2018;Consultation roundtable on the Responsible Gold Mining Principles&#x2019;) and report on the Responsible Gold Mining Principles (see www.ecdpm.org/events/responsible-gold-mining-principles/), aimed at gathering inputs and comments from experts and stakeholders on the initial draft Responsible Gold Mining Principles produced by the World Gold Council,  and which have now been adopted (see www.gold.org/about-gold/gold-supply/responsible-gold/responsible-gold-mining-principles).     In parallel, we also contributed to the debate on the types and causes of illicit financial flows and efforts to combat them, both in Europe and in Africa, stressing the (lack of) coherence of measures and policies to address them in the context of commodity extraction and trading. The resulting paper (&#x2018;Understanding illicit financial flows and efforts to combat them in Europe and Africa&#x2019;) was widely read and informed policy makers, notably in the context of Europe-Africa relations.     3. Did you consider gender issues during the process of engagement?     The gender dimension has been mainstreamed in our approach, notably in the context of ASM. it was also the focus of a dedicated article in our GREAT Insight magazine on mining for development (see www.ecdpm.org/great-insights/mining-for-development/african-mining-employment-womens-empowerment/) and in a session of our ASM Forum with SDC.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">ECDPM continues to engage with stakeholders to inform debates around artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM). Under an agreement with the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC) in Burkina Faso, ECDPM was approached to provide analysis of the ASM sector in the country and engage in a participatory process to influence policy and interventions. Focusing on one country allows to bring out the underlying complexities in terms of the different actors and factors involved when looking at the sector. To this end, a background paper (unpublished) was produced to appreciate the wide range of actors involved in this largely informal activity with varied interests. To make the analysis relevant for a development partner like SDC, a discussion paper (https://ecdpm.org/fr/publications/encadrer-artisanat-minier-burkina-faso-approche-contextualisee/) was produced laying out considerations that influence key pillars where development partners provide support, so that interventions can be appropriately designed. These key pillars of engagement include formalisation processes, the use of technology, governance, and commercialisation. A third note (https://ecdpm.org/publications/understanding-use-trade-toxic-chemicals-artisanal-gold-mining-case-burkina-faso/) looks closer at initiatives to bring in social and environmental sustainability, especially by reducing the use of mercury in ASM operations through e.g. standards and certification, as well as regional harmonisation of measures in order to suggest ways forward.In the different outputs special attention was given to the governance aspects of artisanal gold mining. ECDPM staff traveled to Burkina Faso to appreciate some of the nuances in terms of how the activity is governed. It was found that while formal rules and regulations may be lacking, or even flouted, there are informal governance mechanisms which can either be built upon to get a buy-in from miners themselves, and better govern this sector to maximise benefits and mitigate its social and environmental costs. Several local actors, especially in the civil society, have been active in this space and their reflections were valuable in outlining some of the opportunities and challenges in the sector. Involvement of these actors in setting the rules of engagement in the sector will be essential. It was underlined in the different ECDPM studies on ASM in Burkina Faso that despite being a significant driver of economic activity and poverty reduction, the sector was neglected and marginalised, while large-scale mining was instead prioritised. Even as efforts are now underway to better govern this activity, this does not easily supplant the mistrust of the state among actors in artisanal gold mining space given past experiences. These factors need to be carefully assessed before their eventual success of governance efforts can be assessed. Inclusion of local actors and institutions at deconcentrated levels, who have most been in touch with realities on the ground, is essential and should be accompanied by capacity building.The next step of the collaboration with SDC in Burkina Faso, of engaging in a policy process in the country, however has not been achieved. This was due to unforeseen circumstances related to the deteriorating security situation in Burkina Faso and the effects of the unfolding pandemic. Engaging in such a process has its limitations when done remotely. It was under these circumstances that the decision to produce another briefing note, mentioned above, was taken following consultations with the SDC. It is important to ensure that the &#x201C;carrots&#x201D; used in interventions to bring about sustainability in artisanal mining, e.g. through certification and so on, are indeed seen as such by the miners themselves. As eventual beneficiaries of these measures, miners will only engage when the perceived benefits outweigh costs, which currently does not seem to be the case. This is pointed out in the briefing note published, mentioned above. The way forward to bring sustainable development through this activity should ideally be for stakeholders to consider ASM through the prism of economic development and poverty reduction, rather than simply a mining issue. This requires finding a good-fit in terms of existing institutional capacities, trust-building skills and relations between the different actors rather than relying solely on bringing in best practices from around the world.These policy research outputs will contribute towards better design of development policy. In particular the discussion paper served as one of the inputs for the new programme by the SDC. Moreover, the relevance of this work goes beyond the engagements with SDC alone. By looking at the sustainability (standards and certification) and regional (interests and incentives of players) dynamics of artisanal gold mining, this study also feeds into other workstreams of the Centre. It also serves as a building block for other work that the Centre is doing on illicit trade and smuggling in West African transport corridors for the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Gender dimensions are important in ASM in that a significant proportion of the labour force engaged in this activity are women. Health hazards related to the activity also affect women given that they tend to be engaged in the processing phase of gold mining which includes working with toxic chemicals like mercury and cyanide. On the other hand, given the existing inequalities in terms of access to land tenure, or finance, women may be at risk not enjoying the benefits of formalisation. These dimensions have been, and will be, pointed out in previous, and upcoming, works.</narrative>
