  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The overarching change we try to contribute to is a food system transformation, towards more sustainable food systems (SFS). Our contribution is geared mostly towards the achievement of sustainable food systems in Africa and the effective support to such processes from European public and private sectors. Specifically, our desired changes can be clustered in three levels: More sustainable food systems outcomes (in terms of economic, social and environmental sustainability, including food and nutrition security) through the formulation of more coherent and integrated policies and interventions, by applying the food system approach/analytical tools within relevant policy processes and among key stakeholder groups at the local, national and international level in Africa and Europe. Clearer conceptual and methodological frameworks underpinning a food system approach (FSA) &#x2018;community of practice&#x2019;, in the emerging field of FSA/analysis, in combination with Political Economy Analysis (PEA). Our contributions will be provided through: participating in the emerging FSA &#x2018;community of practice&#x2019;; and an empirical testing of the approach in selected case studies (in doing so, we aim to better inform actors by providing context-relevant and realistic analyses). Global processes and institutions, such as the UN Food &amp; Agriculture Rome-Based Agencies (RBAs), better reflect the interconnectedness of food systems with climate change, health, trade, biodiversity, etc. Our contributions will be provided by feeding our &#x2018;conceptual and methodological&#x2019; as well as our &#x2018;policy processes&#x2019; work to such global processes and institutions (thus also contributing to the global debate around the Sustainable Development Goals). Adopting the ECDPM&#x2019;s multi-level-governance angle, it is important to engage global actors and processes also for their contribution to improving the effectiveness of the relevant Europe-Africa frameworks. The main impact areas our work tries to contribute to are 4. Sustainable Economic Transformation and 1. Effective international cooperation frameworks. In terms of outcomes, the transformation towards SFS requires: I. Informed actors, i.e. actors that understand the interconnections and emerging properties of food systems (including correlated challenges, potential synergies and trade-offs) so that synergistic interventions can be formulated; II. Inclusive dialogue and processes and VI. Effective multi-actor partnerships - for example through multi-stakeholder platforms - because there are knowledge gaps on parts of the food system (particularly informal ones), and because systemic change requires buy-in of many stakeholders. Also, multi-actor partnerships are best placed to coordinate action and monitor impact among a high number of stakeholders. III. Coherent and integrated policies, i.e. given interconnectedness of food systems, making the link between food-related policy processes in different policy domains (food and nutrition security, agricultural and rural development, climate/environment, trade etc.) is key for increased coherence and integration of policy objectives and outcomesIV. Reduced policy-implementation gap, i.e. identifying horizontal and vertical coordination challenges and policy blockages (e.g. through PEA) for effective implementation of policies.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">1. Context and relevance           World hunger has been increasing over the last three years, reaching levels equal to those of almost a decade ago. This is also due to the growing climate variability and extremes, causing severe food crises especially in Africa, the continent with the worst undernourishment. And yet undernutrition coexists with obesity, on the rise also in low income countries. This shows that our food systems are inefficient and unsustainable: they are depleting our resources and polluting the globe, while not properly nourishing two thirds of the world&#x2019;s population and generating income inequality. For food systems to simultaneously serve the needs of the Planet, People and Profit, availability and consumption of diverse and nutritious foods should urgently increase. It is therefore important to work towards more Sustainable Food Systems which is the overarching change this workstream aims to contribute to. Although initially three specific changes were foreseen, we have revised them in 2017/2018 to the following two changes: 1) Food-related policy processes in Africa (and support to them from Europe and globally) contribute to improvements in economic, social and environmental sustainability of local, national and international food systems (i.e. strengthening their nutritional, food security, ecosystem and resilience outcomes over time).2) Global organisations such as the UN Rome-based Agencies and global public-private initiatives adopt a more politically and commercially realistic and inclusive approach to trade, investment and public-private partnerships within the food systems policies and processes.  We revised the changes we work towards, as, soon after starting this workstream, we realised that both conceptually and in terms of the policy processes to be supported, economic, social and environmental sustainability of food systems should be looked at and worked towards simultaneously, rather than as separate areas of work.           2. Our contributions to improving the role of food-related policy processes in Africa towards food systems sustainability           First of all we have supported the increased focus on more sustainable food systems (SFS) within food-related policy processes in Africa by promoting and testing therein the so called food system approach. After decades of policies, investments and donor support centred around &#x2018;traditional&#x2019; agriculture and rural development and later value chain specific approaches approaches, a momentum is emerging from international policy circles and innovative local stakeholders (e.g. certain units of the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation; the International Panel of Experts on Sustainable Food Systems; Wageningen University; consumer organisations and municipal food policy councils in Africa) to take a broader food system approach. The food system approach (FSA) aims to simultaneously meet the needs of society, economy and environment over time by improving all activities and outcomes that relate to the production, processing, distribution, and consumption of food. However, there is still widespread uncertainty about what such FSA exactly entails. We have contributed to clarifying this, both conceptually and practically, in the context of various initiatives and processes related to food-related policies in Africa. The result of our efforts (combined with similar efforts by other stakeholders) is that many food system issues are now considered, both by actors, and in relevant initiatives and processes. This increases the chance that FSA will be adopted in the respective undertakings. Conceptually we have helped clarifying the importance of taking an FSA and addressing simultaneously the economic, social and environmental sustainability of food systems through a series of publications. These include a special issue of the ECDPM GREAT Insights Magazine about SFS with views and vision of key European, African and international stakeholders including the Italian Minister of Agriculture and the African Union Commissioner for Agriculture. Leading professors in important food-related European Universities (e.g. London and Wageningen) and managers of international organisations (e.g. International Institute for Environment and Development and Bioversity International) who also serve as advisors to several UN bodies and African governments, as well as the AU Commissioner herself, gave us written feedback about the importance of this GREAT Insights issue, in clarifying the issues at stake which would also help them promote the FSA in their work and policy processes. Moreover, we published a study on &quot;Options and Opportunities to Make Food Value Chains More Environmentally Sustainable and Resilient in Africa&quot; that will be used also as part of the training packages implemented by the Global Environment Facility (the largest international fund that addresses global environmental issues). All this helped increasing the potential for these and other organisations, and the food-related processes and initiatives they lead in Africa, to work towards more sustainable food systems.  We similarly contributed to raise the profile of the FSA in food-related policy processes by making the multidimensionality of SFS policies and the need to act on all dimensions simultaneously a central part of our brokering, facilitating, advisory and partnership-building work. We helped (partly) change the focus of certain major international conferences and policy dialogues, and explained the FSA to important public and private decision-makers. In the changed focus we favour the expansion of the policy and investment processes these actors regularly shape from an exclusive focus on agriculture to food systems and to economic-social-environmental sustainability. We contributed to a more SFS-sensitive programme of the Global Conference on Climate Smart Agriculture. This Conference has been recognised as a key milestone for the &#x2018;agriculture and climate&#x2019; global debates and was organised in its 4th edition in November 2017 by a major African continental development agency and the most important agriculture universities worldwide. Initially the Conference programme did not stress sufficiently the diversification and SFS issues, beyond climate challenges. ECDPM offered to be a member of the Scientific Steering Committee and organised two sessions of the Global Conference. One session was on Policies, the other one on Biodiversity. ECDPM and others could thus put forward the FSA for discussion and consequently facilitated inclusion of the related recommendations in the Conference Outcome Document that will be the basis for the discussions at the 5th edition of the Conference.ECDPM also invested in making SFS part of the Food First Conference. Every three years, this conference brings together all key agriculture stakeholders in Dutch-Africa relations. While it was organised along more &#x2018;traditional&#x2019; agriculture and rural development and value chain approaches, ECDPM facilitated a panel in the plenary about SFS (&#x201C;Sustainable food systems and agripreneurship: what role for the AU-EU Partnership and Climate Funds?&#x201D;). In this panel, we drew from our own work and asked to the Directors General of Bioversity International and the CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS), Dutch and African representatives of public and private sectors about how their organisations could practically contribute to SFS. This was highly appreciated by many of the 400 participants, also since the official review of the &#x2018;Dutch food security policy 2012 - 2016&#x2019; called for more holistic approaches that consider the food system as a whole.  Practical contributions of our work to help food-related policy processes in Africa better supporting food systems sustainability are starting to emerge from our &#x201C;Sustainable Agrifood Systems Strategies&#x201D; (SASS) project in East Africa. This 3 million euro consortium with four Italian universities led by ECDPM for 2 years is aimed at identifying and supporting SASS. ECDPM has put the FSA at the centre of SASS, starting from the design of our multidisciplinary research and policy dialogue activities. We see SASS as a concrete application and test of the FSA. The SASS project is implemented in a context where it is very early to be able to conclude that the FSA is more effective than the more &#x2018;traditional&#x2019; agriculture and rural development and value chain approaches, to tackle economic, social and environmental sustainability together. For this reason, we focus on a subset of challenges within the food system at a context specific level in East Africa. Currently, we test the opportunity to increase food system sustainability by better integrating indigenous vegetables (i.e. informal value chains, less served by infrastructure, policies and international support) with more formal food value chains that are widely supported (including by research and policy, both nationally and internationally). Given that Wageningen University is one of the most important agricultural universities in the world, the invitation to present SASS as one of only four case studies of FSA operationalisations during the August 2018 Centennial Conference of the Wageningen University can be considered as a first result in terms of contributing to more awareness about the importance of improving the role of food-related policy processes in Africa towards food systems sustainability. SASS also generated interest among a broad range of stakeholders in Kenya and Tanzania: national and local governments, researchers, donors, farmers and other private-sector entities participate both in our research activities and in the identification of integrated policies and investments for the diversification and sustainability of food value chains, expressing their willingness to use the results of SASS for their core business initiatives. A video interview with a Kenyan company processing the indigenous vegetables analysed by SASS and discussing such needed improvements was watched 540 times. In the case of Kenya, stakeholders involved in SASS discuss, amongst others, labels as a possible improvement, which recognises simultaneously the environmental, social and economic sustainability of indigenous vegetables (see our paper &#x201C;Making markets work for indigenous vegetables&#x201D;). In July 2018 the management of the Kenyan Ministry of Agriculture, through a formal letter, expressed interest for collaborating with SASS and FAO to launch such a labelling scheme in the near future. The SASS project will certainly pursue this partnership proposal which could be a great opportunity to concretely use the scientific results of SASS to define standards and labels explicitly targeting the environmental, social and economic sustainability of the local and national food systems.           3. Our contributions to improved coherence between global policies and processes on trade and investment and on food systems The influence we could have on the second change trajectory of this work-stream is more limited. This is mostly due to the fact that the integration of food systems sustainability as a key objective of food-related policy processes is in its infancy, as explained in the previous section, and therefore more time is needed before the debate on coherence between food system approaches and trade and investment can be taken up systematically in global policies and processes.Nonetheless, to contribute to such coherence debate we regularly engaged with global organisations, fora, and public-private initiatives like the UN FAO, the Committee on World Food Security and the Global Alliance on Climate Smart Agriculture (all based in Rome), putting forward the idea that they should adopt a more politically and commercially realistic and inclusive approach to trade, investment and public-private partnerships within their respective food-related policy processes. In this light, we consulted numerous stakeholders and participated in several policy dialogues and other events organised by such global organisations and initiatives to help frame the ongoing debates in Rome on how to use trade and investment for food security. As a result of these engagements, we identified three &#x2018;big picture divides and incommunicabilities&#x2019; that will underpin future decisions about food systems at global level in relation to the Profit part of SDGs. Firstly, these are divides between the WTO and global food bodies, and therefore between global trade and food policy; secondly between those who want the climate-food synergies (and the climate funds) to be about &#x2018;agriculture input intensification&#x2019; versus &#x2018;agroecology&#x2019;; and thirdly, between promoters of large-scale and mono-cropping investments versus small-scale and family-farming based investments. In all our brokering and partnership-building activities around the global food (and climate) agencies and initiatives in Rome, we call for more coherence between food, trade and investment initiatives, and give examples of how sustainability outcomes are likely to arise more from enhancing complementarities between the three divided policy processes and types of investments we identified, clarifying respective responsibilities and integrating them gradually, rather than by insisting on one of them only. Our calls for more coherence have not received very positive feedback yet, due not only to the low degree of maturity of this debate at international level, but also to the limited nature of our efforts. In future, we will formalise our ideas and contributions in this area through more structured outputs such as publications, targeted policy dialogue and partnership building, aimed at supporting the coherence between global policies and processes on trade and investment and on food systems.</narrative>
