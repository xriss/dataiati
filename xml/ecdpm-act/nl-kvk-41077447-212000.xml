       <narrative xml:lang="EN">1. Contextualisation and importance         Over the past two decades, illicit financial flows have emerged as a key issue for discussion in international taxation and development. The loss of trillions of resources for public use has become a matter of major concern everywhere, not least because it hinders the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals and reduces a country&#x2019;s domestic resources. In the context of our new multi-annual strategy, the Centre&#x2019;s African Institutions programme tried to deepen its engagement in the area of Domestic Resource Mobilization in Africa and Illicit Financial Flows. The work stream aims to contribute to the following changes:         1) contribute to develop regional standards around DRM, and improve governance in relation to Illicit Financial Flows (IFFs) in the extractives sector.         2) improve the knowledge of African actors about processes in the EU to tackle IFFs and thus enable them to identify possible areas of mutually beneficial dialogue.         3) promote with European policy makers that developmental concerns around IFFs are taken into consideration        2. Contributions made to each of the main changes envisaged        1) Efforts to develop regional standards around DRM, especially in relation to IFFs in the extractives sector         We know that the extractives sector is key to the fight against Illicit Financial Flows, as the sector has been identified numerous times as being one that loses out the most to such flows. But at what stage(s) of resource extraction are Illicit Financial Flows most prevalent, and what are areas in which partner country governments have begun to address IFFs? In order to answer that question the centre has embarked on two case studies, one in West Africa (Ghana) and the other in East Africa (Tanzania). The studies will look at issues of policy coherence, and that institutional and organisational arrangements to tackle IFFS. We will be looking at incentives of policymakers, and the interests of ruling elites in strengthening governance and state capabilities to effectively tackle Illicit Financial Flows. Due to budget constraints, we reduced the original scope.        2 and 3) African actors are well informed, and European policy makers take developmental impact of IFFs into account         Many European and African stakeholders have acknowledged the need for stronger political push and better policy implementation in addressing Illicit Financial Flows. This acknowledgement, however, is translated in often fragmented and uncoordinated actions, with sub-optimal effects. In order to stimulate the dialogue among key stakeholders the African Institutions programme produced a discussion paper that takes stock of policy dynamics and dilemmas in tackling Illicit Financial Flows. It also presented a number of policy recommendations for key stakeholders at both sides of the partnership.         While the necessity for future cooperation between the EU and Africa has been recognised by both sides, the programme has encountered difficulties in mobilising resources to continue to engage with these main stakeholders. Therefore, the African Institutions programme has re-adjusted its focus and has identified opportunities at a national level, i.e. in Tanzania to work with domestic non-state actors and public authorities on challenges related to domestic resource mobilisation. If the funding for this project comes through, there will be an exciting opportunity for working on this policy challenge. In order to mobilise the resources within the centre the work by African Institutions will be integrated with the Centre&#x2019;s programme dealing with political economy and regional dynamics, within an integrated programme on African Institutions and Reform Dynamics.</narrative>
