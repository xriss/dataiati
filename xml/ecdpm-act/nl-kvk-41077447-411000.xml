   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This work stream mainly contributes to the overall ECDPM impact areas to &#x201C;Effective international cooperation frameworks and tools for tackling global challenges&#x201D;, as well as &#x201C;Legitimate and accountable public institutions&#x201D; and &#x201C;sustainable economic transformation&#x201D; More specifically changes that are desired are therefore that:1) European financing for development is less fragmented and more coherent in its approach to the SDGs; in particular, International and Development Financing institutions (IFIs/DFIs), including development banks, and European ones in particular (EIB, EDFI, EBRD) are better connected and integrated in development cooperation tools of EU donors (i.e. among DFIs, DFI-donor agency, and at EU level) to foster the 2030 Agenda, including blending mechanisms to combine public and private resources.2) This would mean that a more coherent approach is taken at the European level to foster investment for greater development impact and harness risk mitigation mechanisms along the SDGs and to link European approaches to African ones, in an effort to also attract long term finance (i.e. mainly institutional financiers).3) Climate finance and other vertical funds are more effectively mobilised and enhance climate finance readiness (defined as the capacities of countries to plan for, access, deliver, and monitor and report on climate finance, both international and domestic, in ways that are catalytic and fully integrated with national development policies and the achievement of the SDGs), in particular for African countries, with the support of MDBs and DFIs (including African ones).</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">1. Contextualisation and importance             With the 2030 Agenda and Addis Ababa Action Agenda, greater attention is put on sustainable growth and private investment to achieve the SDGs. For development cooperation actors, one of the challenges is thus how best to leverage private finance for sustainable and inclusive development objectives, scaling up the volume and improving the effectiveness of blended finance, including public-private partnerships, notably in poorer and more fragile contexts. This has also become a major issue for the EU, which has been engaged in rethinking its financing architecture to that effect, as exemplified by its External Investment Plan. It also includes renewed attention to the roles and impacts of European Development Finance Institutions (DFIs) and Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs), such as the European Investment Bank (EIB) and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), as well as the World Bank Group/IFC and African Development Bank.      2. Contributions made to the main changes envisaged       1) European financing for development is less fragmented and more coherent in its approach to the SDGs; in particular, International and Development Financing institutions (IFIs/DFIs), including development banks, and European ones in particular (EIB, EDFI, EBRD) are better connected and integrated in development cooperation tools of EU donors (i.e. among DFIs, DFI-donor agency, and at EU level) to foster the 2030 Agenda, including blending mechanisms to combine public and private resources      Blended finance is the strategic use of development finance for the mobilisation of additional finance towards sustainable development in developing countries (OECD definition) and as such is a key means of implementation to achieve the SDGs. Yet, the challenge is to ensure that blended finance constitute an appropriate and effective use of public development finance, in the broader context of finance for development. In this respect, there is a range of experiences among financial institutions, in Europe and beyond.      Our work has been to contribute to a more coherent and effective approach to blended finance. We have engaged at two levels: international level and the European level.      On the international dimension, we have been an active member of the OECD-led Senior Advisory Group on blended finance, establishing a close cooperation with the OECD Secretariat and participating to OECD Coordination Meetings on advancing the Joint Agenda on Blended Finance (in Paris and Washington DC). This OECD-led international effort has led to the adoption in early 2018 of the OECD DAC Blended Finance Principles (http://www.oecd.org/development/financing-sustainable-development/blended-finance-principles/) and in October 2018 to the adoption of the Tri Hita Karana Roadmap for Blended Finance (http://www.oecd.org/dac/financing-sustainable-development/development-finance-topics/Tri-Hita-Karana-Roadmap-for-Blended-Finance.htm), which highlight shared values and action plan. ECDPM is also contributing to the development of OECD guidance on better practices to implement the blended finance principles, focusing on the blended finance principle on local context and ownership. In doing so, we are in contact with many MDBs and international think tanks.      On the European dimension, ECDPM has liaised with the key institutional actors involved in the European financing for external investment, including the European Commission, the European External Action Service, the European Parliament, some EU Member States, European Development Finance Institutions (DFIs), the European Investment Bank (EIB) and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), Agence fran&#xE7;aise de d&#xE9;veloppement (AFD) and KfW, as well as the World Bank Group. We have organised or contributed to numerous closed-door and public events and briefings, conducted some related training for European officials, and produced several publications.      2) This would mean that a more coherent approach is taken at the European level to foster investment for greater development impact and harness risk mitigation mechanisms along the SDGs and to link European approaches to African ones, in an effort to also attract long term finance (i.e. mainly institutional financiers)      The EU initiative to set up an External Investment Plan (EIP) is an ambitious one. While building on the European experience, notably with Blending Facilities (on financing) and Budget Support (on investment climate), the EIP aims to contribute towards a more coherent EU financing architecture for external investment.      ECDPM has been closely informing and facilitating the discussion and policy elaboration around development finance instruments. Our work has focused on drawing some of the lessons from the existing EU blended finance instruments for the EIP, notably in access to energy, working together with partners and bringing key stakeholders together, and documenting key lessons. We have provided technical input in the context of the adoption of the European Fund for Sustainable Development (EFSD) Regulation, contribute to the debate with the European Parliament, some Member States, DFIs and MDBs. In a set of two briefing notes, we untangled what the European External Investment Plan is really about as well as pointing out some of its current challenges that need to be addressed to make it a game changer for sustainable development. The 2018 spring issue of our quarterly &#x2018;Great Insights&#x2019; magazine also covered the challenges in development finance from different angles.      In doing so, we have also contributed to the discussion on the EU partnership with Africa, highlighting the need to focus on financing for sustainable investment for decent job creation (in two briefing notes, as a member of the European Think Tank Group) as well as the need to more closely associate African actors in the EU endeavours to reshape its financial instruments for external investment (in events and publications).      This work has been further elaborated in our input on the debate towards the new EU Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) and the Commission proposal to set up an open system of guarantees of up to &#x20AC;60 billion with an enhanced European Fund for Sustainable Development (the EFSD+).      3) Climate finance and other vertical funds are more effectively mobilised and enhance climate finance readiness (defined as the capacities of countries to plan for, access, deliver, and monitor and report on climate finance, both international and domestic, in ways that are catalytic and fully integrated with national development policies and the achievement of the SDGs), in particular for African countries, with the support of MDBs and DFIs (including African ones)      ECDPM work so far has focused on stressing the sustainability dimension of financing approaches, stressing the need for more ambitious agenda and targets, and comprehensive approaches, notably in the areas of access to energy and agriculture. We have also developed two main projects which will directly address the climate dimension of sustainable financing: 1) in the context of the EU Horizon 2020 research project on climate change from a European perspective, ECDPM will focus on the strategies and actions of European MDBs and DFIs towards climate finance; 2) in the context of our work on regional value chains in agriculture, we will also focus on approaches to more effectively finance climate smart agriculture.      3. Did you consider gender issues during the process of engagement?      In the context of our work on the EIP and EFSD+, ECDPM has stressed the need to more explicitly include the gender dimension. The key role of women has also been highlighted in articles we published on blended finance, illicit financial flows, gender budgeting, private sector investment and job creation.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">The ECDPM focus on development finance institutions (DFIs) and public development banks (PDBs) as a way to leverage private finance to help meet the resources needed towards achieving the sustainable development goals (SDGs) turned out to be in line with international and EU dynamics, and new EU strategic political and budgetary priorities. Our assumption that DFIs and PDBs could play a catalytic role in the 2030 Agenda, should be better harnessed to other development cooperation endeavours (notably traditional aid and policy reforms), and should build on local dynamics, turned out to be most relevant.In our work on the roles of European DFIs (EDFI), the European Investment Bank (EIB) and European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), and more broadly on the European financial architecture for development (EFAD), we have focused on the narrative that supporting sustainable economic growth and quality jobs creation in Africa would be mutually beneficial for Africa and Europe.The COVID-19 pandemic put a brand new dimension and sense of urgency in the need to mobilise resources and leverage private finance to address some of the health and socio-economic challenges of the pandemic, in a context of rising inequality and two-track recovery. This put a further emphasis on the role of PDBs and DFIs, in Europe, in Africa, at international ones, to promote a build back better, green, more inclusive and gender-sensitive agenda.ECDPM has established itself as a key non-partisan insider, with the ability to provide useful insights to address systemic issues related to the EU financial architecture for development (EFAD), while keeping a strong practice anchor.We have indirectly enhanced the local dimension of some EU financial institutions, notably in terms of the need to work with local public financial institutions. This is the case for the EIB and its engagement with the ACP, which adjusted the way it presented its activities and highlighted its engagement with regional development banks. Through our work on the External Investment Plan notably, our emphasis on the policy/climate investment and financing/guarantee of investment is increasingly better articulated at the EU level and reflected in some DFIs engagement.We have notably helped several EU member states and notably the Finnish Presidency and in defining their position on the EFSD+ proposal (https://ecdpm.org/publications/leveraging-the-next-eu-budget-for-sustainable-development-finance-the-european-fund-for-sustainable-development-plus-efsd/) under the NDICI Regulation, on the EU financial architecture and on the recommendations of the Wise Persons Group report.It is worth stressing that besides papers and blogs, we have contributed to impact the financial architecture process within the EU through our facilitation of informal dialogues activities, principally through closed-door roundtables and bilateral meetings. ECDPM facilitation of closed-door roundtables has helped DFIs reflect on their modes of interventions and share experiences (https://ecdpm.org/events/pushing-the-envelope-with-the-efsd-fostering-additionality-in-eu-external-investment-lunchtime-roundtable/), as well as engage with EU member states and Commission officials in an informal setting.ECDPM has provided direct advice to several European financial institutions for development and to some EU member states. We have been particularly active in the context of the EFAD discussion, providing input to the wise person group study on EFAD, and to the consultants in charge of the follow up, an independent feasibility study on EFAD. We have also helped some EU member states in this process, with direct input as well as in facilitating informal discussion among EU member states, with European DFIs/PDBs and all institutional actors.&#x200B;&#x200B;In the context of COVID-19, ECDPM has been instrumental in concretely identifying how DFIs and PDBs could best respond to the COVID-19 crisis and be empowered to better support the COVID-19 recovery, and on how the EU could best contribute to this global response, mobilising its range of policies, instruments and institutions to more significantly support private finance to build back better and greener, in particular in Africa and poorer countries.We have worked at the international level, in particular by actively contributing to OECD-led Tri Hita Karana Blended Finance network (https://www.oecd.org/dac/financing-sustainable-development/development-finance-topics/tri-hita-karana-roadmap-for-blended-finance.htm), becoming a member of its coordination group and providing background analysis (https://assets.ctfassets.net/4cgqlwde6qy0/2UIDzHLqOh58RKeuHqejft/6a934d233516039a7c239014ce466b6d/THK_Report_on_Covid-19_and_Blended_Finance_21-10-2020.pdf), drafting the Statement (https://www.oecd.org/dac/financing-sustainable-development/development-finance-topics/THK-Statement.pdf) for public endorsement, writing an op-ed in Devex (https://www.devex.com/news/opinion-how-can-dfis-do-more-to-help-msmes-survive-covid-19-98566), co-organising and contributing to ETTG-ECDPM-OECD event on multilateral development finance in COVID-19 (https://ettg.eu/event/ettg-oecd-webinar-weathering-the-storm-what-role-for-multilateral-development-finance-in-response-to-the-covid-19-crisis/), and presenting key recommendations at the OECD-DAC Community of Practice group. These activities have had a direct influence on the DFIs/PDBs community, with many financial institutions (EBRD, EDFI, EIB) and EU member states directly requesting the support and advice of ECDPM.We have actively worked at the EU level, on the EU global response to COVID-19 and its financial institutions for development, notably the EIB, EBRD and Association of European DFIs (EDFI), providing analysis on the need for Europe to contribute to saving Africa&#x2019;s private sector (https://www.edfi.eu/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Saving-Jobs-During-Pandemic_te-Velde-et-al_15-April-2020.pdf, with ODI and UNECA), the EU response (https://set.odi.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/EU-coronovarius-and-developing-countries_Final.pdf) and ways to improve it with smarter finance (https://ecdpm.org/publications/towards-eu-global-covid-19-response-2-0-boosting-smarter-finance/), and more ambitious and collaborative way (http://www.realinstitutoelcano.org/wps/portal/rielcano_en/contenido?WCM_GLOBAL_CONTEXT=/elcano/elcano_in/zonas_in/ari142-2020-bilal-collaborative-efforts-to-stimulate-sustainable-investment-for-covid-19-recovery-in-developing-countries), notably through Team Europe and co-investments (https://ecdpm.org/publications/european-financial-institutions-work-better-together-sustainable-green-co-investment-times-covid-19/), while better tracking EU COVID-19 development finance (https://ecdpm.org/talking-points/following-money-why-covid-19-marker-might-not-help/).ECDPM has also contributed to increasing the knowledge and understanding of blended finance opportunities and challenges by European civil society organisations, providing training, information and comments, and involving them in some policy dialogues.The narratives on the role of DFIs/PDBs and on the coherence of the European approach have been closely intertwined. This has been the case in the EU policy discussion on the European financial architecture for development (EFAD), on the EU global response to the COVID-19 crisis and Team Europe approach, as well as in the new long-term budgetary process of the EU, with the new development instrument (the Neighbourhood, Development and International Cooperation Instrument - NDICI / Global Europe) and the adoption of the European Fund for Sustainable Development (Plus) - EFSD+ - and the single External Action Guarantee - EAG, a new open architecture for the EU and its financial institutions to conduct blended finance operations and benefit from EU guarantees.ECDPM has been very active in this process, with the European financial institutions, the EU institutions, including the European External Action Service (EEAS), European Commission (DG NEAR and DG DEVCO/INTPA), the European Parliament and relevant committees, and some EU member states (including those holding the rotating Presidency of the EU). As a result, ECDPM has been able to directly inform and influence the shape of the new EFSD+ (e.g. including a dedicated window for the EIB, not initially foreseen), the participation of DFIs/PDBs in the Team Europe approach, as well as other strategic considerations in the COVID-19 response. ECDPM has played the role of facilitator and sounding board, providing a pool of ideas and recommendations, which policy-makers and financial institutions could draw upon.We have also focused on the interaction of the EU with its African partners, identifying a range of new options (such as partnership, co-investment, regional financial hubs, Team Europe-Africa thematic financial platforms) and interactions to stimulate European-African cooperation and partnership on investment. Combined with our engagement at the international level, notably through the OECD blended finance initiatives and OECD-led Tri Hita Karana Blended Finance network (https://www.oecd.org/dac/financing-sustainable-development/development-finance-topics/tri-hita-karana-roadmap-for-blended-finance.htm), establishing links to the G20 Compact with Africa and working in partnership with the African Centre for Economic Transformation (ACET), we have focused on the local dimension of blended finance (https://ecdpm.org/publications/fostering-local-dimension-blended-finance-principles-practice/, i.e. taking into account local institutions and policy dynamics), through the Peer-Learning-Process of the G20 Compact with Africa (e.g. Abidjan event, https://ecdpm.org/events/g20-compact-africa-peer-learning-seminar-blended-finance/) and the OECD blended finance principle on local context, leading to a direct influence on the OECD guidance on blended finance and approach by some financial institutions for development.We have also engaged in an international dialogue (with the OECD and G20) on the principles and support needed by developing countries for the emission (green and sustainable) bonds and the use, by developing country governments, of blended finance.Working with the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO) as part of our joint AgrInvest project, ECDPM has also contributed to identifying concrete channels and modalities to finance sustainable agri-value chains in four African countries (Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Kenya and Niger), based on dedicated financial mappings. We have identified some guiding recommendations for agri-value chain finance, which should form the basic principles for value-chain financing platforms at the country level.Our impact on climate finance has principally been at the level of European financial institutions for development and in particular the European Investment Bank (EIB).As part of the EU-funded Horizon2020 research consortium on Cascading climate risks: towards adaptive and resilient European societies (CASCADES, https://www.cascades.eu/), ECDPM has emphasised the role that DFIs and the EIB should play in climate finance in developing countries. We have stressed the lack of attention given to climate adaptation by European financial institutions for development and contributed to identifying priorities and principles for the EIB climate finance and climate adaptation new strategies. We are also identifying better practises by multilateral development banks and ways to increase the synergies and coherence of development finance and aid agencies.ECDPM also joined forces with other members of the OECD-led Tri Hita Karana Blended Finance network (https://www.oecd.org/dac/financing-sustainable-development/development-finance-topics/tri-hita-karana-roadmap-for-blended-finance.htm), as well as public and private financial institutions and donor agencies, to identify guiding principles and ways to promote the issuance of green, social and sustainability (GSS) bonds by developing countries.With the support of the Agence Francaise of Development (AFD), together with our partners from the European Think Tank Group (ETTG), we have identified concrete operational principles (https://ettg.eu/publications/financing-the-2030-agenda-an-sdg-alignment-framework-for-public-development-banks/) for public development banks (PDBs) to align their operations to the sustainable development goals (SDGs), which requires adjustments not only at the operation levels, but also to their mandate, governance and, business model. These were officially presented and discussed at the 2nd Finance in Common Summit by PDBs, and follow up discussions are taking place with European DFIs and PDBs to guide their reform process aligned to the 2030 Agenda.ECDPM has also mainstreamed green and sustainable finance in all its development finance activities, as in the case of gender.Our approach to gender issues has been two-fold.First, ECDPM has identified concrete ways DFIs are and could engage in a more comprehensive manner on promoting gender-sensitive approaches. We have done so through direct engagement with financial institutions, collecting insights through a dedicated study (https://ecdpm.org/publications/gender-sensitive-sustainable-covid-19-recovery-role-development-finance-institutions/), and contributing to dedicated dialogues and meetings with financial institutions for development.Second, we have more systematically addressed gender issues in our overall work, on investment promotion and development finance, as well as in our more thematic work (e.g. access to energy, agri-finance, climate). We have stressed in our work on COVID-19 recovery endeavours the critical importance of gender-sensitive approaches. We have also highlighted in social media the gender bias in financial institutions for development, where women are underrepresented at the top level.We consider that beyond dedicated women-focused initiatives, it is even more important for financial institutions to more systematically mainstream approaches to women, in a more overall gender-sensitive manner, including with and by their clients.</narrative>
