  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This work stream seeks to contribute to the following three ECDPM impact areas: effective international cooperation frameworks and tools for tackling global challenges; Legitimate and accountable public institutions and engaged societies and Peaceful societies based on the rule of law, social cohesion and human dignity. It aims to promote the effective operationalisation of the African Governance Architecture (AGA) as a tool to promote legitimate and accountable institutions and to ensure that they are inclusive. It also seeks to strengthen linkages with conflict prevention (APSA) so as to support the goal of peaceful societies. Since international actors could support or undermine progress particularly towards the second impact area, we have integrated elements in our work stream that also seek to ensure that international cooperation frameworks are also created to support legitimate and accountable public institutions and engaged societies.In order to deliver on these impact areas, we will focus on: 1) Contribute to strengthening civil society engagement to support the implementation of the AGA 2) Strengthen policy linkages between the AGA and the APSA strengthened to speed up implementation of the AGA. This is largely to ensure that the processes play on each other&#x2019;s strength (i.e. the APSA is better established and has therefore traction and coherence between interventions of the AU). 3) Promote an international partners engagement that is informed by local context in order to ensure to strengthen the effectiveness of international engagement</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Outcome narrative Support for the African Governance Architecture1. Contextualisation/relevance:          In this work stream, we set out to contribute to the following changes:1) Contribute to strengthening civil society engagement to support the implementation of the African Governance Architecture 2) Strengthen policy linkages between the African Governance Architecture (AGA) and the African Peace and Security Architecture (APSA) to contribute to &#x2018;accountable institutions and engaged citizens&#x2019; and &#x2018;peaceful societies based on the rule of law, social cohesion and human dignity&#x2019;   3) Promote an international partners engagement that is informed by local context in order to strengthen the effectiveness of international engagement          The African Institutions programme responded to a number of changes since the work stream was formulated in 2016. In 2017, the African Union (AU) embarked on a process of institutional reforms, which created new opportunities for engagement with key departments and stakeholders from the African Union Commission (AUC), notably actors driving the African Peer Review Mechanism and those units or departments responsible for supporting or driving the institutional reform agenda. Attempts to promote stronger AUC synergies between the African Peace and Security Architecture and the African Governance Architecture started promising, but did not gain sufficient political traction, the more so as AGA remained overly dependent on funding of donors. At a more practical level, the foreseen EU funding for our intended work on strengthening African civil society engagement with the African Union did not materialise.Nevertheless, a broader institutional reform process was launched in the African Union mid-2016. One central reform challenge was to strengthen the governance systems of the continental organisations, including the question of enhanced yearly contributions from the member states. The African Institutions programme responded positively to requests to contribute to these efforts at improving the governance of the AU institutions, particularly of the financing of the AU operations and programmes.           2. Storyline on the African Governance Architecture and peace and security.           The African Institutions programme contributed to a major study into Africa&#x2019;s regional organisations. It focused on linkages between governance and peace and security within Regional Economic Communities. This work resulted in four reports under the umbrella of the ECDPM PEDRO programme (Political Economy Dynamics of Regional Organisations). Some of the reports were discussed with the AUC Department of Political Affairs, and with the Peace and Security directorate of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS). Generally, there is a lack of interaction on peace and security challenges between Regional Economic Communities and the AU. Yet, the potential for cooperation between these levels may increase with the recent round of reforms that was triggered by the recommendations of the Kagame Report (January 2017). The African Institutions programme used such opportunities to facilitate vertical cooperation between AU and Regional Economic Communities, together with other non-state actors such as the Institute for Security Studies, African Centre for the Constructive Resolution of Disputes and the Norwegian Institute of International Affairs. This was seen as a first step towards opening up the discussion on the vertical linkages between continental and regional organisations on AGA-APSA linkages. Other research included work on the courts for the Netherlands Institute for Multiparty Democracy (NIMD), which provided inputs for the development of the background document for the AGA Roadmap, so in that sense it contributed to inform policy debates on this crucial dimensions for Africa&#x2019;s institutional transformation.Overall, however, there seemed to be little traction for the African Institutions programme to continue the work on strengthening synergies between governance and peace and security with the core AU institutions. Yet new opportunities for constructive support opened within the broader context of institutional reforms and because of opportunities created by colleagues in the Centre in working on regional integration and regional development dynamics. Two developments affecting our contribution to the change trajectories, therefore, merit further attention. One relates to the work on financing of the African Union. The other relates to changes in the structure of the ECDPM work by integrating the workstreams on regional integration and on African Institutions given the strong potential for synergies and emerging opportunities.           3. Storyline on governance reforms of the African institutions and financing the African Union           Some African countries are still defaulting on their yearly payments (assessed contributions) to the AU budget. In 2016, the AU agreed that its member states would impose a 0.2% levy on eligible imports on the continent as a formula of sustainable and predictable financing of the AU. This way, the AU would reduce its dependence on outsiders and would strengthen incentives for improved accountability relations. There were and are a number of political and technical hindrances for moving from policy to practice in this crucial area of AU governance. Given the combined strengths of ECDPM in its work on in-depth context analysis (through its political economy analysis), its well networked connections with the African continental and regional organisations, and its technical and legal expertise, the Centre was able to engage with key players and act as a knowledge broker. Since there was limited analysis on the legal and political challenges member states might face, there was a hesitance with some African countries to implement the 0.2% levy. Having identified such gaps after discussions with key actors, ECDPM published two Briefing Notes on financing the AU. The first paper, (&#x201C;Analysis of the implementation of the African Union&#x2019;s 0.2% levy: Progress and Challenges&#x201D;) sheds light on the importance on the financing decision through the 0.2% levy on all eligible non-African imports. This paper locates the 0.2% levy within the overall reforms of the AU highlighting the need to secure a predictable and sustainable source of financing for the union. A second paper (&#x201C;Can the 0.2% levy fund peace in Africa? A stronger AU-UN partnership in accordance with WTO rules&#x201D;) developed a new legal argument. One of the key concerns raised about the 0.2% levy was its potential contradiction with trade rules of the World Trade Organization. The Briefing Note argued that the obligations towards continental peace and security under the UN Charter offer a counterweight for objections raised around the World Trade Organisation. A representative of the UN Commission on Africa welcomed these concrete proposals on legal challenges, and as it fits within another important continental policy agenda, that of the African Continental Free Trade Area. More generally, the two Briefing Notes were well received in policy circles. Moreover, the audience also included AU member states and Regional Economic Communities. AU advisors followed up with ECDPM and further distributed among interested actors and within their team. ECDPM was invited to present these findings at the an inclusive multi-stakeholder event (the Tana pre-forum in Addis Ababa, February 2018). Some African Union member states present expressed interest that this paper be presented to members of the permanent ambassadors in Addis Ababa, the seat of the AU headquarters. Following our presentation and discussions at this forum (the &#x201C;Permanent Representatives Committee&#x201D;), the representative of Community of East and Southern Africa States invited us to present the paper to the Regional Economic Communities to popularise the core policy messages and findings. Taken together, these responses suggest that the Centre&#x2019;s inputs (facilitation, networking, publications and knowledge brokerage) were taken to a higher level of visibility and potentially acceptance of the relevance to implement the 0.2% levy.           4. Implications for future work           The Centre has adapted to the changes to the context within the African Union - with avenues closing, but new opportunities opening up - in two ways. First, it has re-adjusted its focus and found entry points in the institutional reform processes that are taking shape. Secondly, the work by African Institutions benefits to the efforts by colleagues in the ECDPM workstream on political economy and regional dynamics, and vice versa, the work on Africa&#x2019;s regional organisations and dynamics could reinforce context analysis broaden the scope of potential work areas of the African Institutions programme. Therefore, the two programmes will be integrated to improve synergies to improve context analysis, and enhance responsiveness to opportunities for policy-to-practice study, facilitation, and brokerage within an integrated programme on African Institutions and Reform Dynamics.           5. Additional information:                     Briefing Note 98 was used as reference document by think tanks, as part of the key documents on AU reforms for the 2018 Tana forum under the theme &#x201C;Ownership of Africa&#x2019;s Peace and Security Provision: Financing and Reforming the African Union.&#x201D;           Briefing Note 98 quoted by the East African front page article &#x201C;AU targets $318m in plan to finance itself, reduce aid&#x201D; on 21 April 2018.           On Briefing Note 98, a diplomat at the Tana pre-forum who attended the presentation stated that: &quot;this is the first paper that managed to combine a good analysis of the political context with the technical aspects therefore striking the right balance&quot;. The AU reforms team has been very positive about the Briefing Note 98. During a bilateral meeting with ECDPM, one member said that &quot;this is a reference document in the discussion&quot; (referring to the work on financing the African Union).            Briefing Note 103A representative of the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA) shared a tweet about BN103 and stated &#x201C;Great piece which will guide our work&#x2026; on financing&#x201D; (referring to the work on financing the African Union).</narrative>
