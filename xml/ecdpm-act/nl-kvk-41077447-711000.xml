       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Contextualisation and importance     This workstream aims to fully incorporate North Africa into the Centre&#x2019;s geographic remit as this will help us to foster more effectively and mutually beneficial forms of cooperation between Europe and the whole of Africa.     Through our policy-oriented research, we seek to shed more light on the power relations at play, as well as on the political and economic interests and incentives that either prevent or drive change in North Africa. We equally focus on informing policy makers on European policies relating to the region, to help make these more balanced, strategic, and connected to local dynamics.     As this was a relatively new workstream for the Centre, it was decided to dedicate the first 2-3 years of the new strategy to invest in further scoping the possible niches of ECDPM in this region, to establish contacts and networks and enhance our visibility as an independent foundation specialising on EU-Africa relations. These investments were seen as a precondition for us to be able to gradually work towards achieving the above outcomes.     1) More actors are enabled to manage and effectively use multi-stakeholder processes and where appropriate linking up policy processes at the national and regional level (e.g. cross-regional civil society initiatives)     One of the main ways to increase ECDPM&#x201D;s visibility and credibility as a Centre dealing with North Africa was to participate in relevant events in Europe and North Africa to present our work and connect with relevant researchers and policy makers. Besides, ECDPM gained membership of Euromesco (the Euro-Mediterranean Study Commission), which is a network of 106 research institutes and think tanks from the Euro-Mediterranean area working on politics and security in the Mediterranean. Membership of this network is valuable to facilitate our access to key research centers in North Africa and those in Europe working on North Africa. Using this platform will also help us better understand change dynamics and politics in the region. Contacts were established with other leading think tanks in Morocco and Tunisia.     One contract obtained in 2018 from the EU Delegation in Tunisia, helped us to make our first steps into promoting multi-actor dialogues. While the request was primarily oriented towards helping the EU Delegation in programming its future aid to the country, the &#x201C;political economy analysis&#x201D; study conducted for them, allowed us to engage with more than 250 Tunisian actors and stakeholders. This process is now at a stage where ECDPM can start building on the networks created to foster multi-actor dialogues (e.g. on how to improve the quality of public spending in Tunisia). It is a good example of how a study commissioned by the EUD can spillover into broader dialogue processes at country level.     2) Europe&#x2019;s / the EU&#x2019;s engagement strategies with the countries and citizens of the region are better informed, connected to local dynamics, balanced and resulting in mutually beneficial cooperation     The Centre has invested over the past two years in studying and contributing to the discussion on the EU&#x2019;s engagement and cooperation with countries of North Africa in critical areas like local development and migration. ECDPM has for example participated in a regional exchange seminar on the topic for the Neighbourhood South in Tunis in March 2018. The gathering explored the potential for applying a territorial approach to local development (TALD) in the region with a mix of public and private actors as well as experts. This participation created new space for collaboration with Directorate General International Cooperation and Development (DEVCO Unit 5) and among the ETTG institutes on aspects regarding policies territorialization, multi-level governance and SDGs. This year, we also dedicated a GREAT Insights issue to North Africa to reflect on a host of burning issues in the region. This issue brought together European and North African experts on the matter. Our publications, including papers and blogs, were positively received by experts and practitioners on the ground. Besides, we were interviewed by prominent media including France 24 and Aljazeera on developments in North Africa and the region&#x2019;s relations with Europe. These different activities have helped us contribute to the debate on EU-North Africa relations and disseminate relevant knowledge.      The EU delegation in Tunisia requested ECDPM to conduct a &#x201C;political economy analysis&#x201D; (PEA) on reform dynamics in the country with a view to inform future programming processes. This study is essentially geared at ensuring that EU aid is better aligned to local political dynamics and more realistic in terms of results that can be achieved. The contract spread over 18 months (including 6 field trips) has led to a &#x201C;country PEA report&#x201D; which was used to identify a 100 million Euro support programme in the field of economic governance. The assignment included 5 training seminars for EUD staff to get acquainted with the PEA methodology. This, in turn, greatly helped in &#x201C;co-producing&#x201D; a new-style, more politically driven, programming process.     3) Countries in North and sub-saharan Africa better understand each other&apos;s regional integration frameworks     Achieving this outcome in the long-term goes first through a better understanding of how North African countries engage with the rest of the continent. We launched some projects to contribute to developing this understanding in-house and for the external audience. The first of these projects was a paper that broadly looked at the shift in North Africa towards a stronger engagement with sub-Saharan Africa. The paper broadly explored the drivers of this &#x2018;shift&#x2019; and how it manifests in different policy areas including trade, peace and security, and migration. To deepen this understanding, other papers with more specific focus areas will follow, including a paper that delves deeply into the role of North African countries in peace and security in the continent and another one that focuses on Morocco&#x2019;s potential integration into ECOWAS.     Did you consider gender issues during the process of engagement?     ECDPM&#x2019;s engagement in North Africa is relatively recent. The Centre is in the process of developing knowledge on and understanding of change dynamics in the region and how to strategically contribute to specific policy processes. That being said, there were no clear opportunities and no capacities, so far, to integrate gender in our work on North Africa.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Strengthening ECDPM&#x2019;s engagement in North Africa was one of the strategic priorities of the current ECDPM 2017-2021 Strategy. The aim of this workstream was to fully incorporate North Africa into the Centre&#x2019;s geographic remit.The Centre used the first years of the Strategy to develop knowledge on and understanding of change dynamics in the region and how to strategically contribute to specific policy processes. This has resulted in the publication of several briefs, papers and blogs on the evolving relations with Sub-Saharan Africa, on EU-North Africa relations and migration management, on the regions&#x2019; expectations and positions on the future of the EU-Africa partnership, and on the security interests of North African countries in Africa. We also published a Great Insights issue on North Africa in November 2018. A more comprehensive list of publications can be found in our dossier on North Africa (https://ecdpm.org/dossiers/changing-relations-europe-north-africa/).Other achievements include ECDPM&#x2019;s EuroMesco membership, the African institutions and regional dynamics team&#x2019;s ongoing work on Tunisia with the EU delegation, and the contributions made to the IEMed Yearbook 2019 (www.iemed.org/publicacions-en/historic-de-publicacions/anuari-de-la-mediterrania/sumaris/iemed-mediterranean-yearbook-2019), our participation in the advisory council of the same Yearbook in 2020, and the security and resilience team&#x2019;s assignment to facilitate a discussion for the EEAS on Algeria.Over the years, through our policy-oriented research, we shed more light on the power relations at play, as well as on the political and economic interests and incentives that either prevent or drive change in North Africa. We equally focused on informing policy makers on European policies relating to the region, to help make these more balanced, strategic, and connected to local dynamics.The range of activities across different Centre&#x2019;s teams show the North Africa workstream indeed encouraged the Centre to undertake work on North Africa, in line with the ECDPM 2017-2021 Strategy. The workstream on North Africa has been merged in 2020 with the overall work of the Centre on Africa-Europe relations. Work on North Africa will be further encouraged by &#x2018;North Africa champions&#x2019; within the various teams.</narrative>
