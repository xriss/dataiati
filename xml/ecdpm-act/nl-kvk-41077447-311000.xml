   <narrative xml:lang="EN">4. Promoting integrated EU approaches for more effective crisis response, conflict prevention and peacebuilding in fragile and conflict(-prone) environments</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This work stream aims to promote more integrated EU approaches to external conflict and crisis as a means to achieve more peaceful and inclusive societies. It is based on the assumption that a more coherent, integrated and multidimensional approach to conflict will lead to more effective and impactful and sustainable crisis response, conflict prevention and peacebuilding. Promoting integration is concerned with a better interaction between approaches and tools across the conflict cycle, from acute short-term interventions to prevent or resolve violent conflict to long-term efforts to build sustainable peace. Moreover, integration is concerned with reconciling bottom-up (non-state/community/society-based) with top-down (more state-centric) approaches, creating more inclusive, politically carried and locally-owned peace processes. Furthermore, in times when the EU is more explicitly pursuing an interest-driven approach to foreign policy and developing new mechanisms to allow military responses to conflict (e.g. through the European Peace Facility), this ToC also aims to identify practical insights on how military and civilian approaches to conflict, and value-based and interest-driven agendas of peace and security can be reconciled, e.g. in terms of respect for human rights and doing no harm. At the same time, it is recognised that different contexts may require different forms of interaction (e.g. because of political sensitivities or diverging objectives), depending on the nature of the conflict and what circumstances require and allow. It also recognised that, to maximise sustainable impact, focusing on EU integration at the institutional level should not go at the expense of integrating local needs and ownership. This work stream promotes more effective, influential and conflict-sensitive EU cooperation frameworks, financing mechanisms and working approaches in relation to conflict response, conflict prevention and peacebuilding on the African continent and in the European neighbourhood (particularly in the South). Attention will be mainly given to the Sahel and Horn of Africa regions. Opportunities to expand our expertise on North Africa will be actively sought (including on linkages between North Africa and other African regions, viz. the Sahel), building on earlier work done (including under the work stream Strengthening African regional responses to monitoring and the APSA impact monitoring). The focus is on the cooperation frameworks of EU institutions, but will take into account possible linkages with frameworks promoted by EU Member States.Improved frameworks, tools and methods will also strengthen the accountability of the EU&#x2019;s work in relation to conflict response, prevention and resolution vis-a-vis European stakeholders, African and international institutions. The envisaged changes are: 1) Better informed and empowered public and private actors: EU institutions, in particular EEAS, DG DEVCO, DG NEAR, ECHO and other EU institutions dealing with conflict, fragility and resilience are better informed on how to work in a more integrated and conflict-sensitive manner and more effectively on conflict response, prevention and peacebuilding, including through improved access to and use of knowledge, tools and lessons learnt in relation to peacebuilding and conflict prevention. 2) More coherent policies and cooperation processes: Through policy research, analysis and dialogue, evidence-based and practical knowledge, innovative practices, tools and methods are generated and promoted among EU institutions dealing with conflict, fragility and resilience with a view to help reducing gaps between policy and implementation.3) More effective multi-actor partnerships: EU institutions and external partners (in particular EU Member States, as well as multilateral organisations, African institutions, non-EU bilateral actors and NGOs) are better informed about how to collaborate on conflict response, prevention and peacebuilding. Specific attention is hereby given to the EU-Africa partnership on peace and security, as well as the EU partnership with the UN.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">1. Contextualisation and importance         The purpose of this workstream is to promote more integrated EU approaches to external conflict and crisis in Africa and in the European Neighbourhood. This is based on the argument that a more coherent use of tools across the conflict cycle, integrating short-term responses with longer-term action through peacebuilding and development, and a more prominent role for preventive and non-violent approaches to violent conflict, will help to achieve sustainable peace. Such integrated approaches are also concerned with reconciling bottom-up (non-state, community- and society-level) with top-down (state-centric) approaches, thus creating more inclusive and locally owned approaches to peace. Furthermore, this workstream also explores how collaboration with EU member states, African institutions and the United Nations on conflict prevention, crisis response and peacebuilding can be made more effective.         2. Contributions made to each of the main changes envisaged         1) Better informed actors on more integrated responses to violent conflict         In March 2018, the European Commission published the final report of the evaluation of the EU&#x2019;s African Peace Facility (APF) for the period 2014-2016, which was conducted by ECDPM&#x2019;s Security and Resilience programme in collaboration with Particip GmbH. The APF is the main financing instrument available for the EU to provide support to African responses to violent conflict in Africa through support to peace support operations and institutional capacity-building in the context of the African Peace and Security Architecture (APSA). The evaluation report informed the EU institutions on how the APF has contributed to addressing European and African security challenges and to strengthening capacities of African institutions to effectively respond to violent conflict, and which lessons could be learned from past experiences. It also formulated recommendations to the EU institutions at both the policy and the practical level on how the APF can be used more effectively as part of a more integrated EU response to violent conflict in Africa, including through more attention to civilian aspects of (post-)conflict responses and improved coordination with other EU and member states interventions.         Our findings and recommendations are feeding into the design and implementation of future action plans and programmes of the APF. The evaluation team concretely contributed to this by providing the European Commission with a detailed log frame and monitoring framework for both the 2017-2018 period and for the post-2018 implementation. Recommendations are also informing discussions on future peace and security funding instruments post-2020. To inform such processes, ECDPM staff presented the evaluation in a session of the Africa Working Party of the Council of the EU (convening representatives of all EU member states as well as the Commission and the European External Action Service). Moreover, ECDPM was invited by the ministries of foreign affairs of two EU member states to present and discuss the findings and recommendations of the APF evaluation. A third EU member state invited ECDPM staff for a presentation and debate on the EU approaches to the security-development nexus and how to APF could fit in this.         Such information and facilitation activities were requested by EU member states to inform their positions in the context of ongoing negotiations on the future multiannual financial framework after 2020, including a new set of external financing instruments, as well as the creation of a proposed European Peace Facility as of 2021. As such, ECDPM specifically contributed to a greater awareness on the nature, scope and added value of the APF within the broader set of EU peace, security and development instruments and tools. It also illustrates how the programme&#x2019;s work is informing member states&#x2019; thinking on how the APF can be more effectively used as an element of a broader EU integrated approach to violent conflict in Africa and elsewhere.        2) Peace and security actors more empowered to deal with conflict in an integrated way         In the course of 2018, ECDPM&#x2019;s Security and Resilience Programme contributed to more empowered peace and security actors in two ways. First, we contributed, in collaboration with the European External Affairs Programme, to a debate among policymakers and practitioners on how European support to peacebuilding is being affected by various ongoing changes in domestic and international politics. This was done on the basis of a study, supported by the US foundation Humanity United, on which factors influence European support to peacebuilding and how these will impact engagement in the peacebuilding field in the years to come. Based on this research, case study reports and a synthesis report were published and presented during events in Berlin, Washington D.C. and Stockholm in October 2018. These events brought together policymakers and practitioners and helped building a better understanding of how political changes across Europe are affecting European countries&#x2019; political and financial support to peacebuilding worldwide. During these events, a dialogue was also facilitated on how supporters of peacebuilding can be better equipped to adapt to a world that is seeing radical changes both geopolitically and in terms of domestic politics. One conclusion pointed at the need for peacebuilding organisations to engage more actively with the political level by stepping up advocacy activities. This has resulted to a concrete decision by Humanity United to fund an international coalition of non-governmental organisations active in the domain of peacebuilding to engage in advocacy campaigns in a number of countries and at the global level.         Second, ECDPM also facilitates the empowerment of EU peace and security actors through its involvement in the CIVILnEXt project, which contributes to the development of an innovative communication tool to support EU external policy objectives, with a focus on the EU&#x2019;s civilian crisis management operations. The rationale of the project is that a more innovative and secure means for exchanging information, building situational awareness and exercising command and control would contribute not only to more responsive civilian conflict responses, but also to the implementation of the EU integrated approach to external conflict by facilitating communication with other EU and non-EU actors present in the field (e.g. EU Delegations, United Nations, African Union). ECDPM&#x2019;s role in this consortium is to give policy advice and facilitate interaction to bridge complex policy and operational discussions on supporting Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) missions between the Commission and the EEAS. This engagement is an intermediary result originating from ECDPM&#x2019;s previous participation in a study on supporting CSDP operations in the above mentioned field. The project started in May 2018 and runs for a period of three years.        3) Contributing to more effective multi-actor partnerships         At the core of the work of the Security and Resilience Programme is to contribute to a more effective EU-Africa partnership. Our main input to this objective was done through our evaluation of the African Peace Facility (see above), which highlighted the important contributions the EU has made through the APF to deepen the EU-Africa partnership, while also pointing at the untapped potential to build a more strategic partnership for peace and security based on strengthened political dialogue and more sustainable forms of capacity building and institutional development support. During the various presentations and discussions on the evaluation findings, ECDPM also informed audiences on the steps that are being taken by the African Union in terms of institutional reforms (the Kagame reform process) and the efforts to mobilise more own resources through the operationalisation of the AU Peace Fund. In this way, awareness was raised on potential avenues for building a more strategic and sustainable EU-Africa partnership.         In recent years, the EU-AU partnership on peace and security has seen many improvements and ECDPM&#x2019;s work has been received as a welcome input into ongoing efforts. Specifically, ECDPM is engaged in the discussion on the proposal for a future European Peace Facility (EPF), which would replace, amongst others, the current APF. This is a debate spread over many years, which ECDPM contributes to by sharing views on what the impact of a potential EPF could be on future EU support to the APSA and on the EU-Africa partnership more broadly. A concrete intermediate outcome is that ECDPM was consulted on the EPF proposals by a government officials of an EU member state. ECDPM advice on how the proposed EPF could impact EU-Africa cooperation on peace and security was taken up in the preparations of the government&#x2019;s input for a parliamentary debate on the EPF proposals. ECDPM intends to continue following up this discussion and seize opportunities to use its expertise on the matter to contribute to the development of a more effective EU-Africa partnership on peace and security in the future.        3. Did you consider gender issues during the process of engagement?         The Security and Resilience Programme started to work on gender issues especially in its other work work stream, named &#x201C;Strengthening African regional responses in monitoring and assessing the APSA&#x2019;s implementation in the domain of conflict prevention and conflict resolution&#x201D;. In that work stream we work on Women, Peace and Security policy uptake within African (regional) organisations and the extent to which the EU has been supporting this domain of work. As such, that work - which is in a build-up phase - touches upon issues pertaining to this work stream.</narrative>
