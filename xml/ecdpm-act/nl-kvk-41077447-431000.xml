       <narrative xml:lang="EN">1. Contextualisation and importance           In West Africa, ECDPM delivers support to regional policy processes for the development of competitive and resilient agri-food value chains. This aims to respond to the rapidly growing demand for food in West African cities and to multiple obstacles to private sector development and regional trade, while ensuring that farm households receive better incomes and that more jobs are created in and around value chains, especially for the youth and women. We conduct analyses on the drivers of policy outcomes in particular sectors and identify politically feasible interventions that may be implemented to enable inclusive regional markets and trade in agri-food products. We facilitate the uptake of new knowledge through stakeholder networks and policy processes, particularly for the rice and livestock products sectors in West Africa. In doing so, we strengthen the knowledge brokering capacities of local research organisations in regional agri-food policy processes. We also provide advice to West African policymakers and European development partners who seek to facilitate regional agri-food trade and the development of agri-food enterprises sourcing, processing and marketing safe and nutritious products in the regional market.           2. Contributions made to the main changes envisaged           1) Enhance coherence and synergies of regional policies and practices (e.g., agriculture, industrialisation, trade, corridor development, peace and security) for food security.           In 2017 we completed a case study on the coherence of public policies at different levels, for the development of agri-food value chains in Burkina Faso. This study showed that although agricultural and rural policies now work more in synergy than in the past, there remains a &#x201C;policy gap&#x201D; between agriculture, industry and trade, which hampers the development of inclusive agri-food markets, cross-border trade and value chains. Similar policy gaps at levels of two regional organisations - the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and the West African Economic and Monetary Union (UEMOA) - as well as of EU international cooperation hinder the structuring of markets, the development of infrastructure and private investments in value chains. The study provided a basis for a public-private dialogue in Burkina Faso on these hindrances. It helped inform a meeting of the High-level committee on food security of the UEMOA, and a side event at the High-Level Political Forum of the UN for the Sustainable Development Goals. These dialogues raised awareness about the issue of policy coherence for sustainable agri-food value chains and triggered interest in further research and dialogue, particularly at the level of the regional organisations and some development partners (including the GIZ and the SDC). Incidentally, through Switzerland, this work has also fostered a more practical approach to PCD in the OECD focal points group. In parallel, we have supported development partners, including the Netherlands, and regional organisations in better understanding linkages between trade facilitation and agri-food value chain development and in brokering knowledge across different policy sectors (infrastructure, trade and agriculture).           2) Reduce gap between regional policy frameworks and their implementation (at regional/national/local level)           In 2017 we assisted ECOWAS and its development partner, the Swiss Development Cooperation, in formulating a regional programme to support the marketing and trade of livestock along and around trade corridors in West Africa. This programme was intended to contribute to the implementation of the regional agricultural investment plan and more specifically the regional programme for livestock in coastal countries. The design of the programme included financial and technical assistance to livestock-meat traders organisations and, more importantly, a challenge fund, overseen by the ECOWAS Commission, for entrepreneurs and producers alliances involved in the livestock-meat value chain - this type of private sector development instrument is relatively new in this region and this sector. We also played our brokering role by sharing information on this programming process with other development partners (notably the Dutch government and the African Development Bank).           3) Strengthen effective multi-stakeholder dialogue and collaboration between public and private value chain actors (incl. farmers&#x2019; organisations), particularly at regional level           Our work generally puts emphasis on the understanding of private-sector-led initiatives, especially those led by smallholder farmers and agri-food small and medium-sized enterprises. Our analyses shed light on the factors that allow them to develop innovative business models, responding to market incentives, gain better access to markets, and develop new products responding to an evolving consumer demand. When engaging in policy dialogues, we encourage institutions to involve a variety of private actors (for example, we suggested to the GIZ programmes supporting the rice sector to reach out to a regional farmers-led consultative mechanism as well as to the regional cereals traders organisation), strive to better inform public actors about real economic dynamics, and ensure that private actors gain a better understanding of public policies. As we build up our knowledge base and network relating to the region, we will be more proactive in fostering multi-stakeholder dialogues around specific issues and opportunities, particularly at the regional level.           4) More effective, coherent and coordinated support of development partners (DP), particularly the EU and its Member States.           Our analytical and knowledge brokerage roles take place in the context of EU-Africa, and particularly EU-West Africa relations. By sustaining a regular exchange of information with the Dutch government, EU institutions and other European member states, we foster better coordination among EU development partners as regards agri-food value chain development in West Africa, and stimulate the uptake of implementation approaches that can improve development effectiveness. In the coming years, we will encourage better integration of the implications of climate change for agricultural and pastoral value chains in West Africa, to facilitate a coherent European response to this challenge.           Gender           Gender issues have been considered, particularly when analysing real economic dynamics and policy implementation modalities, as in the case of the regional livestock marketing programme. In this sector, women play a major role in informal processing activities downstream in the value chain (offal and tripes). These activities have been included among the eligible activities for the enterprise development funding instrument that is a core component of that programme. Generally, our analysis considers the benefits and costs for different social and gender groups, including the youth and women. However, ECDPM&#x2019;s available capacities and (externally-funded) project budget constraints often limit the extent to which outcomes for particular groups, notably women, can be assessed. In the events and dialogues we facilitate, we strive to provide opportunities for expression for women and the youth. For example, when we organised multi-stakeholder dialogues in Burkina Faso for the policy coherence study, we ensured that a number of women were involved, such as the female president of the Burkinab&#xE8; federation of food industries or a female researcher from the national research institute for agriculture and the environment.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">In West Africa and the Sahel, ECDPM continued to support regional policy processes for the development of inclusive and resilient agri-food value chains and regional trade. There was a sustained demand among national, regional and international actors for our input in terms of analysis, strategic guidance (on value chain development at the regional level), and multi-stakeholder dialogue facilitation around those processes, given the rapidly growing demand for food products in West African urban centres and inadequate value chain linkages between the latter and rural areas.We also continued to work on specific sub-sectors, although in the second part of this strategy period our focus shifted from the livestock to the rice sector. Again, this focus responded to priorities set by ECOWAS and development partners. The current ECOWAS Commissioner for agriculture and food has been very active and there was an opportunity to make progress in the implementation of the Rice Offensive in particular. For this sector we paid greater attention to political economy dynamics at the country level as it appeared that national policies still play a dominant role, including in the area of trade. In this sector, we worked more closely with farm, industry and trade actors.In the past few years, climate change, regional security developments and later the COVID-19 pandemic have caused new worries about the resilience of agri-food markets in West African countries and food security prospects. Responding to these challenges we supported development partners in better understanding the political economy dynamics of West African regional organisations to guide the formulation of regional interventions such as a regional programme on agri-food system resilience in West Africa that is supported by the Netherlands. We have also started integrating climate risk factors into our work in West Africa (for instance, with the CASCADES project).Over time, ECDPM gained greater credibility in West African regional policy processes relating to agriculture, food and trade. Progressively we have gained the trust of some West African actors, having demonstrated our capacity to make a realistic assessment of regional dynamics in agri-food sectors, our knowledge of the international policy environment, particularly in Europe, and our role as an independent knowledge broker at the nexus of agriculture, food and trade.As already mentioned in the first outcome narrative, in the livestock sector, we helped design a regional programme (PACBAO) led by the ECOWAS Commission and supported by the Swiss Development Cooperation aiming to facilitate trade between Sahelian and coastal countries and to promote investment in value addition activities in cross-border livestock-meat supply chains. At an ECOWAS-led meeting on pastoralism, after ECDPM&#x2019;s presentation on the PACBAO, a member of the organising team said &#x2018;that is how the PRIDEC [another regional initiative in the sector] should have been presented.&#x2019; Following this project, while the implementation of the PACBAO&#x2019;s different components began, we conducted a political economy analysis of the livestock-meat value chain in the central trade basin (Burkina Faso-C&#xF4;te d&#x2019;Ivoire in particular) to provide further insights into the drivers of the sector and to inform renewed efforts among stakeholders to address marketing and trade issues.Following the sequence of work on the livestock sector, in partnership with GIZ (Green Innovation Centres and the Fund for Agricultural Policy Advice and Innovation), we conducted two successive research projects on rice marketing and trade in West Africa to produce an in-depth analysis on extra- and intra-regional rice trading system dynamics, provide insights into the political economy of the sector and outline a comprehensive approach to reform pathways. Following our research and partnership-building activities (https://ecdpm.org/events/workshop-rice-sector-development-trade-policies-west-africa/), we were invited to contribute to the GIZ-sponsored Rice Working Group (https://my.ecdpm.org/deliverables/deliverable/-L86tT83T7usxquA2-nu) and to a consultative meeting on the implementation of the Rice Offensive of ECOWAS where public and private sector actors met to review strategies, at both national and regional levels, to promote the rice sector in West Africa.When the study on rice trade was completed we organised a policy dialogue (in the form of a webinar because of COVID-19) in which the ECOWAS Commissioner for agriculture and food participated alongside senior officials from ECOWAS member states and farm and industry executives. This dialogue took place at an opportune moment when the first draft of the new quinquennal action plan for the ECOWAS Rice offensive was being reviewed. The 2020-2025 action plan, which gives significant attention to trade policy issues, trade information and trade facilitation, probably benefited from our analysis and knowledge brokerage. Having analysed the political economy of rice trade in selected countries and reviewed the promising market regulation experience of Senegal, our work probably also helped the stakeholders of the Rice offensive think about how to &#x201C;work with the grain&#x201D; in ECOWAS member states. Overall, our work has helped shift the attention away from &#x201C;national rice self-sufficiency&#x201D; and towards rice market regulation and development challenges. At the end of this work we met and shared insights with the European Commission&#x2019;s directorate-general of agriculture and that of international partnerships too to inform their dialogue and programming processes with West African actors.This workstream has not only contributed to the impact area of sustainable economic transformation in Africa, putting emphasis on inclusive growth, sustainable agri-food systems, and regional economic integration, but also to that of effective international cooperation frameworks. Through the work in West Africa we contributed to the analysis of and the dialogue on the coherence of policies at different levels, with a focus on the agriculture-food-trade nexus, in particular with the policy coherence case study in Burkina Faso (https://ecdpm.org/fr/publications/etude-coherence-politiques-developpement-agricole-securite-alimentaire/) in the broader West African context. This study not only supported a dialogue in Burkina Faso, but it also informed a meeting of the High-level committee on food security of the UEMOA and allowed us to co-organise a side event at the 2017 United Nations High-level Political Forum (https://ecdpm.org/events/policy-coherence-and-2030-agenda/) on the SDGs. These dialogues raised awareness about the issue of policy coherence for sustainable agri-food value chains and systems.Throughout the implementation of the workstream we engaged in regional meetings and developed relationships with diverse actors. We responded not only to the demand of West African public actors but also to that of private ones - we helped integrate into the programming process of the PACBAO the perspectives of various non-state actors, including pastoralists organisations (RBM), small-scale market intermediaries, transporters (Borderless Alliance), butchers, researchers (CIRAD and ILRI) and NGOs (Acting for Life), including for a three-million euros &#x201C;challenge fund&#x201D;, implemented by the ECOWAS (https://araa.org/fr/news/avis-d%E2%80%99appel-%C3%A0-propositions-de-projets-du-projet-d%E2%80%99appui-%C3%A0-la-commercialisation-du-b%C3%A9tail) to support private sector initiatives.In the rice sector we reached out even farther to individual economic operators, which then helped convey the expectations for reforms of private sector actors to policy-makers and development partners. We consistently focused on providing a better understanding of private sector dynamics and fostered the involvement of diverse private actors into regional policy dialogues and programming processes. For instance, we provided input on public-private dialogue at a seminar of Delegations of the EU in West Africa for programming in the agricultural and food security areas. Engaging and collaborating with West African think tanks was central to our approach (CEDRES and IPAR notably, see for example a seminar of the UEMOA Think Tank Network (RTT-UEMOA) on research uptake and capacity development: https://my.ecdpm.org/deliverables/deliverable/-LONpH5M5G8qQS4RZsCo), to improve the effectiveness of policy process brokerage in this particular sectoral and geographic context.We considered gender in the work on the rice sector in West Africa. In parts of this sector, women play an important role - rice parboiling, marketing and trading, which was integrated into our context analysis. The study on rice trade, however, was not focused on those gender aspects and also human resources and budget constraints did not allow us to conduct a gender analysis. Yet, in the meetings on rice trade that we organised we ensured that women experts and practitioners were involved.</narrative>
