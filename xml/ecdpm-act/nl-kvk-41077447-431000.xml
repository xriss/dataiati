   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The main impact area for this workstream is sustainable economic transformation, while it also contributes to effective international cooperation frameworks (e.g. through improved DP coordination in regional CAADP processes) and to peaceful societies, social cohesion and human dignityOverall, we seek to support regional and international policy processes in/around West Africa and the Sahel for the development of inclusive and resilient markets, value chains and trade linkages and for employment creation, including in the agrifood sector. More generally, we will promote coherent policies for sustainable economic development in West Africa.Towards this aim, we seek to contribute to the following specific changes: Providing for a &#x201C;strategic testing ground&#x201D; cross-sectoral, synergistic think-and-do work, for capacity development for problem-driven approaches in a regional cooperation context, with a view to reducing the policy implementation gapPromoting institutional development to regulate and develop domestic and regional markets/value chainsStrengthening of policy coherence and effectiveness, particularly between trade, industry, agriculture and infrastructure, with a view to pursuing the 2030 AgendaMore effective coordination amongst development partners, particularly European actors</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">1. Contextualisation and importance           In West Africa, ECDPM delivers support to regional policy processes for the development of competitive and resilient agri-food value chains. This aims to respond to the rapidly growing demand for food in West African cities and to multiple obstacles to private sector development and regional trade, while ensuring that farm households receive better incomes and that more jobs are created in and around value chains, especially for the youth and women. We conduct analyses on the drivers of policy outcomes in particular sectors and identify politically feasible interventions that may be implemented to enable inclusive regional markets and trade in agri-food products. We facilitate the uptake of new knowledge through stakeholder networks and policy processes, particularly for the rice and livestock products sectors in West Africa. In doing so, we strengthen the knowledge brokering capacities of local research organisations in regional agri-food policy processes. We also provide advice to West African policymakers and European development partners who seek to facilitate regional agri-food trade and the development of agri-food enterprises sourcing, processing and marketing safe and nutritious products in the regional market.           2. Contributions made to the main changes envisaged           1) Enhance coherence and synergies of regional policies and practices (e.g., agriculture, industrialisation, trade, corridor development, peace and security) for food security.           In 2017 we completed a case study on the coherence of public policies at different levels, for the development of agri-food value chains in Burkina Faso. This study showed that although agricultural and rural policies now work more in synergy than in the past, there remains a &#x201C;policy gap&#x201D; between agriculture, industry and trade, which hampers the development of inclusive agri-food markets, cross-border trade and value chains. Similar policy gaps at levels of two regional organisations - the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and the West African Economic and Monetary Union (UEMOA) - as well as of EU international cooperation hinder the structuring of markets, the development of infrastructure and private investments in value chains. The study provided a basis for a public-private dialogue in Burkina Faso on these hindrances. It helped inform a meeting of the High-level committee on food security of the UEMOA, and a side event at the High-Level Political Forum of the UN for the Sustainable Development Goals. These dialogues raised awareness about the issue of policy coherence for sustainable agri-food value chains and triggered interest in further research and dialogue, particularly at the level of the regional organisations and some development partners (including the GIZ and the SDC). Incidentally, through Switzerland, this work has also fostered a more practical approach to PCD in the OECD focal points group. In parallel, we have supported development partners, including the Netherlands, and regional organisations in better understanding linkages between trade facilitation and agri-food value chain development and in brokering knowledge across different policy sectors (infrastructure, trade and agriculture).           2) Reduce gap between regional policy frameworks and their implementation (at regional/national/local level)           In 2017 we assisted ECOWAS and its development partner, the Swiss Development Cooperation, in formulating a regional programme to support the marketing and trade of livestock along and around trade corridors in West Africa. This programme was intended to contribute to the implementation of the regional agricultural investment plan and more specifically the regional programme for livestock in coastal countries. The design of the programme included financial and technical assistance to livestock-meat traders organisations and, more importantly, a challenge fund, overseen by the ECOWAS Commission, for entrepreneurs and producers alliances involved in the livestock-meat value chain - this type of private sector development instrument is relatively new in this region and this sector. We also played our brokering role by sharing information on this programming process with other development partners (notably the Dutch government and the African Development Bank).           3) Strengthen effective multi-stakeholder dialogue and collaboration between public and private value chain actors (incl. farmers&#x2019; organisations), particularly at regional level           Our work generally puts emphasis on the understanding of private-sector-led initiatives, especially those led by smallholder farmers and agri-food small and medium-sized enterprises. Our analyses shed light on the factors that allow them to develop innovative business models, responding to market incentives, gain better access to markets, and develop new products responding to an evolving consumer demand. When engaging in policy dialogues, we encourage institutions to involve a variety of private actors (for example, we suggested to the GIZ programmes supporting the rice sector to reach out to a regional farmers-led consultative mechanism as well as to the regional cereals traders organisation), strive to better inform public actors about real economic dynamics, and ensure that private actors gain a better understanding of public policies. As we build up our knowledge base and network relating to the region, we will be more proactive in fostering multi-stakeholder dialogues around specific issues and opportunities, particularly at the regional level.           4) More effective, coherent and coordinated support of development partners (DP), particularly the EU and its Member States.           Our analytical and knowledge brokerage roles take place in the context of EU-Africa, and particularly EU-West Africa relations. By sustaining a regular exchange of information with the Dutch government, EU institutions and other European member states, we foster better coordination among EU development partners as regards agri-food value chain development in West Africa, and stimulate the uptake of implementation approaches that can improve development effectiveness. In the coming years, we will encourage better integration of the implications of climate change for agricultural and pastoral value chains in West Africa, to facilitate a coherent European response to this challenge.           Gender           Gender issues have been considered, particularly when analysing real economic dynamics and policy implementation modalities, as in the case of the regional livestock marketing programme. In this sector, women play a major role in informal processing activities downstream in the value chain (offal and tripes). These activities have been included among the eligible activities for the enterprise development funding instrument that is a core component of that programme. Generally, our analysis considers the benefits and costs for different social and gender groups, including the youth and women. However, ECDPM&#x2019;s available capacities and (externally-funded) project budget constraints often limit the extent to which outcomes for particular groups, notably women, can be assessed. In the events and dialogues we facilitate, we strive to provide opportunities for expression for women and the youth. For example, when we organised multi-stakeholder dialogues in Burkina Faso for the policy coherence study, we ensured that a number of women were involved, such as the female president of the Burkinab&#xE8; federation of food industries or a female researcher from the national research institute for agriculture and the environment.</narrative>
