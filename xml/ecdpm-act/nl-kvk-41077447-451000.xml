       <narrative xml:lang="EN">1. Contextualisation and importance     The universal 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development puts great emphasis on the role of the private sector as a development partner and source of funding. The private sector &#x2013; in all its heterogeneity - provides jobs, produces goods and services &#x2013; including for the poor &#x2013;, generates tax revenues and through innovation can contribute to low-carbon and resource-efficient production methods. At the same time, when enterprises fail to act responsibly, they risk contributing to human rights violations, poor labour conditions and negative environmental impacts through their own operations or supply chains.     In line with Agenda 2030, African and European policymakers have in recent years developed new policy frameworks and instruments to engage with the private sector to leverage its contribution for sustainable development in Africa. Such private sector engagement (PSE) instruments include grants, guarantees, concessional loans, equity financing (or a combination of those through blending facilities), as well as non-financial mechanisms such as matchmaking services, policy dialogue, technical assistance and multi-stakeholder platforms. There is an interest and push from different stakeholders to further implement, develop and improve PSE tools.     The purpose of this workstream is therefore to contribute to more effective European and African policies, approaches and instruments to leverage and foster as well as partner with the African and European private sector for sustainable development in Africa. Specific changes relate to :     1) public and private actors in Europe and Africa that have more evidence-based practical insights to more effectively (re)design and implement PSE policies, approaches and instruments;     2) a reduced gap between PSE policies and their implementation;     3) more effective multi-stakeholder dialogue and collaboration for sustainable private sector development.     We seek to contribute to these changes by generating and sharing evidence-based and practical knowledge and by facilitating dialogue.     2. Contributions made     Within this broad framework, we have sought strategic opportunities to contribute to specific PSE policies/approaches/instruments, while also serving a broader audience. We provide one example for each of the envisaged changes. While activities may contribute to more than one of the envisaged changes, we have allocated them to the change they relate to most.     1) public and private actors in Europe and Africa that have more evidence-based practical insights to more effectively (re)design and implement Private Sector Engagement (PSE) policies, approaches and instruments     The Cashew Coalition in Benin brings together cashew value chain actors for the benefit of the development of the value chain. At the request of this coalition, we conducted an analysis of policy measures to develop the cashew value chain in C&#xF4;te d&#x2019;Ivoire, and how value chain actors are organized there, to draw lessons for Benin and potentially other cashew producing countries. As a result, the Cashew Coalition and its members have taken some of the findings into account in their advocacy agenda (e.g. related to a levy to finance the development of the value chain). They have also explicitly used the study on several occasions in their engagement with government officials, for example in the context of the elaboration of the decree organising and regulating the cashew nut sector in Benin. Reportedly, they continue to do so. Furthermore, as another indication of the value of the evidence-based practical insights that we provided, a representative of the Cashew Coalition expressed &#xAB; Thanks to [ECDPM] for the quality of their work which will certainly be a breviary for the actors of the cashew nut sector of Benin in their choice of policy for the development of the sector.&#x201D;  It is too early to assess actual influence on policies.     2) a reduced gap between PSE policies and their implementation     The European Commission increasingly seeks to support sustainable value chain development in Africa, as transpires from its renewed Aid for Trade Strategy (2017), the External Investment Plan and the Africa &#x2013; Europe Alliance for Sustainable Investment and Jobs, which was announced by Juncker in 2018. In this context, we have supported the Directorate General for International Cooperation and Development (DEVCO) to develop and facilitate a one-day value chains training for Commission staff. In the feedback form (filled in by 21 out of 36 participants), 95% indicated to recommend the training to others, which is an indication that the large majority found the training useful. After the face-to-face training, we were asked to contribute to the shooting of a short training video on sustainable value chains for the DEVCO Academy, to reach more staff members. Furthermore, we&#x2019;ve received a tentative request from DEVCO to contribute to a second face-to-face value chains training course. These examples illustrate the appreciation for and value of our support to strengthen the capacity of European Commission staff to implement the sustainable value chains ambitions reflected in the EU policy framework.     3) more effective multi-stakeholder dialogue and collaboration for sustainable private sector development (PSD)     In May 2017, the EU adopted a regulation that obliges actors importing tin, tantalum, tungsten, their ores and gold into the EU to ensure supply chain due diligence when importing from conflict- affected and high-risk areas. Against this background, the European Partnership for Responsible Minerals (EPRM) was created in 2016 by a select group of governments, companies and civil society organisations, as an accompanying measure to the Conflict Minerals Regulation. We have provided analytical support to the EPRM, by delving into the interests of different stakeholders and their implications for the partnership. It has resulted in an internal report for the EPRM and its members with practical recommendations, as well as a more concise Briefing Note with more general lessons for a broader audience. The EPRM Secretariat has expressed appreciation for the work, indicating that it provides useful recommendations. The findings are now feeding into EPRM Governing Board discussions. As such, they are well placed to help the EPRM stakeholders to further shape the partnership.      These are three examples of our work and its intermediate outcomes. Other actors that we directly worked with and supported include among others the African Development Bank, the Luxembourg Development Cooperation Agency, and the Donor Committee on Enterprise Development. Beyond the organisations directly targeted, our work is well read by a broader audience. For example, our discussion paper on artisanal gold mining in the DRC has had 1854 views so far and our briefing note on multi-stakeholder initiatives in the garment sector in the Netherlands and Germany has had 1050 views so far.     Following written outputs, we have been regularly asked to contribute to dialogues, as moderator, panelist, discussant or as round table participant. It shows an interest in our work and has provided additional opportunities to contribute to the envisaged changes. We&#x2019;ve received and responded positively to such requests from public sector actors, but also private sector actors (e.g. European Business Council for Africa) and civil society organisations (e.g. Flemish NGO network 11.11.11).     In some cases, we have doubts if our work has/will contribute significantly to the changes we had envisaged. This is the case for our support to the Donor Committee on Enterprise Development (DCED) to develop methodological guidance to measure five private sector development indicators. We thought it strategic to conduct this work, given the challenge of measuring private sector development impact, and as such to help reduce the gap between policy and implementation. However, while the work was welcomed by the DCED Working Group on Results Measurement, we have no clear signs yet that the guidance is actually being used by development practitioners.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">In line with Agenda 2030, African and European policymakers have in recent years developed new policy frameworks and instruments to engage with the private sector to leverage its contribution for sustainable development in Africa. Many African governments have stated they seek to improve the business environment and attract (domestic and foreign) investments to create more and better jobs, as part of their economic transformation and development strategies, which is also reflected in regional policies and the African Union (AU) Agenda 2063. In parallel, the EU and its Member States have put in place a range of different policies, instruments and approaches to stimulate inclusive and sustainable investments and economic activities in Africa. In the new European Consensus on Development, signed in May 2017, the EU and its Member States have committed to further increase their cooperation with the private sector notably through the European External Investment Plan (EIP) and to support responsible business conduct (RBC) and responsible management of supply chains, while also helping to create a more business-friendly environment that respects international human rights, labour and environmental standards. This has only increased since then, as evidenced for example by the Africa &#x2013; Europe Alliance for Sustainable Investment and Jobs, launched by the EU in 2018, and the European Commission&#x2019;s proposal for a comprehensive Africa strategy adopted in March 2020. Increasingly, climate change and environmental concerns more generally take centre stage, particularly in the context of the EU Green Deal, which should be taken into account in all EU policies, including when it comes to private sector engagement and development.Most recently the health and economic implications of the COVID-19 pandemic have disrupted global supply chains and has affected African and European economies. Businesses are facing bankruptcy at an unprecedented scale, resulting in job losses for millions, as well an increase in human rights violations. Disruptions to global value chains in the pandemic, as well as trade tensions, encourage companies to explore opportunities to bring production closer to end markets, which has implications for workers as well as the environment.The purpose of this workstream is therefore to contribute to more effective European and African policies, approaches and instruments to leverage and foster as well as partner with the African and European private sector for sustainable development in Africa. Specific changes relate to:1) public and private actors in Europe and Africa that have more evidence-based practical insights to more effectively (re)design and implement PSE policies, approaches and instruments;2) a reduced gap between PSE policies and their implementation;3) more effective multi-stakeholder dialogue and collaboration for sustainable private sector development.We seek to contribute to these changes by generating and sharing evidence-based and practical knowledge and by facilitating dialogue.As part of our work on green transition, we have in the last few years increasingly looked at how the shift towards a more circular economy is integrated in the foreign policies of EU and member states. For instance, for PBL Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency, we wrote a paper (http://www.ecdpm.org/dp274, 2020) on how climate and circular economy are integrated in the foreign policies of the EU, Finland, France, Germany, Sweden and Switzerland, looking at lessons the Netherlands could draw from this. Following a webinar on our paper with Dutch government officials from several ministries, we received a specific request from the Sustainable Economic Development Department (DDE) at the Netherlands Ministry of Foreign Affairs, asking us to present our discussion paper to a group of DDE officials, to help inform the drafting of the environmental strategy of DDE. We also received good feedback from PBL on our work, based on which we received two further requests from them, including research on green recovery strategies of the EU and other countries (https://ecdpm.org/publications/towards-global-green-recovery-cases-denmark-eu-germany-netherlands-uk/, 2021) and the role of low- and middle-income countries in the circular economic transition of the Netherlands and the EU (http://www.ecdpm.org/bn142, 2022). While it is too early to comment on the outcome of these papers, we have received a positive response on the latest paper from Mr Jaime de Bourbon de Parme, the climate envoy of the Netherlands, which demonstrates the potential reach of our work.To give an example of our efforts to improve policy implementation, we have worked towards more effective civil society engagement in the development and sustainability dimensions of EU trade agreements. In 2020 we published a study (http://www.ecdpm.org/dp276) on the topic, including a concise list of recommendations (http://www.ecdpm.org/bn119) to enhance the effectiveness of the Domestic Advisory Groups (DAGs) of trade agreements. Following up on our work we actively engaged with several organisations that were members of these DAGs, including participating in a discussion between DAG members on ways to strengthen non-state actor engagement. Concretely, the engagement led to a non-paper (https://www.cnvinternationaal.nl/dag) on improving the functioning of the advisory groups, which was endorsed by all DAGs (2021). The paper served as input for the first ever (online) all-DAG event organised by the European Economic and Social Committee, which ECDPM also participated in. Several participants referred to recommendations in the paper. The paper serves as an input for the (ongoing) review process of the European Commission&#x2019;s 15 action plan on trade and sustainable development. A step in this direction is the recent meeting (December 2021) between ECDPM, a selection of DAG members and the cabinet of EU Trade Commissioner Dombrovskis to discuss the recommendations of the non-paper.Our work on EU measures for fairer and more sustainable textile value chains, is an example of our efforts to promote more effective multi-stakeholder dialogue and cooperation. In 2019, we published a research paper on the topic which was co-funded by three fair trade-related organisations (Oxfam-Magasins du monde, the World Fair Trade Organization-Europe and the Fair Trade Advocacy Office). Based on our paper, and with our support, these three organisations together with other civil society organisations drafted an EU shadow strategy (https://fairtrade-advocacy.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Civil-Society-European-Strategy-for-Sustainable-Textiles.pdf) in support of fair and sustainable textile supply chains (2020). The initiative provided an opportunity for organisations from different fields to come together and agree on a comprehensive set of proposals for EU measures to address both environmental and social dimensions in textile value chains. Such collaboration is far from straightforward. Priorities, ways of working and expertise differ and it can be challenging to find each other in the first place, as people operate in different fields. Furthermore, to facilitate dialogue between the private sector and civil society, ECDPM was invited to moderate a discussion (in the context of the shadow strategy) between the civil society coalition and the policy hub (representing the apparel and footwear industry).While policy influence is difficult to assess, it is worth noting that the European Commission&#x2019;s Circular Economy Action Plan (https://ec.europa.eu/environment/circular-economy/) launched in 2020 includes the commitment to develop a comprehensive textiles strategy. While it is difficult to ascertain if and how much our paper contributed to this development, one of our clients expressed: &#x201C;I am sure your (ECDPM) paper and workshop played a key role&#x201D; (email Sergi Corbalan, Director Fair Trade Advocacy Office, 06/03/&#x2019;20). In addition, 50 MEP have sent a letter (https://fairtrade-advocacy.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Letter_ShadowStrategy_3rdJune2020.pdf, 2020) to the European Commission endorsing the EU shadow strategy in support of fair and sustainable textile supply chains.As regards to gender, we have tried to integrate (but not focus on) gender related issues in policy analysis, with a view to help key stakeholders in their efforts to promote gender sensitive private sector development policies/ approaches/ instruments. We have contributed to the evaluation of the integration of gender in EU development cooperation. This included an analysis of support provided to economic empowerment of women and girls.We are also involved in a project with the Maastricht University, FRONTIERi and IDH on women, wellbeing and work in Ethiopia (https://fasos.maastrichtuniversity.nl/weekly/three-fasos-researchers-secure-nwo-wotro-grant/), with particular focus on the garment and horticulture sector. The project has encountered some delays and setbacks due to COVID-19 and the deteriorating security situation in Ethiopia.</narrative>
