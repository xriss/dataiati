   <narrative xml:lang="EN">16. From Policy Coherence for Development to Policy Coherence for Sustainable Development</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This work is about two closely linked but to some extent separate sub work streams. The first is at the level of the international debate on PCSD within the framework of the 2030 Agenda. The second deals with issues of policy incoherence in relation to specific dimensions of development and specific nexuses between policies. The two levels are envisaged as running separately but concurrently with linkages back and forth as each can benefit from the other. For the second level it is possible for ECDPM to work on several thematic cases - here we have only described one.For the first sub workstream, we aim to contribute to: 1) The conceptual solidity and operational effectiveness of PCSD as a means of implementation of the 2030 Agenda are enhanced based on past experiences with PCD and a robust methodology to assess policy incoherencies in regard to key development objectives; to clarify the concept of PCSD (SDG 17:14) and encourage a debate on how it is understood and can be used in achieving the SDGs in different contexts; and to develop and promote an understanding of how PCD and PCSD relate to each other and how they are used and promoted, in Europe and in Africa.2) African public and private actors&#x2019; engagement in policy dialogues related to PCSD and African policy frameworks and processes addressing policy incoherencies are more effective in their specific contextsThese changes should contribute directly to the ECDPM impact areas: Effective international cooperation frameworks, and Legitimate and accountable public institutions. More indirectly they should also be positive factors for achieving the other two ECDPM impact areas.For the second sub workstream, we aim to contribute to 3) In selected areas, European state and EU economic &amp; financial policies are more coherent with sustainable development objectives, in Europe and Africa; in particular, agricultural, industrial and trade-investment  policies of European development partners which are more coherent with African sustainable agricultural development and food security and improved nutrition goals as well as more synergistic with their development cooperation policies, in particular at the level of African countries and regional economic communities. Other possible thematic areas include: The development-security nexus; climate and climate and economic policies; the fight against illicit financial flows, as part of domestic resource mobilisation.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Summary    ECDPM has a long track record of working on issues of policy coherence, in the spirit of the commitment to policy coherence for development (PCD) by actors such as the EU (in its Maastricht Treaty) and of the commitment to policy coherence for sustainable development (PCSD) by the international community since the adoption of the 2030 Agenda for sustainable development. This work stream responds to challenges such as: how can countries navigate and operationalise these international commitments, how to ensure that policy making processes are in line with those, and how to promote awareness of issues where policy coherence is most crucial and/or missing?     In 2017 we worked on clarifying the PCSD concept and how PCD and PCSD relate to each other and we encouraged debate on this in different circles. In 2018 we continue to provide conceptual insights, while continuing to produce additional thematic research. We also laid some groundwork for future research bringing together the expertise of developing and developed countries&#x2019; think tanks to reflect on policy coherence challenges, including methodological ones, and to bridge the gap between generic thinking and policy recommendations on policy coherence, and thematic ones in specific policy areas.     Our understanding is that slowly, more actors are starting to become active on PCSD. For instance, the OECD-led PCSD Partnership for the UNDP is attracting more members, who report on their respective contributions annually (a few items per member and per year). The UN is also organising a training course on promoting PCSD in Spring 2018, together with the National University of Singapore and the Hertie School of Governance in Berlin. Beyond PCSD strictly, countries are more and more factoring sustainable development goals into their policy making, with the result of an additional interest for coordination between policy silos and within policy nexuses.    Providing a solid conceptual basis to enable dialogue    ECDPM&#x2019;s Discussion Paper 210 brings together four approaches to integrated policy making, and analyses these in a comparative framework which focuses on their characteristics in terms of rationale, mechanisms and impact. While the PCD approach was known, especially among PCD circles, the paper broadens the perspective, as the other approaches help to extend the scope for promoting coherence across  the whole spectrum of sustainable development. Based on the lessons learned from the four approaches for integrated policy making, the paper sketches a set of guiding ideas for a PCSD system and provides  a set of 5 recommendations to consider when promoting PCSD, which includes considering PCD as a valuable contribution to broader PCSD - a nuance which ECDPM has advocated and which was, most meaningfully, adopted by the EU with its new European Consensus on Development in 2017. Another form of involvement of ECDPM to promote the availability of knowledge to decision makers consisted in taking stock of the implications of the &#x2018;good enough governance&#x2019; movement (as opposed to &#x2018;good governance&#x2019;) and draw some recommendations for policy coherence work. This resulted in an opinion piece forthcoming within the OECD&#x2019;s PCSD partnership flagship report.    Outreach to inform and empower multiple actors    This outreach covers steps towards enhancing the conceptual clarity and operational effectiveness of PCSD as well as developing an understanding of how PCD and PCSD relate to each other. Presentations of the paper (at the United Nations&#x2019; High Level Political Forum 2017 (HLPF); at seminars in countries such as Luxembourg, and in international fora such as the OECD and EU focal points meetings) also informed more actors and encouraged debate on how the PCSD concept is understood and can be used. This was done on the basis of fostering partnerships with multiple stakeholders: ECDPM paired with the Committee on World Food Security (CFS) for the side event at the HLPF. To improve the outreach within this context and afterwards, ECDPM created a short animation video explaining the concept of policy coherence. Building on the dual expertise of ECDPM in the fields of policy coherence and political economy analysis, we organised a training workshop at the ECDPM head office in Maastricht in August 2017 for a coalition of Dutch NGOs working on advocacy for policy coherence, as part of the effort to empower institutions and actors in the promotion of policy coherence.    Consolidate and mobilise expertise of a community of dedicated practitioners    A platform for discussion facilitated by ECDPM, the community of practice on policy coherence for development (PCD CoP) played a role in bringing about more inclusive dialogues and processes. This community bringing together PCD focal points from half a dozen European ministries of foreign affairs and a few observers from the EU and OECD, offered more occasions for deepened information sharing and discussion. The CoP meets twice a year, and the last workshops in Stockholm (April 2017), Brussels (November 2017) and Berlin (March 2018) were the occasion to discuss a set of challenges that arise in the promotion of more coherent and integrated policies. The CoP also offers opportunities to reinforce partnerships between stakeholders: for instance it invited the NGO network CONCORD to present a report on the EU&#x2019;s impact assessments (a tool to promote policy coherence for development) to a group of government officials. The expertise of this group is also pooled together for the purpose of influencing policy coherence design - for instance by responding to an open public consultation on PCD launched in spring 2018 by the European Commission as part of its Evaluation on EU efforts to promote PCD. In early 2018 we conducted an internal online survey of all the participants in the 6 CoP workshops over the past 3 years to learn lessons and see how the Workshops and the running of the CoP&#x2019;s online platform could be improved and fine-tuned.    Dive deeper into thematic areas crucial to policy coherence, and build synergies    ECDPM&#x2019;s wide range of thematic expertise includes several issues for which policy coherence is particularly crucial, and often stressed within the 2030 Agenda. These include food security, migration management, industrialisation, the fight against illicit financial flows, etc. We consolidated the knowledge base on these issues with an attention to relating them to the broader discussions on policy coherence for sustainable development. In 2017 we finalised a discussion paper on policy coherence for food security in Burkina Faso, which was also presented at the HLPF in the event with CFS, which showed the potential for cross-fertilisation of generic work on policy coherence and thematic work. This research was undertaken in partnership with the Burkinab&#xE9; think tank Centre d&apos;&#xE9;tudes, de Documentation et de Recherche &#xC9;conomiques et Sociales (Cedres), and sheds a light on multiple factors at play in determining policy coherence outcomes in West Africa, ranging from the internal policies of distant but important actors such as the EU to the institutional policy coherence of countries in the region.    Ongoing and next steps to expand the contribution    Currently ECDPM is working on a thematic discussion paper applying the analysis of policy coherence system to the case of illicit financial flows, overviewing the efforts in this field in Africa and in the European Union. The goal is to inform policy design and to make the product of research more available to policy makers across sectors in the two regions. ECDPM is also participating in a discussion with think tanks located in developing countries (from the Southern Voice network) and partners, which should result in a methodology-oriented workshop on PCSD in June at ECDPM&#x2019;s headquarters in Maastricht for further research on policy coherence. This builds, among others, on the financial support granted to ECDPM by Switzerland and Denmark with the specific goal of supporting the production of relevant knowledge on policy coherence. The aim is to pool expertise and foster a coalition for research, in order to incrementally produce new insights on how selected developing and developed countries tackle policy coherence, both from a generic angle and thematic ones. The ultimate goal is to provide recommendations which ensure that policies are more integrated and coherent.     Gender dimension    So far gender concerns did not emerge during this work at least on the more systemic level at which activities on this workstream have been conducted.  But in considering specific cases of policy coherence it is clear that gender issues are often very evident and need to be tackled. Thus in the side event at the UN HLPF the case of policy coherence for food security was used and in that gender issues were covered.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Interest in policy coherence and uptake of the principle and methods to pursue it continue to grow slowly in a variety of circles, with the reference to Policy Coherence for Sustainable Development (PCSD) in the 2030 Agenda (SDG 17:14) proving to be an important driver. The discussion on whether or not PCSD replaces PCD (policy coherence for development) has settled down with most actors accepting the position promoted by the EU, notably in its new European Consensus on Development; that is: PCD is a contribution to PCSD and also remains important in its own right. The United Nations High Level Political Forum each July remains an important moment for international exchange on PCSD and a growing number of actors from all continents are contributing to this conversation. In Europe there is also some increased awareness of PCSD and willingness to work with it, although it remains more limited in policy sectors beyond that of international development.The PCSD concept is gradually becoming clearer and understood by a growing number of stakeholders though there is still a long way to go. Many users of the PCD concept increasingly understand how it relates to PCSD. Moreover, some new users of PCSD who were not familiar with PCD in the past (and therefore do not need to transition from one to the other) are taking an interest in the past experience with PCD to see what lessons can be learnt for tackling PCSD. Yet others are renewing or starting efforts under PCD, or more generically policy coherence, that aim to build on PCSD.ECDPM is actively contributing to all these discussions. Other important contributors to the debate are the OECD PCSD Unit, United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) which is charged with identifying indicators for SDG 17:14 and the European Commission. ECDPM&#x2019;s Policy Coherence Community of Practice (CoP) continues to operate with a few EU member states plus Switzerland joining regularly but also the European Commission and the OECD (two meetings a year). During the COVID-19 lockdown the 11th meeting of the community was held as a webinar. In this online meeting, discussions focused on the implications of the COVID-19 and its economic and political fallouts on emerging issues and interest in promoting policy coherence. A good example of the value of the informal exchanges the CoP encourages was the decision by the participants to jointly submit comments and amendments to the OECD for improvements to the draft OECD Council Recommendation on policy coherence that was subsequently agreed in December 2019.Another indicator of the interest in PCSD (and the lessons from PCD) is ECDPM&#x2019;s participation in a Horizon 2020 project led by the Potsdam Climate Institute (PIK) called CASCADES, on the cascading risks for Europe of events caused by climate change around the world. One of ECDPM&#x2019;s contributions to CASCADES is a paper on the EU experience of PCD and the lessons to be learnt for PCSD that is published in autumn of 2020 (https://ecdpm.org/publications/promoting-policy-coherence-lessons-learned-eu-development-cooperation/). This will provide an input to the reflection on the overall conceptual framework of CASCADES and to the drafting of policy recommendations emerging from the project..Another output on PCSD was ECDPM&#x2019;s involvement in the UN HLPF in 2019 where we were called upon to facilitate two sessions on PCSD in side events organised by the OECD and by UNDESA/UNEP. For these particular sessions we were also involved in recommending panelists from the global South from among ECDPM&#x2019;s network.ECDPM was also involved in activities on policy coherence responding to demand for expertise by a diversity of other actors, ranging from the European NGO federation CONCORD, the think tank CIDOB, the Scottish government or the Slovenian NGO council. Methodologies to promote policy coherence were integrated in papers advising policy-makers on topics including agriculture and nutrition, political governance, trade and climate.Think tanks that are members of ECDPM&#x2019;s partner coalition Southern Voice have been particularly active and take a growing interest in PCSD as part of their wider work on the 2030 Agenda. It is also apparent that government officials in various countries in Africa, but also in Asia and Latin America are engaging in policy dialogues around PCSD. Our work increasingly aims to engage with African and Global South peers to promote joint work on policy coherence.In the EU the new von der Leyen Commission has put forward an EU Green Deal as one of its flagship policies for its mandate. This is led by Frans Timmermans, the First Vice-President, who in the previous Commission was responsible for the Better Regulation Package (BRP) and the EU response to the 2030 Agenda. In his initial statements on the Green Deal it is apparent that he sees it as directly linked to the 2030 Agenda framework and the BRP which gives a prominent place to policy coherence will be central to policy making for the Green Deal. PCSD is thus finding its way in to EU policy thinking.But there is also evidence that this is being picked up by EU member states. A recent report (https://ecdpm.org/publications/integration-climate-change-circular-economy-foreign-policies/integration-climate-change-circular-economy-foreign-policies-discussion-paper-274-june-2020-ecdpm/) that ECDPM produced for PBL, the Netherlands Environmental Planning Agency, addresses the question of how climate change and circular economy ideas are factored into the foreign policies of a number of EU member states. Equally at the sub-national level the Scottish Government external affairs department invited ECDPM to facilitate a workshop (March 2020) in Edinburgh of officials across the government as to how they could promote PCSD in their efforts to address the 2030 Agenda in Scotland, particularly a &#x2018;Just Transition&#x2019;. More widely, policies ranging across the spectrum of ECDPM&#x2019;s activities have been advised on how to improve policy coherence where applicable.See more on our website: https://ecdpm.org/dossiers/policy-coherence/. Gender has not been a central focus of this workstream, but it is evident that PCSD as a concept also implies coherence with policies to promote gender that is a key factor for sustainable development. In workshops and policy events that we contributed to (for examples, the research workshop co-organised with Southern Voice and the UNEP-sponsored side event on policy coherence at the 2019 HLPF), and wherever possible we ensured that participants or speakers were balanced in terms of gender so that different perspectives were represented.</narrative>
