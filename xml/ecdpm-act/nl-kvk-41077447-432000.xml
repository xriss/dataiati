  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Regarding ECDPM&#x2019;s centre-wide theory of change, the main impact that we seek to contribute to through this work stream is (4) Sustainable economic transformation, but we expect our work will also contribute somewhat indirectly to (1) Effective international cooperation frameworks and (2) Accountable institutions and engaged citizensWe aim to contribute to all six outcomes listed in the ECDPM theory of change, with the most direct contribution being made towards (vi) Effective multi-actor partnerships and (ii) Inclusive dialogue and processes, and more indirect contributions towards the other outcomes, particularly (i) Informed actors.Specifically, through this workstream, we aim to promote (the establishment and/or strengthening of) inclusive multi-stakeholder frameworks for agri-food value chains in Eastern and Southern Africa to facilitate dialogue and partnerships between value chain stakeholders (including private sector actors, public authorities and relevant CSOs) aimed at developing and implementing solutions to pressing challenges affecting the development of the value chains and affecting trade in the agri-food products in question (particularly regional trade).The aim is to establish these frameworks at the sub-regional level in order to focus on challenges that i) require regional cooperation to address (e.g. around particular trade barriers), or ii) for which regional cooperation could complement national-level solutions (e.g. sharing lessons on common challenges), but where appropriate (i.e. based on context and demand), we may also support the establishment of such frameworks at a national or sub-national level.In addition, we aim to contribute to a better understanding among local policymakers, value chain/food system actors, development partners and other relevant stakeholders of: (i) key challenges affecting agri-food value chains, and potential solutions to these challenges; (ii) opportunities to promote greater private investment in local value chains and to ensure investments in these value chains, and policies to support their development, contribute to sustainable outcomes; and (iii) feasible approaches to promoting multi-stakeholder engagement for (local, national or regional) agri-food value chain development.If successful, the more inclusive processes (value chain frameworks) and more effective partnerships involving better informed actors can and should contribute to better and more coherent policies for sustainable agri-food trade, investment and value chain development, more effective implementation of these policies and more empowered agri-food institutions and value chain actors.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">1. Contextualisation and importance        The development of more efficient, inclusive and sustainable regional agro-food value chains in Eastern and Southern Africa can contribute greatly to improved food security and nutrition in the region, as well as to the economic and agricultural transformation of the region. This workstream therefore aims to support regional actors in Eastern and Southern Africa to devise and effectively implement regional policies that facilitate the development of key regional agro-food value chains, and to pilot innovative approaches such as regional public-private value chain coordination platforms. The workstream also aims to support efforts to strengthen institutions involved in these processes, ensure relevant non-state actors are able to participate effectively in these processes and promote improved donor coordination in support of these processes. In addition, it aims to promote greater coherence between agriculture and trade policies at national and regional levels in Eastern and Southern Africa.         2. Contributions made to each of the main changes        More effective regional policies in Eastern and Southern Africa that contribute to regional and national level food and nutrition security objectives        Working closely with the Food and Agricultural Organisation of the United Nations (FAO), ECDPM helped formulate a Regional Agricultural Investment Plan for the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) . In particular, ECDPM developed a plan that focuses on reducing barriers to regional agricultural trade and improving farmers&#x2019; access to markets. Including for example, the establishment of a regional public-private platform for the dairy value chain in East Africa. This scheme is identified as a pilot for an approach to establish regional coordination platforms to promote key agro-food value chains that can contribute to improved food security and nutrition (and agricultural transformation) in Eastern and Southern Africa.        More coherent policies on agriculture, trade, food security and rural development, with a focus on more effective public-private platforms for RVC development        The inclusion of a component on reducing trade barriers and a scheme to pilot regional value chain platforms in the COMESA Regional Agricultural Investment Plan serves to mainstream trade issues and perspectives into regional agricultural policy in Eastern and Southern Africa, thereby promoting greater policy coherence at the regional level. ECDPM also collaborated with FAO on a project to promote greater coherence of agriculture and trade policies in African countries. Among other things, this project identified opportunities for promoting greater policy coherence in the four focus countries (Mozambique, Rwanda, Tanzania and Zambia), and kickstarted a process of engagement with the governments of the these countries to facilitate the development of more coherent policies and programmes in the future.        Civil society and private sector actors are more effectively participating in regional (and national) CAADP policy processes        ECDPM also took steps to ensure participation by civil society and private sector actors in the formulation of the COMESA Regional Agricultural Investment Plan. ECDPM and COMESA engaged extensively with dairy stakeholders to develop the Plan&#x2019;s scheme for a Regional Dairy Platform, while ECDPM and FAO co-facilitated a multi-stakeholder consultation on the overall Plan. In addition, the FAO-ECDPM project on national agriculture-trade policy coherence involved national workshops with stakeholders from government, the private sector and civil society to identify challenges and opportunities for greater agriculture-trade policy coherence including through mainstreaming trade objectives and issues into national CAADP-related policies and processes.        Policies are more effectively implemented and potential synergies are exploited        The COMESA Regional Agricultural Investment Plan has been finalised, but not much progress has been made on implementation yet. ECDPM is currently finalising arrangements to be in a position to support implementation of the Plan&#x2019;s Regional Dairy Platform beginning in 2019. The establishment of the Platform, and hopefully other regional agro-food value chains in the future, will seek to build on ongoing efforts by FAO and others to promote greater coherence between national agriculture and trade policies in various African countries, some of which are participating in these platforms.        More, better aligned and coordinated support of development partners to regional CAADP and other regional value chain (RVC) policies        ECDPM has already begun engaging with development partners to provide coordinated support to the establishment of the Regional Dairy Platform, and this engagement will continue during the implementation of the COMESA Regional Agricultural Investment Plan, including through a donor engagement workshop. In addition, ECDPM co-produced a Synthesis Report of the FAO-ECDPM project on agriculture-trade policy coherence, which, among other things, provides recommendations on aligning and coordinating donor support.        Key value chain stakeholders from the public and private sector are better informed about impact and effectiveness of certain policies        Both the COMESA Regional Agricultural Investment Plan and its Regional Dairy Platform have/will have dedicated monitoring and evaluation processes that ensure stakeholders are informed about their impact. ECDPM will be involved in drawing lessons from the implementation of the Platform (and possibly other ongoing initiatives related to COMESA Plan).         3. Did you consider gender issues during the process of engagement?        This workstream has not directly addressed gender issues during the past two years. Nevertheless, given that women face significant challenges to their participation in the dairy value chain (and other value chains) in East Africa, the Regional Dairy Platform scheme identifies the need to adopt a gender perspective. Gender issues will therefore be addressed more directly during the implementation of the Regional Plan and the establishment of the Regional Dairy Platform.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Originally this workstream sought to leverage ECDPM&#x2019;s excellent relations and ongoing partnerships with the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations, the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) and various other regional organisations in Eastern and Southern Africa working in the areas of agriculture, food trade and food security, to support the development of more efficient, inclusive and sustainable regional agri-food value chains in Eastern and Southern Africa. In particular, we sought to assist COMESA and other regional organisations in Eastern and Southern Africa to develop and implement conducive regional policies and actions to facilitate agri-food trade and value chain development in line with continental policy frameworks for promoting agricultural development and food security in Africa.Over time, however, this workstream has evolved. Having supported the drafting of - and the engagement of stakeholders with - the COMESA Regional Agricultural Investment Plan, we have not been involved in supporting its implementation. This is largely due to the fact that there has been little to no movement on its implementation over the past 3 years. We also made the strategic decision to align our work in Eastern and Southern Africa more closely to our workstream on promoting sustainable food systems, and took advantage of an excellent opportunity to do so through a large project we have been implementing with FAO on promoting sustainable investment in agri-food value chains in specific countries in Eastern (and West) Africa.As a result, the focus of our work has shifted from supporting regional value chain development (platforms) and regional food trade, to supporting efforts to ensure agri-food value chain development processes at national and local levels have positive impacts on local food systems. Through our work we have sought to stimulate more private investment in local and national agri-food value chains (in Ethiopia), while also identifying opportunities to ensure that such investments contribute to improving the economic, social and environmental sustainability of local food systems, and supporting multi-stakeholder collaboration to capitalise on these opportunities.A) Improved understanding &#x200B;of challenges and opportunities for agri-food value chains and for promoting greater private investment in agri-food value chains and ensuring such investment contributes to more sustainable local food systems, including through multi-stakeholder engagementEarly on in this workstream we co-organised with FAO a regional workshop to inform relevant food and agriculture stakeholders in Eastern and Southern Africa (including farmers organisations, regional food trade bodies, development partners, and COMESA member state representatives) about the COMESA Regional Agricultural Investment Plan, its objectives and the envisaged roles and responsibilities that various actors would have to take up in order for the Plan to be successful. This workshop informed the participants about some of the key challenges to agri-food trade and value chain development in the region, and the solutions the COMESA Plan was proposing to address these.Together with FAO, we also facilitated national multi-stakeholder workshops in four African countries on improving policy coherence and aligning policy processes for agricultural trade. These workshops informed participants, drawn from national government ministries and agencies, the local private sector and local civil society organisations, about relevant challenges and opportunities for better aligning existing national (agriculture and trade) policies and policy processes to support regional agri-food trade and value chain development. We also presented findings from these workshops during a panel session at the 2017 Global aid For Trade Review (https://ecdpm.org/events/aid-trade-global-review-2017/) in Geneva, with the hope of reaching a broader set of agricultural trade stakeholders at the regional level and influencing aid for trade policy towards a greater focus on promoting regional agricultural trade in Africa.In early 2021, we published and disseminated, through our and FAO&#x2019;s in-country, regional and global networks, an analysis of the Ethiopian food system we produced in collaboration with FAO. This study provides an overview of major political economy dynamics affecting the food system in Ethiopia as well as the key sustainability challenges affecting the food system, including in relation to youth unemployment and gender inequality. This analysis identifies opportunities to stimulate private investment in particular value chains in Ethiopia with a view to promoting more sustainable outcomes in local food systems, and in doing so, lays the groundwork for multi-stakeholder collaboration to stimulate sustainable investment in agri-food value chains in Ethiopia. In this regard, we are also working on additional studies identifying opportunities and recommendations for promoting sustainable investment in the dairy value chain in the Oromia region of Ethiopia, which, among other things, we will use to inform ongoing investment value chain development activities in dairy in the region.B) Inclusive multi-stakeholder frameworks for agri-food value chainsIn line with our objective of supporting the establishment of regional dairy platform in East Africa under COMESA&#x2019;s Regional Agricultural Investment Plan, we organised and facilitated a meeting of dairy value chain actors (dairy companies and cooperatives, farmers representatives, regional organisations, dairy sector experts) in Eastern and Southern Africa during the COMESA Business Council Agro-Industry Dialogue in May 2017 and during this event coordinated the establishment of a multi-stakeholder dairy sub-sector working group and the formulation by the members of this group of regional policy recommendations that were later adopted by COMESA.Although our work on the East African Dairy Platform lost traction as the implementation of COMESA&#x2019;s Regional Agricultural Investment Plan stalled, we have continued to focus on dairy value chain issues in the context of our work in Ethiopia with FAO. Through this work we are facilitating collaboration between dairy value chain stakeholders in the Oromia region to create a more conducive environment for investment in the dairy value chain and to ensure that investments in dairy in the region contribute to a more inclusive, resilient sustainable local food system.</narrative>
