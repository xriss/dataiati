       <narrative xml:lang="EN">1. Context and outcome areas      This work stream on Integrated European External Action pursues the following outcome areas: * Better informed policy-making process in Europe and Africa.
* More inclusive European policy dialogues and cooperation processes.
* More effective, coherent and integrated European policies to tackle global challenges.
* Reduced gap between European external action policy and implementation.
* More empowered actors in Europe and Africa. 
* Stronger links between distinct policy domains of diplomacy, development, security, trade/economic; energy/climate/natural resources diplomacy.
* Better equipped European institutions and non-state actors to operate in a legal and policy framework that is fit for purpose to effectively contribute to the 2030 agenda.
We cluster these outcome areas as follows: (i) better informed, more effective and inclusive policy-making processes in Europe; (ii) better informed and more empowered actors in Africa; (iii) reducing the policy-to-implementation gap.2. ECDPM contributions to these outcome areas:2.1. Better informed, more effective and inclusive policy-making processes in EuropeThis first cluster concentrates on better informed policy-making processes in Europe; more inclusive European policy dialogues and cooperation processes; more effective, coherent and integrated European policies to tackle global challenges; and more empowered actors in Europe.As a non-partisan broker of dialogue on development policy issues, ECDPM looks at the possible implications of European policies particularly on foreign, security and development policy and relationships with Africa. Under this workstream, it has done so notably with regard to the EU Budget (a) and Brexit (b).A. Highlighting the strategic choices under the future EU BudgetOur work on the preparation of the next EU budget (the Multiannual Financial Framework - or MFF - for the period 2021-2027, including the future generation of EU External Financing Instruments) aims at a better informed process and more effective, coherent, integrated European policies to tackle global challenges. Indeed, our publications highlight the strategic political and technical choices that should be made in the MFF in view of aligning the EU&#x2019;s global aspirations, resources and financial instruments, thus ensuring that EU development policy is better integrated in EU external action.Our substantial analysis is collected in a special dossier. These contributions have received positive feedback, and we continue to receive many invitations and requests that illustrate the relevance and quality of this work, which has also been quoted in various media. We have participated in numerous formal and informal events in Brussels and in EU member states where behind-the-scene work was being done to formulate positions, allowing us to reach out and disseminate our analysis more effectively to a broad range of decision makers in all EU institutions.B. Explaining the challenges of Brexit from a European perspectiveAs a knowledge broker, both in written outputs and on the occasion of events, ECDPM aims at outlining and communicating all the options for continued collaboration between the EU and the UK, thus favouring a constructive and inclusive dialogue.ECDPM has taken at least three initiatives to encourage negotiations and discussions around Brexit to be more inclusive, both content-wise (putting development on the agenda of Brexit-negotiators and influencers) and in terms of actors (putting these negotiators and influencers in contact with the development and European foreign policy worlds).* Our substantial analysis on Brexit is collected in a special dossier. ECDPM notably published a Choice Matrix: Future Options for EU-UK collaboration on international cooperation. This choice matrix triggered great interest with DFID officials who now seem to refer to it in their conversations with European counterparts. This would illustrate how ECDPM contributed to improve informed policy-making processes in Europe. 
* ECDPM organised an informal meeting under the Chatham House rule in Brussels with Brexit Coordinators, the EU Working Party on Development Cooperation (CODEV), a member of M. Barnier&#x2019;s Advisory Board as well as external experts, and with the participation of the UK Representation to the EU &#x21D2; More inclusive European policy dialogues and cooperation processes &#x21D2; Stronger links between distinct policy domains of diplomacy, development, and foreign affairs.
* ECDPM organised an event with the Dublin City University Brexit Institute on Brexit and development cooperation. The Irish Minister of State for International Development, the Chair of the European Parliament&#x2019;s Development committee, the DFID Europe Department, several experts as well as representatives from the civil society and the NGO sector were present, and the audience actively participated. The Director of the Brexit Institute, who also took active part in the event, is part of Michel Barnier&#x2019;s Advisory Board. Together with Dublin City University, ECDPM thus brought international development to a Brexit expert forum. This, together with, to our knowledge, the first official speech from a development minister from Brexit, form two primeurs &#x21D2; More effective, coherent and integrated European policies to tackle global challenges.
* In addition to our writing, brokering and formal events, a regular informal exchange has been had between ECDPM staff and member states since January 2017 until now &#x21D2; More empowered actors in Europe.
2.2. Better informed policy-making process in Africa / More empowered actors in AfricaA. Addressing the challenges of Brexit from an African perspectiveA special issue of ECDPM&#x2019;s magazine Great Insights entitled &#x201C;Beyond Brexit&#x201D; was widely circulated with members from the development and Brexit communities as well as with civil society and academics. Most of the articles in this magazine focus on Brexit from an African or Global South perspective. By taking the perspective of how Brexit will impact countries beyond Europe, we have informed and potentially empowered African actors in this debate.The informal meeting under the Chatham House rule in Brussels about Brexit also included a leading African expert on global dialogue, again emphasising the need to understand Brexit also through an African lens.In the same vein, an ECDPM policy officer has published an article in the magazine Jeune Afrique entitled &#x2018;Pourquoi l&#x2019;Afrique a tout &#xE0; craindre d&#x2019;un Brexit dur&#x2019; (Why Africa should be worried about a Hard Brexit). Jeune Afrique is widely read in francophone Africa and beyond, and the Rwandan Minister for Trade referred to it in a meeting with ECDPM, and shared the analysis conveyed in the article &#x21D2; Better informed policy-making process in Africa / More empowered actors in AfricaB Involving North African states in the debate on EU-Africa relationsECDPM has contributed to the objective of &#x2018;More empowered actors in Europe and Africa&#x2019; and &#x2018;Better informed policy-making processes in Europe and Africa&#x2019; by closely following the post-Cotonou negotiations, and how they relate to high-level declarations both in Europe such as the State of the Union) and Africa (Kigali Declaration and Nouakchott Summit) about more holistic Europe-Africa relations.For the first time, ECDPM has included North African countries and opinion-makers in the discussion. To this end, ECDPM has been in contact with diplomats working in or with Egypt, the next chair of the AU Assembly of Heads of States, Morocco, Tunisia and Algeria as well as with EU diplomats and civil servants. The &#x2018;crucial week&#x2019; brief was cited both by DEVCO and ACP actors, allowing them to be better informed on the high stakes of a closed ministerial meeting that took place on 14 September 2018, which further co-determines the format and objectives of the ongoing EU-ACP negotiations. 2.3. Reduced gap between European external action policy and implementation.Our work on the changing nature of support to peacebuilding has generated a lot of interest in the peacebuilding community and beyond, and received positive feedback. ECDPM was the first to undertake independent policy analysis on what drives change and continuity in support for normative agendas like peacebuilding. We have been invited to brief government officials as well as parliamentarians on the key messages of this study, thus feeding into internal discussions on their priorities, and have presented it in various public events, including at the Alliance for Peacebuilding&#x2019;s annual conference PeaceCon 2018, and at events co-organised with FriEnt, the German Working Group on Peace and Development and with the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI). These are all leading platforms on peace issues. As a relative newcomer in the debate, ECDPM has contributed to more honest discussions on the challenges faced by the peacebuilding community in the current political environment. We aim to follow-up on this work in order to keep contributing to more effective European policies to tackle global challenges in a changing world, and to reduce the gap between European external action policy and implementation.3. Did you consider gender issues during the process of engagement? Yes, at least in three regards: * ECDPM organised an event with the Dublin City University Brexit Institute on Brexit and development cooperation with equal male and female representation both in the panel and the key-note speeches.
* ECDPM published Great Insights with several contributions from female authors, and one article specifically dedicated to the impact of Brexit on the Gender Action Plan. 
* ECDPM&#x2019;s Gender Task Force is currently analysing how the gender component can be strengthened in our work.</narrative>
