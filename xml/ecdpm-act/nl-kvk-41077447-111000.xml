       <narrative xml:lang="EN">1. Context and outcome areas      This work stream on Integrated European External Action pursues the following outcome areas: * Better informed policy-making process in Europe and Africa.
* More inclusive European policy dialogues and cooperation processes.
* More effective, coherent and integrated European policies to tackle global challenges.
* Reduced gap between European external action policy and implementation.
* More empowered actors in Europe and Africa. 
* Stronger links between distinct policy domains of diplomacy, development, security, trade/economic; energy/climate/natural resources diplomacy.
* Better equipped European institutions and non-state actors to operate in a legal and policy framework that is fit for purpose to effectively contribute to the 2030 agenda.
We cluster these outcome areas as follows: (i) better informed, more effective and inclusive policy-making processes in Europe; (ii) better informed and more empowered actors in Africa; (iii) reducing the policy-to-implementation gap.2. ECDPM contributions to these outcome areas:2.1. Better informed, more effective and inclusive policy-making processes in EuropeThis first cluster concentrates on better informed policy-making processes in Europe; more inclusive European policy dialogues and cooperation processes; more effective, coherent and integrated European policies to tackle global challenges; and more empowered actors in Europe.As a non-partisan broker of dialogue on development policy issues, ECDPM looks at the possible implications of European policies particularly on foreign, security and development policy and relationships with Africa. Under this workstream, it has done so notably with regard to the EU Budget (a) and Brexit (b).A. Highlighting the strategic choices under the future EU BudgetOur work on the preparation of the next EU budget (the Multiannual Financial Framework - or MFF - for the period 2021-2027, including the future generation of EU External Financing Instruments) aims at a better informed process and more effective, coherent, integrated European policies to tackle global challenges. Indeed, our publications highlight the strategic political and technical choices that should be made in the MFF in view of aligning the EU&#x2019;s global aspirations, resources and financial instruments, thus ensuring that EU development policy is better integrated in EU external action.Our substantial analysis is collected in a special dossier. These contributions have received positive feedback, and we continue to receive many invitations and requests that illustrate the relevance and quality of this work, which has also been quoted in various media. We have participated in numerous formal and informal events in Brussels and in EU member states where behind-the-scene work was being done to formulate positions, allowing us to reach out and disseminate our analysis more effectively to a broad range of decision makers in all EU institutions.B. Explaining the challenges of Brexit from a European perspectiveAs a knowledge broker, both in written outputs and on the occasion of events, ECDPM aims at outlining and communicating all the options for continued collaboration between the EU and the UK, thus favouring a constructive and inclusive dialogue.ECDPM has taken at least three initiatives to encourage negotiations and discussions around Brexit to be more inclusive, both content-wise (putting development on the agenda of Brexit-negotiators and influencers) and in terms of actors (putting these negotiators and influencers in contact with the development and European foreign policy worlds).* Our substantial analysis on Brexit is collected in a special dossier. ECDPM notably published a Choice Matrix: Future Options for EU-UK collaboration on international cooperation. This choice matrix triggered great interest with DFID officials who now seem to refer to it in their conversations with European counterparts. This would illustrate how ECDPM contributed to improve informed policy-making processes in Europe. 
* ECDPM organised an informal meeting under the Chatham House rule in Brussels with Brexit Coordinators, the EU Working Party on Development Cooperation (CODEV), a member of M. Barnier&#x2019;s Advisory Board as well as external experts, and with the participation of the UK Representation to the EU &#x21D2; More inclusive European policy dialogues and cooperation processes &#x21D2; Stronger links between distinct policy domains of diplomacy, development, and foreign affairs.
* ECDPM organised an event with the Dublin City University Brexit Institute on Brexit and development cooperation. The Irish Minister of State for International Development, the Chair of the European Parliament&#x2019;s Development committee, the DFID Europe Department, several experts as well as representatives from the civil society and the NGO sector were present, and the audience actively participated. The Director of the Brexit Institute, who also took active part in the event, is part of Michel Barnier&#x2019;s Advisory Board. Together with Dublin City University, ECDPM thus brought international development to a Brexit expert forum. This, together with, to our knowledge, the first official speech from a development minister from Brexit, form two primeurs &#x21D2; More effective, coherent and integrated European policies to tackle global challenges.
* In addition to our writing, brokering and formal events, a regular informal exchange has been had between ECDPM staff and member states since January 2017 until now &#x21D2; More empowered actors in Europe.
2.2. Better informed policy-making process in Africa / More empowered actors in AfricaA. Addressing the challenges of Brexit from an African perspectiveA special issue of ECDPM&#x2019;s magazine Great Insights entitled &#x201C;Beyond Brexit&#x201D; was widely circulated with members from the development and Brexit communities as well as with civil society and academics. Most of the articles in this magazine focus on Brexit from an African or Global South perspective. By taking the perspective of how Brexit will impact countries beyond Europe, we have informed and potentially empowered African actors in this debate.The informal meeting under the Chatham House rule in Brussels about Brexit also included a leading African expert on global dialogue, again emphasising the need to understand Brexit also through an African lens.In the same vein, an ECDPM policy officer has published an article in the magazine Jeune Afrique entitled &#x2018;Pourquoi l&#x2019;Afrique a tout &#xE0; craindre d&#x2019;un Brexit dur&#x2019; (Why Africa should be worried about a Hard Brexit). Jeune Afrique is widely read in francophone Africa and beyond, and the Rwandan Minister for Trade referred to it in a meeting with ECDPM, and shared the analysis conveyed in the article &#x21D2; Better informed policy-making process in Africa / More empowered actors in AfricaB Involving North African states in the debate on EU-Africa relationsECDPM has contributed to the objective of &#x2018;More empowered actors in Europe and Africa&#x2019; and &#x2018;Better informed policy-making processes in Europe and Africa&#x2019; by closely following the post-Cotonou negotiations, and how they relate to high-level declarations both in Europe such as the State of the Union) and Africa (Kigali Declaration and Nouakchott Summit) about more holistic Europe-Africa relations.For the first time, ECDPM has included North African countries and opinion-makers in the discussion. To this end, ECDPM has been in contact with diplomats working in or with Egypt, the next chair of the AU Assembly of Heads of States, Morocco, Tunisia and Algeria as well as with EU diplomats and civil servants. The &#x2018;crucial week&#x2019; brief was cited both by DEVCO and ACP actors, allowing them to be better informed on the high stakes of a closed ministerial meeting that took place on 14 September 2018, which further co-determines the format and objectives of the ongoing EU-ACP negotiations. 2.3. Reduced gap between European external action policy and implementation.Our work on the changing nature of support to peacebuilding has generated a lot of interest in the peacebuilding community and beyond, and received positive feedback. ECDPM was the first to undertake independent policy analysis on what drives change and continuity in support for normative agendas like peacebuilding. We have been invited to brief government officials as well as parliamentarians on the key messages of this study, thus feeding into internal discussions on their priorities, and have presented it in various public events, including at the Alliance for Peacebuilding&#x2019;s annual conference PeaceCon 2018, and at events co-organised with FriEnt, the German Working Group on Peace and Development and with the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI). These are all leading platforms on peace issues. As a relative newcomer in the debate, ECDPM has contributed to more honest discussions on the challenges faced by the peacebuilding community in the current political environment. We aim to follow-up on this work in order to keep contributing to more effective European policies to tackle global challenges in a changing world, and to reduce the gap between European external action policy and implementation.3. Did you consider gender issues during the process of engagement? Yes, at least in three regards: * ECDPM organised an event with the Dublin City University Brexit Institute on Brexit and development cooperation with equal male and female representation both in the panel and the key-note speeches.
* ECDPM published Great Insights with several contributions from female authors, and one article specifically dedicated to the impact of Brexit on the Gender Action Plan. 
* ECDPM&#x2019;s Gender Task Force is currently analysing how the gender component can be strengthened in our work.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Over the reporting period, five important developments are necessary to contextualise the workstream. First, late in 2019, a new political leadership was appointed to lead the European institutions, self-declaring that their mandate would be to lead a Geopolitical (European) Commission. The second one was in early 2020 when the European institutions laid out an enhanced partnership with Africa as a key priority. Thirdly, the global COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact upon dynamics in European external action in terms of the operating environment. Fourthly, in 2021, the UK formally left the transition period after negotiating to leave the European Union. Fifthly, after protracted and difficult negotiations, the EU agreed the budget and specific regulation for the EU&#x2019;s major external financial instrument for the period 2021-2027, an approach which was a considerable break from the past. ECDPM has responded to each of these changes by producing new analytical work, facilitating dialogue and building capacity to assist actors in responding and adapting to these changes, albeit with varying depth based on our analysis of their relevance for European external action.One of ECDPM&#x2019;s approaches in this area has been to provide informed analysis quickly after new initiatives were announced by the EU on its external action agenda. This proved to be the right choice. Whether it was the new Geopolitical Commission, the COVID-19 response, the Team Europe approach, or the implications of Brexit negotiations for development cooperation, we were generally the first think tank to provide analysis at the political - technical level, albeit we chose not to look at all in similar depth. Also when new initiatives had to be launched, working with EU agenda setters (like EU Presidencies of the Council of the EU), we also produced analytical work to underpin European policy discussions and decision making processes. We did this on issues such as human development, collaboration with middle income countries, water as a regional public good, digital in humanitarian action, or even politically sensitive issues such as the governance of EU external aid. At times we were called to facilitate discussions or nourish internal debate amongst various European stakeholders on these topics. On three of these topics the Council of the European Union adopted specific policy proposals, and our work on digital in humanitarian action is informing the policy of the EU&#x2019;s humanitarian agency. Outside of this process, ECDPM, at times working with ETTG and with African think tanks, undertook to produce joint analytical work and hold joint events to help frame the discussion on critical new issues, such as digital collaboration. When it comes to EU development cooperation, there are big differences between member states in terms of their experience and expertise, their resources and their capacity to engage. The lion&#x2019;s share of EU-funded contracts are awarded to only a handful of prominent European national development agencies that have a strong &#x2018;footprint&#x2019; in partner countries or in a given sector, meaning that EU development is not nearly as &#x2018;inclusive&#x2019; of European stakeholders as it could or should be. ECDPM work in this area analysed the concept of inclusiveness and its importance for EU development policy &#x2013; both politically and operationally. Inclusiveness seeks to ensure that all interested member states &#x2013; including their implementing agencies and development finance institutions &#x2013; are involved in the planning and implementation of EU development cooperation activities. Our analysis was presented with a verbal and PowerPoint presentation to the Working Party on Development Cooperation (CODEV-PI) on Fostering Inclusiveness in a Team Europe Approach on 25 January 2021 and a further presentation was made to the European Practitioners Network on 15 October 2021. This work has helped raise and make more practical the issue of inclusiveness, although it has to be noted that this is really only one aspect of inclusiveness, namely that of the various European actors and EU member states. Yet it was through this more specific focus that we were able to achieve some impact and feed directly into raising awareness and changing European policy. It is also a specific area where there is likely to continue to be demand for ECDPM&#x2019;s engagement in the future and that helped link us to more diverse European actors. In order to respond to the global pandemic ECDPM adapted its work. One of the first things we realised was that there was no comprehensive analysis of the EU as a global health actor spanning not only the past and future EU financial framework and global finance, but also how the EU would use its competences (powers) and its research and innovation funding for the pandemic response. ECDPM provided the first comprehensive analysis of the EU as a global health actor in the wake of COVID-19. Based on desk research and interviews with EU and member state officials, civil society representatives and international partners, we sought to understand the scale and scope of the EU&#x2019;s global health role and offer perspectives on its future role in this area. We looked at the EU&#x2019;s global health role in addressing the COVID-19 outbreak and analysed the extent to which the pandemic is changing the parameters for EU action. We also offered a strategic overview of the EU&#x2019;s past and current action in different global health-related realms. Our analysis was unique as it simultaneously looked at the EU as a diplomatic player, a major aid donor, a research and innovation (R&amp;amp;I) leader and its dual mandate on domestic and international health issues. It also provided some insights on the EU-Africa partnership on global health and on the EU&#x2019;s vaccine strategy. The paper argues that brought together, these assets could give the EU more leverage in global health that could lead to better health outcomes, yet COVID-19 did not cause a fundamental change in the rules of the game when it comes to the EU&#x2019;s limited role as a global health player. If the EU and its member states wish to step up their game in this field, they will need a clear strategy as well as better coordination. On reflection it was decided not to significantly invest in &#x2018;health&#x2019; as a stand alone area of EU external action (or the link between internal and external policy) but rather to focus on the area in relation to wider issues of human development in European external action. In looking at human development we emphasised not only the traditional development angle, but how it was also relevant to more European self-interested external action in terms of getting results. Working with the EU Portuguese Presidency, this work fed into the first Council of the European Union - Foreign Affairs Council conclusions related to human development for over a decade in 2021. ECDPM has consistently analysed the gap between the EU&#x2019;s policy and its implementation as well as put forward clear ideas of how to bridge these gaps in various areas &#x2013;or example, in relation to EU-Africa relations (a key aspect of European external action) and how the EU programmes its external aid. In this regard, in 2020 and 2021, we designed and delivered training for officials of the European External Action Service, both from HQ and EU delegations in partner countries, on strategic programming and decision making. ECDPM&apos;s past analytical work and the trust we had built up with the EU institutions allowed us to play this unique role. Within this training, we took the concepts and issues developed in EU policies such as &#x201C;policy first&#x201D;, &#x201C;Team Europe&#x201D;, &#x201C;linking policy and programming&#x201D; and sought to train on how these could be operationalised in practice, including exploring obvious trade offs and dilemmas associated with this. ECDPM produced the first analysis related to the programming of EU aid for 2021-2027 that was consulted by all major parties (Council of the European Union, member states, European Parliament, and also European civil society organisations). The European External Action Service (EEAS) even asked us to train hundreds of their staff on how to be more strategic when programming the Neighbourhood, Development and International Cooperation Instrument (NDICI) instrument. Overall, our work on the NDICI and programming is unique and appreciated and has bridged a gap between the &#x2018;ideas&#x2019; and strategy behind it and the practical choices that are being made in the roll out of this new instrument. We also recently produced an entirely new product answering specific questions around this area to empower actors to engage with this new EU financial instrument, and are in the process of translating this into French to reach an even wider audience in Francophone Africa. Yet, we would have to say that while there has been consistent interest in and engagement with our work on this area, it has primarily come from European not African stakeholders, something we intend to remedy in 2022 by analysing the impact of the major changes in European external action for African partner countries and empowering African stakeholders to effectively engage in these processes.In response to COVID-19, the European Union set in motion a new &#x2018;Team Europe&#x2019; approach to give more visibility to the collective efforts that brought together EU member states, EU institutions, and EU financial institutions. This more political approach to collective European external action provided a focus of analysis for ECDPM, and we produced the first independent analysis of the &#x201C;Team Europe approach&#x201D;. Beyond the analytical work, ECDPM also undertook internal seminars and facilitation for member states (at their request) on how to operationalise the Team Europe approach. ECDPM also undertook training of the European External Action Service (HQ and Delegations) that mainstreamed analysis of &#x201C;Team Europe&#x201D; within a wider training on the strategic deployment of the EU&#x2019;s new &#x20AC;79.5 billion NDICI Global Europe financial instruments. All in all we think our work in this area has been appreciated as it has been critical but with the clear idea of improving collective action. There are critical questions to examine in terms of how much this focus on &#x201C;Team Europe&#x201D; has really changed practice, and importantly how this has been received and perceived by partners that are not European.The mainstreaming of gender within the activities of this workstream was enabled by developing and implementing a particular gender action plan for the wider programme of work in which it was located. Furthermore, the analytical work undertaken particularly in 2021 increasingly took a gender lens, as well as focused down on specific pieces of analysis (some of the first of its kind) of how the EU in its external action was implementing its own Gender Action Plan commitments and how it linked to other important processes such as the programming of EU aid. In 2021, we published a number of documents covering this theme, also held our own event, and were invited to present on the topic at the Council of the European Union&#x2019;s working party on Development Cooperation and International Partnerships. We also developed more grounded work on this theme in relation to EU collaboration with Mozambique. The challenge will be to continue to build on the significant work we have undertaken in the past two years in 2022.</narrative>
