  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This work stream aims to contribute to:1) At policy level: The added value of territorial (or place-based) approaches to development is clarified and socialised across the board (starting from the premise that this concept is quickly gaining momentum but still requires to be properly understood and translated into feasible and attractive implementation approaches)2) At Institutional level: The EU/EUD are enabled to better integrate the territorial dimension in their overall (sectoral) cooperation strategies with partner countries3) At Implementation level: Territorial approaches to development are effectively tested out and applied in partner countries (through EU support strategies with accompaniment of ECDPM and other interested actors/institutions)</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">1. Context and outcome areas     Territorial development is not a new concept. It has been tried out in many parts of the world with the objective to unleash the potential of territories (of various kinds) from the &#x201C;bottom-up&#x201D; by mobilising the capacities and resources of local actors (the private sector, civil society, local authorities). If done properly it can help to create &#x201C;additional&#x201D; wealth and jobs while helping to ensure inclusiveness, social cohesion and resilience to cope with new challenges (such as climate change) at local level. Strangely, the concept has only recently been picked up by international donors and the EU. So in this work stream, we try to both promote / socialise the vision behind territorial development (as an approach that can yield major development and governance benefits) and accompany its practical application in partner countries.     2. ECDPM contributions in these outcome areas     At policy level: Building on past work done in the last 5 years (including helping the Commission to produce a guidance on the topic), ECDPM has invested in further dialogue processes on territorial development. An example was a 3 days exchange seminar, sponsored by the EU for the countries of the Neighbourhood South (North Africa and the Middle East). More than 50 participants arrived at a large consensus on how territorial approaches could contribute to overcome over-centralised ways to manage development in the Arab world while responding to promising dynamics at local level, partly pushed by increasingly vocal local authorities. More recently, various ECDPM programmes are looking at how they could work more with cities as key territorial actors. This reflects rapid urbanisation trends as well as a growing interest of the EU to engage strategically with cities. ECDPM is also looking at how future international agreements (such as the new Post Cotonou arrangement) and the future EU budget (or Multiannual Financial Framework, MFF, 2021-2027) will integrate local and city authorities. To this end, it has convened two gatherings (November 2018, March 2019) with leading associations of local authorities to strategize how to make the case for deepened relations with local authorities - as key drivers of the Agenda 2030 and partners in EU external action.     At institutional level: As more and more EU staff in headquarters and Delegations get enthused about the potential of territorial approaches (that can be applied in different sectors and themes), the pressure to get operational guidance increases. Hence, ECDPM has helped the Commission to work out a &#x201C;roadmap&#x201D; for Delegations that want to explore how to integrate territorial approaches in their ongoing and future support programmes. The guidance and related analytical tools have aroused the interest of 4 EU Delegations to test them out (Colombia, Ecuador, Ethiopia and Timor Leste). ECDPM is currently compiling &#x201C;stories&#x201D; about these 4 pilot experiences in the hope to &#x201C;contaminate&#x201D; other stakeholders. It should be noted that this type of processes are not merely &#x201C;Commission-driven&#x201D; but also generate a lot of interest of domestic actors.     At implementation level: The guidance and related analytical tools are tested in 4 partner countries (Colombia, Ecuador, Ethiopia and Timor Leste) and more are expected to follow suit in 2019.     3. Did you consider gender issues during the process of engagement?     In the various dialogues on how to promote territorial approaches to local development, space is created to consider relevant gender issues. This is facilitated by the fact that territorial development calls for the mobilisation of local actors and resources, the adoption of multi-sectoral approaches and the introduction of new modes of local governance (with citizen participation of men and women) as well considering issues of &#x201C;rights&#x201D;.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Territorial development is not a new concept. It has been tried out in many parts of the world with the objective to unleash the potential of territories (of various kinds) from the &#x201C;bottom-up&#x201D; by mobilising the capacities and resources of local actors (the private sector, civil society, local authorities). If done properly it can help to create &#x201C;additional&#x201D; wealth and jobs while helping to ensure inclusiveness, social cohesion and resilience to cope with new challenges (such as climate change) at local level. Strangely, the concept has only recently been picked up (again) by international donors and the EU, partly driven by the universal Agenda 2030 which insists on the &#x2018;localisation&#x2019; of the sustainable development goals (SGDs). In this work stream, we try to both promote / socialise the vision behind territorial development (as an approach that can yield major development and governance benefits) and accompany its practical application in partner countries.Building on the work done in 2017-2019, we continued to develop a wide range of activities to promote local/territorial development approaches as a more sustainable and inclusive strategy. In this we were helped by other ECDPM programmes (e.g. dealing with food or security) which increasingly integrated the &#x201C;local dimension&#x201D; in their policy analyses or actions on the ground. We continued to support leading Associations of Local Authorities to advocate for the adoption of territorial approaches by the EU institutions as well as by African governments. ECDPM also provided lead expertise in carrying out an independent evaluation on EU support to Local Authorities in the Neighbourhood South and East as well as in the Western Balkans (concluded in February 2021). Though the targeted audiences were generally highly open to the messages coming out of all these processes, effective policy change was hampered by a lack of high-level political commitment at EU level as well as the legacy of top-down, centralised approaches to development cooperation (which tend to marginalise local authorities) - as well as on too heavy reliance on intermediary agencies or civil society actors to implement local level programmes (which often end up substituting for the legally enshrined role of local authorities). As a result, there is a growing gap between policy discourses in favour of territorial approaches and effective follow-up in practice. This, in turn, suggests the critical need for local level actors themselves to stand up more effectively to &#x2018;demand&#x2019; more localized approaches which truly empower local authorities. In the next years, we will mainly work through these actors to promote policy change. In this context, the tender won by ECDPM to accompany the monitoring of a major EU programme aimed at fostering &#x2018;city-to-city partnerships&#x2019; between Europe and the Global South (due to start in September 2021) seems highly strategic. In this area as well, effective change is at best incremental. Past efforts done produce operational guidance (including by ECDPM) on how to implement territorial approaches have &#x2018;contaminated&#x2019; some EU Delegations, but not yet managed to mobilize a critical set of institutional EU actors at different levels. As the abovementioned evaluation on EU support to Local Authorities illustrated, there is still a major lack of political, institutional and bureaucratic incentives available to EU delegations to embark on (complex, non-linear) processes of territorial development, driven by local actors. Those who opt for it tend to encounter a host of implementation challenges (including resistance from central authorities or the inadequacy of funding instruments), as experienced in ECDPM&#x2019;s support to the EU programming process in Tunisia. One way forward for the next years is to document successful sectoral attempts to better integrate local authorities or to promote a greater &#x2018;localization&#x2019; of decision-making powers and funding. In this context, it is worth noting a strategic collaboration with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Netherlands on the potential of &#x201C;inclusive governance&#x201D; as concept for better development outcomes. In the next years, ECDPM will continue to explore and test out linkages between inclusive governance and locally driven development processes -in which local authorities play a key role. Change at EU level could be accelerated by the involvement of Member States pro-actively fostering these agendas (in a &#x201C;Team Europe&#x201D; spirit).In order to test out territorial approaches in EU cooperation processes, a new facility was set up at INTPA level to help EU Delegations with (ad hoc) quality support or advice. This is a promising avenue for change, though its potential is reduced by the lack of high-level political support for effectively decentralizing development support and the weakness of the thematic unit in charge. Considering its limited capacities, ECDPM will continue to partner with other allies (such as United Cities and Local Governments of Africa, UCLGA, to whom we provided technical and training support). It will also continue engaging with EU Delegations that are committed to truly experiment with bottom-up approaches to territorial development. This could help &#x2018;demonstrating&#x2019; that such approaches deliver results and merit a greater uptake. In this context, a major opportunity recently opened up, as ECDPM entered into an 18-month agreement with the EUD in Burkina Faso for effective application of a territorial development approach as well as a (sectoral) mainstreaming of local authorities in overall EU cooperation. Experiences gained will be documented and upscaled to further make the case, in a pragmatic and result-oriented way, for the feasibility of such support strategies.The inclusion of the gender dimension is done in a generic way in our policy documents and expert advices. For a more systematic consideration of gender issues, the practical facilitation work on the ground with EU Delegations offers a promising ground. Opportunities will be explored to focus on gender issues in the ongoing 18-month support programme to the EU Delegation in Burkina Faso.</narrative>
