  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Thanks to the John Watson Trust, we have been working alongside our local Caritas partner to support 80 indigenous women living across 22 communities in the municipalities of Carcha (Campur) and Cahabon in Alta Verapaz since July 2015. 
The project aims to empower the women&#x2019;s networks supported by Pastoral Social - Caritas, Diocese of Verapaz. Focusing on agricultural production, access to local services, trade and marketing and leadership opportunities. We are helping women to increase the quantity, quality and value of their crops, to increase their representation and independent income for their family. 
During the first and second phases of this project, the women began to adapt their agricultural practices to incorporate more crop varieties, produce organic fertiliser, sustainably manage pests and diseases and select the best seeds to ensure a better harvest. They took part in workshops on food preparation, storage and hygiene and learned about financial planning. This enabled them to start selling products in their communities and at local and regional market days. They also strengthened their leadership skills to sell their crops at market. However, time was not long enough to see the full impact of this work. Due to climate change, significant alterations were made to the sowing season resulting in a smaller crop. The women formed groups to collaborate and to promote savings and credit committees. 
Whilst we have seen progress in the diversification of crops and the formation of two community saving and credit committees, there has not been enough time for these new processes to become standard practice within the community. Local leaders have advocated for the continuation of the project, with a focus on technical assistance to increase crop production. The women have noted a direct benefit from the project on their feeling of dignity, independence and empowerment in facing gender-based violence and increasing their access to food.</narrative>
