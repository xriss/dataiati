  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In Verapaz, Guatemala, the economic crisis triggered by the Covid-19 pandemic and the devastation of storms Eta and Iota left thousands of households in great vulnerability: people lost crops, backyard animals and even their homes. In this context, Pastoral has not stopped assisting the communities with its different development projects.
The Covid-19 pandemic aggravated the crisis; with the intermittency of services, illnesses worsened among the population, as did poverty and the fear of contagion from the coronavirus, and so it continues. Accessing a doctor under these conditions is complicated. 
At the end of 2021, a new NGO law was approved, which establishes, among its requirements, that under the responsibility of the Ministry of Labour, an Occupational Health Plan must be implemented by 2022 in non-governmental and social organisations, and that is why Pastoral Social-C&#xE1;ritas has begun to draw up an institutional plan with the support of a doctor who was at Cl&#xED;nica El Buen Vivir. According to government guidelines, for organisations with at least 50 people as staff, the plan must include a doctor, a nursing assistant and environmental licenses for the clinics.
Project Goal - Pastoral Social-C&#xE1;ritas will contribute to the early detection, care and accompaniment of people with a positive diagnosis for Covid and/or general health in vulnerable populations and collaborators of Pastoral Social-C&#xE1;ritas.
Specific Objective
1. To provide medical care in the form of direct and telephone consultations for Pastoral intervention communities and the technical, administrative and religious staff of Pastoral Social-C&#xE1;ritas, Diocese of La Verapaz who are having reduced access to healthcare due to Covid context. 
Expected outcome
Programme participants and the technical, administrative and religious staff of Pastoral Social-C&#xE1;ritas, Diocese of La Verapaz receive orientation on prevention measures and medical care for COVID-19 and/or general health.</narrative>
