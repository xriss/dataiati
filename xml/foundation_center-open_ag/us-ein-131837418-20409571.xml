   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Indigenous Partnership for Agrobiodiversity and Food Sovereignty has been given the opportunity to help organize the Indigenous Terra Madre (ITM) festival that will take place in Mawphlang, Meghalaya in Northeast India in 2015. This event provides a unique opportunity to raise the voices of indigenous peoples on issues of food sovereignty and to link indigenous networks with researchers, policymakers and advocacy groups to work together toward a more sustainable food system. Specifically, this grant will fund the development of three indigenous ecological networks: millet cultivation, swidden agriculture (traditional production system); and pollinators (with a focus on Latin America). Activities to be funded will include trainings, reviewing earlier networking attempts, organizing information exchanges to develop best practices, documenting case studies from each network that will be presented at ITM 2015, as well as organizing a side event presenting their findings at the Permanent Forum on Indigenous issues, which will take place in 2016. Additionally, the grant will go to fund capacity building activities on communication methods, such as community radio, the internet, and traditional storytelling practices, which are important tools to raise awareness and share knowledge in indigenous communities and throughout the world. These communication trainings will focus mostly on women and youth.</narrative>
