   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Whilst the majority of the Rwandan population is dependent on agriculture, population growth is threatening food security. The average family have 0.6 hectares on which to grow enough food to eat and to sell to pay for healthcare and education. In partnership with local organisations, Trcaire have successfully introduced a more modern farming approach using high-quality seeds, fertilisers and storage banks. As a result farmers raised their wheat, soya and maize yields and reduced crop losses allowing them to feed themselves and still have crops left to sell locally. This grant will support an extension of this approach to help thousands more farmers, many of whom are women, by helping them to standardise quality and sell collectively in order to get the best prices. They will help to improve the organisations that package and brand their crops to produce more and become self-financing. They will also help the factories to meet tough new national food safety and packaging standards</narrative>
