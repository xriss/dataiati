   <narrative xml:lang="EN">At the core of Vision 2030, the Kenyan government&apos;s main development plan, is the effective development of land. Agriculture, natural resource exploitation, and infrastructure development will be key vehicles to achieve this objective. Delivering on the promise of this vision will depend on the extent to which the government manages to implement transparent and accountable processes of large-scale land acquisition that safeguard and do not disadvantage local communities. In a context marked by high levels of poverty, and unclear or insecure land tenure rights, the mainly rural population might be vulnerable to inequitable treatment during land acquisitions, as well as to exposure to negative impacts if social and environmental safeguards are not followed. ,,The aim of this project is to explore the most effective ways of ensuring the accountability of government managed processes to protect the interests of vulnerable communities in circumstances of large scale land acquisitions. To that end, the project proposes to review current policy and legislative criteria, particularly those developed under Kenya&apos;s 2010 Constitution, for the acquisition and granting of land for investment purposes in Kenya. Complementing this analysis, the project will develop a community based scorecard to track the impact and implementation on the ground in concrete communities of pre-existing and newly developed laws. Findings will then be used as a barometer to assess the legitimacy and accountability of processes governing large-scale land acquisitions, along with interviews with public officials, investors and other relevant stakeholders. Data generated by this project will ultimately help inform future legislation and policy, and act as a vehicle to engage a broader range of stakeholders in government and private sector. The research will target two regions in Kenya. In Siaya county, where a 25-year lease was granted to a private company over the expansive Yala Swamp to undertake large scale irrigation farming. The second set of sites will be Lamu and Isiolo counties, which are at the centre of implementation a planned new port at Lamu through Kenya to Ethiopia and South Sudan. This project is being developed as part of a cohort of planned projects on promoting accountability around large-scale land acquisitions in Africa</narrative>
