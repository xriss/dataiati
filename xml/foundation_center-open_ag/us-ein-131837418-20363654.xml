   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In the frame of the project we would like to improve the relationship between local farmers and their customers by increasing the consumption of locally produced healthy food, the extension of environmentally conscious consumption, and strengthen local economy. They would like to find more marketing channels for local farmers, at families in Nyiregyhaza with locally produced high quality food. Meanwhile a community will be built up. They expect 50 families, 20 farmers, and 50-200 people who are interested. During public meetings they try to organize discussions with the participation of a performer and the audience, and want to give higher publicity to food self-sufficiency to form people&apos;s approach. Running their shopping community, being a model for consumers, will bring positive results in the society. The costumers (50 families), farmers (20) might experience the coherent power of our society, and our model spreads among the habitants of our town</narrative>
