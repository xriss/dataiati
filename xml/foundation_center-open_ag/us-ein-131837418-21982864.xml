   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Directed towards the youth of Alentejo, a region in Portugal struggling with depopulation and weak business dynamics, the project fosters inclusion and employability in the agricultural sector, aiming to strengthen economic and social development in rural areas. To reach this goal, networks for innovation and employability will be created, and other initiatives will be carried out to strengthen entrepreneurship and investments that contribute to job creation and the improvement of the regional value chain of agricultural products. The project also includes cooperation with two research centres dealing with innovation and rural development from Norway, so that Portuguese and Norwegian NGOs may broaden their knowledge and exchange experiences. In order to strengthen the skills of young people, training and awareness raising activities will be carried out, and there will also be the opportunity to contact with best practices and internships on farms and agricultural companies, in addition to technical support. Other Partner(S): University of Evora; Association of Young Farmers of the South</narrative>
