   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Challenges Worldwide alleviates poverty by supporting enterprise in low-income countries, strengthening small businesses and helping them to grow, while enabling access to products and services previously unavailable. We invest professional time, energy and skills where others don&apos;t and where the potential for impact is highest. Our support of enterprise development is a major strategy to change power relations and increase the voice, influence and the economic share of people living in poverty. We engage with governments and larger companies to increase the participation of small enterprises in supply chains in ways that benefit producers. We work with investors to promote investment that enables economic growth to be more equally distributed. [Our work] helps many thousands of people to work their way out of poverty and to access previously unavailable products and services. Challenges in: Agriculture. Around 1.5 billion women, children and men live in rural areas and depend on agriculture for their livelihoods. According to recent research by the International Food Policy Research Institute this includes half of the world&apos;s undernourished people, three-quarters of Africa&apos;s malnourished children, and the majority of people living in absolute poverty. Studies have shown that investing in small-scale agriculture delivers more in terms of poverty reduction than other sectors. Our agricultural sector activities aim to enable rural people to improve their food security and nutrition, raise their incomes and strengthen their resilience. Over time, we have identified a need to progress our involvement in the agricultural sector from opportunistic to strategic by improving our company level understanding of the common barriers and opportunities faced by small enterprises, the costs and risks of doing business in the developing world, and how to design and deliver appropriate and affordable services to help businesses overcome impediments to growth. An addition to our portfolio of work is Challenges Impact, a structured program through which knowledge and insight will be generated on a substantial scale. For these efforts, we expect to see a measurable increase in the effectiveness of our own deployment of resources. We are eager to highlight the opportunities this present to the cooperatives themselves, as well as the broader implications of supporting business growth</narrative>
