   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Food insecurity and absolute poverty characterise the situation of the population in the Coast Region of Kenya. Land ownership is a major problem as most people who work the land do not have title deeds. In a context of polygamy, women are particularly disadvantaged. The 2010 Constitution provides the legal framework for women to address their rights to land tenure and other assets, as well as for combating gender-based violence. The production of drought-resistant crops and the cultivation of high value plants like aloe for conversion into soaps and lotions for local consumption offer an opportunity to improve food security and income. This project will build on existing work with self-help women&#x2019;s groups and a mixed cooperative to help them improve their production techniques in growing aloe domestically, processing the plants to extract sap and use this to make natural-based products for sale in local markets. The cooperative will develop a centralised collection point and processing unit to bulk purchase raw materials for soap and lotions, and to scale up production and marketing. Vegetable gardening and bee-keeping will be promoted alongside the production of aloe, which will improve food security. Education and awareness on women&#x2019;s constitutional rights, as well as adult literacy provision, will improve women&#x2019;s capacity to develop their leadership skills and realise their rights</narrative>
