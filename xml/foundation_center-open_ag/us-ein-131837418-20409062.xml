   <narrative xml:lang="EN">CODEMIA will promote the recuperation of traditional knowledge of planting and use of nutritional and medicinal plants between indigenous families and youth. Large companies, including petroleum and logging corporations, greatly impact indigenous communities, who suffer from economic, cultural, and environmental damages from the companies&apos; projects. Additionally, women in these communities are affected the most mostly because they assume additional responsibilities when men have to leave the communities to look for work. The situation has led to increase in workload for women, loss of cultural and environmental knowledge and diversity, soil nutrient depletion and degradation, chronic malnutrition, environment deterioration from contaminates and predatory practices and increase need for indigenous families to obtain additional financial support. The group will promote food security and sustainability, the improvement of nutritional quality and variety, and income generating activities for families. Specifically, the group will develop 2 gardens and 1 farm for the Paoyhan community and community school. Medicinal and nutritional plants will be planted in these gardens and farm using traditional Shipibo knowledge and modern techniques. Trainings will be offered to community members in organic agriculture, nursery construction, and crop rotation.</narrative>
