  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">K-Monitor seeks institutional support of $87,000 per year for three years, almost all of which will go toward paying the full salaries of the programmatic staff members to carry out its core activities. This will entail continuing to develop its two web portals to make information about potential corruption available to the public as well as for its own research purposes. The group will closely examine company registry data, procurement related to EU funds, and tenders for public agricultural land use, which has recently become the subject of another major corruption scandal. In this case, the whistleblower is a current ruling party MP and former Minister of Agriculture who resigned in protest over the level of corruption in this sphere. K-Monitor will advocate for shaping the legal framework related to strengthening whistleblower protection, FOI legislation, conflict of interest rules and lobbying regulations. In most cases, K-Monitor will do the legislative advocacy work by joining and complementing continued efforts of partners such as the Hungarian Civil Liberties Union (TASZ) and Transparency International Hungary (TI Hungary). K-Monitor&apos;s role will concentrate primarily on recommendations and inclusion of electronic and open data disclosures and registers. The group will inform the public and campaign though social media channels such as Facebook and use network visualization tools to highlight special cases. In addition, it plans to advance partnership with major news portals and will apply widget functions on hot topics, which will take the reader to K-Monitor portals</narrative>
