   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Southern Cape Land Committee was established in 1987 and works with rural communities, farmworkers and farm dwellers, and small-scale farmers to create the conditions for agrarian reform. Past support assisted the Southern Cape Land Committee to educate people on farms about their rights and how to access them. Support was provided to eight rural community advice offices and 35 farmworker committees, representing the interests of over 2,200 farmworkers and farm dwellers. This grant will support the Southern Cape Land Committee to support community advice offices and farm and forestry workers in rural parts of the Eastern and Western Cape provinces. The support will include assisting communities to organize themselves and understand their rights so that they can engage decision makers on accessing these rights, conducting research to better understand the living and working conditions of poor people on farms, and producing and disseminating information that enables people to access their rights.</narrative>
