   <narrative xml:lang="EN">For GGF funds will be used to empower indigenous women of Sarawak to enhance their capacity, leadership and understanding of community issues related to gender, agriculture, food security, environmental justice and indigenous peoples&apos; rights in rural Sarawak. This project will provide them opportunities to become aware of their rights, and equally participate in defending their livelihood, environment and ancestral lands together with the Sarawak community. The indigenous women play significant roles in ensuring the traditional ways of meeting the basic needs such as food security and nutrition of every household and community in Sarawak. Yet, these roles of women play remain invisible; and with the encroachment of private corporations in their customary lands brought about by concessions with the government, the indigenous women are forced toward further marginalization. In particular, the project activities will include: capacity building for 75 indigenous women in 2 indigenous communities in Sarawak and awareness raising session to at least 200 women residents in 2 indigenous communities in Sarawak</narrative>
