   <narrative xml:lang="EN">For With the funds, Saramanta Warmikuna (Daughters of the Corn) will develop activities to strengthen the organization and impact of indigenous women of the Ecuadorian Amazon in their struggle against the extractive industry. At the end of 2013, a group of Amazonian women led a series of protests against the Ecuadorian government&apos;s plan to expand petroleum and mining activities that would spread across hundreds of thousands of hectares of indigenous lands. Although women have always played important role in indigenous movements, this was a milestone in the struggle for women&apos;s rights, food sovereignty, and territorial defense. The group will focus on developing tools and raising awareness about women leadership and their contribution to the movement. The group will organize workshops and continue the debate within four communities about the dangers of petroleum, and document and photograph the activities and leadership of Amazonian women in their resistance to the hydrocarbon extractive model. It will circulate the material as part of a larger awareness campaign on the women&apos;s role in the defense of their territory. It will work directly with 20 women from each community (80 women in total.)</narrative>
