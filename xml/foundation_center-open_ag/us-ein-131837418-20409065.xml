   <narrative xml:lang="EN">COMAID will advocate against the international financing of agro companies that actively participate in land grabbing activities in the northwest region of Cameroon. There has been a rapid upward trend of land acquisition in this region, confirmed by COMAID&apos;s study in February 2013 funded by a previous GGF grant, by foreign companies and individuals for palm plantations. The study revealed the devastating environmental impact of the industry&apos;s use of chemicals, clearance of forests and grasslands, and factory wastes polluting water sources. The land grabbing and agricultural activities of these massive international agro industries are funded by financial institutions like the World Bank, African Development Bank, HSBC (based in France), and the Islamic Bank and are increasingly threatening the food security, land rights, and environmental resources of local communities. COMAID will partner with civil society organizations working on food security, environmental protection, advocacy against land grabbing, minority land right protection, and gender issues to develop a coalition/regional land observatory. This observatory will investigate financial sources and drivers of large scale land acquisition and it will gather, communicate, monitor, and use information to advocate against the financing of these agro industries. Specifically, COMAID will organize a workshop with these CSOs to develop the coalition, provide training for the Land Observatory and develop strategies on information gathering, monitoring, and advocacy; legalize the independent Land Observatory organization, and advocate against financial flows and land grabbing directly to financial institutions and through media coverage and public campaigns.</narrative>
