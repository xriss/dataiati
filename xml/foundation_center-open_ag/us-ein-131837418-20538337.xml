   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Recent years have seen a renewed investor interest in acquiring farmland for agricultural investments in the global South. Empirical research suggests that media reports have over-estimated the scale of land acquisition but underplayed how investor interest is focused on more valuable lands, which are often already the subject of competition. While investment in agriculture can create jobs, improve access to markets and develop infrastructure for agricultural development, large-scale land acquisitions (LSLAs) have been associated with negative impacts for local populations, including the dispossession of land and other resources. Since many villagers depend on land and natural resources for their food security and livelihoods more generally, ill-conceived land acquisitions can have major and lasting negative repercussions for local livelihoods. If not properly managed, LSLAs can increase the risk of conflict -- between and among companies and communities. A key challenge is ensuring that decision-making on land and investment builds on local needs and aspirations. In this context, there is broad agreement that improving accountability is critical to ensuring equitable management and governance of lands and of local communities. ,,Through action-oriented research, this project aims to fill a crucial knowledge gap on what practical steps can best promote and improve accountability in LSLAs. As a first step, the project will assess the strengths and weaknesses of legal frameworks in regulating LSLAs in each country, in Ghana, Cameroon and Senegal. That analysis will then feed into a participatory process to design and experiment with tools that will enable the local communities to engage in activities to improve accountability in agricultural investment processes. In each country, Legal and Social Accountability Tools (LSAT) will be tested in pilot sites, which aim to support efforts of local communities to secure their land rights, and to address relevant governance structures. Tools will be designed that specifically address gender dimensions of LSLAs. Research findings aim to help communities gain a better understanding of existing legal processes, to map systematically gaps in legislation and their implementation and to propose alternatives to existing legal frameworks and governance structures, as part of larger efforts to engage policy-makers on how best to achieve inclusive, transparent and accountable decision-making around land and investment. This project is being developed as part of a cohort of planned projects on promoting accountability around large-scale land acquisitions in Africa</narrative>
