   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Farmers in China are reluctant to switch to organic farming because they have a fear that they won&apos;t get a fair price, so the Beijing Farmers&apos; Market was developed so that farmers would have direct access to consumers, and consumers would have a venue where they can trust that they are purchasing uncontaminated food. However the farmer&apos;s market has been unable to implement a third party certification system because it is extremely expensive. So, they would like to develop a Participatory Guarantee System (PGS), which is more cost effective, democratic and transparent. PGS uses various stakeholders, including farmers, consumers, NGOs, media, and the government, to supervise the production process. Implementing a PGS will ensure accountability among the producers and help build trust between producers and consumers. This grant will be used to hire a full time staff person who will focus on developing and implementing this system. This person will create materials in Chinese about PGS that will be used to educate and promote PGS in other cities.</narrative>
