   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Almost 400 African producer organisations and small businesses are registered to sell into the Fair Trade market and have the potential to grow, delivering more income and opportunities to their small-scale farmer, women and young members. However, they cannot access the finance they need to do this because they are unable to articulate their financial needs even to social lenders that value the economic and social benefits they deliver. The Shared Interest Foundation [UK charity] will work with Fairtrade Africa to identify and recruit four or five specialist trainers to offer 150 socially responsible businesses in East and West Africa the opportunity to learn how to access finance through practical training on key financial concepts, improving their systems and making successful applications. At least 30 businesses will then receive direct assistance to develop proposals and apply for finance from Shared Interest Society [uK social lender] and other lenders if they so choose. The support will be given through workshops and fast-tracking up to a third of these to receive one-to-one financial mentoring. The project will test a new financial tool and a curriculum to improve the Foundation, Fairtrade Africa and others ability to support Fair Trade businesses and to share with other social lenders. This proposal is recommended for approval with a budget increase of 14,430. The approach is worthwhile and is likely to deliver the proposed results. The gaps in oversight by the applicant which were raised at the assessment have been addressed through adding an additional project monitoring activity to strengthen the Foundations presence and with more ongoing feedback and review (e.g., after each workshop) and a modest additional budget for this has been provided. This will improve the quality of implementation and the likelihood of success. It is recommended that the additional amount for this and the budget submitted for M&amp;E (which was omitted from the original proposal) be added to the sum considered. The project is essentially investing in the Foundation and its direct involvement in developing a practical training approach. Broadening the Foundations network of trainers and experts on the ground can produce good results in the future as the Foundation starts to implement its new vision for financial literacy and capacity building.</narrative>
