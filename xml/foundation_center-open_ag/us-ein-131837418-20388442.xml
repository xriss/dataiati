   <narrative xml:lang="EN">To consolidate the gains of the previous two grants to 30 rural women&apos;s organizations working in the rice sector and based in Bama, Banfora, and Di in western Burkina Faso. These organizations were supported by CBDF to share their experiences in strengthening their organizational leadership; building their capacity in various institutional areas; and highlighting the social, economic, and political power they derive from producing, transforming, and marketing rice. The main goals of the grant were to create a network of rural women&apos;s groups active in the production, processing and sale of their rice to derive the highest possible social, economic, and political benefit from their agricultural work; strengthen the capacity of rural women&apos;s groups that are forging the women rice producers&apos; network to understand and more effectively exercise their social, economic, and political rights; make the power of rice the basis for improving the well-being and rights of rural women in the rice sector</narrative>
