   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Many smallholder tea and coffee farmers in Tanzania, Kenya and Uganda earn less than US$2 a day, some as little as 11p a day. To improve their incomes and reduce their vulnerability to climate change they need to learn how to improve degraded soils, raise productivity, and find other crops to grow and sell. However most farmers cannot get help from conventional extension services, and the ratio of field technicians to farmers in the coops is low (1:300). Through this project the Cafedirect Producers Foundation and its partners will make it possible for farmers in 13 coops in Tanzania, Kenya and Uganda to tackle the problems they face on their farms themselves, using low cost solutions that other farmers in this network have already tried and tested. This approach recognises that many individual farmers are innovators and experts themselves. They can be the solution not the problem, if only they can systematise and access each others ideas and ways of working. The project will support 3 producer organisations to become Centres of Excellence, equipped and able to support each other, and a wider group of 10 coops to address their members environmental and climate problems, productivity, and the many challenges associated with small-scale farming and product quality. The goal is to capture what farmers in the network already know about problem solving and set up and use a wide range of channels for farmers to ask and get their personal problems and questions answered: mobile phone, radio, face-to-face meetings, a phone-and-web based Q&amp;A platform called WeFarm, farmer and technician workshops, outreach by technicians and trained farmer promoters. The project will then offer revolving credits, where needed, to support investments that farmers decide to make. As women and younger farmers face particular exclusion from coop structures and services, the project will ensure access to the support system through non-coop structures also e.g. local womens groups and targeted selection of female farmer promoters. In addition to the project grant, Cafedirect Producers&apos; Foundation has been awarded 35,310 to help strengthen the organisation and their work, enabling them to support their local partners in Africa to continue to provide effective solutions to the issues they address</narrative>
