   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In Zambia, people with disabilities and those with HIV/AIDS are recognised as being the most vulnerable and the poorest, due to the multiple disadvantages they experience. This project helps to support the creation of enterprise and employment opportunities for people affected, through both individual and group training, group mentoring and crucially, the provision of loans to individual and group members. These loans help disabled people to develop their own small enterprises to be able to support themselves and pay back the initial loan. Business and enterprise training focuses on: small trading, crafts, tailoring and shoemaking, farming inputs and horticulture, poultry and small livestock. They also work with small traders that could employ disabled people, supporting them with advice as well as loans. The laws on employing disabled people are good but not routinely put into action. The project will work with shop owners and unions to help make this happen. As a result, disabled people will be helped to find and develop employment opportunities and this will help to reduce the isolation they feel and the stigma they experience</narrative>
