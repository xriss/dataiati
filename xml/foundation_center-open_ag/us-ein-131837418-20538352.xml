   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The objective of this project is to test whether the UN Food and Agriculture Organization Guidelines on Responsible Governance of Tenure of Land, Fisheries and Forests can help increase accountability for large-scale land acquisitions in Mali, Nigeria, Uganda and South Africa. In 2007, the absolute number of people living in urban centers worldwide overtook the number of people living in the countryside for the first time ever. As a result, the attention of the international development community is increasingly turning urban. Yet, data from the United Nations indicates that three-fourths of sub-Saharan Africa&apos;s poor still live and work in the countryside. Effective access to, and ownership over, land and associated natural resources remains critically important for rural poor people in Africa to be able to build decent economic livelihoods and participate meaningfully in decisions that affect their lives. Against this backdrop, a recent convergence of multiple crises of food, fuel/energy, climate, and finance has occurred and one of the most immediate and important implications of these convergent crises is the revaluation of land as a scarce resource. This reality has driven industries governments, communities and individuals to acquire land at a scale never witnessed before, and Africa has played center stage to this wave of large-scale land acquisitions. In fact, estimates indicate that since 2006, international and domestic investors have acquired some 50-80 million hectares of land in middle and low income countries. This project will be implemented by Foodfirst Information and Action Network-FIAN with the participation of national citizen-based groups, regional and international civil society organizations as well as researchers and policy makers working on issues of land. It will apply a case study and participatory action-research approach. The project will generate evidence about how local peasants can enhance their ability to promote more equitable, transparent and accountable land acquisition mechanisms. Project results will be used to feed into the UN Committee on World Food Security&apos;s monitoring mechanism and into other relevant monitoring bodies at national (parliamentary commissions, national human rights organizations), and regional and international levels (African and UN human rights systems).</narrative>
