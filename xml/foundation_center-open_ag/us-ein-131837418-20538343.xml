   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Despite their critical role in promoting food security on the African continent, women continue to be marginalized in the distribution and allocation of land with far reaching implications for both family survival and national food security. The ability of African women to continue to engage in food crop farming to ensure food security for families and the continent at large is only possible if their right to land is not only protected but respected and fulfilled. Studies on women&apos;s land rights have shown, however, that the African woman&apos;s right to land is seriously under threat. African women have traditionally not had equal access to land as their male counterparts. This unequal access is now being further eroded by weak and opaque land laws and governance processes related to large scale land acquisitions (LSLAs). Critical knowledge is emerging about the impact of LSLAs on livelihoods in affected communities; however, very few have included a gender perspective. Moreover, very little knowledge exists about how African women, who have traditionally not had equal access to land have developed strategies to foster more gender equitable land governance policies and practices that, contribute to greater accountability and transparency around LSLAs. This research seeks to contribute to fill these knowledge gaps. ,,The ultimate goal of the project is to promote more gender equitable land governance policies that contribute to greater accountability and transparency around LSLAs. It will examine the conditions under which women can be empowered to effectively participate in the processes of LSLA and to ensure that the legal and policy frameworks foster better accountability and legitimacy in land governance in sub-Sahara Africa. The research will be implemented in six communities in three African countries (Ghana, Cameroon and Uganda), which have all experienced LSLAs and explore the various processes of land acquisition, the winners and losers in these transactions, the ways in which the losers, specifically rural African women, respond to their situation and finally the extent to which these responses are successful. It will create gender sensitive evidence-based knowledge that can be used by women, local communities, non-state actors and public authorities to enhance accountability and legitimacy in LSLAs processes. It will propose gender inclusive strategies for formal and informal institutions that will respect, promote and protect women&apos;s rights in processes of LSLAs</narrative>
