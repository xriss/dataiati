   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The organization pertains to a group of rural farm workers with many needs but no access to field consulting. The land is exhausted and eroded, but they receive support from no one. They need to respectfully manage the land, for which they must learn new techniques that do not harm the environment. They require training and organization in order to address rural issues. The project is in order for 10 farm workers who promote sustainable agriculture to participate in a leadership workshop in which they will receive technical training. They will meet two groups of Oaxaca farm workers who have already had successful experiences with this type of project. Once they have acquired the knowledge, the 10 farmers will then serve as teachers and examples for their neighbors. With a committed, trained and organized team that understands their town&#x2019;s situation, they can attain their goals</narrative>
