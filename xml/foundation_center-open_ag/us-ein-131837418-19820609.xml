   <narrative xml:lang="EN">For training for health care professionals, teachers, police, and civil society actors about child rights. Raising awareness and advising the community about child rights and registration of children. Giving legal assistance in order to obtain birth certificates. Sending radio broadcast about child rights. As a result of the DRC &apos;s long-running conflict children&apos;s registration system have collapsed. According to UNICEF, in 2011 only 41 % of children were registered. During the project, the organization is going to upgrade its own population register in order to provide a more accurate picture about registrations development of the area. A general feature that characterizes the conflict of DRC &apos;s eastern regions is the violence against civilians, particularly sexual violence, which is committed by all parties of the conflict. Particularly problematic is the culture of the military government&apos;s impunity. UNFPA estimates that the vast majority of sexual assault victims are teenage girls. In the project area Kabare, and especially in Mudaka administrative region, rebel forces have abducted women and girls as sex slaves. Victims of sexual violence often reject their children born as a result of rape. These children&apos;s risks related to unregistration increase even more, as they are already socially disadvantaged. The project aims to promote children&apos;s rights in Kabare, South Kivu. The aim is to contribute to the emergence of legal system that consideres the children&apos;s rights who are born as a result of a rape and who are orphaned because of the war, as well as to inform and train about children rights</narrative>
