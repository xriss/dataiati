   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The cooperative (Beekeepers in the Mountains of Los Altos) is faced by challenges to achieving its objectives. The internal problems include not having enough knowledge and materials to develop the organization&#x2019;s plans and to be able to access external funds that complement their own. The external and internal problems make it impossible to have productive, sustainable projects and activities that help to root the community to the land and territories. As a result, youth are the first to leave in order to improve their lives as migrants. The project is organized in three parts: obtain furnishings and equipment necessary for the cooperatives&apos; coordination and management tasks; develop skills for breeding or transferring the larvae of queen bees, as well as for extracting bee venom which will be used in the production of natural medicines; and to acquire equipment for bee venom extraction. The cooperative&#x2019;s partners, members of the 13 CCT, have extensive experience in family-based honey production. Over the past two years, they have received training in sustainable production and have also learned the techniques used for obtaining pollen and wax, among other courses that they&#x2019;ve taken. Nevertheless, the main problem is that the cooperative depends on businesses that sell queen bees, which halts the productivity of the 13 bee yards. For this reason, it is important for the cooperative to develop the skills needed to breed or transfer the larvae of queen bees using an organic system, and for extracting bee venom in order to produce natural medicines for the community and regional market</narrative>
