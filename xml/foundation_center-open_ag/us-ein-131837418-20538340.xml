   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Commercial interest and investments in agricultural land is not a new phenomenon, yet they have intensified in quantity, speed and size over the past five years with Africa as a main stage. Pressures are expected to continue globally in the future to meet demands of growing populations in a context of a diminishing supply of fertile land. Experiences to date have shown that even when communities welcome outside investment, they can face a number of potentially destabilizing risks, such as dispossession of lands, displacement, loss of access to livelihoods, and increased conflict due to greater competition for land. Communities are often left out of land concession-granting processes, and thus have little power to advocate for equitable terms that support local prosperity and protect community interests. This is particularly the case with communities that manage land use and ownership through customary legal rules, and have no formal legal title to their lands. In these contexts, communal lands not under cultivation can become flashpoints, because they are often and the first to be allocated to investors, claimed by elites, and appropriated for state development projects. Studies have shown, further, that increased scarcity and competition for land can trigger the breakdown in customary rules, especially those that previously protected the land rights of vulnerable groups and ensured equitable and sustainable management of communal resources.</narrative>
