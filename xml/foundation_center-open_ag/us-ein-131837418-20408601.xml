   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Organize a campaign advocating for and revitalizing traditional knowledge and aims to mobilize the Cordilleran youth to defend their culture, land, and natural resources, as well as advance self determination through systems of education and exchange. The group will organize the Cultural Education Festival, the Balik Ili (community immersion/ going back to indigenous communities), and educational activities including the Youth Elders Dialogue, focus group discussions, forums, and a leadership training seminar. The festival will run for a week in line with the Kaigorotan Youth Week (a commemoration of a peaceful assembly against the commercialization of culture that was violently dispersed by police). It will include discussions, forums, exhibits, a film showing, and cultural workshops on genuine regional autonomy, climate change, sustainable development, food security, right to education, and human rights, among other topics. The Balik Ili will enable indigenous youth studying or living in the city to stay with communities in the Cordillera for a minimum of one week to help the youth learn about these communities&apos; culture and struggle to protect their land and heritage. The youth will provide tutoring in literacy and mathematics and teach arts and cultural performance skills. The final aspect of the project (educational actitivities) will be centered on the needs of the communities and are aimed at helping the Cordillera youth develop strategies for the communities to protect their traditional systems of resource management and cultural identity.</narrative>
