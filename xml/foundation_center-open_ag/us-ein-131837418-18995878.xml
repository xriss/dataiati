   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Large scale deforestation due to forestry activities since the 1980s have eroded the remaining thin layer of top soil and led to impoverished sandy soil in YUM&apos;s working area of Bukit Batu. As a result, the communities have great difficulties to produce fresh food and have to purchase it at high costs. This is aggravated by a lack of knowledge about how to handle the soil, to make compost and mulch and to use land around the house for the production of fresh vegetables. Home gardens are therefore rare. As a result, 90% of fresh vegetables have to be imported from Java and South Kalimantan; fish and poultry are mostly bought in the market. In 2009, YUM began designing a sustainable agricultural project to address the need for agricultural development in the area and improve the nutritional and economic situation of the target group. Thanks to funding a sound research program to design and implement trials on soil rehabilitation through composting, mulching, and vermiculture could be expanded in 2011, and a demonstration area to serve as demonstration for farmers was created. The agro project has started to produce organic vegetables and chicken that are sold in a nearby residential complex. In July 2011, agreement was signed to conduct a 3  year project (to December 2014) to establish two Rural Centres for demonstration and training purposes, training of 300 villagers with a view to establish home gardens using simple organic farming practices. Desired impacts: Increased use of sustainable farming methods. Increased capacity building: Local farmers acquire information on agricultural opportunities, market development, technical information and natural pesticides treatments that are more affordable to them. Improved livelihoods of participants. Improved nutrition and health</narrative>
