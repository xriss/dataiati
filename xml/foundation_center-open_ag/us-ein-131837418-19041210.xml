   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The farming of nutritious mushrooms can provide a sustainable income for poor farmers. Mushroom farming requires little space or equipment, making it perfectly suited to people without assets. However, small-scale mushroom farmers in Ghana are struggling to make a living. The mushroom market is fragmented and under-developed, with no centralised marketing service to guarantee fair prices to producers. Minimal training exists and is often too costly for farmers, who do not have access to finance to help develop their business. This project will tackle the main barriers to mushrooms becoming a vibrant industry in Ghana, building the capacity of a small but determined national association of mushroom growers. This project also will establish a central marketing service to sell and guarantee quality. It will also offer micro-credits and record-keeping training for mushroom growers. Intensive training will be developed and trialled with a pilot group of existing growers, then rolled out in all regions where there are members. The project will help the Association to invest, speed up spawn delivery, assure members get quality spawn and earn an income for the Association itself. As a result, mushroom growers will have increased income and an improved standard of living</narrative>
