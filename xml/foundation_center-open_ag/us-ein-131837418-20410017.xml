   <narrative xml:lang="EN">For With the funds, Environmental Conservation Society (Switch ON) will develop a model for sustainable and integrated farming that addresses challenges of modern agricultural methods in India. Most of India relies on agriculture based livelihoods, but fragmented small land holdings and complex inter related issues complicate the entire system from harvest to market. These challenges include inadequate irrigation methods, which often use diesel, chemical farming practices, over reliance on middle men in supply chains, which frequently result in vegetable quality degradation (often by as much as 40%), and a lack of knowledge and information. Three SwitchON coordinators and five field staff with SwitchON&apos;s partner Farmer Producer Organization will analyze the day to day functioning and support local markets and farmers in a push to eliminate the need for middlemen and increase the direct profit for farmers. They will develop irrigation system that relies on solar power and can support farmers at a reasonable price and the groups will set up a solar cold storage system to integrate in the supply chain activities. Additionally, funds will support trainings for farmers in organic practices, better prices for agricultural inputs, and a membership drive</narrative>
