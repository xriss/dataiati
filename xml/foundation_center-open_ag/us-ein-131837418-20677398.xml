   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project aims to increase the income of 7,800 cotton producer families through supporting them to form 105 community-based producer groups to receive training in good agricultural, environmental, social and business practices. Source Trust (ST) in partnership with the Great Lakes Cotton Company LTD., (GLCC) will support farmers to form groups through 15 Agribusiness Centres in 3 districts which are producing 50% of Malawi&#x2019;s cotton. The project aims to increase productivity and producer income by 35% over three years while at the same time reducing the negative impacts of cotton production on the environment. An expert in water management will undertake a study against the criteria for water management included in the Cotton Made in Africa (Cmia) and Better Cotton Initiative (BCI) standards. The cotton produced will feed into the Sainsbury garment supply chain with the manufacture of final products in Bangladesh. 4,000 Women in the project area will be supported to grow cassava and sweet potato to improve food security whilst improving their leadership skills. 4,500 In-school youth will be provided with training in cotton production on plots of cotton with the proceeds going to benefit the schools to help stem the flow of youth moving away from agricultural production.This project proposal is a good fit with Sainsbury&#x2019;s Fair Development Fund strategy. Sainsbury&#x2019;s have made a commitment to develop Malawi as a new source of cotton for its garments which also fits with its sustainability agenda and its membership commitments under the Better Cotton Initiative. Sainsbury&#x2019;s has done a lot of ground work already to build the supply chain from cotton farmers in Malawi to its manufacturers in Bangladesh. The local partner has a track record of working within the framework of various cotton initiatives for sustainable cotton. Source Trust has a track record on working with small-holder farmers to improve their yields and income. The project proposal does not adequately reflect the in-kind contribution made by Sainsbury&#x2019;s and it is recommended that this be adjusted at set up stage.</narrative>
