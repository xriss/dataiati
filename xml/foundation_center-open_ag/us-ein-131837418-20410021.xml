   <narrative xml:lang="EN">For With the funds, Friends of Lake Turkana will hold a one day workshop in Nairobi to bring together approximately 30 researchers and key stakeholders from civil society and affected communities to discuss the impacts of the upcoming filling of the Gibe III Dam on the Lower Om River in Ethiopia. This major development poses a major environmental and social threat to downstream communities and Lake Turkana in Kenya, which is the world&apos;s largest desert lake, and could induce long term poverty and loss of cultural heritage for the people in the region. Local communities have had no say in the process, and no comprehensive environmental impact assessment has been conducted on either the Gibe III or related irrigation projects. Though Ethiopia has offered to negotiate with Kenya, there has been little progress. The group will organize a meeting of scientists, politicians, civil society, and affected people in Nairobi to address the problem and develop a solution. The goals of the meeting will be to inform the participants of the current situation and next steps, facilitate discussions on coordinating efforts to maximize effectiveness, and develop a plan of action. The group will organize informal meeting with local civil society to share the outcomes of the meeting and discuss further engagement with decision makers</narrative>
