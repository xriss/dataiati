   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In 2000, FXB introduced the Village Network program in Rwandan communities devastated by conflict and HIV/AIDS. The premise of the program is simple: the best way to protect children who have been orphaned or affected by poverty and AIDS is to strengthen the families who care for them. Since then, FXB has implemented 39 Village Networks in Rwanda, helping nearly 20,000 impoverished children and adults to meet their basic needs. FXB proposes to launch a new Village Network in rural Rwanda that aims to improve upon financial and small business services offered to 80 families through the development of new agricultural or livestock cooperatives, partnerships with local and international micro-finance service providers, and the creation of a peer entrepreneur mentoring program. The project will serve approximately 500 people, of whom 400 will be children, in 80 impoverished households. In addition, approximately 2,000 people in the wider community will benefit from child protection and HIV prevention services, as well as water and sanitation improvements. In total, FXB expects to reach at least 2,500 children and adults</narrative>
