   <narrative xml:lang="EN">As part of MARCH&apos;s three year plan to counter conflict and radicalization among the youth in vulnerable areas in Lebanon, through art and culture in the first phase, and then through empowering them to bring about positive change in their own community and transforming them into activists and agents of generational change, we are looking to kickstart two new phases in our project. It is important to note that these 2 phases can be done in parallel as suggested in this proposal as well as chronologically. 
The first one is the logical continuation of our original peace-building project between the Tripolitan communities. Following the success of the play and the establishment of the cultural cafe between Syria Street (bab el tebbneh) and adjacent Muhajarin Street (Jabal Mohsen) and helping  the youth to use art to bring them together as well as voice their frustrations and concerns , today we aim to empower them to bring about positive change to their neighborhoods and communities, by providing them with the necessary tools and capacities to rehabilitate the shops and commercial spaces in the area. Currently, Syria Street has around 350 business venues that are prevented from operating properly due to the poor condition of the street and store fronts. We aim to address the situation of 50 shops in this first phase,  before extending the project when proven effective. In order to counter the dire economic conditions of the area, which are correlated with instability and violence, we want to involve the youth, most vulnerable category to yield to radicalization and extremist ideology due to lack of purpose, lack of hope, poverty and decreasing social cohesion.
The first phase of the project will involve technical capacity building of around 50 youth in various aspects of rebuilding (electricity, woodwork, paint etc.). The second phase will involve them in refurbishing and renovating shops on the Syria Street (and adjacent street in Jabal Mohsen, Muhajirine Street) under the supervision of professionals. The youth will also promote their work and raise awareness about the conditions they live in, through rap songs and video clips in order to continue using art as a catalyst for social change. 
In the second project, we hope to replicate the success of the Tripoli project in Akkar as a way to counter growing radicalization and extremism in the region.
We will start by creating a theatrical performance inspired by the lives of impoverished Lebanese communities. Castings will be held to hire between 20 and 35 actors/singers and actresses/singers aged between 16-30, from lower economic backgrounds who are unemployed The youth will be picked from different religious and cultural backgrounds, from areas with very poor social cohesion.   They will undergo training in acting, as well as leadership and communication, as well as received advice from opinion leaders and famous artists. A comedy play or musical inspired by their lives will be written by a director and a team of artists who will supervise the rehearsals before touring Akkar, Tripoli and Beirut to present the play and spread a message of tolerance and hope.  The play performance will be the first step as part of an overall plan similar to that of Tripoli as below: 
1. Recruitment of (marginalized) youth (part of this project) 
2. Art reconciliation with the use of branding and messaging (part of this project ) 
3. Deeping reconciliation through a sustainable and symbolic
platform: The Cultural Caf&#xE9; and activism art. (outside the scope of this project) 
4. Transforming participants into activists to be a part of a larger
youth movement and empowering them to improve their
conditions in their communities (outside the scope of this project)</narrative>
