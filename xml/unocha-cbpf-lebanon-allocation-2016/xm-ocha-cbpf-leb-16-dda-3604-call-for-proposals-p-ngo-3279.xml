   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Even though Lebanon is considered somewhat liberal, individuals with alternative Sexual Orientation amp Gender Identity (SOGI)s continue to face legal and social barriers that hinder their access to holistic protection services. Admittedly, the spillover of the protracted crisis in Syria into Lebanon has resulted in a number of consequences, one of which is the increasing tensions between displaced refugees and hosting communities. The situation in Syria reignited social tensions between Lebanese and Syrians, which has led to further stigmatization and alienation of the Syrian population. Seeing as survivors of sexual Gender-Based Violence are a marginalized minority, those of Syrian nationality have become one of the most vulnerable communities in Lebanon. Moreover, their needs are barely being met due to the presence of only a few organizations that possess the expertise in addressing individuals with alternative SOGI needs, funding shortage, and the political crisis of the country. 

As for social barriers, they are often exacerbated by homophobia and violent acts towards persons with alternative sexualities. These discriminatory practices result from the socialization of Lebanese individuals of all genders, and due to the lack of legal protection mechanisms, generally, and the absence of laws that protect gender and sexually nonconforming individuals from violations, specifically. Discrimination resulting from homophobia is not limited to social discrimination in everyday practice, but affects all avenues of life and services, including health and medical services, access to legal services and justice, mobility, and many others. For instance, according to one study among medical doctors, it was discovered that only 50% of physicians were willing to provide medical services for homosexuals and often perceive alternative sexual behaviors as a &#x201C;disease&#x201D;. Moreover, a significant number of Lebanese and International NGOs providing services in Lebanon lack the specialized and appropriate tools, skills, and sensitivity to address SGBV survivors and provide them with services without harm, stigma, or discrimination.

Due to the aforementioned causes, there are two main gaps in terms of service provision for survivors of violence living in Lebanon. The first is the lack of holistic, adequate, specialized and sensitive services to these marginalized communities while the other is the difficulty in reaching these individuals while ensuring their safety. As such, this project will address these challenges with the ultimate aim to enhance the overall well being of SGBV survivors in Lebanon, through enhancing their access to sensitive services and the reduction of stigma, and through community-based interventions. We will offer life skills lessons and trainings to enhance their tools and access to protection and self-care, peer-to-peer trainings to improve outreach, and activities to increase their well being and livelihood. 

The project will attain its objective through enhancing the provision of holistic protection services for persons with alternative SOGI in Beirut and Mount Lebanon. Additionally, MOSAIC aims at ensuring an efficient and sustainable protection mechanism by expanding its referral system in order to include all services providers/services that survivors of violence can benefit from.</narrative>
