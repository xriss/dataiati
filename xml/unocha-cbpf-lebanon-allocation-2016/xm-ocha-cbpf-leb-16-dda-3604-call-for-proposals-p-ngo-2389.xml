  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Even though Lebanon is considered as somewhat liberal however, individuals with alternative SOGIs continue to face legal and social barriers hindering these individuals access to holistic protection services. 
Admittedly, the protracted civil war in Syria resulted in consequences that have spilled over to neighboring countries, increasing tensions between displaced refugees and hosting communities. The situation in Syria reignited social tensions between Lebanese and Syrians, which has led to further stigmatization and alienation of the Syrian population, and seeing as the LGBTIQ community in Lebanon is a marginalized minority, LGBTIQ Syrians have become one of the most vulnerable communities in Lebanon whose needs are marginally being met due to funding shortage and the political umbrella of the country. 
As for social barriers, they are often exemplified through homophobia and violent acts towards persons with alternative sexualities. These discriminatory practices are resultant from the socialization of Lebanese individuals of all genders, whereby they are raised to believe in conservative social norms that does not include sexual or gender diversity. This homophobia is not limited to certain group of the Lebanese population for instance, in a study among medical doctors it was discovered that only 50% of physicians were willing to provide medical services for homosexuals and they often perceived alternative sexual behaviors as a &#x201C;disease&#x201D;. 
Due to the aforementioned cause, there are two main gaps in terms of service provision for LGBTIQ communities in Lebanon the first being the lack of holistic, adequate, specialized and sensitive services to the LGBTIQ communities while the other is the lack of any service to individuals residing outside of Beirut. As such, this project will address these challenges ultimately aiming to enhance the overall wellbeing of LGBTIQ persons in Lebanon, through enhancing their access to sensitive services and the reduction of stigma. we will offer life skills, personality and team building lessons in our offices in Beirut to increase social cohesion and stability.
The project will attain its objective through enhancing the provision of holistic protection services for persons with alternative SOGI beyond the Beirut area, which is known as the service hub for LGBTIQ individuals.

Additionally, issues of livelihood and protection pertaining to refugees have sparked up, and tensions due to job employment have been ignited, making the marginalized and vulnerable communities more prone to the consequences of unemployment and inflation. Notwithstanding, MOSAIC aims to empower the refugee and host LGBTIQ community by providing the beneficiaries of this project with the proper skills to produce potential artistic products of manual work that can be later sold to generate income, thereby promoting self-funding during this dry economic phase.</narrative>
