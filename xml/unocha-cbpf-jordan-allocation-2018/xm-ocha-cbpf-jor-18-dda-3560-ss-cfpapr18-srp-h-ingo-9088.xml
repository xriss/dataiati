The second component of this project is to maintain a buffer stock of medication amp supplies for primary health care, with the aim of mobilizing the mobile units to respond to the displacement of individuals into various communities in Dar&#x2019;a, as a result of the expected violence and attacks. These attacks are expected to occur in the communities, close to FSA and the GoS from one front, and JKBW and the FSA on another front.  As these mobile units can also be deployed for use of emergency response for a vulnerable population . 
The buffer stock will be established according to latest guidelines as per sector planning. However, in case of reconciliation of south and north in Niwa area, the buffer stock will be established in Niwa hospital (warehouse) to take care of North of Niwa area as to avoid any stock-outs during the emergency phase for any emergency response.
