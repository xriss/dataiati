   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The establishment of greywater system in Village 5 in Azraq Camp to address the protection and safety concerns of Syrian refugees.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In April 2014, Azraq Camp opened and is currently home to more than 36,000 Syrian refugees living in four villages. The camp was designed and constructed incorporating some of the many lessons learned from Za&#x2019;atari Refugee Camp. One of the key differences between the two camps was the design of the communal WASH blocks. In Za&#x2019;atari, the WASH blocks were very large and were designed to cover the needs of hundreds of people surrounding the blocks. In Azraq Camp, the WASH blocks were designed very differently, with twelve shelters in each plot served by two twin WASH blocks (each consisting of a washing area and a toilet) set on either end of the plot, with male facilities at one end of the plot and women&#x2019;s facilities at the other. As Azraq Camp evolved, households gradually stopped using the communal WASH blocks, and began bathing in their own shelters. The low usage rates of the current WASH blocks, in which only 8% of girls and women use the facilities 9% of boys and 11% of men, have highlighted protection, physical and safety concerns shared by the Syrian refugees.This was increasingly evident in the large number of greywater channels across the camps and pools of water outside shelters. These pools posed large risks in terms of public health, particularly to children. The issue of pools of standing water has been a particular concern in Azraq Camp during the previous successive outbreaks of Hepatitis A. To address the concerns of Syrian refugees in using the communal WASH blocks, World Vision aims to expand the greywater project established by UNICEF, in partnership with ACF, in 2016 and implement a household greywater project in Village 5 in Azraq Camp. 

World Vision proposes to connect all of the households in Village 5 in Azraq Camp to the underground collection tanks at the communal WASH blocks, to enable the greywater from the shelters (from the kitchens and bathing areas) to be collected and safely disposed. WV will consult with other implementing partners on the current design of the greywater system in Azraq Camp, to learn from the lessons and experience of the other partners. To ensure harmonization in approach, reduced operation and maintenance complexities, as well as improved monitoring and coordination, WV will implement this Greywater Project, in accordance with the agreed design and implementation methodology for the greywater network project in Azraq Camp, and in coordination with UNICEF, ACF and other partners. Due to the size of Village 5, WV will acquire additional funds required for the effective implementation of the Greywater Project and cover any additional costs further incurred due to slow rate of implementation, challenges, additional labour costs etc. WV will proactively participate in the various sector coordination at a camp level and national level to work closely with other partners, which may also be awarded JHF funding for the installation of greywater systems in Azraq Camp. To ensure sustainability of this project, WV will provide Operations and Maintenance (OampM) training and tools to targeted beneficiaries living in each block (total of 241 blocks) in Village 5 of Azraq Camp. during the duration of the project and before its completion and handing it over the project to UNICEF.

The proposed project aligns directly with WASH sector priority - Cash assistance in Villages 2 and 5 targeting vulnerable individuals through the expansion of the Greywater Project, JRP sector specific objective - Providing safe and equitable access to gender appropriate sanitation services in Zaatari, Azraq and KAP camps, and included in the JRP 2018-2020 project 6.2 (REF 6.2 - Construction, operation and maintenance of (greywater network) in camps). The concept of the project was also endorsed by the WASH Sector and Basic Needs and Livelihoods Working Group in Azraq</narrative>
