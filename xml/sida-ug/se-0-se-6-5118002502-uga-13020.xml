    <narrative xml:lang="EN">The&#xA0;original&#xA0;agreement,&#xA0;ending Dec&#xA0;2013,&#xA0;was&#xA0;extended&#xA0;with&#xA0;one&#xA0;year&#xA0;(Jan&#xAD;Dec&#xA0;2014).&#xA0;The final report was submitted to the Embassy in September 2014 and it seemed unclear the reasons why the report was submitted before the end of the extension. A speculation by then responsible PO is that when the original agreement ended December 2013 and the extension of one year was done, its likely there was an oversight of changing the dates of the initially planned completion report for the period Dec 2010 &#x2013; Dec 2013. It was however decided to do a bridging period from January -March 2015 before a new agreement was signed for Phase 2. The report for the bridging period was also supposed to cover Sep &#x2013; Dec 2014.
Summary of some of the results as of the executive summary in the completion report of Dec 2010 &#x2013; Sep 2014.
- There are strong signs that MHP is helping people to know their rights. For example, knowledge on where Maternal, Sexual &amp; Reproductive Health services are provided increased from 78% at baseline to 96% at endline; the proportion of people with knowledge of at least 3 danger signs in pregnancy and child birth more than doubled from 26% to 67%; the proportion of community members who know their MSRH rights and; those who feel it is necessary to be supervised by a skilled health worker during pregnancy quadrupled from about 13% to 81% and 98% respectively
- MHP has conducted a total number of 28,290 meetings to date reaching a total of 973,662 people (364,512 male and 609,150 female). The number of people reached through individual sessions alone also increased from 20,648 in 2012 to a cumulative of 537,412 people (206,262 male and 331,150 female) by September 2014.
- Overall, the MHP reached a total of 1,511,074 people (570,774 male and 940,300 female) through individual and group sensitization sessions combined. Group sensitization meetings contribute 64% of the overall attendances which makes it the main approach for targeting the majority of the population. Male participation slightly increased by 1% from 37% in 2012 and remained stagnant at 38% in the last 2 years of the project.
- The MHP has successfully changed the dialogue between health workers and community members from confrontation to constructive discussions. In all the districts there are no reports of confrontation between duty bearers and clients.&#xA0;
- One of the fundamental improvements is the reality of effective demand. The rights based approach has been the main game changer; people know their entitlements and go for them. Communities now know which questions to ask at each level.
- To date 43 health facilities have been supported to conduct 2,165 integrated outreaches. By December 2013, the project was remaining with 27% to achieve 100% on client satisfaction. Health data show positive trends in service utilisation in all districts. Although there still drop outs between 1st and 4th ANC, improvements have been observed, postnatal &#x2013; an indicator which performs poorly nationally has also improved significantly.
- Client satisfaction increased from 61.4% at baseline to 73% and endline.
- There are systematic feedback mechanisms, these include; notice boards, suggestion boxes, dialogue meetings and providing feedback to clients at the waiting areas. At Maanyi HC III, there is an open day where communities are invited to be informed about their facility and are given opportunity to ask questions and be answered.
- In all the project areas, the Health Unit Management Committees have established themselves as a functional bridge between community members and health facilities. They have also provided the linkages with local government leadership.&#xA0;
- The capacity of IPs to advocate has generally improved; HAG reported improved capacity to gather evidence and executing impactful advocacy at national and district levels. The MHP has given opportunity to all IPs involved to interface with other CSOs, parliament and MoH. It was through the MHP that IPs secured MoUs with districts of implementation. THETA has used the MHP approach and experience to develop its own advocacy strategy for their Traditional Medicine Department. The Voices for Health Rights coalition from which the MHP IPs were drawn has also increased its influence in the sector and at least all the MHP IPs are visible at policy level in the health sector.</narrative>
