    <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Strengthening of Private Sector Engagement Project (SPEED) in Northern Uganda and Karamoja was implemented in Lamwo and Kitgum Districts of Northern Uganda and four districts of Karamoja: Amudat, Moroto, Nakapiripirit and Napak between February 2014 and January 2018. The main goal of the project was to Increase incomes in high growth sectors through inclusive market development for 114,055 farmers and traders in Northern Uganda and Karamoja (i.e 46,275 in Northern Uganda and 67,780 in Karamoja).
In terms of attaining this goal the project empowered 194,989 beneficiaries in both Northern Uganda and Karamoja representing a performance of 171%. For Karamoja, the project targeted to empower 67,780 farmers (i.e 66,780 farmers, 600 traders and 400 youth). By end of the project, 142,698 (210.5%)beneficiaries (i.e 136,514 farmers, 3,508 traders and 2,676 youth) had been empowered.
The project aimed at 3 key objectives:
(i) increasing gender inclusiveness of selected value chains
(ii) improving the capacity of local business community to positively influence the business environment and
(iii) Increasing the access to demand driven skills and productive employment for youth
While initially the project covered both Northern Uganda (Kitgum and Lamwo districts) and Karamoja, the component for Northern Uganda came to completion on 31st December 2015 while the component for Karamoja that was expected to end in July 2017 was extended to January 2018. The end of project evaluation and&#xA0; assessment for the Northern Uganda component was reflected in the conclusion of performance report for 2016 dated 9th July 2016 attached in Trac. Consequently, this end of project evaluation now&#xA0;focuses on the Karamoja component that has been implemented for the largest and later part of the implementation&#xA0; period.
In accordance with the project document, regular annual reports including a Results Framework were prepared by IRC and annual reviews held by Sida and IRC. In addition, a final project evaluation for Karamoja was carried out by an independent consultant and both the annual reports and final evaluation provide a basis for assessing project achievements. Based on these, the following results have been achieved by the project as reflected under each main objective:
Objective 1. increasing gender inclusiveness of selected value chains
A gender analysis conducted in 2014 to identify gender and power dynamics, decision making processes, roles, control of resources and sharing of benefits between men and women indicated that men had more capacity for opening more land for cultivation than women and while women had less time as they have to clear, plant and weed, harvest and clean produce both from their own and spouses gardens in addition to household chores. Men also had a more control on procurement of production equipment like granaries, ox ploughing, fencing and marketing surplus produce. In terms of livestock production, there were culturally ascribed roles of females such as watering, milking while men&apos;s included security and marketing livestock and livestock products. This setting needed to be addressed as it creates power imbalances between men and women, overburdens women and limits their opportunities and potential to contribute to production and economic development. The project has addressed this through:
-The project promoted more joint involvement of men and their wives in various stages of production of crops. The involvement of women in post-harvest cycles which influences sharing production benefits increased from 24% in 2014 to 78.8% by end of the project in January 2018.
-An elaborate gender training manual was developed and training in various gender aspects was conducted in joint groups of men and women. The project ensured that community based training personnel were both male and female. This has increased joint planning, mutual roles, sharing roles and responsibilities between men and women.
-Improved output of Agricultural and Livestock Products- From capacity building programmes, the project has ensured that at least more than 3 acres of land are cultivated by farmers especially due to adoption of mechanization and modern farming practices to boost agriculture production. While in 2014, only about 1% of the farmers cultivated more than 3 acres, by the end of the project in 2018, 38.7% of farmers had cultivated and utilised over 3 acres for crop production with 29.1% cultivating 3 to 5 acres and 9.6% cultivating over 5 acres. About 95,800 of the targeted farmers (84%) received two five training on various aspects of production while 68% of the target population had participated in in demonstrations set up in their communities (village level). These trainings and demonstrations are likely to have long term positive impact on the region&apos;s agricultural production.
&#xA0;-Related to the above and not withstanding climate challenges, the project registered a tremendous increase in agricultural productivity with overall household yields estimated at 429.6Kg per acre (sorghum-233.3Kg, finger millet-262.5 and maize 413.3kg from about 100kg per acre in 2014.
-As part of boosting livestock production, the project established 57 demo Kraals in conjunction with NARO demonstration and training in good livestock management practices was conducted. These demos were estimated to serve about 54,281 heads of cattle, 56,281 goats and 19,233 sheep. In addition, the project established 50 manyatta based livestock kraals where 2,634 farmers including 524 females were trained particularly on good livestock management practices, establishment of farm structures, animal feeding and nutrition, reproduction and breeding management, general husbandry, disease and vector control. The project further provided training to 45 Community Based trainers through Agro-pastoral Farmer Field Schools and training for 46 community Animal Health Workers for regular training and support to livestock farmers.
-The Community Animal Health workers trained supported regular treatment of 22,500 livestock and vaccination of 45,000 livestock during the project period. The project further supported development of a Livestock Drug Supply Chain in Karamoja through supporting livestock farmers to access drugs at subsidized prices and support to veterinary stockiest shops in records and stock management and linkage to Vet Centre and Community Animal Health workers and demo kraals. In addition, the project established a livestock market in Amudat for improving the livestock sales in the region.
&#xA0;
-The project was instrumental in addressing livestock disease emergencies such as vaccination of 31,498 cattle against Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) vaccination of 3,100 livestock against Contagious Caprine Pleuro Pneumonia (CCPP) in Napak and Moroto in 2014, vaccination against Lumpy skin disease in 1760 small ruminants, 6516 cattle against trypanosomiasis, 7,691 small ruminants against CCCP. The project supported a tick-borne control strategy and established demonstrations in which 7,500 cattle and goats were routinely sprayed and dewormed.
&#xA0;
-In order to address limited water for livestock and crop production during the drought periods, the project established two valley tanks at Motany and solar valley in Amudat district and water user committees were put in place. The committees received training from the district water department in order to maintain the infrastructure
-Beneficiary households on average own 10 heads of cattle, 6 sheep, 23 goats and 8 chickens with annual incomes from livestock estimated at Ugx 1,095,200. With the above-mentioned interventions, the level of productivity and income is expected to increase in the long term.
The project supported strengthening linkages between bee farmers and honey buyers and capacity building in proper harvesting and improved management of bees resulting in increased amounts and quality of honey produced and increase in price of honey from about Ugx 3,000 to 6,000 and supported groups increased number of bee hives from 1,993 in 2015 to 2,236 by end of 2017.
-Post Harvest handling and Collective marketing: The project supported Commodity Market committees (CMCs) through training, collective bulking, marketing and value addition. A total of 1,122 participants participated in the trainings on best practices in harvesting agricultural produce while 1350 farmers were trained in post-harvest handling practices. In addition, farmers were provided with 63 demo equipment such as for grain milling, honey processing, rice mills.
Due to the above interventions, there was a marked increase in both sale volumes, prices and amount of sales through the CMCs. For example, while on average individuals sold about 475.75Kg of maize earning USD 112.1, CMCs on average sold 2,650Kg of maize earning about 729.2 due to market linkages and increased quality of produce sold.
In terms of financial inclusion, a total of 203 Village Saving and Loan Associations (VSLAs) were formed having 2,122 males and 3,109 females. In addition, 214 existing VSALs were supported by the project and 60.2% were formally registered which enables them to access other funding and resources and can enable them to live beyond the project. In terms of business training, 125 VSLA groups were trained using the Competency based Economies, Formation of Enterprise (CEFE) approach. The VSLA on average saved about UGX 2,664,715 (USD 740.2) with individual average savings of UGX 193,484 (USD 53.8). VSLAs has a high average retention rate above 84% largely due to spousal discussions sessions that strengthened cohesion amongst members and played a crucial role in addressing gender imbalance aspects like sharing of responsibilities and benefits, joint planning and working together among couples and families. Assessment of impact of VSLAs in 2018 found that 57% of VSLAs owned group projects, had clear management strategies like management committees, registration, constitution in place.&#xA0;&#xA0; Through the groups, a number of equipment like maize grinding, paste processing machines were acquired and well maintained and generating incomes for the groups. The groups have been instrumental in acquiring improved goat breeds with ability to produce twins and grow faster attracting market and better production for VSLAs and members.
Objective 2. Improved capacity of Local Business Community to positively influence the Business Environment by 2017
The project supported the Karamoja Livestock Development Forum as a multi-stakeholder platform in Karamoja and 415 beneficiaries (28% women) were involved. The forum aimed at addressing issues of developing capacity of forum members and attracting goods and services in the region, linkages with markets and business opportunities, coordinating issues on animal health and livestock production. Through the project, the forum organized the first Karamoja Trade Fair in 2015 in Moroto that attracted 38 external exhibitors and 4,837 participants while the subsequent fair attracted 85 exhibitors and 8,714 participants. In addition, through the project KLDF has developed a Karamoja Livestock Strategy and Master Plan aimed at aligning development of development of livestock in the region. A number of exposure and mentoring visits for KLDF with advanced private sector forums such as with Kampala City Traders Association, Lodwar market in Kenya, Turkana Chamber of commerce to promote cross border trade and participation in the Annual Jinja agriculture show were supported. These will be fundamental in identifying opportunities, linkages and new ways of conducting business for the private sector in Karamoja.
The project further supported KLDF through trainings in leadership, advocacy and lobbying, access to financial services, saving and organizing trade shows. The project further supported the forum in organizing and conducting the keep Karamoja Clean campaigns. These actions have boosted the sustainability of KLDF in terms of implementing self-sustaining actions like market linkages, development of plans and proposals and management of the forum.
Objective 3: Increasing the access to demand driven skills and productive employment for youth
In partnership with the Ultimate Choice Educational services, the project provided customized business skills packages to 8 Business Forum sub-sectors to address existing skill gaps which included poverty analysis, enterprise selection, planning and management and this benefitted 230 including 106 males and 124 females and 1,954 businesses.
The project further enhanced the skills of the youth in Karamoja particularly skills related to savings, entrepreneurship and life skills that were necessary in starting or expanding their businesses, better business management and meeting their needs. In terms of entrepreneurship training 741 youth including 404 females were engaged in 42 youth clubs and supported. 103 youth were supported with tailored in-kind grants to improve their businesses.</narrative>
