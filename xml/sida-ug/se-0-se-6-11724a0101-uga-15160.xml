The OHCHR results framework for FY2020 maintains the overall five thematic priorities of the FY2019 program and results stated under each theme are more or less the same as in the previous results framework.&#xA0;

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">Some of the results reported are:
- A new network of Women Human Rights Defenders has been created, based on OHCHR&apos;s training programme, which is already engaging with regional and international human rights mechanisms.
- Human rights awareness trainings for journalists  with a focus on women journalists - has resulted in increased knowledge on human rights including womens rights and impunity and accountability. A media review shows that media has increased coverage and reporting on the human rights violations.
- Victims of human rights violations in Karamoja has received legal advice as well as medical and psychosocial attention by the Uganda Law Society (ULS) and the African Center for Treatment and Rehabilitation of Torture Victims (ACTV), as a result of the joint monitoring.&#xA0;
- CSOs from different regions in Uganda have been equipped with an updated version of a database to register cases of human rights violations and abuses, which improves CSOs human rights reporting capacity.
- Members and staff of the National Council for Disabilities have increased knowledge on the linkages between human rights and the Sustainable Development Goals, with a specific focus on the rights of persons with disabilities, which has led to improved inclusion of persons with disabilities in district local government planning and decision-making processes.
- The Inter-Ministerial Committee on Human Rights has gained greater awareness of the UN Guiding Principles on business and human rights, and is moving towards the drafting of a National Action Plan on Business and Human Rights under the lead by the Ministry of Gender, Labour and Social Development.&#xA0;
- OHCHR reports that law enforcement agencies demonstrated improved knowledge on human rights standards as a result of OHCHRs training of senior officials on public freedoms, public order management and the Prevention and Prohibition of the Torture Act (PPTA). However, OHCHR states that the main challenge remains at the political level to comply with human rights in specific operations during situations of political unrest.?
- An improved version of the search engine/database on human rights recommendations, developed jointly with Uganda Human Rights Commission, will ease the tracking of progress made in the implementation of human rights recommendations, and will facilitate treaty body reporting.</narrative>
