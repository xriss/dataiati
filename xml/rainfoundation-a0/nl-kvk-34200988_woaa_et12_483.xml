   <narrative xml:lang="EN">* Site selection 
* Designing of the Sand dam construction
* Project agreement signing with local government
* Local water committe management selection
* Provision of training on operation, maintainance and WASH
* Mobilization of construction crew
* Community mobilization 
* Construction of Sand dam
* Installation of water pump
* Hand over to the local community/government

Target group:
The sand dam will be constructed near to the Eyana primary school which has 700 students. These students will be the direct benificiaries since secure water source will become available within 400 meter from the schoolcompound. Children can bring the water to the school before the classes start so that water is available at the school during the day for drinking and handwashing. After school children can easily take water to their houses.</narrative>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">- To enhance the hygiene and sanitation knowledge of the pupils in the school and their households
- To minimize the time spent on fetching water by children and women and thus enable children to enrole in school.
- To substantial reduction in the incidence of water born disease &amp; child mortality by providing clearn water
- To ensure environmental benefits like aquifer recharge.
- To contribute to the achievement of of better health, hygiene and sanitation of community</narrative>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Financial sustainability : Financial:
Sand dams provide a clean, reliable water source, close to their homes. The low cost of operating and maintaining sand dams means that these schemes are well suited to remote and poorly served regions like Konso woreda. Based on the capability of the community the water community will set a minimum affordable fee that would help them to purchase spare parts of the pump and cover maintenance cost.

Institutional:
The sand dam construction is undertaken with the full participation of the local community and government in order to create commitment and local ownership.
After the construction the system will be handed over to the community and local government (woreda water development office). The water management committee, that will be established at the start of the project, will be responsible for the daily operation and management of the scheme. The Woreda water management office will provide backstop support and be responsible for overall monitoring of the water system as well as major repair when needed.

Environmental:
The sand dam will retain the water for a longer period of time in the river bed as well as the river banks. This can be observed by regreening of the river banks. This will then increase the water holding capacity as well. Another possitive effect is that the river flow will be regulated (moderated), in stead how heavy flushes of water. 
   
Technical:
Sand dams are the lowest cost form of rainwater harvesting and its robust nature and very low operational and maintenance costs make it particularly suited to remote and poorly served regions. The technical barriers to adoption are low: The technical skills required to construct can be developed locally. It is a solution that is scaleable and has a broader application for use as a rural and game park road crossing to replace less effective culvert bridges.

Social:
As far as the local norms is concerned this project  is planned to alleviate the core problems of the community in which all the stakeholders from the woreda to Kebele level have active participation from inception to the M&amp;E. In the current situation the community, mainly women and children get their water from unprotected sources like scope holes in the river bed and other remote water sources. Time spend on water fetching can take up to 6 hours. By providing access to improved water source in the community time will be freed for children to attend school and also to access to better quality water will have a positive effect on their health.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Konso woreda which is located in South-Western Highlands of Ethiopia at latitude and longitude of 5&apos;15&#x2032; N and 37&apos;30&#x2032;E respectively, in a terrain characterized by steep slopes and soils highly susceptible to erosion. The Konso have developed a complex and highly sophisticated agricultural system, which has allowed them to subsist in a mountainous area, harsh conditions and irregular rainfall. Farming is based on an elaborate system of terracing, soil and water conservation practises, irrigation, multiple cropping systems with the integration of livestock and forestry and crop biodiversity.</narrative>
