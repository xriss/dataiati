   <narrative xml:lang="EN">- water supply at a household level (10 m3 per household) to at least overcome the dry period, for drinking, small domestic uses and biogas production
- water supply at a school level (35 m3) to be used during school days by schoolchildren and teachers
- training and awareness sessions on operation, maintenance and management of rwh systems to ensure sustainable water supply
- training and awarenss on water quality issues related to the rwh systems
- awareness on hygiene issues related to water</narrative>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">A construction, management and a maintenance commiittee will be formed by the local community, a  women group and the school administration to supervise the involvement of the community during the construction phase and to address the repair and maintenence fund for the rainwater harvesting systems. There is 50% female representation in all the committees formed. The water management committee will receive a general training  on operation and maintenance of the rainwater harvesting systems as well a training on  hygiene and sanitation. The management committee will manage a maintenance fund of NRs. 50,000.00 (450 euro) for minor repairs and maintenance.

The rainwater harvesting systems constructed by BSP Nepal will be guareented (3 years - civil structure and 1 year- pipes and fittings). Should any problems occur within this period, BSP-Nepal will cover the costs. Periodic monitoring will be carried out and necessary training will be given during this process in case of problems encountered by the users.</narrative>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">BSP-Nepal has been working with RAIN Foundation since 2004 and is a trusted partner, with several years of experience with the implementation of rainwater harvesting systems and biogas systems. BSP-Nepal works throughout the country. Biogas Sector Partnership Nepal (BSP-Nepal) is the implementing agency of Biogas Support Programme (BSP) Phase-IV. BSP-Nepal was established as an NGO in 2003 to take over the implementation responsibility of BSP, which formerly was managed directly by the Netherlands Development Organisation (SNV). 

Since BSP-Nepal took over the responsibilty of implementing BSP Phase-IV, it very much considers itself responsible for the development of the biogas sector, further strengthening and expanding the sector while at the same time interlinking it with the issues of other development sectors. Further, since last few years it has also embarked on promotion of rain waterharvesting systems and linking it with biogas promotion in areas where water is scarce.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Safe water for 50 households and 1 school in Sarkuwa, Nepal</narrative>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">T</narrative>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project consists of the implementation of 50 rainwater harvesting tanks. The water from the systems will be used for drinking, small domestic use and for biogas production. 50 biogas tanks will also be build, which will be financed by a subsidy model and local contribution and are therefore not part of this project budget. People living in this area currently have to walk 2 -3 hours to fetch water from a spring. This spring only provides water from June - October (during the rainy season).</narrative>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project is located in Sarkuwa village, which is located at the eastern part of the Baglung district. It takes 4 hour by public vehicle from Baglung headquarter to Gawa and another half an hour by foot to reach the site. 
Water scarcity is a major issue in this area and women and children spent most of their time on collecting water. During the rainy season they can get water from a spring source which takes appr. 1 - 2 hours per trip. In the dry season however, the spring still produces water, but people have to wait 1 - 2 hours since the capacity is not adequate. There is lower secondary school in the village. The children and teachers at this school have to use the same water source as the villagers, which is very time consuming.</narrative>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project will start as soon as funding is found.</narrative>
