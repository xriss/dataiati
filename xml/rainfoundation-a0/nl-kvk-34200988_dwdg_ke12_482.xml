(F)inancial Sustainability: the project aims to introduce 3R to KWA partners and others aiming to create a sustainable financial loop in which co-financing is central. Additionally the interest of WRMA to 3R could bring additional fundings to sustain the efforts of the alliance.
(I)stitutional sustainability: The government thorugh Water Resource Management authority is interested in 3R. By adding value to the WRMA activities, 3R can hopefully become integrating part of the government effort in creating sustainable access to WASH services.
(E)nvironmental sustainability: 3R aims to create a healthy water buffer to face water scarcity in drought prone areas. By creating extra storage within the landscape 3R will decrease the pressure on traditionally tapped water resources such as groundwater.
(T)echnical Sustainability: Technically 3R involves a vaste package of techniques. The techniques can be picked - to fit local conditions and needs - by local organizations in order to achieve maximum technical sustainability.
(S)ocial sustainabilty: Participatory involvement of communities in each phase of the 3R approach is of paramount importance. Local KWA partners are the key to introduce 3R without disrupting the social patterns that characterize Kajiado district. Particular attention is given to understand and address the pastoralists communities needs and challenges.</narrative>
