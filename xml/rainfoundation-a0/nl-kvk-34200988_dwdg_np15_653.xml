   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In the context of Nepal and it&#x2019;s foundation in 2004, RAIN has been working with its partners to promote, develop, spread and implement rainwater harvesting systems. Having initiated the promotion of RWH in Nepal as decentralized drinking water source and for enabling use of biogas in water scarce areas, today the technology is being promoted for multiple uses to ensure livelihood enhancement. Presently the integration of 3R (retention, recharge and reuse) principals is accepted for enabling access to water from different natural sources for variety of purposes like domestic and productive use ranging from drinking, sanitation, energy generation to food security and climate change adaptation as it is more related to the enhancement of indigenous knowledge .</narrative>
