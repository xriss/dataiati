  <title>Introducing 3R in impact area of DWA</title>
  <description rain:description="General (short) project description" rain:type="description" type="3">- Raise awareness on 3R at governmental level: Regional, Zone and Woreda offices will be engaged in discussions and activities

- Capacity building at national and Zone level: Trainings and workshops will be held at different level to promote 3R and clarify its approach and technical aspects

- Development of innovative training package: Training of trainers approach will be used in order to enable local practitioners to unroll 3R in their working areas. The practitioners will be enabled to plan and implement 3R measures for an improved water buffer

- Partnership with local government offices to create institutional support in every phase of the project; from training, through planning, up to implementation

- Implementation phase: Together with local government and EWA partners, the right mechanism to finance and implement 3R plans are sought and pursued

- Phasing out: The involvement of local government office will create sense of ownership and therefore the measures will be included in their existing management and maintenance framework</description>

  <description akvo:type="6" rain:type="d_context" type="1">Ethiopia is one the eight countries where the Dutch WASH Alliance Program is working. The program works on water, sanitation and hygiene components working in the two regions of Oromia and Afar. In these regions, it mainly focuses on pastoralist and communities where access to WASH service is relatively difficult creating more burden to women and children. The program will run until 2015 targeting the marginalized.
Currently it is working with its alliance member NGOs composed of AMREF-Ethiopia, HCS-RiPPLE, HOAREC, WaterAid and MetaMeta.</description>
  <description akvo:type="10" rain:type="sustainability combined" type="1">Financial sustainability : This project envisages to achieve sustainability according to the FIETS framework:

(F)inancial Sustainability: the project aims to introduce 3R to local government and others, aiming to create a sustainable financial loop in which co-financing is central. The interest of third parties can bring a wealth of future opportunities. 

(I)stitutional sustainability: The government through the bureau of agriculture and water is interested in 3R. By adding value to the government activities, 3R can hopefully become integrating part of the government effort in creating sustainable access to WASH services.

(E)nvironmental sustainability: 3R aims to create a healthy water buffer to face water scarcity in drought prone areas. By creating extra storage within the landscape 3R will decrease the pressure on traditionally tapped water resources such as groundwater.

(T)echnical Sustainability: Technically 3R involves a vast package of techniques. The techniques can be picked - to fit local conditions and needs - in order to achieve maximum technical sustainability.

(S)ocial sustainabilty: Participatory involvement of communities in each phase of the 3R approach is of paramount importance. Particular attention is given to understand and address the communities&#x2019; needs and challenges.</description>

  <description akvo:type="5" rain:type="d_summary" type="1">This project wants to introduce the 3R concept in the Dutch Wash Alliance program for Ethiopia. This activity is led by MetaMeta in partnership with RiPPLE and with other Dutch WASH Alliance (DWA) partners, especially those working in the project regions, i.e. AMREF in Afar and AFD in Borana and HCS-RiPPLE in East and West Harraghe.

3R is an approach for creating sustainable water buffers &#x2013; using a series of techniques for recharge, retention and reuse.</description>
  <description akvo:type="8" rain:type="d_objectives" type="2">To create basic understanding by main stakeholders on 3R &#x2013; with aim of roll out in more areas
To develop 3R sub catchment plans for eight subcatchments (in a participatory way)
To develop constructive engagement in these plans of implementation partners
To set up a capacity building support system - using GLOWS methodology for DAs on 3R
To create more capacity in introducing 3R techniques at technician level
To review progress and build sustainable arrangements</description>
