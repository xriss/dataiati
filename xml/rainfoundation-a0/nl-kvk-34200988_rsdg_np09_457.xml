   <narrative xml:lang="EN">- water supply at a household level (10 m3 per household) to at least overcome the dry period, for drinking and other small domestic uses
- training and awareness sessions on operation, maintenance and management of rwh systems to ensure sustainable water supply
- training and awarenss on water quality issues related to the rwh systems

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Financial sustainability : The local ownership is guaranteed since the beneficiaries have been involved and organised in a water management committee since the definition of the project. The request for RWH tanks came from the beneficiaries themselves. All responsible persons from each households will be trained on operation, maintenance and management of their RWH tank. The water management committee will also manage a maintenace fund, to ensure that minor repairs can be financed. Next to this, the RWH tank implemented consists largely of materials which are locally available, and the beneficiaries will contribute in constructing the tank. The RWH tanks have a simple design and don&apos;t need any complicated maintenance. 
Monitoring and evaluation of the project will be ensured by NRCS, who will be supported by RAINs Rainwater Harvesting Capacity Centre BSP-Nepal.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project proposal involves an additional 34 rainwater harvesting (rwh) systems for a village where NRCS is already constructing 56 rwh systems funded by RAIN Foundation. The village of Paanchkal is located in a rural and hilly area, where water is currently fetched by mostly women and girls at a distance of 1,5 km, where people have to queue for 1 - 4 hours. This source only provides water during June till November.A study showed that water boreholes are not an option.</narrative>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This village is located in a upperhill area and people are currently using water from a spirng located 1,5 km away in the rainy season, During the dry season, this spring dries up and women and girls have to walk to a  spring even further away. Although the sping is located relatively near to the village, queing takes up much of their time and can take up to 4 hours. A study showed that borehole drilling is not an option for this area. 
By constructing a RWH tank at each household, women and girls can have water at their doorstep and spend the hours previously spend on fetching water on other activities like education or generating an income.</narrative>
