   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The coverage of water supply and sanitation in Dailekh district are 53.9 per cent and 43.1 per cent, respectively (CBS: 2011). Dullu Municipality in Dailekh district is newly announced municipality by the government of Nepal. Water Use Master Plan (WUMP) prepared in four VDCs then (Badalamji, Nepa, Nauelkatuwal and Paduka) revealed that access to piped water supply is about 40 %. On average, 2.5 hours per day per house hold spent for the collection of drinking water in these areas. There are many settlements which lacks reliable water source for the construction of conventional water supply or they have water source with little discharge. On one hand there is growing demand of water for domestic and productive uses, on the other hand the effect of climate change is emerging as a key challenge for the water sector.  New technologies like rain water harvesting could be one of the solutions for the drinking water for the hill tops where other options are unfeasible or too costly.</narrative>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The overall goal of the proposed project is improving the livelihood of disadvantaged people through sustainable water resources management and improved access to water for drinking and productive uses. To achieve this goal, the project will implement 3R schemes planned in the WUMP already prepared and capacitate local level stakeholders (VDC/ WASH-CCs, users committee and community). A total of 1,620 people will benefit from implementation of different 3R schemes.</narrative>
