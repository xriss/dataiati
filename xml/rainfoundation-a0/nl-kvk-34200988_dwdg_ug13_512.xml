  <description akvo:type="10" rain:type="sustainability (technical)" type="1">Bunds, terraces, trees, vegetation strips are all made from locally available materials and members of the local community have been engaged in the construction. Off take wells are at the request of the people, but all have been furnished with simple appropriate technologies that recharge the groundwater. All cement structures are simple and low maintainance. Local environment around these structures has been improved</description>
