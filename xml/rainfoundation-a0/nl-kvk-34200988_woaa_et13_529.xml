* Designing of the Sand dam construction
* Project agreement signing with local government
* Local water committee management selection
* Provision of training on operation, maintainance and WASH
* Mobilization of construction crew
* Community mobilization 
* Construction of Sand dam
* Installation of water pump
* Hand over to the local community/government</narrative>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Based on the capability of the community the water community will set a minimum affordable fee that would help them to purchase spare parts of the pump and cover maintenance cost.</narrative>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Communities have been consulted from the start of the project through out the implementation phase. They have reached consensus on the use of the sand dam and RWH facilities. they will also be taking responsibility in the maintenance of the system</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Financial sustainability : Based on the capability of the community the water community will set a minimum affordable fee that would help them to purchase spare parts of the pump and cover maintenance cost.
Institutional sustainability : The sand dam construction is undertaken with the full participation of the local community and government in order to create commitment and local ownership.

After the construction the system will be handed over to the community and local government (woreda water development office). The water management committee, that will be established at the start of the project, will be responsible for the daily operation and management of the scheme. The Woreda water management office will provide backstop support and be responsible for overall monitoring of the water system as well as major repair when needed.
Environmental sustainability : The sand dam will retain the water for a longer period of time in the river bed as well as the river banks. This can be observed by regreening of the river banks. This will then increase the water holding capacity as well. Another positive effect is that the river flow will be regulated (moderated), in stead of heavy flushes of water. 
   

Technical sustainability : Sand dams are the lowest cost form of rainwater harvesting and its robust nature and very low operational and maintenance costs make it particularly suited to remote and poorly served regions. The technical barriers to adoption are low: The technical skills required to construct can be developed locally. It is a solution that is scalable and has a broader application for use as a rural and game park road crossing to replace less effective culvert bridges.
Social sustainability : Communities have been consulted from the start of the project through out the implementation phase. They have reached consensus on the use of the sand dam and RWH facilities. they will also be taking responsibility in the maintenance of the system</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project is designed to provide potable water for 700 students in the Ayene School in Konso Woreda through the construction of sand dams using the 3R approach. This is planned to reduce school drop outs in the dry season and enhance the performance of the students by reducing the burden of fetching water from long distances.</narrative>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project site is characterized by steep slopes and soils highly susceptible to erosion. The Konso have developed a complex and highly sophisticated agricultural system, which has allowed them to subsist in a mountainous area, harsh conditions and irregular rainfall. Farming is based on an elaborate system of terracing, soil and water conservation practises, irrigation, multiple cropping systems with the integration of livestock and forestry and crop biodiversity.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The selected project intervention area in Alle woreda is affected by great seasonal water scarcity. To alleviate this problem SEPDA will construct one sanddam on Kabagama dry river which will retain the water in the wet season to provide year-round water supply to 700 pupils and their homes.</narrative>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">To enhance the hygiene and sanitation knowledge of the pupils in the school and their households
To minimize the time spent on fetching water by children and women and thus enable children to enroll in school.
To substantial reduction in the incidence of water born disease &amp; child mortality by providing clear water
To ensure environmental benefits like aquifer recharge.
To contribute to the achievement of of better health, hygiene and sanitation of community</narrative>
