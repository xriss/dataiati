   <narrative xml:lang="EN">1.	Inventory of the assessment methodologies and tools currently used (or under development) by DWA partners E-Sus elements and classify them in their focus on/relevance of particular WASH aspects and approaches (i.eRAIN&#x2019;s RWHT; PRACTICA&#x2019;s DWDST; WASTE&#x2019;s SDST, etc.);
2.	Inventory of existing CATs and assessment on usability for the currently to be developed CAT; 
3.	Identify how to make the connection between the CAT and other methodologies and tools, i.e. particular the DWDST, i.e. how a user can easily &#x2018;move&#x2019; from the one tool to the next. 
4.	Review of the internal and external inventory and defining of applicable and non-applicable elements / tools, regarding the content and quality of the ecological, hydrological and socio-economic aspects relevant for the CAT;
5.	Decide on the elements/criteria to be part of the CAT and its form and parallel its linkage to the DWDST.
6.	Discuss the inventory of steps 1 to 5 with relevant DWA partners to assess usability in their planning processes. Adjust standards/elements based on the feedback provided by DWA partners.
7.	Decide on the form of the CAT and develop the final CAT.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">DWA has identified five approaches that can lead to Environmental Sustainability of WASH interventions, as stated in the definition document of Environmental Sustainability component of the &#x201C;FIETS&#x201D; (provided): 

1.	Thinking with the landscape: understanding of water flows and community needs 
2.	3R approach: Recharge, Retention and Re-use of water resources
3.	3R approach: Reduce, Reuse, Recycle of waste(flows)
4.	Low cost, low maintenance and environmental friendly technologies 
5.	Ecosystem service approach: maintaining resources and services of natural environment upon which communities depend
It was decided the CAT should mainly focus on:
-	Supporting planning processes in WASH towards more Environmental Sustainability (as defined by the Dutch WASH Alliance),
-	Supporting users of the DWDST to make informed decisions on water supply technology selection.</narrative>
