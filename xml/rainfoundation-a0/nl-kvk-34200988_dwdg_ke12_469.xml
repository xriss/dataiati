   <narrative xml:lang="EN">An inventory of RWH techniques and sustainability factors</narrative>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Answering the question of how financial,institutional, environmental, technical, social (or FIETS) sustainability for RWH projects can be achieved in the short, medium and long term is the primary goal of this project.

The study shall focus on identifying through analysis of various projects, success factors for implementingfuture projects on RWH. The study shall also endeavor toensure that future funds to cover maintenance, emergency repairs and other unforeseen cost are created and maintained for communities to access for implementation of RWH activities. 

It is anticipated that creation of above-mentioned conditionswill make donors and lenders more inclined towards providing the initial funding, as the risk of failure will have been minimized or even diminished.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In order to appreciate the contribution of rainwater harvesting to improved access to water and sanitation, it will be necessary to map the extent to which RWH interventions have been implemented in Kenya. In 2004, SearNet in collaboration with Kenya Rainwater Association compiled a directory of RWH stakeholders in Kenya. This report shall be used as the starting point for conducting an inventory of what has been done where. The WHaTeR project will be conducting detailed revisits to selected sites where RWH has been in place for more that 20 years. The sites include Turkana and Machakos. Results from these studies shall contribute a deeper understanding on sustainability of RWH intervention.

In collaboration with key stakeholders, the known successful interventions sites shall be geo referenced so as to produce a map showing the distribution of the different RWH interventions across Kenya.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Problems commonly encountered, and recommendations for more sustainable RWH projects in Kenya have been detailed throughout this report. The intended goal of this effort is to see the continued acceleration and scaling up of RWH as a viable practice to meet Kenya&#x2019;s water needs. This will work to spark economic growth in the country and to realize the Millennium Development Goals.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The World Agroforestry Centre (ICRAF) is one of the partners for Kenya WASH Alliance (KWA) since its inception. ICRAFs mandate is to undertake research on Agroforestry which indeed is one of the disciplines encompassing Environmental Science. During 2012, ICRAF continued her engagement with KWA, focusing on the Water, Sanitation and Health Programme for Kajiado Central District. The Centre also participated in a number of activities which include: The organization of the Southern and Eastern Afr</narrative>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The primary objective of this project is to conduct a comprehensive mapping of successful RWH interventions and detailed assessment of financing mechanisms and institutional frameworks for RWH in Kenya so as to generate scientific knowledge and develop a tool for policy makers and planners, practitioners, donors and stakeholders to use in targeting future rainwater-harvesting investments in Kenya and beyond thereby contributing to Millennium Development goals 1, 3 and 7.</narrative>
