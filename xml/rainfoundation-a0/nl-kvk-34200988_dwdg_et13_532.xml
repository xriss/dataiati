   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The DWA targets arid/semi-arid zones in Ethiopia. Most of the arid zones are located in the lowlands. The arid lowlands are often the harshest of environments but also buffer management techniques in such areas are less well known. These areas encounter various water related problems such as water availability in dry seasons and water quality. 3R approach rehabilitate the water retention capacity of water sources and create sustainable buffering zones. Better buffer management in these areas will help sustain the source (or create new ones) for water supply systems, facilitate self supply system and contribute to livestock watering, hence serving the economy</narrative>
