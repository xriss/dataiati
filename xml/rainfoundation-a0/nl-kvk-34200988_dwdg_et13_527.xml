   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Financial sustainability : the WASH committee will set the water tariff/cost which will cover the operation and maintenance cost of the system. It will conduct semi-annual wash meeting to monitor the work of the water facilities.
Institutional sustainability : the partner organization and the local Woreda authorities have reached on agreement on the execution of the project and clear tasks have been set among them. The project will be hand over to the Woreda authorities after its completion. 
Environmental sustainability : The rainwater harvesting infrastructure to be built looks to increase water availability and recharging the aquifer. This increased water in the soil which gradually supports plant live and thus re-greening the immediate environment
Technical sustainability : The project promotes the use of local technologies and local knowledge to ensure easy repair and maintenance facilities and to promote local innovation in the water supply sector.
Social sustainability : Responsibilities are shared among local communities and government officials, promoting gender equality by involving woman in the planning and decision making and administrative levels.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Gursum Woreda is located in Eastern Ethiopia. It is located at a distance of 117 Km from the city of Dire Dawa. The woreda has mountainous topography. Over 95% of the people are dependent on rain fed agriculture. The area is known for the production of quality groundnuts. Rainfall is prominent from March to April and July to September. However, rainfall patterns are not consistence. The area experiences frequent drought and critical shortage of water. Because of this, most of the population is subjected to chronic malnutrition and water born diseases. Many governmental and non-governmental organizations have put efforts to provide shallow and deep ground water sources, harvesting of surface runoff and diversion of flowing rivers. Despite these efforts the growing need and the provision of services could not match. This project is designed to contribute on the ongoing effort to increase access to water supply and household sanitation facility.</narrative>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The main objective of the project is to empower Water Management Committees and scale up hygienic practices of target communities at Gursum woredas. The specific objectives are
- Empower the communities on water scheme operation and management
-Increase awareness and improve hygienic practices through education supported with participatory approaches using CLTSH/PHAST/CHAST methodologies   
-Promote 3R and MUS technologies
-Introduction and promotion of various Rain Water Harvesting technologies</narrative>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project is designed to empower Water Management Committees and scale up hygienic practices of target communities in Gursum Woredas in Eastern Harerge zone. It targets 6,570 individuals in these Woredas. It aims to improve the Knowledge, Attitude and Practice (KAP) on sanitation and hygiene. It promotes local ownership and management of WASH infrastructure. The project will build 2 sand-dams and 1 sub-surface dam which will provide water for multiple uses in Gursum.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project is designed to develop the capacity of local communities on water management, sanitation, water technology schemes and rain water harvesting technologies. The capacity development activities will be invested on community members and students. WASH committees and school WASH clubs will be established in Woreda levels that will take over the project after its completion. This will ensure the sustainable management of the WASH facilities constructed in the course of the project.</narrative>

Gursum woreda is located at a distance of 117 Km from Dire Dawa which is 22 KM branching gravel road from the main asphalt road leads from Dire Dawa to Jijiga. These two woredas have a long border line with Jijga zone of Somali Region.
Gursum has mountainous topographic characteristic. In this woreda, like the other part of the country have a bimodal rainy season; from March to April and from July to September. This woreda is well known mainly with the production quality groundnuts in the country.
In these project areas the main livelihood activity of the people is rain fed agriculture with the limited farming area and cattle and small ruminant rearing. The main products are nuts, maize, sorghum and vegetables.</narrative>
