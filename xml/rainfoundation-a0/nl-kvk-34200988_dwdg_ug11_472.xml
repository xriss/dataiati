  <title>Raising awareness on rainwater harvesting</title>
  <description akvo:type="4" rain:type="subtitle" type="1">Collaborative support to Uganda RainWater Association</description>
  <description akvo:type="10" rain:type="sustainability combined" type="1">Financial sustainability : Rainwater harvesting, be it from roof-catchments, rock-catchments or different sorts of dams, is a sustainable and environmentally sound intervention, it does not deplete existing water sources or lowers the groundwater table. By retaining water that would otherwise flow away rainwater harvesting interventions compensate some of the negative climatic effects of global warming, cooling the climate and allowing more vegetation to develop. URWA wants rainwater harvesting to be sustainable in Uganda and encourages self-supply from the grass root level that will easily be replicated to other regions that have not yet taken it up.</description>

  <description rain:description="General (short) project description" rain:type="description" type="3">The following indicators will be used to measure the progress of the project;
1. Awareness on rainwater harvesting as a viable water supply option raised amongst stakeholders.
2. Recognition of various rainwater stakeholders contribution realized. 
skills of WASH alliance partners developed.
3. Information sharing and documentation on rainwater harvesting improved.</description>
  <description akvo:type="7" rain:type="d_activities" type="1">The ministry of water and environment is thinking more about setting policies and guidelines to improve rainwater harvesting in Uganda. There is a review of the water policy currently on going and there has been an interest to include rainwater harvesting in the policy which has not been there before. This is a positive sign to show that the ministry is also seeing the extent to which rainwater harvesting is contributing to water coverage.</description>
  <description akvo:type="6" rain:type="d_context" type="1">Uganda Rainwater Association is a national membership non-governmental organization that was formed in 1999. URWA supports communities to improve their social-economic situation, through mobilization, information, skills and experience sharing. The major focus of community support has been rainwater harvesting for domestic water supply.

Uganda receives a bimodal rainfall pattern with two distinct rainy seasons in a year with about 1200 mm rainfall annually for 2/3 of the country. Yet the current climate changes affecting people in Uganda, call for measures that retain water rather than extract it from underground sources. Rainwater harvesting (RWH) is an ancient method of water supply that  has been given more attention as a result of increasing availability of hard roofing, cost reductions and other innovations in rwh technologies. Due to the fact that it provides an alternative sources of sustainable water both to the community and households.</description>
  <description akvo:type="5" rain:type="d_summary" type="1">Uganda still has a lot to do in order to meet the MDG on water and sanitation. Rainwater harvesting is a viable option for the provision of clean water but has been greatly down played by the ministry of water and development actors. Uganda rainwater Association has been advocating for its promotion and RAIN foundation came in to support URWA in these activities.</description>

  <description akvo:type="8" rain:type="d_objectives" type="2">When URWA got the funds, a process documentation training was carried out for its members to improve their documenting skills in rainwater harvesting. Demo jars and tanks were also constructed in the rwenzori region to promote rainwater harvesting and in addition case studies, position papers on rainwater harvesting were also produced to increase on information circulation this raises awareness and encourages good practices to be passed on and shared.</description>
