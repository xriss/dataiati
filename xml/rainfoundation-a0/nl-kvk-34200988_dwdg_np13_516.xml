  <description akvo:type="10" rain:type="sustainability (financial)" type="1">As the target group belong to lowest economic strata, self investment is not possible. A small subsidy will be provided and the gap will be met through microfinance. The microfinance facility will be provided in coordination with Environment Development Society for installation of rain water harvesting at household level. To enable repayment of the loan will be made possible through income generation from the productive use of waste water and waste. The monitoring of fund flow will be monitored by RHCC-BSPN.</description>
  <description akvo:type="6" rain:type="d_context" type="1">Birendranagar Municipality (BM) is a regional headquarter of Mid-Western Development Region. Community people visit for any governmental legal work; the public from other districts in the region too come here for government administrative service. The visitors of this region will get chance to learn more about RWH and productive reuse; thus the municipality building itself becomes a showcase for RWH and productive reuse. 
Janajyotee Higher Secondary School has more than 1500 students and is located at Badhichaur village, 20 KM away from BM. It is a training centre for junior technician in agriculture (JTA). The establishment of a RWH demo site in the school will help provide sufficient water for school community, integrated with sanitation and re-use system, and will be developed as a show-case of MUS. 
Neta VDC is 36 KM from BM. The water situation is grim: people here do not have access to sufficient pipe water for drinking and are compelled to use river water for drinking purpose.</description>
  <description akvo:type="7" rain:type="d_activities" type="1">Construction of demonstration sites, construction of household level RWH for MUS systems, training on rwh and productive reuse, promotion and lobby of RWH for MUS, stimulation of microfinance for household level systems.</description>
  <description rain:description="General (short) project description" rain:type="description" type="3">Demonstration sites at Birendranagar Municipality (regional headquarter of Mid-Western Development Region), at Janajyotee Higher Secondary School and implementation of RWH for MUS with household systems in Neta VDC.

For demo-sites: collaboration with RUAF on urban agriculture, and on integration of RWH with sanitation and re-use system. 
For village implementation: collaboration with Environment Development Society (EDS) on micro-financing of RWH systems.</description>

  <description akvo:type="10" rain:type="sustainability combined" type="1">Financial sustainability : As the target group belong to lowest economic strata, self investment is not possible. A small subsidy will be provided and the gap will be met through microfinance. The microfinance facility will be provided in coordination with Environment Development Society for installation of rain water harvesting at household level. To enable repayment of the loan will be made possible through income generation from the productive use of waste water and waste. The monitoring of fund flow will be monitored by RHCC-BSPN. 


Institutional sustainability : The project will be implemented in coordination with the Municipality in case of the rainwater harvesting integrated with 5R demonstration in Birendra Municipality. The project in Janajyotee Higher Secondary School will be carried out in partnership with the School Management committee. The interventions in Neta VDC will be carried out in co-ordination with the VDC and the community. 
Environmental sustainability : Fostering the adoption of the 5R approach, we believe, will enable access to water primarily for drinking and it multiple use at the household level twill support in improving sanitation and food security through vegetable farming using efficient micro irrigation. These will contribute to enhancing health, environment and economic status of the community people.
Technical sustainability : The revolving fund will be prepared collecting 10% equivalent costs of hardware construction form community/institutions and the fund will be used for the operation and maintenance in the long run. Users will be trained on minor operation and maintenance and effective use of water, sustainable sanitation, hygiene behavior, livelihood enhancement through productive reuse. The project will be monitoring at regular intervals to ensure smooth implementation and build the confidence of the users.
Social sustainability : The homogenous community of 30 households is comprised of indigenous people with very low income.</description>

The development of rain water harvesting and 5R  demonstration systems in the municipality and school premises is seen to be very effective for creating awareness and sensitizing a bigger mass of this region. In Neta VDC, 30 households will acquire RWH for MUS systems.</description>
