  <title>Scoping study on RWH practices in Brasil</title>
  <description akvo:type="8" rain:type="d_objectives" type="2">1.	To study the extent to which the P1MC and P1+2 programmes are attaining their objectives, including positive- and negative impacts.
2.	To analyse the P1MC and P1+2 programmes to identify the success factors, context specific characteristics and key elements for a sustainable and successful roll-out elsewhere 
3.	To meet a variety of RWH stakeholders 
4.	To give recommendations to RAIN on how these Brazilian RWH experiences can be used in other RWH country or regional programmes</description>

  <description akvo:type="10" rain:type="sustainability (institutional)" type="1">At the end of 1999, as a consequence of the awareness building on rainwater harvesting, the Programa um Milh&#xE3;o de Cisternais rurais/Program for 1 Million Cisterns (P1MC) was developed by ASA. ASA - Articula&#xE7;&#xE3;o no Semi-&#xC1;rido Brasileiro/Articulating (the needs) for the Semi-arid Areas of Brazil is a network of almost 3000 NGOs working in the SAB. ASA aims to empower civil society to build participatory processes for sustainable development and cope with the semi-arid areas based on cultural values and social justice. (ASA, 2011) 

P1MC was launched in 2003. ASA uses an on-line project management system, and on
April 24, 2013, one could read on the website that it had constructed over 458&#x2019;000 domestic rainwater reservoirs. P1MC is being executed by the civil society in a decentralized manner (at the community, municipal, micro-region, state and regional levels) with initial funding from the Ministry of the Environment , and later from State and international, as well as the private sector.

P1+2: Programa uma Terra e duas &#xC1;guas/Programme 1 piece of land and 2 sources of water runs since 2007. It aims to further enhance the livelihood opportunities in this vast area by focusing on water for production. So far it has completed rainwater collection systems existing of 9000 tanks of 52.000 l capacity, 420 subsurface dams and 302 rock catchments. In addition 208 Volanta-type water pumps have been installed and one trench water storage pit. Altogether P1+2 serves some 12&#x2019;000 families. 

ASA is funded by various ministries and entities within the Government of Brazil, including Governo de Minas Gerais &#x2013; Secretaria de Agricultura Familiar (SAF), Minist&#xE9;rio do Desenvolvimento Agr&#xE1;rio (MDA), Minist&#xE9;rio do Desenvolvimento Social e Combate &#xE0; fome (MDS), Minist&#xE9;rio da Integra&#xE7;&#xE3;o Nacional, etc.

ASA hold regular conferences with its constituent partners and stakeholders. In the conferences it reviews the progress and key issues of the Projects as well as reviews political and policy aspects. The last Conference was held in November 2012, in Janu&#xE1;ria in Minais Gerais.</description>

  <description akvo:type="5" rain:type="d_summary" type="1">One of the countries that has made important progress in this area is Brazil, where large rainwater harvesting programmes for domestic and small-scale agriculture have been implemented since 2003. ABCMAC &#x2013; the Brazil rainwater harvesting association - and EMBRAPA &#x2013; an agricultural research agency - have played important roles in facilitating initial technical development and promulgation of rainwater harvesting technologies and experiences. RAIN wants to learn from this and disseminate.</description>

  <description akvo:type="6" rain:type="d_context" type="1">The one million tank programme (P1MC) was initiated to ensure water security for poor households in remote areas in the Nort East. The P1 + 2 (one piece of land and 2 sources of water) project was initiated later when it became clear that provision of a water store for domestic use is often not enough to help families get out of poverty. Access to sufficient land is further critical to have a reasonable livelihood.</description>
  <description rain:description="General (short) project description" rain:type="description" type="3">This study address a specific component under the first objective of IFAD, which is a preliminary study on RWH practices and stakeholders in Brazil, with a specific focus on the 1 million cistern programme (P1MC) and P1+2 programme. The outcomes of this preliminary study will be used for further dissemination and learning for practioners and policy makers in other areas of the world.</description>
