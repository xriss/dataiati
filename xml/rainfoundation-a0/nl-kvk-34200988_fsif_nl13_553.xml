   <narrative xml:lang="EN">RAIN Foundation and the WaterChannel are joining forces to promote RWH for food security in poor and marginalized regions of Asia and Africa. The collaboration will provide them a platform where the two organization can join their strategies and expertise in the RWH sector. Furthermore, partnership will allow them to co-operate on awareness raising and capacity development activities to increase the integration of RWH as food security mechanism in local, regional and international levels.</narrative>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">RAIN and the WaterChannel will work together to increase the promotion of RWH for food security. More than half of the global agricultural product depends on rainwater. Most chronically food insecure regions of the world are occupied with rain fed agriculture and subsistence farming. Increased rain fall variability and extreme weather events are affecting the worlds already vulnerable communities. any of the food insecure regions have on average enough rainfall for food production however the lack the mechanism for making maximum use of the rainwater. The promotion of RWH mechanisms is therefore a core part in empowering farmers and local people to become self supporting and develop sustainable economies. Raising the awareness of communities and policy makers will enhance the integration of RWH in water management and water use at local, regional and international levels.</narrative>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project have the following objectives
-Jointly promote and disseminate success stories/research
-Exchange know-how and expertise
-Linking knowledge and experts concerning RWH / 3R with other regions
-Share information on programme/project result
-Disseminate impacts of RWH
-Lobby &amp; Advocacy</narrative>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project will carry out the following activities to reach its goals
-The WaterChannel and RAIN will jointly work on publishing booklets, leaflets, articles, research and case studies concerning RWH and/or 3R
-RAIN embed the WaterChannel platform (i.e. video) into the new website on RWH for Food Security.
-The WaterChannel staff will actively participate in the RWH CoP (Community of Practice), link their CoP to the CoP of RWSN and actively contribute to the knowledge management component concerning RWH and 3R that is build under the RAIN/IFAD programme
-Linking with worldwide water harvesting knowledge/networks through WaterChannel and RAIN</narrative>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project is executed by collaboration between RAIN foundation and the WaterChannel based in the Netherlands. RAIN foundation primarily work on promoting and implementing RWH in poor and marginalized parts of Easter and Western Africa and Asia. The WaterChannel was launched at the World Water Forum in 2009. It focuses on supporting education and awareness through video materials. The two organizations will collaborate in the areas of rain water harvesting (RWH) and food security.</narrative>
