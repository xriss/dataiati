   <narrative xml:lang="EN">A construction, management and a maintenance committee will be formed by the local community and women group to supervise the involvement of the community during the construction phase and to address the repair and maintenance fund for the rainwater harvesting systems. There is 50% female representation in all the committees formed. The water management committee will receive a general training  on operation and maintenance of the rainwater harvesting systems as well a training on hygiene and sanitation. The management committee will manage a maintenance fund for the minor repair and maintenance.

The rainwater harvesting systems constructed by BSP Nepal will be guaranteed ( 3 years - civil structure and 1 year- pipes and fittings). Should any problems occur within this period, BSP-Nepal will cover the costs. Periodic monitoring will be carried out and necessary training will be given during this process in case of problems encountered by the users.</narrative>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">BSP-Nepal has been working with RAIN Foundation since 2004 and is a trusted partner, with several years of experience with the implementation of rainwater harvesting systems and biogas systems. BSP-Nepal works throughout the country. BSP-Nepal was established as an NGO in 2003 to take over the implementation responsibility of BSP, which formerly was managed directly by the Netherlands Development Organisation (SNV).</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Safe water through rainwater harvesting for 68 households in Alamdevi</narrative>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project consists of the implementation of 68 rainwater harvesting tanks. The water from the systems will be used for drinking, small domestic use and for biogas production. People living in this area currently have to walk 2 -3 hours to fetch water at a spring. This spring only provides water from June - October (during the rainy season). After the project is completed, water will be available at their doorstep instead of many walking hours downhill.</narrative>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project in the village of Alamdevi is located in the western part of Shayangja district. In the district 2 other projects funded by RAIN Foundation are already under construction. People from the village of Alamdevi received news from these projects and got interested to have rainwater harvesting tanks, since their situation is comparable. Currently people, most women and girls, are spending 2-3 hours daily to collect the drinking water from a spring located in downhill of the village. They have to cue and wait their turn to fetch the water. This is not only a time consuming activity, but is also a heavy physical burden, since women carry the weight of the water cans on their head, while walking up steep slopes. In the rainy season, the paths can get very slippery, leading to injuries. Mostly, on women from a household is responsible for fetching water for the whole family, and sometimes their cattle, meaning she will be busy fetching water for the whole day.</narrative>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project will start as soon as funding is found. Since implementation under RAIN funding is already taking place in neighbouring villages, implementation can start quickly as the local context is known.</narrative>
