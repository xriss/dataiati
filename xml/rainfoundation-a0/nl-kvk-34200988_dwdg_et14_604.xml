  <description akvo:type="6" rain:type="d_context" type="1">Moreover; some of the latrines of the schools are not enough to serve the number of enrolled students. This situation obviously forces students to practice open defection in the school compound while latrines of some other schools do not have water connection.  In such situations the school students are likely to be infested with parasitic infections which result in students&#x2019; drop-out and regular absenteeism.</description>
