   <narrative xml:lang="EN">3R is an approach for creating sustainable water buffers based on local planning, working at scale and high density and using a series of techniques for recharge, retention and reuse &#xE2;&#x20AC;&#x201C; and in specific cases small surface water storage as well. The water buffer is constituted by the totality of water storage structures in a landscape in the form of water reservoirs, groundwater and soil moisture. The water buffer can be improved by applying the 3R approach and technologies with the aim of storing water when abundant to make it available when scarce for different and multiple uses. 3R stands for Recharge, Retention and Reuse of rainwater.

The impact areas of the DWA are arid/semi-arid and to a large extent, lowlands this brings in an extra challenge. The arid lowlands are often the harshest of environments but also buffer management techniques in such areas are less well known.</narrative>
