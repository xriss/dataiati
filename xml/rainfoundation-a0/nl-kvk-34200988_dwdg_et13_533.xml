A combination of facility support through construction of water systems and sanitation facilities is only ideal when combined with behavioural and attitude change. Awareness campaigns are expected to be the building block for generating real ownership and active involvement of the communities in WASH interventions.</description>

  <description akvo:type="10" rain:type="sustainability combined" type="1">Financial sustainability : communities contribute in the inception as well as implementation part of the project both by providing locally available construction materials and participating in the excavation work. This is believed to increase the ownership feeling in the community that will contribute to its sustainability. The water committee will take care of the management and maintaiance issues and facilitate funding for repair when fid necessary   
Institutional sustainability : the project will establish a water committee made of equal number of men and women that set working by laws and procedures with the participation of the community. They will take the responsibility to run the systems and ensure that regulations are easily communicated and followed by the users</description>

  <description akvo:type="6" rain:type="d_context" type="1">The proposed project activities are envisaged to be implemented in Dugda Dawa Woreda of Borena Zone, Oromia Regional State. The woreda is one of the 13 woredas/districts of Borena zone. Topographically, 80% of the district is lowland and the remaining 20% is medium highland with an average annual precipitation in two rainy seasons estimated in the range of 450 - 500 mm. 
Like most, the rural communities in this district have limited access to WASH services be it clean water or sanitation facilities. All year long there is a big struggle to have water for both household use and for livelihood purposes. In this region, droughts simply aggravate the already prevailing problem of water shortage and in particular water for livestock.  During drought times, women and girls have to travel for long distances (at minimum for 6 hours) to fetch water for domestic use from unprotected and likely-contaminated sources. High incidence of drought-induced water shortage and erosion.</description>
