  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">- Prepare 3R WUMP module with basic WUMP for Improved integrated water resources management mainstreamed with the issue of 3R; 
- Capacity enhancement, through intensive training, of Rain partners to apply 3R WUMP module;
- pilot 3R WUMP module in one VDC + guide pilots of 3R WUMP module by two other RAIN partners
- Improved access to sustainable water, sanitation and hygiene services.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Emphasis will be on 3R (Recharge, Retention and Reuse) and its process by incorporating 3R in the basic WUMP steps to produce a 3R WUMP module. The 3R WUMP module basically consist some additional steps, but is closely interlinked with the basic Water Use Master Plan. The 3R WUMP module will be applied in areas where the local water needs for domestic and irrigation water supply cannot be met with the currently available water resources or where the society has an overall interest to capture as much water as possible (e.g. source catchments of a major, inter VDC water supply project).</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Incorporating the concept of 3R in water management using administrative boundaries, the proposed HELVETAS Swiss Intercooperation approach will deviate from water buffer or catchment management. However, the approach will comply with the objective of the 3R focus on climate change adaptation. This application will be on the side of no regret actions in adapting to climate change, i.e. even if the activity may not directly and effectively support climate change adaptation, it will certainly support local communities in other improvements of their livelihood. In other words, the approach aims at improving water quantity and quality within the administrative boundaries of a Village Development Committee (VDC) through the planned and managed recharge, retention and reuse of groundwater and rainwater.</narrative>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Institutional sustainability : The 3R concept is a perspective towards up-scaling the use and management of rain-, soil- and ground water for livelihood security and climate change adaptation in a water buffer or catchment. HELVETAS Swiss Intercooperation&#x2019;s existing approach focuses on planning of water resources and allocation of its use based on the decisions of local communities and governments. The organization&#x2019;s experience in Nepal realizes the institutional feasibility of low cost planning adapting local resources and implementation of Integrated Water Resources Management components within administrative boundaries. The 3R system envisions something similar, albeit in a catchment or a water buffer.

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The 3R WUMP module aims to mainstream the issues of recharge, retention and reuse in operational water use planning in Nepal for climate change adaptation and improved water resources management. The overall objective is to improve livelihood of women and marginalized group by improving increased access to and use of sustainable water and sanitation services and improved hygiene practices.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The RAIN Foundation and HELVETAS Swiss Intercooperation have agreed to develop a 3R WUMP module that builds on the basic Water Use Master Plan approach developed and implemented by the Water Resource Management Programme of HELVETAS Swiss Intercooperation. The objective of the 3R WUMP module is to mainstream the issues of recharge, retention and reuse in operational water use planning in Nepal for climate change adaptation and improved water resources management.</narrative>
