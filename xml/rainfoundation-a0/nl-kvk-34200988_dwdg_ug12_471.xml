   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Environmental sustainability : In 2015, the project aims to have provided sufficient tools, lessons-learned and evidence to ensure integration of Environmental Sustainability in WASH service delivery, which has not only led to upscaling / uptake of this approach in Uganda but also in other country programmes of the Dutch WASH Alliance. It will contribute to evidence and capacity building as well as lobby and advocacy on environmental issues concerning WASH, with a special focus on wetlands management and water harvesting for WASH.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Evidence based learning on integration of water recharge, reuse, retention, wetland management and WASH for sustainable livelihood improvement. Recharge groundwater and provide soil conservation measures for water for production and domestic use and stabilize runoff and silt flow. Improve management, ecology and legal status of the Rwambu wetland for local communities. Improve access to safe water, handling and reuse of waste flows for productive use. Increase hygiene practices.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Intensive collaboration between JESE, Wetlands International and Rainfoundation resulted in a detailed action planning. In the remaining months of 2012 JESE will select sites for intervention and do a baseline study on these sites.</narrative>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">JESE in partnership with RAIN and Wetlands International will research and up-scale the integration of wetland management, rain water harvesting and water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) in the Rwenzori region. To achieve this a pilot project is set up, located in the transboundary resource Rwambu catchment covering the districts of Kamwenge and Ibanda. In 2011, this project focused on an in-depth assessment of the Rwambu catchment to start the planning of an action-research and implementation for 2013 - 2015.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Wetland management in Rwambu wetland, water, sanitation, hygiene and soil degradation in surrounding villages and hills of the wetland have always been treated as separate problems. The Uganda based organization JESE has questioned the sectorial approach and asked for the possibilities to explore a catchment based or landscape based approach. In 2012 an assessment by JESE, Wetland International and RAIN foundation revealed how relevant the added value of integrated model. Thinking about the integration of Wetland management, WASH provision and Water harvesting solutions really is catching two birds with one stone. Retention of uphill water provides clean drinking water in the areas where it is most needed and at the time when it is most needed. It also protects the wetland from flooding and siltation and combined with agricultural and agroforestry projects, provides alternatives for local communities which hopefully will reduce land pressure and thus encroachment of the wetland.</narrative>
