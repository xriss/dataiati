   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Financial sustainability : RiPPLE has developed a comprehensive and valued recognition in the water sector at national, regional and district levels. The reputation of RiPPLE provides a coordination space that allows the RHCC activities to be backed up by government, CSO and private sector. The support from the federal, regional, woreda and CSO will have an added value to effectively implement the RHCC and sustain the outputs and the system in the country. This inclusive shift in programming to consider RH options will also address the current self-supply focus of the government in the UAP(WASH GTP). 

The ongoing accelerated universal access plan of the government which has been planned to achieve 98% coverage of water and 100% coverage of the sanitation intensified the necessity to document and share knowledge with the purpose of giving support to the plan and the roles of the sector performers, at a central and decentralized level. The demand for knowledge that exists in the sector has put forward for discussion or to the development of pertinent work, justifies the need for RHCC at both national and regional levels. In addition, the leading support of RAIN as a think tank in RWH, as well as the partnership with IRC, WaterAid, UNICEF, WSF, WASH movement, Meta Meta, SNV etc will have input to the success and sustainability. The skills in RiPPLE office and experience working with regional and national platforms expected to insure the successful team spirit and knowledge combination.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The WASH service delivery gap in Ethiopia is enormous. Ethiopia has the highest absolute number of people without access to improved water supply and sanitation in Sub-Saharan Africa, accounting for over 50% of the (mainly rural) population. To meet the challenge, the government has set ambitious targets under its Accelerated Universal Access Programme (A-UAP) to achieve full coverage by 2012, with major investment from government, donors and, increasingly, rural communities. The plan has been made part of the current growth and transformation plan (GTP) which targeted to achieve the full coverage by 2015. The ability to meet and maintain coverage in the context of growing concern over climate change, and the climate resilience of different water supply technologies, is a subject of considerable debate.</narrative>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The effort to develop an Rainwater Harvesting Capacity Center (RHCC) in the Water and Sanitation sector in Ethiopia has the vision of creating a dynamic water-centered knowledge driven centre focusing on pro-poor rainwater harvesting (RWH) and WASH services for sustainable WASH intervention.

It provides a knowledge base for the promotion of appropriate and sustainable RWH and WASH to address multiple water needs of vulnerable communities in Ethiopia for domestic water supply, hygiene, sanitation and food production.</narrative>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The objective is to become the lead sector knowledge driver, facilitating the learning process, knowledge generation and advocating for knowledge sharing within the WASH sector organizations working in the sector (to improve program quality/harmonization/policy and practice support) with a specific focus on rainwater harvesting (RWH). It does so by delivering quality services and knowledge products to meet the information needs of the WASH sector.</narrative>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The thematic areas are the backbone around which we apply the proposed WASH resource and RHCC in sector development. The knowledge cycle serves as a guide to structure the thematic areas, a logic process to identifying demand and supply, developing new knowledge, facilitating its dissemination and monitoring. These thematic areas proposed based on various surveys which represent important knowledge by their implications on the quality and coverage of the WASH services. Hence WASH as a package is the core thematic area with a focus to RWH. 

Water supply (WS): is the major component of the center services. The center will work to achieve comprehensive transformation of the delivery of quality WASH services. The RWH options will give emphasis to reach the most remote areas with sustainable and cost effective self supply options.  

Sanitation and Hygiene (SH): the sanitation activities linked with the water supply activities through awareness creation and low cost hardware support to implementing partners. The center will document and share various international, national and local sanitation models for sustainable services.  The center will work with relevant partners to develop local specific promotion strategy. The hygiene component focuses on developing means and tools for behavioral change interventions in institutions and community. The center will work with partners in monitoring and evaluation, capacity building and information communication. 

Cross-cutting sector:  the RHCC will consider issues in sectors which have direct or indirect impact on the WASH like integrated water resource management (IWRM), climate change adaptation, IWRM sectors. These will be considered through sector coordination and harmonization. There is direct linkage like between natural resource management and WASH. One has to complement each other. Similarly WASH is the most vulnerable sector impacted by climate change.  The focus will be on WASH (RiPPLE background) at least in the first phase. However the climate change and water linkages; integrated water resource management will going to be taken up depending specific priority topics. The cross cutting activities will be part of all the phases but varies in scale depending on the resource and learning in the sector with the recognition that training, advices, M&amp;E, communication etc. is also scarcely on supply and in high demand.

Food Security: food production through MUS and improved natural resource management will be also addresses in the thematic areas. The multiple use of water in RWH which includes productive use will provide a knowledge base for the promotion of appropriate options to address multiple water needs of vulnerable communities for domestic water supply, hygiene, and sanitation and food production.</narrative>
