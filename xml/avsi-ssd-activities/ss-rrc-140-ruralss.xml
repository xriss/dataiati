   </title>
   <description>
    <narrative xml:lang="EN">Four multisector surveys were carried out in 4 out of the 6 targeted counties. Namely, all the targeted counties in Eastern Equatoria State - Torit, Magwi, Ikwoto, and Lopa/Lafon &#x2013; plus Wulu were surveyed and assessed. 

Meant to influence AVSI&#x2019;s programming and project implementation, the objectives of the multi-sector household survey are multi-fold. In order to promote a holistic and change-oriented understanding of the area, the survey covers different sectors and determinants (contributing factors), with brief references to outlier communities and/or noticeable changes occurred in the recent past. 

The core of the survey is food security and agriculture. Other sectors covered include: Livelihood, Problems and Resilience, Health and WASH, Education, Protection and GBV, Agriculture and Livestock rearing, Migration, Community participation, Governance, Disaster Risk Reduction. 

 The sampling strategy followed the standard two-stage cluster sampling, the first stage guiding the selection of villages (based on probability proportional to population size - PPS - and stratification) and the second one that of the households to be surveyed (based on &#x201C;improved random-walk&#x201D; method). 

In Torit county, a total of 348 HHs were randomly selected and interviewed, covering the payams of Kudo, Lowoi, Ifwotu, Bur, Nyong, Himodonge, Imurok, Hiyalla, Iyire. 

In Magwi county, 295 HHs were randomly selected and interviewed, covering the payams of Magwi Centre, Obbo, Iwire, Omeo, Agoro, Owinykibul, Pajok, Palwar, Lobone, Losite. 

In Ikwoto county 351 HHs were randomly selected and interviewed, covering the payams of Ikwoto, Imotong, Bira, Chahari, Chorokol, Hatire, Isohe, Losite.

In Lopa/Lafon county, 248 HHs were randomly selected and interviewed, covering the payams of Lohutok, Obunge, Arilo, Longiro, Imehejek.</narrative>

   </title>
   <description>
    <narrative xml:lang="EN">From the 18th to the 28th of January 2022, a mission guided by Andrea Fabiani (Dr. in Tropical and Subtropical Agricultural Sciences) was conducted in the targeted areas in Eastern Equatoria State. The main objective of the mission was to assess the territories, their challenges and constraints specifically related to climate in order to develop eco-friendly agricultural practices. 

Key findings: The techniques to be adopted must be at cost &quot;0&quot;, to cover large extensions and so that the communities can take charge of them. Effective and low-cost techniques are easily replicable and can spread quickly among communities. The keyword must be environmental &quot;Education&quot;, because to respect the environment, you need to know it and in order to know it, you need to be trained. The food consumption of termites should be taken seriously (50% protein content; micronutrient content should be researched), along with the proposal to introduce more efficient cooking systems. Desertification is an ongoing process and, to reverse the trend, it is enough to put into practice actions in favor of the resumption of the biotic succession.</narrative>
