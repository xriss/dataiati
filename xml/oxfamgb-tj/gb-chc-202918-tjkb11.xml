   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The aim is to massively increase demand for improvement of sanitation facilities in households in Tajikistan where the government and donors see a huge need for investment but have low understanding of &#x2018;how&apos;. The main problem is how to build a business model that will lay the foundation for a sanitation market system and catalyse the sales of affordable, sustainable and culturally acceptable sanitation products for households in rural and peri -urban areas. Many poor households not only lack income, but also the preferences for demanding access to quality water and sanitation services, often resulting in low rates of maintenance and self -financing even in those cases where donors have provided initial capital for infrastructure; these supply side focused initiatives will not generate sustained long term impact on Water Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) and therefore potentially result in the return of negative coping mechanisms and the very problems we initially intended to resolve.  A business model will be built around a &#x2018;sanitation marketing&apos; method that applies social and commercial approaches to scale up the supply and demand for improved sanitation facilities. Oxfam aims to build a business model that will benefit 10,000 people (of these, 51% women) in 2,000 households -particularly women and children -in three villages of Rudaki district with improved and equitable access to quality sanitation facilities and services by 2020, resulting in better health conditions and well -being. The main components of the sanitation marketing activities will be: &#x2022; A SMART business model for sanitation marketing is developed with clear milestones for demand creation, supply chain and financing models &#x2022; Approximately 200 households in three rural communities in Rudaki district are reached with effective behaviour change communication, and access improved sanitation products &#x2022; At least 2 latrine producers provide improved sanitation services in the district based on national level busi</narrative>
