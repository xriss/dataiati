    <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Ebola Virus Disease outbreak of 2014 - 2015 significantly affected the advances that Guinea has made since democracy took root in 2010. Though the epidemic was largely brought under control late by 2015, Guinea will continue to face the social, economic, and health consequences of the Ebola outbreak. The Ebola outbreak highlighted the weak governance that has crippled the well-being and growth of the country for decades. Dysfunctional government administration, pervasive public corruption, and rampant infectious diseases exacerbated by malnutrition are among Guinea&apos;s challenges. Environmental sanitation is poor, cholera and typhoid epidemics occur regularly, along with pervasive malaria and diarrhea that kill many, especially children. U.S. assistance will increase the availability of quality health services and improve food security, with a particular focus on improving delivery of health services, strengthening health systems, and encouraging communities to access health services. Assistance will also target civil society, media programming, and strategic security sector reform to encourage the development of a rule of law culture in Guinea, which is critical to reshaping the country&apos;s institutions. The United States seeks to accomplish these objectives through effective collaboration with the Government of Guinea (GOG), other donors, local non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and the private sector.</narrative>
