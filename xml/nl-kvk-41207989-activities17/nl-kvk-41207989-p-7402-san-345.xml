   <narrative xml:lang="EN">GUSO aims to improve the sexual and reproductive health and rights of young people. The program takes a multi-component approach, working simultaneously on ensuring comprehensive sexuality education, youth-friendly services and building a supportive environment.     
 
In Kenya, Aidsfonds works with two organisations, led by young people and women living with and affected by HIV. Aidsfonds aims to ensure that the rights and need of people living with HIV are fully integrated in sexuality education, health services and sexual and reproductive health policies.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Get Up Speak Out builds on the previous Access, Knowledge and Services (ASK) and Unite for Body Rights (UfBR) projects, which were implemented in the same countries through alliances of complementing partners. 
 
The program aims to improve the poor sexual and reproductive health and rights of young people by strengthening civil society organisations to effectively address young people&#x2019;s rights and needs. Meaningful youth participation is a key strategy to make sure the voice of young people is heard.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Get Up Speak Out Theory of Change (ToC) builds on the successes and experience from the previous Access, Knowledge and Services (ASK) and Unite for Body Rights (UfBR) projects. Our unique added value is our ability to address the multitude of factors and actors influencing young people&#x2019;s SRHR using a multi-component approach. Using our individual and joint expertise, we can successfully link (i) provision of sexuality education and information, (ii) provision of quality, youth-friendly SRH services and (iii) building support for youth SRHR, by addressing socio-cultural and political barriers in terms of practices, norms and policies.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The final beneficiaries of the project are young people. Over 3 million young people will be reached by campaigns and (social) media; 3.450 young people will be structurally involved in the implementation of the programme at community level (for example youth groups, CBOs, peer educators). 300 young key influencers are acting as SRHR ambassadors and bring SRHR at the forefront. 400 policy makers involve young people and youth-led organisations in SRHR policy review, development and dissemination; 250 religious leaders are sensitized and advocate for and support youth SRHR issues. 80 young people receive and participate in tailor made awareness raising sessions</narrative>
