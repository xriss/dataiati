Bi-monthly community led health outreaches were held with support of health care service providers to these sex workers at hot spots. This is where young female sex workers engaged with facilitators in health and rights literacy trainings, while also accessing services. These bi-monthly community-led health outreaches were conducted utilising sex worker peer educators supported under another SRC project titled &quot; Going the Last mile in the control of HIV&quot;. A total of 6 community-led health outreaches were held in Bulawayo, 2 in Gwanda and 1 in Plumtree under Mangwe districts.</narrative>

These included clients that experienced physical violence perpetrated by clients who refused to pay for sexual services, emotional stress due to family problems, denial of HIV status and defaulting, loss of property to clients and  bereavement. The psychosocial support comprised of counselling, home visits, accompaniment to the police to make reports and to hospital to access health care services.
