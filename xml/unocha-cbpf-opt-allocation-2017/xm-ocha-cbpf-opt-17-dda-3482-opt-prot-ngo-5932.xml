   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Enhancing protection through provision of specialized mental health services and psycho social support to the most affected children, adults and parents living in vulnerable areas at Gaza Strip.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project will support the delivery of quality specialized mental health services to the most venerable women and men, girls and boys in the most affected locations identified by the Child Protection and Mental Health and Psychosocial Working Groups in Gaza Strip through the following: 
A1)	Provision of specialized mental health services for children (boys and girls) and adults/parents (women and men) who have displayed symptoms of severe psychosocial distress. By using the existing referral system, those cases will be detected and referred by the case managers and psychosocial support staff working in 28 family centers and Child Protection and MHPSS networks across the Gaza Strip. Additionally other support detected through structured activities implemented through other venues such as GCMHP&#x2019;s community centers and their teams can be provided with required support. The clinical services will be provided by specialized multi  disciplinary team at GCMHP three community centers located in Gaza city, Deir El Balah and Khanyounis encompassing: child amp adolescent psychiatrists, psychologists, psychiatric nurse, and social workers as well as community  teams. Therapy plans include psychotherapy, play therapy, medication, family counseling and home visits 
A 2)	The project also will contribute to strengthening the provision of counseling through sustaining the provision of free telephone counseling service for children (girls and boys) and adults/parents (women and men) who couldn&#x2019;t reach mental health centres due to economic or social barriers. The free telephone counseling service is an efficient service that enables people from the marginalized and vulnerable communities to reach reliable counseling services for any psychological, social or emotional problems by specialized professionals. It is provided free of charge i.e., clients do not pay for this service. Through this service, the telephone counselors also will detect and refer children and women with severe symptoms into GCMHP community centres to receive specialized mental health services including medications if necessary. The telephone counselors (1 man and 1 women) provide psycho education and individual counseling. It is worth to mention that this service helps overcome stigma attached to mental health problems. Callers are given a chance to express themselves freely and without hesitation due to the fact that they are anonymous. Moreover, callers can present problems that they are ashamed to disclose in person due to the nature of the problems that they might suffer from. Further, callers especially women and girls from remote and border areas are given chance to call as they might not be able to reach due to various reasons.  In other words, the telephone counseling services are key in serving target groups that have restrictions to reach the community centers.
A 3) Strengthen coordination mechanisms: GCMHP will update and share its 5 W matrix with CPWG and PHSS including gender disaggregated information. Also it will be participated in the coordination mechanism building on the SOPs for emergency.</narrative>
