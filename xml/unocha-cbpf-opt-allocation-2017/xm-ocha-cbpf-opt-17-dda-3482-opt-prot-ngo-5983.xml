   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Supporting the Right to Recovery for Traumatized Children and their Families in Conflict Affected Areas of the West Bank and East Jerusalem</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Since 2014, Israeli military campaigns in both the West Bank and Gaza Strip have continued to violate the human rights of all Palestinians, especially children, accumulating further burden to decades of traumas and human rights abuses particularly in conflict affected areas of Hebron, including the H2 District where children are at high risk of politically motivated violence by Israeli security forces and settlers, as well as in villages in East Jerusalem. In these areas, children suffer from increasing fear for their lives as a result of torture, politically motivated violence, and other forms of human rights abuses that threaten to destroy their normal childhood development and hinder their growth and livelihood. Families, especially children, are at risk of physical and psychological trauma caused by frequent exposure to violence and abuse. As children make up 55% of the total population in Palestine, they are at high risk of human rights violations attributed to the on-going conflict. Unlike adults, they are less capable of relying on their verbal communication skills to express their frustrations, anger or fear. If left untreated, Children can develop chronic and long-term side-effects, including PTSD, which can severely inhibit their psychological well-being and development. Many children in Palestine that suffer from torture, violence or ill-treatment under the context of the on-going conflict exhibit poor social skills, hopelessness, loss of education, and a deterioration of their relationships with friends, family and relatives. In their daily lives, they are systematically exposed to house demolitions, land or property confiscation, and movement restrictions in addition to violence and loss of loved ones. Palestinian children also suffer from domestic violence, which is directly correlated and attributed to the prevalence and continued use of torture and organized violence in Palestine. The fact that these children are burdened creates a strong necessity for psychological intervention. TRC seeks to deploy a team of 4 full-time human rights oriented field psychologists to provide individual, group, family and child therapy to a minimum of 200 direct children for a duration of 6 months. In addition, TRC will deploy a Crisis Intervention Protocol to provide immediate response to families and children suffering from shock and trauma due to sudden violent and traumatic situations to assist them in reducing stress and anxiety through debriefing exercises, appropriately responding to emergency crises, and providing support to other family members, especially children whom may exhibit signs but may not be able to communicate their suffering. Additionally, TRC will conduct 6 awareness raising workshops to strengthen and empower marginalized communities to identify and become familiar with the Convention on the Rights of the Child as a framework to promote better understanding, and encourage increased activity of children and youth in the promotion of their rights according to international laws under the context of promoting a more tolerant and human rights-oriented Palestinian society. Finally, TRC will conduct 3 workshops for 60 School administrators, especially those that are directly in contact with children, in order to sensitize them to the needs of children suffering from psychological disorders and in order to promote a support system in coordination with parents to assist children in overcoming their suffering.</narrative>
