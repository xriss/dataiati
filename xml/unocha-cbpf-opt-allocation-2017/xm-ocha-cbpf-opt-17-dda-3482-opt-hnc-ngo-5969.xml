  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The old city of Hebron is considered one of the most struggling areas in the West Bank due to the settler&#x2019;s arrogance and crimes, arrogance of the Israeli occupation, and the large number of military checkpoints and repetitive closures. Therefore, HWC decided to establish Hebron Emergency Center based on its mission for providing health and development services to marginalized people in order to enhance its steadfastness. The center was established in 2002. Then it became the one of the main health facilities that provides Women Health Program&#x2019;s services, Chronic Disease Program&#x2019;s services and among other primary health care services. This is in addition to providing specialized services (11 specialties. The current project is an outcome of the continuous assessment of the general situation and particular health needs of the communities in the old city of Hebron (H2) through HWC&#x2019;s Hebron Emergency Center with special focus on the health needs of the vulnerable communities. This is in addition to analyzing secondary data review published by others. The assessment revealed the presence of two pressing problems faced by the communities in the old city of Hebron (H2), which are the escalation of political violence imposed by the Israeli occupation and its settlers upon communities in the old city of Hebron (H2) and so these communities have been considered one of the most vulnerable communities in the West Bank. As the presence of the Israeli occupation and its systematic violence practices have been imposing threat on the livelihood of these communities. Moreover, the Israeli occupation has been imposing restriction movements upon these communities, which hinders the ability of these communities to reach out for health services outside the old city of Hebron (H2). Thus, the Sustaining the Provision of Essential Health Services by Hebron Emergency Center of Health Work Committees to the Most Vulnerable Communities in the south governorate of the West Bank Health has the overall objective to contribute to the promotion of equitable access to essential health services of adequate quality by communities in the old city of Hebron (H2). The overall objective will be accomplished through two specific objectives (1) To increase the capacity of Hebron Emergency Center of Health Work Committees to provide essential health services to communities in the old city of Hebron (2) To increase the access to women&#x2019;s health services, chronic disease services and access to medical supplies and lifesaving drugs in the targeted communities. This will be accomplished through two expected results (1) The capacity of the Hebron Emergency Center of HWC to provide essential health services is increased, This correspond to the first specific objective and (2) The communities in the old city of Hebron (H2) have received women&#x2019;s health services, chronic disease services, emergency services and medical supplies and lifesaving drugs through Hebron Emergency Center of HWC.  The first expected result will be accomplished through the implementation of the following activity providing the Hebron Emergency Center with basic medications and medical disposables. While the second expected result will be accomplished through the following activities the Hebron Emergency Center provides healthcare services including primary health services, through the Women Health Program, the center provides services that focus primarily on early detection of diseases, especially breast and cervical cancer and on health education. In addition to the organization of open health days in which topics related to women and their health in all aspects of life, legal and human rights, are discussed, through the Chronic Disease Program, the center provides services which is essential for the early detection of complications of diabetes and therefore early treatment. It also provides educational sessions in areas of proper nutrition personal hygiene, and how to deal and cope with diabetes.</narrative>
