   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The objective of this 2-year project is to improve the living conditions of 12 families by building houses and deep-water wells, so they can return to their land. All of the families are members of ASOCAB in the town of Buenos Aires, El Pe&#xF1;on municipality.The project will build 6 houses and deep-water wells per year over 2 years. This will also help to improve the safety and security of 34 families that have already returned to this land, through the mutual protection of people, their houses and food production for their own consumption and income generation. Mutual care and self-protection of families has proven to work in the past against the palm oil companies attempts to destroy properties. Properties that were left unattended were targeted by the company.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Together with the beneficiary families, our partner will establish the best location on which to build the houses. This selection will take into consideration which areas are least exposed to floods, have underground water sources which can be accessed with deep-water wells, have a strategic location so families can watch their land, and are easy to access, amongst other things. Corambiente will also establish basic agreements with the community for the purchase of materials and the construction of the houses, a process in which other members of ASOCAB will participate. The same will be done for the construction of the deep-water wells, an essential component for improving the families&#x2019; habitat and their food production. Individual deep-water wells will be constructed beside each house instead of the community sharing a well as the properties are considerably spaced out from each other, therefore requiring wells that are easier accessed by beneficiary families to use for their own consumption and to irrigate their crops.</narrative>
