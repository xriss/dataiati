   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The  success  for our response will be measured by number of people that receive life-saving emergency support that contributes to reduced mortality and morbidity among the displaced communities.  In the interim success will entail (i) number of households and members of community that have access to sanitary and hygienic practices; (ii) Number of pregnant and lactating mothers, children under five, PLWDs, PLWH and the Elderly that have access to Corn Soy Blend; (iii) number of households that have access to essential items through cash and NFIs.  In the long term, the success will be reduced morbidity and mortality of women, children and other members of the affeted communities.  By March 2022, 4,000 households (20,000 people) in the 4 flooded TAs will have been reached with emergency support.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The response project will focus on sectors including multipurpose cash, nutrition, shelter and Non Food Items (NFIs) and Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) and will cover 4,000 HHs (20,000 individuals). These particular sectors have been selected due to the needs requirements for the catchment following the needs assessment reports. Specifically, they are the:

- distribution of WASH items to 4,000 HHs (20,000 individuals); this includes items such as buckets, sanitizers, face masks, etc.
- distribution of NFIs materials to 4,000HHs (20,000 individuals); this includes items such as plates and cups.
- distribution of nutrition baskets of Corn Soy Blend to 3,800 individuals including under five Children, Chronically ill and Elderly will have access to high nutritious foods.                   
- non-conditional multipurpose Cash distribution to 1,000 HHs (5,000 individuals) to cover for all other urgent needs not included in the other activities. This approach will address the needs of the affected people as they will have opportunity to choose what they want to buy instead of bringing them something they may not like to buy. 

The project will be divided to 2,000 HHs in Chikwawa and 2,000 HHs in Nsanje District.</narrative>
