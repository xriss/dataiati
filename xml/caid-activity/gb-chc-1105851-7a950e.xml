   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The intervention will alleviate immediate suffering for the crisis affected people that will be targeted for this response while more resources are being mobilized from other partners and government stakeholders such as the State Emergency Management Agency (SEMA), National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA), Kaduna State Peace-Building Commission. Start agency interventions would be able to meet the immediate needs of the affected population while any mobilised resources from the government would also support further recovery processes and or possible scale up.
The IDPs have migrated to a safe area from which they will move out and return to their homes as they still try to attend to their farms. This intervention will serve as mainly a lifesaving intro to stabilize them for the initial period before they feel safe to return as is the typical disposition of those in the middle region of Nigeria. 
Based on the assessment that has been conducted so far by Red Cross and local partner in the location, the needs are quite varied due to the nature by which households were displaced. The key sectors identified in the assessment findings were: Food, NFIs and WASH.</narrative>
