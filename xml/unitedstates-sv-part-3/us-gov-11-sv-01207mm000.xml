    <narrative xml:lang="EN">U.S. assistance aligns with the U.S. Strategy for Engagement in Central America (the Strategy) to expand broad-based economic growth in a more secure and transparently governed El Salvador. The U.S. government will promote prosperity by improving the business environment, stimulating greater production, and building a skilled workforce that will help attract greater investment and create more jobs. These activities will be provided through technical assistance, grants, and loans. To increase security, U.S. assistance will help build stronger and more resilient communities that can withstand increasing pressures of gang violence. Programs will address the underlying social and socioeconomic factors that contribute to crime and violence by providing greater educational and economic opportunities for vulnerable youth in high-crime communities. Assistance will also strengthen the capacity of El Salvador&apos;s security forces and law enforcement agencies to contribute to international and domestic security. Using a place-based approach, a geographically focused, coordinated effort to reduce crime and victimization in targeted communities, U.S. assistance will support the integration of law enforcement and prevention activities. To promote improved governance, U.S. assistance will help strengthen the criminal justice system, government transparency and accountability, and respect for human rights. In October 2014, the U.S. government launched the Strategy, which complements the work undertaken by national governments and multilateral development banks, to support the priority objectives identified in the Plan of the Alliance for Prosperity in the Northern Triangle. The Strategy focuses on three overarching lines of action: 1) promoting prosperity and regional economic integration; 2) enhancing security through continued and expanded Central America Regional Security Initiative (CARSI) activities; and 3) promoting improved governance. Therefore, the Department of State and USAID&apos;s FY 2017 request of $750.0 million in bilateral and regional assistance for Central America - a part of the Administration&apos;s $1.0 billion whole-of-government request for appropriations and financing assistance to support the Strategy - includes and aligns the resources necessary to increase economic opportunity, reduce extreme violence, strengthen the effectiveness of state institutions, address climate change and food insecurity, and address challenges that have resulted in an influx of migration.</narrative>
