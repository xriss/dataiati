       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Major achievements under Output 1.2: 
&#x2022;	Baseline survey conducted based on 10 focus group discussions among youth and 10 focus group discussions among municipal staff covering 110 participants, 541 questionnaires filled out and informal observation conducted (implemented in 2018).
&#x2022;	Needs and priorities of youth assessed in 10 pilot municipalities (implemented in 2018).
&#x2022;	24 youth leaders completed a 6-month intensive &#x2018;Dilgir&#x2019; course on April 18, 2019 and obtained certificates issued by the Ministry of Education and Science of the KR.
&#x2022;	20 staff of pilot municipalities completed a 6-month intensive course for Specialists on Youth Affairs on April 2, 2019 and obtained certificates issued by the Academy of Public Administration under the President of KR. Jointly with the Staff of pilot municipalities the youth leaders developed so called &#x2018;portfolios&#x2019; (i.e. individual youth action plans) and conducted 64 events covering around 3,000 participants. This is a good example of interaction of the youth leaders with the municipal servants and will be used further in development and adoption of local strategies on youth policies that will be a part of the Programme on Social-Economic Development adopted in June 2019 and will be valid for the next 4 years and for implementation of which funding from local budgets will be allocated.
&#x2022;	&#x2018;Safe Route&#x2019; interactive game among youth piloted in 10 municipalities among youth aged between 14-28 on May 14-28, 2019 and covered more than 400 people.
&#x2022;	Together with LSGs, local youth groups, as well as with the support of implementing partners, local youth development plans have been developed in pilot communities. At this stage, 8 plans have been developed and adopted, 1 plan is being at the adoption stage. In total, 92 youth (75% male and 25% female) took an active part in the processes of developing plans and their further promotion. The indicated 8 youth development plans have been approved, adopted by local councils of deputies and received full financial support from the local budget for a total of more than $188,000.

Major achievements under Output 2.2:
&#x2022;	Together with local IP UNDP KG allocated $100,000 to support various youth initiatives through establishing a Revolving Fund. On the other hand, the IP reached agreement with a respective Commercial Bank to be a partner and allocate relatively the same amount to credit youth initiatives with low interest rate and without collateral. This will leverage external investments/funding opportunities to support youth initiatives. The grant funding among youth is already launched.
&#x2022;	In total, 53 project proposals were received under the revolving fund, a specially created commission selected and awarded financing to 21 projects for a total of $ 100,000. Projects are mainly in the field of provision services to the population, livestock and production. In total, 112 jobs were created (78% male and 22% female, as well as 2 people with disabilities (PWDs) and 12 young people from vulnerable categories). About $7,000 of the funds issued has already been returned according to the agreement, respectively, these funds will be issued to young people from the reserve list of projects or from the number of new applications that have already begun to come.
&#x2022;	The second round of call was announced among CSOs approximately for $100,000 to support youth initiatives, which is ongoing.</narrative>
