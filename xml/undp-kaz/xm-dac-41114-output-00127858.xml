       <narrative xml:lang="EN">1. The needs-assessment study was designed to assess the degree of readiness of each country in introducing innovation in government operations and policy implementation and digitalisation of public services utilising easy-to-use and convenient differentiated channels for their delivery. It has been completed and its results may be found in the report titled &#x201C;Feasibility [Needs-Assessment] Study Results Report&#x201D;. The results of the study have allowed for a better understanding of the needs for each country with respect to adopting innovative practices and digitalising public services and their delivery that suits each one of them best. Such results are currently being utilised in designing and planning capacity development activities for the second year (2022) of project implementation. 
2. A regional conference aimed at discussing the findings of the needs-assessment study and coming up with a programme of activities for the second year of project implementation - planned to take place in December 2021 - has been postponed indefinitely due movement and social contact conditions induced by the persistently prevalent pandemic. Given the fact that this conference is contingent to the development of programmatic activities for 2022, it seems that it will not take place after all, since the programme of activities for 2022 must be prepared as soon as possible, in order to ensure smooth implementation of the envisioned activities throughout the year, with no unnecessary rush.
3. Three seminars took place in November and December 2021. The first seminar was about ecosystems and conducive environments for innovation and digitalisation to flourish and took place on 4 and 5 November. The second seminar was about policy making for development of innovation and digitalisation and took place on 25 and 26 November, and the third dealt with innovation and digitalisation policy for efficient implementation and took place on 9 and 10 December. 
A total of 327 individuals participated in the two seminars of which 175 were female (53.5%) and 152 male (46.5%). Presentations were made from all seven participating countries, as well from countries considered leaders in digitalisation, i.e. Estonia, Finland, and Korea, and from international development organisations, i.e. the OECD, and the World Bank (Gov Tech). The study visits of government personnel from the seven participating countries engaged in innovation and digitalisation policy design and implementation was not implemented. It was postponed due to travel and movement restrictions currently in force. However, it was agreed among the implementing partners to replace it with an on-line webinar and a self-paced on-line course targeting high-level officials from the seven participating countries. 
The objectives of the webinar were to provide a better understanding of the Korean experience in digital government and its key policies, to learn about Korea&#x2019;s best practices in digital government, and to acquire information on recent technological advances in digital government, with the aim to identify ways that they could be adopted in the participating countries&#x2019; settings. The objectives of the self-paced course were to provide an opportunity to the participants for gaining a better understanding and enhancing their capacities to plan and implement a digital government strategy and an action masterplan, through learning about digital government policies, innovative digital government services, and best practices of the Korean digital government development experience, as well as about the lessons learnt in the process.</narrative>
