      <narrative xml:lang="EN">Structural and functional degradation of desert and steppe ecosystems is occurring across Kazakhstan with the loss of important biodiversity and ecosystem services. 

Wind and water erosion primarily due to unsustainable farming practices (crop and rice production) and extensive resource use (grazing, wood and grass harvesting) affect over 67 % of rain-fed areas of steppe and desert ecosystems, resulting in the loss of organic matter in topsoil (20% in the past 30 years) and reduction of crop yields by 20-30%.

The increasing annual harvest of riparian trees and reeds by local communities, local hunters, fishermen and farmers for use as fuel and for sale as well as for creating areas for fishing, grazing and harvesting has led to a dramatic reduction of the area and diversity of wooded zones.

Overgrazing is the leading cause of degradation of Kazakhstan&#x2019;s rangelands, making this important agroecosystem susceptible to droughts, inadequate natural regeneration, widespread aerial transportation of sand and salt (affecting some 30 million ha) and formation of salinized or &#x201C;solonchak&#x201D; lands (more than 93 million ha).  
Pasturelands in Kazakhstan are affected by uneven use. Over 125 million ha of pastures lack watering points, thus restricting their utilization. On the other hand, some pastures are being over used - about 27.1 million ha of pastures that are located around settlements are classified as highly degraded due to unsustainable use.

Unsustainable hunting and fishing is on the rise.

Household and hazardous waste accumulation is increasing in rural and peri-urban areas.

Being a semiarid to arid country with a temperate climate, Kazakhstan faces significant desiccation in the face of climate change, and significant exacerbation of non-climate pressures.

The essential problem to be addressed by this project is that the necessary collective action in Kazakhstan for adaptive management of resources and ecosystem processes for sustainable development and global</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">1) Due to COVID-19 and restrictions for movement, monitoring of the on-going projects was mainly ensured remotely. Plan B was prepared for each of the grant project, approved by the NSC and monitored biweekly starting April-August 2020 by the Project team via skype/zoom. Weekly/biweekly virtual calls with each project portfolio was arranged for the same period to monitor the project implementation of the each project. In September-December the projects were monitored by personal calls biweekly. Also project was monitored based on the progress reports, lessons learned documents, analysis documents etc. 

2)	Grants commitments
&#x2022;	In 2020 the NSC approved three grant projects for the total amount of US$ 81,347 and additional grant amount of US$ 40,151 for climate change projects to expand the project activities. 
&#x2022;	The grant amount of $50,000 for the Workshop to demonstrate the SGP results in OP6 was reallocated for other purposes, as there are similar activities planned within on-going grant projects on mulstistakeholder dialogue expansion and due to COVID-19, the event is planned to be arranged online. 
&#x2022;	The entire grant project portfolio on biodiversity conservation, climate change, and land degradation in Y 2020 amounted to 47 projects for a total amount of $ 1,437,297.
o	21 demo projects and 3 capacity building projects are underway, 25 projects successfully completed.

3) Due to COVID-19 impact, most of the grant projects as well as the entire SGP OP6 Project were extended till October 2021 to complete the project activities and to have enough time to analyse the results achieved. Thus the lessons learned and case-studies activities will continiue till summer 2021. In 2020 17 lessons learned documents have been developed, two case-studies drafts prepared. In 2021 all planned (seven) case-studies and seven lessons learned documents will be finalized.

4) In 2020 8 experience exchange visits have been arranged, which demonstrated sustainable agricultural technologies and practices for small businesses and educational facilities, energy efficient technologies in educational and social institutions working with vulnerable groups, sustainable methods for the development of beekeeping, examples of farmers cooperation. Due to COVID-19, 4 site-visits were arranged virtually. Project results were also presented to akimats of the pilot regions.
5) Regular PR and outreach activities to share SGP experience were implemented. 55 posts were prepared and posted on the activities of the SGP and projects on the SGP website and in the social networks; 8 articles about projects were prepared and published in the LIVEN magazine and in the magazines social media accounts. 

6) Due to COVID-19, the UNOPS audit have been postponed to 2021.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">1) Four regional (participated by approx.60 participants) and one national level (90 participants) multi-stakeholder consultations were held that concentrated on group current issues, experience exchange and attained results on earlier agreed (2018) landscape strategies and on-going SGP projects.
2) Project aimed at enhancing effectiveness of multi-stakeholder groups work on regional and national level is approved by NSC in October and will start in 2020. SGP stakeholders and partners discussed its importance at SGP stakeholder meeting and agreed on areas that this project would address.
3) SGP staff accompanied with thematic experts conducted monitoring visits to all 33 project sites in seven regions as planned.
4) SGP organized three exchange visits to projects sites that piloted agro-technologies for small business and energy efficient technologies at social facilities working with vulnerable groups. Participated by more that 80 stakeholders and partners from seven regions, these visits raised awareness on piloted technologies, enhanced regional cooperation and networking between CSOs.
5) On 29 October 2019 NSC members approved another 14 projects to start early in 2020 that will ensure commitment target of $340,000 by the end of the project.
6) Local website was developed with the purpose to widely share experience of Small Grants Programme, attract new CSOs and replicate successful practices across Kazakhstan. Website is currently updated with substantial content; official launch is anticipated in January 2020.
7) In September 2019 SGP hosted Midterm review mission. MTR report shared last week rated the project satisfactorily. Draft report was submitted to HQ for final comments. Project Audit is postponed for 2020 by UNOPS.</narrative>
