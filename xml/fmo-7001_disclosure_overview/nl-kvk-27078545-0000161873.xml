   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project aims to support healthcare providers, patients, and the national government in Ghana, with the current Covid-19 response and to ensure that the implemented processes and technologies stay in place post-Covid-19. This will improve the response capacity for future outbreaks and will contribute to a stronger healthcare system in Ghana. FMO- NLB&#x2019;s support will assist PhamAccess in implementing and rolling out the Covid-19 Monitor in Ghana, as the first African country to help reducing the spread of the virus and preparing the healthcare system and local authorities to better handle the COVID-19 response. The FMO development capital contribution of EUR 258,781 represents 50% of the investment required to introduce the COVID-19 Monitor to Ghana as was developed by Luscii Healthtech B.V. and was in the Netherlands made available by OLVG. As part of the solution, a remote care centre will locally be established and the solution will be made available for a USSD feature phone. After successful implementation in Ghana, it will also be made available to other countries such as Nigeria and Kenya.</narrative>
