   <narrative xml:lang="EN">FMO&#x2019;s financing will support DanPer through its growth phase by enabling a better match between the maturity profile of its assets and funding lines. USD 5 million of the USD 30 million facility, will be provided by the Infrastructure Development Fund (IDF) which FMO manages on behalf of the Dutch Ministry of Development Cooperation. To assist the company in dealing with weather related effects, such as the El Ni&#xF1;o effect of 2015, FMO has established a capacity development plan to assist them with an Integrated Water Management Plan to manage the water risks, which is aligned with the Alliance for Water Stewardship Standard. DanPer has adopted IFC Performance Standards and completed Environmental Impact Assessments for all their operations; they already adhere to international certifications (ISO 14001, SA8000, OHSAS 18001 and Global/US GAP). All farms make use of drip irrigation and have reservoirs to store water; waste water is treated and reused and therefore limited amounts are discharged.</narrative>
