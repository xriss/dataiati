   <narrative xml:lang="EN">DeHaat is looking to safeguard health and safety of its employees, Village Level Entrepreneurs (VLEs) and farmers while providing farmers with 360o agricultural services during this unprecedented crisis. The objective is to ensure i) the health and safety of farmers, VLEs and field employees by equipping them with proper kits, ii) health insurance inclusive of Covid-19 cover to VLEs and field employees to safeguard them against any eventuality; iii) Freight subsidy to ensure business continuity arising due to supply chain disruptions. The DeHaat model of providing end-to-end services (agri-inputs, advisory and market linkage) through technology-led value chain interventions is highly sustainable and scalable. DeHaat has demonstrated a phenomenal growth of 3-4x in recent years on Y-o-Y basis, ensuring greater income to smallholder farmers, rural entrepreneurship and job creation while remaining capital efficient.</narrative>
