   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Fund is dedicated to providing debt financing to fast-growing companies which promote access to decentralized modern energy solutions, primarily in Africa and Asia. The market for off-grid energy and lighting is expected to grow into a US$ 50 billion market per annum in the long term. Innovations in business models, coupled with declines in the cost of components like solar panels, are opening new opportunities for companies to offer affordable, high-quality products that can serve the needs of over 2 billion people worldwide who lack access to reliable and affordable energy. These new affordable and modern energy solutions provide a range of socio economic, health and environmental impacts to households, businesses and community services such as schools and clinics.</narrative>
