   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In 2015, FMO has financed and invested in the development and construction of 4 LPG plants with a local capacity of 100,000 ton/year. Total project costs amount to approximately US$60 million. The funding was used for the construction of the main terminal, the three satellite plants and the distribution network. The main terminal is located in Mongla (close to one of the country&apos;s principal seaports) where the LPG is delivered and then redistributed to the three satellite bottling plants located in Dhaka, Bogra and Chittagong and further on to private and commercial users.
In 2018 FMO participated in the capital increase of Omera, which was used to finance the further expansion of Omera.</narrative>
