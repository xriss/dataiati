   <narrative xml:lang="EN">To support BAM International B.V. in preparing and performing the studies/surveys and ESIA needed, prior to financial close, to move forward to the implementation phase of the bridge component of the Project. The proposed Project will consist of two main components: 

I.	Design and construction of Adowso Bridge, the bridge is expected to have a length of ca. 2.5 km (subject to topographical surveys) and shall connect Adowso to Ekyiamentfrom in the Eastern Region of Ghana. The works consists of the design, supply and construction of a new 2 lane bridge and walkways on both sides. 
II.	Design and construction/upgrading of approx. 128 km of approach roads, connecting the National road N6 with the Adowso bridge. The approach road is from Adowso to Bunso, through Kwahu, Maiso and Begoro.

BAM International together with consortium partner Janson Bridging are preparing a proposal for the design and construction of the Adowso Bridge. The upgrading of the approach roads within the Afram Plains will be carried out by a third contractor under a different contract. Because of the topographic connection between the bridge and the roads the separate contracts are considered as a single project. The project will result in contributing to tackling zero hunger and potentially reduce inequalities to marginalised populations in the catchment area of the Afram Plains.</narrative>
