   <narrative xml:lang="EN">KTDA Power will design, construct, operate and maintain seven run-of-the river small-hydropower plants (SHPs) with a total installed capacity of 16MW at various locations in Kenya. The SHPs will provide captive power generation for several KTDA tea factories, and will sell any excess to the majority state-owned utility company, Kenya Power and Lighting Company (KPLC). Each SHP will be owned by newly created asset holding companies, Regional Power Companies (RPCs). KTDA Power will have a 12.5 percent share in each RPC while the remaining shares are held by several tea factories in the region. KTDA Power will on-lend the money to the different RPC&#x2019;s and in turn to different SHPs. There are four RPC&#x2019;s owning seven hydro projects. By retaining factory profit, the tea factories have saved equity over several years. Total Project cost is USD 85.6 million, financed for 65 percent by debt and 35 percent by equity. Total debt package of USD 55 million is arranged by IFC. IFC will take USD 25 million (50 percent GAFSP) and FMO and Proparco both USD 15 million. FMO will participate in a B-loan financed by IDF. KTDA Holdings and its largest subsidiaries will provide a first demand corporate guarantee and unlimited deficiency support throughout the full lifetime of the loan.</narrative>
