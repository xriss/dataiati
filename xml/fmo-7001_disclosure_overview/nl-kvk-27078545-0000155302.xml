   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The objective is to help Meloy with supporting portfolio companies and other impacted SMEs in its pipeline to provide a safe working environment for employees and fish suppliers, as well as bridge the gap between slow-moving government aid and current need for subsistence and health and safety supplies. Since the outbreak of COVID-19, Meloy has responded by implementing a strategy that provides benefits to key stakeholders in this sector, including: 
(i) unlocking liquidity and ensuring safe operations for the portfolio and SMEs in the sector, reducing supply chain disruptions and ensuring business continuity;
(ii) facilitating the continued employment of workers in portfolio companies;
(iii) providing subsistence aid and continued purchases in support of the most vulnerable small-scale fishers in local communities.</narrative>
