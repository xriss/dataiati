  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project will primarily work for anticipatory early actions with a preparatory work from identifying the most vulnerable affected population to prepositioning with winterization support and its distribution before the anticipated cold waves sets in. For this, it will closely monitor the weather information, analyse the data from department of Hydrology and Meteorology (DHM) and observe its effect at local level in the targeted districts. Accordingly, it will work with local DRM authorities and stakeholders including District and Local Emergency Operating Centres (DEOCs &amp; LEOCs) to set out the trigger indicators and associated anticipatory early actions to combat the effect of cold wave. The prepositioning of commodities will mainly cover the sectors a. Shelter and NFI, and b. Food Security and Livelihoods. The shelter and NFIs mainly include the winterization kits for family and individuals (both adult and children). The food security and livelihoods covers distribution of survival food package through vouchers in order to support pauperized families and daily wage earners who may have difficulty finding work during the cold wave times. Gender specific requirements are considered in designing the set of commodities and top up nutrition supplement for pregnant and lactating women and children under 5. In addition, project will also sensitize staff and communities on specific protection issues and also disseminate health awareness messages through mobilizing social mobilizers and using the digital platform called Interactive Voice Response  (IVR).</narrative>
