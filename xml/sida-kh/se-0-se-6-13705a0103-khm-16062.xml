    <narrative xml:lang="EN">The following are some examples of achievements under each of the four components:

1. National Accounts

Time series of new base year have been recalculated, from old 2014 time series to new 2021 time serices, and back casting to 2000. The work on the time series have continued in 2021 and the publication of the national Accounts, with old time series, was published in December 2021.

A memorandum of understanding that formalises how data is shared between NIS and GDT (taxation authority) was expected to be in place during 2021, but this did not succeed as there has been no collaboration from NIS side to develop this further for the moment. In the meantime, the data sharing is still done informally.

The simplified calculation system as well as the training material and coumentation needs to be updated regularly with for instance the use of tax data. The strategy for improved quality and communication of the National Accounts also needs to be updated regularly, and communicated to key users. Hands on trainings on analysis for main users such as Ministry of Economcy and Finance and Central Bank have been done.

It is positive to note that as the capacity has increased in the National Accounts Department, only one mission with SCB&apos;s short term experts is planned for 2022.

2. Statistical Methods

- The methodology team at NIS has developed documentation regarding roles and responsiblities within the team.

- The methodology Team has also done training assessment and developed a training plan for the team, and continued training with the online support by SCB.

- 3 courses in basic statistics (Statistics in Action, STAC) have been conducted in the provinces, Kratie, Kep and Kampong Thom, with NIS trainers. This was the first time that courses are completely held by NIS&apos;s teachers and with training material in Khmer language. In total 99 staff (54 women and 45 men) from Ministry of Planning&apos;s provincial offices participated. The training has resulted in that the participants (working with different parts of the statistical production) have a much greater understanding of the importance of their own part of the work of producing statistics, as they now have knowledge of the entire statistical process.

- A basic course in the R Studio software was conducted with 12 participants (10 men and 2 women). The more advanced course is postponed to 2022.

- One course in SQL (databases) was conducted with 21 particpants (6 women and 15 men) and one course in Excel with 24 participants (7 women and 17 men).

3. Communication and ICT (Information Communication Technology, ICT)

Communication

- There is now a publishing process and dissemination policy in place and the publishing team at NIS is responsible for its implementation. The team has produced posters and leaflets for the census launch early 2021, and training material in Khmer language for the STAC courses. The census results have also been published on NIS website using the Redatam software. Two workshops on how to use Redatam have been conducted for key users.

Other activities have been postponed to 2022 due to the lack of server hardware that will be in place when the new domain/network possible to use and to some extent also due to Covid-19 restrictions that prevailed during 2021 at NIS.

ICT

 - In order to harmonize ICT solutions it is important that all hardware are part of the same domain. This has not been the case at NIS. Work has been done to add/move all NIS staff to the new domain/network that was originally set up for the 2019 Housting and Population Census. This work is essential in order to be able to reuse hardware that are currently used in the old domain/network. Work has also started to set up a server environment at NIS for hosting web servers locally at NIS premises.

- Finalization of the ICT strategy has been carried out by the ICT staff and it is expected to be approved early 2022. A working team for the implementation of the strategy , with its corresponding policies, have been established and the team members comes from ICT department and top management at NIS.

4. Management and Organizational Structure

- Three workshops have been conducted to develop a detailed workplan and budgeting.

- A first draft of a workplan has been developed.

Other activities have been postponed to 2022 as Covid-19 restrictions have halted short term missions to arrive in Cambodia and for planned study trips in the region and to Sweden to be cancelled or postponed.

There is a risk that this component will not be fully achieved by the end of 2022.</narrative>
