    <narrative xml:lang="EN">The assessment of results achievement for this year&apos;s Conclusion on Performance is based on the annual report for 2020 and on-going dialogue and communication between Sida and RWI. These results are summarized as follows: 

Output 1: Improved  knowledge, skills and attitudes among targeted teachers to design, deliver and administer programme/course on human rights and/or gender equality (or where human rights or gender equality is mainstreamed) 

2020 saw a successful enrollment of the seventh batch of students in the PUC master programme in International Human Rights Law and 7 full scholarships for female students were supported by RWI. Under this output, right smaller research grants were provided to eight selected human rights master students. Furthermore, a finalization of self-assessment on gender, human rights and research course and also provided mentoring support to female researcher was achieved with the support of the visiting professor. 

In term of collaboration with the provincial university, USEA, 16 female researchers and students of University of Battambang joined a three days online research workshop on the impacts of Covid 19 on the livelihoods of farmers living along Cambodia-Thai border. In the same activity period, 88 judges students were also provided a human rights course and out of which 55 students are female. Despite of the reporting of the results under output 1, RWI noted that due to the global pandemic during the reporting period some expected outputs were only partially achieved. 

Indicators that were used for the reporting results are based on to what extent to which activities have improved the knowledge, skills and attitudes to teach human rights and gender topics; to what extent research processes and findings are effectively fed into human rights teaching and learning at the institutions and lastly, to what extent activities have improved knowledge and skills to administer and manage programmes and course on human rights and/or gender equality. 

Based on the indicators used by RWI, RWI pointed out that a wide range of activities with the provincial university partners could be implemented and participants had the possibility to improve their knowledge and skills. For example, the 10th December Academy proved to be very efficient forum to critically discuss human rights questions in Cambodia. However, due to PUC&apos;s under-performance the expected outputs were only partially achieved. 

Output 2: Increased opportunities amongst Cambodian students and young professionals to access human rights education and human rights and gender equality networks 

Eight scholarship awards have been granted to female students from socio-economically disadvantaged backgrounds to study law in English at ELBBL programme of the Royal University of Law and Economics. In addition to the scholarships provided earlier, two Cambodian students were also selected to study the Master Programme in International Human Rights Law and Lund University. As a reflection from above-mentioned results RWI, through its feedback given by the students, assessed that it is beneficial for the involved students and their network. During the reporting activity period; however, the Covid-19 made it difficult for students to held regular contact and there were no international conference to be attended and thus, the expected outputs were only partially achieved. 

Output 3: Improved knowledge and skills on human rights and gender equality research among Cambodian academics and increased opportunities to carry out research 

Seven research grants were provided to individual and joint researchers. The topics of the research papers cover Covid-19, human rights and general research papers. Furthermore, research materials and books were purchased and provided to all researchers. In relation to the above, CSHL plays a key role in offering human rights courses to EBBL as well as complementary research papers on human rights. It is assessed that the research grants proved to be a very effective tool to promote academic research on human rights and gender topics in Cambodia. Despite of the pandemic, CSHL was able to excel in its performance on research. All expected outputs were achieved. 

Output 4: Strengthened capacities of libraries and increased availability of human rights and gender teaching resources and materials incl. locally produced, that integrate contextualized human rights knowledge with existing social and human rights problems including gender issues

12 librarians (8 females) received three phase training to build capacity and knowledge in basic library skills together with human rights and gender. 594 human rights and law books/booklets were donated to libraries of the partner universities and libraries at the National University of Management, the Centre for Khmer Studies and Future Forum. Beside the above-mentioned results, there were results of other activities that were not summarized here. For this output, RWI assessed that all expected outputs were achieved and that the targeted librarians increased their knowledge in library management as well as on the topics of human rights and gender. 

Output 5: Increased opportunities among representatives of academic institutions, public institution and civil society actors to be involved in joint human rights and gender equality initiatives 

A round table meetings with all RWI partner universities plus the National University of Management was held on Clinical Legal Education. Moverover, RWI reported that the members of the Young Female in Legal Professions Network have supported the dissemination of scholarships and importance of education for women.

More importantly, an assessment on PUC&apos;s performance was externally conducted by an external consultant and the findings from the assessment will be used as a tool to improve PUC&apos;s performance and strengthen the bilateral cooperation. 

For this output, the expected outputs were only partially achieved due to restrictions of Covid-19.</narrative>
