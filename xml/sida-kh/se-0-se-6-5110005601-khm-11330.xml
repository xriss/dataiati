    <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Academy of Culinary Arts Cambodia was established in 2013 with support from Sida and the UN-WTO organisation EIF (Enhanced Integrated Framework for Trade) as a vocational training institute of international quality standard. The original concept was created in discussions between the Swiss development cooperation &#x2013; SDC &#x2013; representatives from the hospitality industry in Cambodia and the Shift 360 Foundation. Sida originally came on board as a financier as partner to SDC. Due to shifts in the SDC&#x2019;s stance the Swiss withdrew their projected support very late in the preparation process. As the preparations were well underway Sida and EIF decided to continue with their respective contributions. 
The actual process of establishing the ACAC took much longer time than anticipated in the original plan and proposal. The two main reasons for this were, a) the reluctance two out of five key stakeholder ministries to participate in the Public-Private-Partnership (PPP) concept of ACAC; b) the unforeseen condition of the building intended for the Academy.
In the structure of governance and relations between training and economic development the Ministry of Tourism (MoT) and the Ministry of Labour and Vocation Training (MoLVT) are the two ministries that should be the main counterparts and government stakeholders in the establishment of the ACAC as a key training institute for the hospitality sector in Cambodia. However, the MoLVT did early on in the process indicate lack of interest unless the ACAC would be incorporated directly into the vocational training system of the ministry. That would have been contrary to the raison d&apos;&#xEA;tre of the ACAC as a public-private-partnership (PPP) with close relations to the private sector stakeholders in the industry.
Although officially supportive the MoT in reality was for a long time more of a hindrance than promoter of ACAC. An important reason was the resistance to accepting PPP as a governing and organisational principal of the Academy. PPP in education and skills training is a new concept in Cambodia and is seen by many ministerial stakeholders as a threat to control and income.
The resistance from MoLVT and MoT created unforeseen delays and put extra burden on the implementing partner.
Three other ministries have on the other hand been very supportive and have been instrumental in the establishing the ACAC. These are Ministry of Commerce (MoC), Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports (MoEYS) and the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF).
To govern the Academy, a Board of Governance was formed with a Prakas from the MoT with three representatives from the public sector, three representations from the private sector and Shift 360 (seven members in total).
The building for the Academy was secured free of charge for the first five years through a philanthropist within the private sector. However, the building needed refurbishment and had to be equipped with all the necessary furniture and kitchen equipment to provide a safe environment where quality education for students would be guaranteed. The refurbishment of the building was accomplished by the 3rd quarter of 2016 and the installation of kitchen equipment and classrooms was completed in the following quarter. Since the inception of the project, Shift360 acquired the partnership of Swiss Hotel Management Academy Lucerne (SHL) as the technical partner for the development of the curriculum for the 2-year diploma program, and to administer the quality assurance of the program and issue the Swiss certification.
In March of 2017, the Academy enrolled its first cohort of 29 students (17 females; 12 males, and three international students) in the 2-year culinary diploma program. In this cohort, one student received a scholarship. The second intake of students took place in September of 2017 (29 females; 22 males, and 4 international students). In this cohort, seven students were awarded scholarships.
Staff and faculty were gradually employed as the number of students increased. By the end of 2017, there are 23 staff employed, including administrative and supporting staff and faculty. Security for the building was outsourced to G-FORCE.
The curriculum for the 2-year diploma program is approved and accredited by SHL and ASEAN through the MoT.
Six short-term courses and five up-skill training courses for industry professionals and non-professionals was created.
Public sector contribution to the project was received only half way through the project through VAT exemption for imported products (ACAC still remains liable for other types of taxes), on invoices by the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MoEF), and covering the cost for the transformer by MoEYS. Support from the private sector did not materialize in 2017, with the exemption of providing internship places for ACAC students.
The lack of a clear framework of a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) in Cambodia and the diversity of Ministries potentially involved in the project makes it challenging to clearly designate and understand roles and responsibilities. Arranging regular Board meetings that suit all parties proved to be difficult and did not materialize as originally intended. The ACAC Board needs to meet more regularly to encourage more active private sector participation. Through the end of 2017, only four meetings were organised.
Working relationships with the multiple relevant line ministries continue to develop positively and the government is providing in kind contributions, including tax exemption on imported equipment and the provision of the 400KVA transformer. Tax issues remain a challenge; the issue is very complex because of the multiple layers of offices that are involved and their lack of understanding of the nature of the project. KPMG was engaged to resolve these issues and additional large and unbudgeted consultancy fees had to be absorbed.
Even while the private sector is desperate for trained professionals in all areas of hospitality, its remains hesitant to invest in the training of their staff, fearing that their staff will resign and get better paid jobs once they have gone through the training.
Employment of Cambodian staff in key positions, especially faculty, to deliver the quality education expected by SHL also proved to be too optimistic. ACAC had to hire several expatriate faculty to ensure the quality of the program, thus affecting the salary budget with higher costs than anticipated. The budget allocation for the marketing of the academy at $14,400 for two years is not sufficient to develop an effective marketing strategy for a start-up business. The budget had to be drawn from other budget lines to develop operative marketing strategies. Marketing activities were executed respectively as detailed in this report.
The perception of the culinary profession within Cambodian society is low. This is assessed as a long-term behaviour change issue to which the project can contribute as future graduates realize the potential for senior management positions in the hospitality, both in Cambodia and overseas.
In May 2017, Shift360 formally launched The Naomi Tami Memorial Scholarship Fund for economically disadvantaged students and marginalised youth. The fund aims to provide scholarships to students with the possibility to enrol at the ACAC for the 2-year diploma program. By the end of 2017 the memorial fund has reached around $60,000. This will provide 15 scholarships. This upholds the goals and objectives of the ACAC to provide high-level education for underprivileged Cambodians. There are presently 8 students enrolled who have received a scholarship through this fund.</narrative>
