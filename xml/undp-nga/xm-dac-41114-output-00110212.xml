       <narrative xml:lang="EN">i)	Improved Women Participation in Politics and Elections:

Women active participation in party politics and elections has not recorded marked improvement in the recent electoral cycles in Nigeria.  This activity was, therefore, planned and implemented to boost women participation in politics and elections through increased publicity and training.  To achieve the result 4 national Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) were identified through a competitive process and provided grants to use social media and modern technology to promote women leadership and candidatures in party politics.  In all, over 400 women vying for various political offices were supported in 9 states.  

-Furthermore, in response to the persistent reduction of women in elective and appointive offices, UNDP engaged with Women Parliamentarians and the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) during the reporting period to plan a strategy for reversing the trend.  The effort resulted into the establishment of a platform for media engagement gender parity in politics and the drafting of a Bill titled &#x201C;Women Participation in Elections Support (WOPELS) Bill&#x201D; which has passed through 1st Reading in the National Assembly.

ii)	Enhanced Violent Free Elections:

a.	High-Level Stakeholders&#x2019; Dialogue: Promotion of violent free elections before, during and after the 2018 isolated gubernatorial elections in Ekiti and Osun states and the 2019 general elections in Nigeria was accentuated during the reporting period.  Two sessions of high-level stakeholders&#x2019; dialogue were organized for stakeholders in Ekiti and Osun states and the South West Nigeria.  The dialogues helped to build the capacities of the stakeholders, sensitized and encouraged them to propagate peace and harmony in their respective domains.  The participants were clustered into Networks &#x2013; Multi-stakeholders Network - by states and enjoined to partners for peaceful and violent free elections in their respective states.  The stakeholders that participated in these dialogues included the Governors and other political office holders, INEC, National Orientation Agency (NOA), security agencies (armed forces, police, NSCDC, Prisons, DSS), traditional rulers, political parties, IPAC, Academic, CSOs, religious leaders, youth and women groups, NULGE, professional bodies, trade unions, and market women/men.

The dialogue sessions helped to stimulate discussions on imperative of peaceful elections and proffered credible and lasting solutions that would improve the electioneering processes in Nigeria.  The &#x2018;Multi-stakeholders&#x2019; Network&#x2019; formed at the end of the sessions embarked on intensive programmes to sensitize and create awareness on the imperative of peaceful elections and national stability using various mechanisms - social media, radio and television programmes series, advocacy visits, rallies and town hall meetings.


		
b.	Conflict Sensitive Reportage: The contribution of media organizations and practitioners to inform and support national development is significant.  Therefore, imperative to periodically implement activities that will build and strengthen its capacity for peace reportage.  UNDP organized two workshops to build and strengthen the capacities of media practitioners and journalist in the North Central and South West in the run up to the 2018 isolated gubernatorial elections in Ekiti and Osun states and the 2019 general elections in Nigeria.  Over 300 media practitioners and journalists across over 200 media organizations in 12 states and the Federal Capital Territory were trained on conflict sensitive reportage.  The participants at the workshops were organized into a network &#x2013; &#x2018;Conflict Sensitive Reportage (CSR) Network&#x2019;  in each state to step down the training in their respective media houses and to also form vanguard against conflict induced headlines/captions.Substantial achievements were recorded by these networks through various approaches including social media, advocacy visits, sensitization and awareness programmes on radios and televisions to propagate the message of peace before, during and after the electioneering periods.  The networks interlinked one another across the states to promote the culture of conflict sensitive reportage, objective and balance reportage, tolerance and to cross fertilize ideas among themselves.  The networks believed that they contributed immensely to the peaceful conduct of the 2018 isolated gubernatorial elections and the 2019 general elections in Nigeria.

 	
iii)	Increased Citizens&#x2019; Participation in Elections:

Series of related activities including technical support to INEC, voter education and voter campaigns and social engagement to ensure mass participation and credible election outcomes were implemented during the period under review, to cover isolated elections in Ekiti and Osun States, as well as, the 2019 general elections.  Over 10 million population were reached in 12 states within the reporting period. 

a)	Election Management and Support Platform: UNDP supported INEC to training its Directors and technical staff on the Election Management and Support Platform.  The assistance helped INEC management and technical staff to understand the operation, management and utilization of the platform to boost free, fair and credible elections in Nigeria. 
b)	Deployment of innovative technology software &#x2018;Election Spy&#x2019;: to capture and report real time incidence around the elections to detect and report early warning signals that could hinder smooth elections including violence. The technology enables the local observers to capture and report election related situations using mobile device or internet while simultaneously creating a real time geospatial archive of events. It is a useful software for social activism, public engagement, early warning signs mitigation and election accountability in Nigeria. The deployment and the use of the Apps helped identification and mitigation of election warning signals and timely prevention measures taken by the security agencies.
c)	Training and Deployment of Election Observers: UNDP supported the training and deployment of 150 observers towards the 2018 isolated gubernatorial elections in Ekiti Osun states. It also supported National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) to deploy 953 observations towards the 2019 general elections.  The observers were deployed into 464 LGAs identified hotspots in the 36 states inclusive of 4 LGAs in the isolated gubernatorial elections in Ekiti and Osun states and 1,050 Polling Units (PUs). The report of the observers was analyzed and presented to INEC and other relevant MDAs for action.
d)	Voter Education and Voter Campaigns: UNDP supported the production and dissemination of information, education and communication (IEC) materials for voter campaigns and voter education in the isolated gubernatorial elections in Ekiti and Osun states, as well as, for the 2019 general elections in Nigeria.  In all around 800 radio jingles and 200 television advertisements were aired while 12,000 posters were produced and distributed.  Series of radio and television talk shows and call-in programmes were sponsored.  The jingles were produced and aired in English, Yoruba, Hausa, Ibo and Pidgin languages.</narrative>
