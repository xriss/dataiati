   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Improving education through Non-Formal Primary Education and Education Support Activity in Sittwe Township, Rakhine</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Sittwe Township has been seriously and badly affected due to 2012 conflict. The deterioration of the situation is very serious in key sectors such as education, health care, etc. MRF Education Team conducted data assessment in Sittwe Township in four villages: Lat Ma Chay, Maw La Wei Chan, Kone Saung 1 and Kone Saung 2. According to the collected data on those villages in December 2015, out of a population of 2,590 people, 46.53% (1205 people) is illiterate. 
Moreover, there is only one government primary school, situated in Lat Ma Chay..Some children from other villages come there for their schooling and some go to school in other villages. The distance between the village and the school is about 2 mile far. There is no school in Maw La Wei Chan village, Kone Saung (1) village, and Kone Saung (2) village. As a result, most of the children from these villages do not learn or only few children go to school.
Since the illiteracy rate is high in these villages (average 46.53%), they need a lot of helps for their education. As the majority of parents and youth are also illiterate and jobless, Non Formal Primary Education (NFPE) program for out-of-school children and awareness activities for parents are needed, including specific actions with education development committee members, vocational training and Education Support  Activities. This NFPE project intends to respond to humanitarian needs in education sectors, as well as, set up the basis of a sustainable development for the project area.
Non Formal Primary Education and education support activity will be initiated in these four villages in Sittwe Township under supervision of Myittar Resource Foundation after the grant accepted. This emergency education program will provide opportunity to out-of-school children aged 10 to 14 years.This project is the part  of emergency education program and therefore it will implement only basic literacy during 9 month emergency project.
MEC/Save the Children and their partners are currently implementing NFPE and they used NFPE Module developed by Myanmar Literacy Resource Center. Their NFPE Activity includes Income Generation Activity/ Education Support Activity, because most NFPE students are child workers and out of school children and they are working for their family income. If they attend the class they do not have income for their family. Therefore, vocational training and education support   activity is essential for NFPE students to attend NFPE program.  MRF intends to conduct 9 months NFPE program and this is only initial stage and it will conduct ongoing process if the grant accepted form any donors. 

The following activities will be conducted under this education development program during  9 months:
Component    1:   Baseline data collection, analysis and documentation                      
Component    2:   Conducting  meeting and setting up  Education Development Committee
