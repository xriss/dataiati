   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Backward Society Education (BASE) has been implementing DFID funded project titled Nepal Ex-Kamaiya Education and Poverty Alleviation Project (NEKEPA) Since January 2013. This project has been envisioned and implemented by BASE in partnership with World Vision Advocacy Forum (WVAF). The project is intervened in mid and far- western district namely Dang, Banke, Bardiya, Kailali and Kanchanpur of Nepal.
The project supports over 186,000 of Nepal&apos;s ex-kamaiya community (freed bonded labourers). In 2000, following peaceful civil society protests, the Government of Nepal abolished the kamaiya system but the ex-kamaiyas are extremely poor, without land or livelihoods. Almost 15% have not received their rehabilitation packages because most are unaware of their entitlements and because accessing them is obstructed by bureacracy, inefficiency and corruption. Un- and under-employment is high, with 69% experiencing income/food insecurity for at least nine months/year. Evidence suggests that 11% of children are out-of-school and likely to be in child labour. The project aims to support ex-kamaiyas to gain their entitlements, to mobilise them for savings and credit, and to provide vocational training. The ex-kamaiyas will increase their incomes and gain productive employment; children (with a focus on girls) will be supported to attend school and complete primary education.
