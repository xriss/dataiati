   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Febrile Illness Evaluation in a Broad Range of Endemicities (FIEBRE)</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Fever is one of the most common symptoms leading to health care seeking and hospital admission in sub-Saharan Africa and Asia. Until recently, most febrile illness in these regions has been attributed to malaria; however, with scale-up of point-of-care testing for malaria following the 2010 World Health Organization (WHO) recommendation to test before treating it has become clear that most febrile patients do not have malaria. Patients with confirmed cases of &#x2018;non-malarial fever&#x2019; are more likely to receive antimicrobial medicines, although not all cases require or respond to available antimicrobials. This could drive antimicrobial resistance, whilst having little impact on individual or population health. The ability to differentiate between infections that do and don&#x2019;t require antimicrobial treatment could greatly benefit public health. We have been funded for four years by the UK Department for International Development (DfID) to conduct a study called &#x201C;Febrile Illness Evaluation in a Broad Range of Endemicities (FIEBRE)&#x201D;. The FIEBRE study is led by researchers at LSHTM and our collaborators including partners at four sites in Africa (Malawi, Mozambique, and Zimbabwe) and Asia (Laos). 
The study will focus on detecting infections that are treatable and/or preventable. Point of care tests (POCT) for malaria and HIV, microscopy for malaria and other blood-borne pathogens, and blood cultures with susceptibility testing will be performed at the study sites for all participants. Serum, plasma, and red cell pellet will be separated on site before being shipped to LSHTM, together with nasopharyngeal swabs, for all participants; for a subset of participants at each site, an aliquot of whole blood in PAXgene tubes will also be shipped.</narrative>
