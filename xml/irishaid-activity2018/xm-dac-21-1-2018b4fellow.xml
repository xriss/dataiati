   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Fellowship Training Programme aims to strengthen the capacity of development partner organisations in countries benefiting from Irish Aid support through the provision of higher education study opportunities. Fellowships are offered for full time Postgraduate Diploma/Master&apos;s level study either in Ireland or in region and there is a particular emphasis on linking fellowship awards to the key priorities of Irish Aid&apos;s country strategies in our partner countries.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Fellowship Training is intended to support capacity building within identified organisations in those countries. Fellowship recipients are committed, on completion of their training, to return home to resume work and put their acquired skills into practice for the benefit of their home country. The Irish Council for International Students (ICOS) is an independent non-profit network of educational institutions, NGOs and individuals interested in international education and working with government and other agencies to promote good policies and best practice in relation to the recruitment, access and support of international students in Irish education. ICOS administers the main elements of the Fellowship Training Programme on Irish Aid&apos;s behalf. This includes the provision of various support services for fellowship holders. Work is underway on the establishment of country-based alumni networks which will further support the programmatic approach. In time, the alumni network will be complementary to existing Higher Education Institute networks and will build on existing Irish Aid networks already established through our Embassies/Missions.</narrative>
