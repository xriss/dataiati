   <narrative xml:lang="EN">While recent projects between the EC and the ILO focused on the identification of major trends in industrial relations and social policies in Europe since the financial and economic crisis and subsequent budgetary programmes, the aim of this project would be to replace such changes in a longer term perspective. What are the main transformations in the world of work over the last 20 years in terms of labour market, social dialogue, conditions of work, wages and incomes, how has the crisis accelerated or changed these trends and policy reforms, and what can be the expected effects on inequalities and on different income categories? All European countries have put in place a number of labour market reforms with the emergence of new forms of employment contracts that brought more flexibility but also less stability in the employment relationship. The balance between flexibility and security has thus evolved. Working conditions have also been affected. Collective bargaining coverage, mechanisms and contents have also been progressively transformed along the changes in the labour market, in working conditions and the evolving economic and social context. The roles of actors, in particular of workers&#x2019; and employers&#x2019; representatives, have also been challenged and transformed. The purpose of the project will be to document these trends while differentiating the eventual influence of the crisis and the new context it has generated (in terms of jobs&#x2019; prospects, youth unemployment, recent reforms). The aim will then to identify the effects of such transformation and trends. What are the effects of such transformations on inequalities? What forms of vulnerability may they have brought? What are the outcomes on the levels of employment and labour force participation? What are the categories most at risk in the long term while also integrating the particular effects of the recent crisis? Is there an extension of most vulnerable categories? Are there examples of such long term transformations with optimal outcomes in terms of flexibility-security balance and inequality and vulnerability at work? The reduction of inequalities was recently retained by the European Commission, the OECD and the ILO as an important policy target. Last ILO-EC project on the European Social Model has also emphasized an erosion of the middle class in Europe, something that may not only undermine the sustainability of the European Social Model, but also put at risk Europe&#x2019;s sustainable recovery. There seems to be a direct relationship between the growth of inequalities and polarization and the erosion of the middle class &#x2013;or on the reverse between the decline in inequalities and the expansion of the middle class&#x2013; a process that will be studied through mobility between income groups but also through specific case studies in European countries. One particular aim of this project will be to identify some best practices that may have emerged over most recent years. What countries did succeed to carry out the necessary reforms without generating further inequalities? What type of policy measures, institutions, and actors do play a determinant role? This project will also evaluate the outcome for &#x2013;and potential role of&#x2013; social partners and social dialogue, and directly contribute to the European Industrial Relations Report, which is precisely aiming at identifying some concrete effects of industrial relations trends. On the basis of such a comparative and comprehensive assessment of major developments at national level, policy issues will be discussed with the aim to carefully identify ways to carry out the necessary transformations without generating further inequalities and social exclusion.</narrative>
