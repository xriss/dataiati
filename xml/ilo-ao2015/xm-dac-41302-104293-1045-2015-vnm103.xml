  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The programme strategy for Phase II was designed under specific assumptions, most of them deriving from the experience of the BFC project. Its implementation in seven countries of different sizes and through various operative frameworks indicates that some strategic approaches need to be reviewed and adjusted in order to allow the Programme to maximize its potential and fully meet its objectives. Changes in the Programme approach and strategy have de facto been occurring to address emerging needs and realities in operating countries. Deliberate decisions have been taken in order to mainstream these ad hoc responses into a new comprehensive strategic framework for phase III. In accordance with its visions, over the next five years, Better Work aims to have a significant and direct impact through its own programmes in the garment sector and a wider, indirect impact through its influence, knowledge sharing and partnerships. In many respects Better Work&#x2019;s impact will be achieved by leveraging the comparative and combined strengths of the wider Better Work alliance which includes ILO, IFC, the constituents of government worker, employer and employer organizations and international buyers. In order to reach these goals, Better Work will be implementing a multi-pronged strategy over the next three-year period (July 2012-June 2015). This strategy is articulated around the following five strategic components: 1) Extending the scale of the Programme operations 2) Accelerating and demonstrating impact of services in participating factories 3) Playing a catalyst role in order to foster change in terms of strategies, practices and policies at various levels 4) Exerting a stronger influence over international brands and buyers to improve supply chain practices 5) Strengthening the governance and viability of its global and country operations</narrative>
