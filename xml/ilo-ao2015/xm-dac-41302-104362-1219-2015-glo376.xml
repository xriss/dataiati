   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The ILO and the Global Programme on Migration and Development (GPMD) of SDC share a common vision: enhancing access of migrant workers to decent work and dignified working conditions, compatible with labour market needs and through the effective protection of their rights. These goals can be advanced by disseminating good practices in the field that improve national and regional migration governance, and inform the global debates on migration and development with solid, evidence based knowledge. Specifically, ILO and SDC share a number of priorities and approaches to work on migration and development issues globally and in specific regions that suggest stronger collaboration: - Development policy and planning, including the post-2015 development agenda process, should incorporate migrant workers&#x2019; rights protection, labour market needs assessment to improve skills upscaling, recognition and jobs matching, and social protection, such as access to basic services and pension portability; evaluation of the impacts of immigration policies on development outcomes for migrant workers and the stronger engagement of workers and employers associations in such processes can improve the sustainability of development policies. - Employment policies at the national level should be harmonized with labour migration policies and international labour standards, and these considered in national strategies for development; sharing tools and best practices will be critical to facilitating the uptake of appropriate harmonization strategies at national and regional levels. - Regional integration process should more robustly engage workers and employers associations, migrant workers, and other stakeholders to ensure that policies related to migration and development more appropriately reflect and address the needs of migrant workers and their families, and that such policies are implemented in ways that can assure equitable, inclusive, and sustainable development. The proposed collaboration responds to both organisations objective to engage and operationalize a mutual learning process and advance the agenda forward in the area of labour migration by reinforcing the linkages and exchanges between national/regional initiatives and global processes and debates. Looking forward, this learning partnership will fill existing knowledge gaps, facilitate regular exchange of ideas and experiences, and foster sharing of good practices within the international community and for country- and regional-level projects on labour migration.</narrative>
