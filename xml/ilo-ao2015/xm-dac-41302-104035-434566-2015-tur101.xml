   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Elimination of Worst Forms of Child Labour in Seasonal Commercial Agriculture in Hazelnut Harvesting in Ordu</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The development objective of the project is to contribute to the elimination of the WFCL in seasonal commercial agriculture in line with the Government&#x2019;s strategy drawn by the National Time Bound Policy and Programme Framework (TBPPF) for the elimination of WFCL by 2015. The immediate objectives of the project are to enhance local capacity for the removal of children from the WFCL in seasonal commercial agriculture in hazelnut production in Ordu; to prevent at-risk children from entering such work through capacity building of public institutions linked to Ordu Governorate, Ordu Municipality, Ordu Chamber of Agriculture, local NGOs; and to develop monitoring models and partnerships including public/private partnerships (PPP). The project would ultimately develop a strategic intervention model which would in turn contribute to the policy making and effective implementation process for the elimination of WFCL in Turkey. Three outputs are envisaged within the project duration: Output 1/Capacity Building: The capacity of local institutions in Ordu has been improved in planning, managing, coordinating, monitoring and implementing activities for the elimination of WFCL in seasonal commercial agriculture in hazelnut production. Output 2/Direct Support: Effective withdrawal and prevention mechanism for the WFCL in seasonal commercial agriculture in hazelnut production has been established and implemented at the local level. Output 3/Awareness Raising: An awareness raising strategy has been developed and implemented towards general public, families, employers, intermediaries as well as the media. The project will run for 12 months and various activities have been planned so as to reach the above outputs. Under Output 1, the planned activities could be summarized as reviewing outcomes of the last harvesting season, establishment of a project implementation unit, establishment of central and local level steering committees, carrying out training needs analysis, preparation of training modules and materials, conducting and evaluating training programmes, organizing meetings with central and field level institutions and organizations to contribute to the development of strategic plans and a strategy document. Under Output 2, intensive activities are planned for withdrawal, prevention and protection of targeted children for the elimination of WFCL. All of the required education, guidance, counselling and rehabilitation services together with monitoring activities will be implemented in this phase. Training of families, intermediaries and village heads on hazards of child labour would be the complementary activities under this output. Under Output 3, the planned activities would focus on reporting and lessons learned for sustainability of the model to be developed while discussing possibilities of replicating it in other agricultural products and areas. Specific focus would be placed on awareness raising activities which involve distribution of outcomes of the project and organization of two campaigns at national and local levels.</narrative>
