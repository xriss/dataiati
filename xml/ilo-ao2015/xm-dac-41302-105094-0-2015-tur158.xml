  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project &#x2013; the first ILO OSH project in Turkey - was triggered by the Soma mining disaster on 14 May 2014 which took the lives of 301 miners. The project aims at facilitating the improvement of OSH in line with international commitments made, in particular, in the areas of mining and construction, in consultation with the tripartite constituents. Following up on the entry into force of Convention No. 187 in January 2015, an initial focus is to promote a preventative safety and health culture in Turkey, in particular in the areas of construction and mining, among the members of the tripartite National Occupational Health and Safety Council (NOHSC). The endeavours include creating a benchmark for progress related to the renewed efforts to improve OSH by mapping the current national OSH system in Turkey in a National Profile on OSH in line with the Promotional Framework for Occupational Safety and Health Recommendation, 2006 (No. 197), commissioning a study from the research institution Economic Policy Research Foundation of Turkey (TEPAV) on &#x201C;Contractual arrangements in the mining sector in Turkey: Forms, Extent, drivers, legal context, and impact on OSH&#x201D; which the outcomes to be discussed in the tripartite meeting, raising awareness on recording and notification of occupational accidents and diseases, commissioning studies on the compliance in national law and practice of Safety and Health in Construction Convention, 1988, (No. 167) and the Safety and Health in Mining Convention, 1995 (No. 176) which were ratified by Turkey on 23 March 2015, improving enforcement mechanism through labour inspection.</narrative>
