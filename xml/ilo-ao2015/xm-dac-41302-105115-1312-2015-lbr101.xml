   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project is a joint UNCT initiative, dealing with the multisectoral human insecurities in the most neglected counties of southeastern Liberia. The project provides concrete and sustainable benefits to the most marginalized groups of people (youth, women and children) in the target counties, who are threatened by high level of food insecurity, lack of basic social services such as water and sanitation and child protection, high rate of HIV/AIDS and SGBV, and highest level of poverty incidence. While comprehensively implementing top-down measures such as improving local governance and social cohesion of the four counties, as well as bottom-up measures through empowering the target people by various means, the project puts emphasis on local ownership and encourage participation from the stakeholders including local government officials, civil society groups, CBOs and NGOs. Throughout the project implementation, special attention will be given not only to the disabilities (as required by the Guidelines) but also to women, children, and youth, as they are the most neglected but critical groups of beneficiaries. In addition, due to the steady return to stability following the 2010 Ivorian refugee crisis, this pilot initiative is programmed also as one of the best tools to bridge the gaps between emergency assistance and medium- and longer-term development. In order to mitigate the potential of deterioration of the situation of human insecurities in the already most vulnerable and neglected region of Liberia, the people-centered, integrated, comprehensive and prevention oriented approach like this initiative is required to meet the multisectoral demands of their human security. Another strong rationale for funding from the UNTFHS is the fact that this type of holistic intervention is currently neglected by existing international development assistance to the southeastern region of Liberia without any funding mechanism available to support such an inter-agency cooperation. The value added of this inter-agency project under one umbrella maximizes synergies and ensures the significant benefit of this mechanism. In this regard, since the UNCT values the approach of human security concept for dealing with the current situation of southeastern Liberia, all the participating agencies will be committed to promote and showcase, to wider audience within and beyond the country of Liberia, the outcomes of this pilot initiative as a model human security project.</narrative>
