   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In the next three-year period (January 2013 &#x2013; December 2015), BFC will maintain its core assessment services in the garment sector while channelling more efforts and resources to address root causes of non-compliance practices, sustain changes, influence people&#x2019;s behaviour, address policy issues and thereby influence the country&#x2019;s labour envi-ronment in formal economies. To this end, BFC will be implementing a multi-pronged strategy. This strategy is articulated around the five components: 1. Expand the scale of BFC operations to cover the footwear sector and sub-contract factories in te garment sector; 2. Strengthen assessment/monitoring quality and broaden training and advisory service offerings with a view to focusing on impact of interventions; 3. Accelerate change and influence stakeholders&#x2019; behaviours; 4. Increase BFC&#x2019;s Financial viability as well as national constituents&#x2019; institutional sustainability, especially that of the RGC; 5. Governance and stakeholder ownership of Better Factories Cambodia has been maintained or improved.In the next three-year period (January 2013 &#x2013; December 2015), BFC will maintain its core assessment services in the garment sector while channelling more efforts and resources to address root causes of non-compliance practices, sustain changes, influence people&#x2019;s behaviour, address policy issues and thereby influence the country&#x2019;s labour envi-ronment in formal economies.
