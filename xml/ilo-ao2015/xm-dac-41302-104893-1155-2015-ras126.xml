   <narrative xml:lang="EN">With the booming economic growth in many countries across the Asia and Pacific region (AP), the availability of a highly skilled human resource base has become a crucial determinant of maintaining the growth for many countries. Under this circumstance, governments and other stakeholders are paying closer attention to developing the requisite technical capabilities through Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET), a primary instrument used to meet the labour market needs emerged from rapid technological changes and economic growth. In order to ensure the quality of TVET, it is critical to strengthen the quality assurance mechanism as it supports the quality status of TVET products, providers and systems, and provides a strong link between institutions and the needs of the labour market. The ILO has long recognized the importance of quality assurance and has therefore integrated it into the overarching framework of skills development in line with the ILO Recommendation concerning Human Resources Development: Education, Training and Lifelong Learning, 2004 (No. 195). The fundamental role of quality assurance in TVET system was also reflected in the ILC 2008 the Conclusion on Skills for improved productivity, employment growth and development which stated that the improvement of quality assurance &#x201C;will enhance the connection between skills development and productivity and employment growth in developing and developed countries.&#x201D; In this connection, the proposed theme for the ILO/Japan Skills Programme for 2014-15 (2014 Programme) is designed to respond to the need of improving the quality of TVET provision through the enhancement of the quality assurance mechanism. Through capacity building and knowledge sharing among participating countries on the adaptable approaches of quality assurance, the project aims to ensure that the provision of TVET is qualified and relevant to labor market needs and will contribute to the delivery of a sufficient quantity of skilled workers.</narrative>
