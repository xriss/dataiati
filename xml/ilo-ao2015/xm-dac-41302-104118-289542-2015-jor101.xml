Subsequently, this will contribute to the creation of sustainable enterprises and the creation of decent jobs. The ILO Know About Business programme will be tested and assessed as an entrepreneurship education curricula for young Jordanian women and men enrolled in vocational high schools and community colleges. Through the integration of entrepreneurship education the project will: 1. Create awareness of enterprises and self-employment as a career option for young people. 2. Provide knowledge and practice of the desirable attributes for and challenges in starting and operating a successful and sustainable enterprise which provides a decent work environment for its employees. 3. Facilitate the school to work transition as a result of a better understanding of functions and operations of enterprises. 4. Develop positive attitudes towards enterprises and self-employment among youth. The project will be implemented in partnership with the Business Development Center (BDC) who is the project donor and the project counterpart and under the umbrella of the Ministries of Education and Higher Education. BDC will pilot the KAB programme in selected community colleges and vocational high schools. Entrepreneurship and business skills taught in KAB will enable students to consider establishing a sustainable business using their acquired vocational skills. Upon completion of this pilot phase of KAB and based on the result achieved, the Ministries of Education and Higher Education will decide if the KAB programme can be nationalized. If so, the ILO will prepare the nationalization plan jointly with BDC based on which a second phase of the project will be formulated which would include the programme dissemination strategy, the capacity building of KAB National Key Facilitators and the training of additional teachers and instructors/professors to ensure an increased outreach and the sustainability of the KAB Programme.</narrative>
