   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) Reform in Bangladesh</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project aims to assist Bangladesh in reducing poverty through reforms of technical and vocational education and training (TVET) policies and systems so that more people can acquire employable skills and thus generate income through wage-earning jobs or self-employment. The rationale for the project stems from the national poverty reduction strategy (PRSP). The project is intended to contribute to the improvement of productivity in industry and services through better responding to their skills needs; to ensure rapid formation of the national human capital and improved employability of vocational education and training graduates; to enhance labour market participation, social inclusion and empowerment of disadvantaged groups &#x2013; the low literate youth, child labourers, women, and the rural communities. The project&#x2019;s logic and activities follow the requirements of the National Strategy for Accelerated Poverty Reduction (PRSP) in the areas of TVET. The productivity and competitiveness in the private sector will be improved through: producing TVET graduates with the skills and competencies that better match the needs of the economy, advice and participation of industry in strengthening TVET and establishing public-private partnerships, and support to the skills development and workplace learning in the private sector. TVET policies and systems will be made more responsive to the needs of the private sector and will deliver the market-oriented skills with better employability. Building of the human capital will be ensured through institutional strengthening of the technical and vocational education and training system, its major technical support services such as course and qualifications development, and the quality assurance system; new vocational qualifications and courses will be developed and provided with training equipment and learning resources; teachers will be upgraded in teaching and occupational areas; the managerial and operational capabilities of the public and private training providers will be upgraded. The disadvantaged groups will be empowered in the labour market through the development of qualifications for people who lack literacy, recognition of skills acquired on the job, and skills training for income-generating activities in communities. The project will therefore significantly contribute to the national &#x201C;pro-poor&#x201D; growth strategy.</narrative>
