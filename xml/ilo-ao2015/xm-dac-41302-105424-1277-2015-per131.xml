   <narrative xml:lang="EN">OUTCOME 1: INCREASED KNOWLEDGE, AWARENESS, AND IMPLEMENTATION OF THE FORCED LABOR PROTOCOL Ratification of the Protocol by ILO member states is an essential step towards securing the rights embodied in the Protocol. This is a process that requires strong public support to work with governments to make the fight against forced labor a priority. It is crucial to build such support through materials that clearly explain the scope and application of the Protocol and Recommendation. A cornerstone of ILO&#x2019;s activities towards ratification will be a campaign called &#x201C;50forFreedom&#x201D; which aims to achieve at least 50 ratifications by 2018. OUTCOME 2: ILO CONSTITUENTS HAVE IMPROVED EVIDENCE-BASED AND RESPONSIVE NATIONAL POLICIES AND ACTION PLANS ON FORCED LABOR WITH STRONG IMPLEMENTATION, MONITORING, AND ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS A national plan of action against forced labor and related practices should include, at a minimum: research and data to identify target groups and the main forms of forced labor; analysis of the legal framework and any gaps; enforcement strategies and other interventions relating to prevention, protection, and remedies (including prosecution); coordination among stakeholders and institutions; and a monitoring and evaluation framework. OUTCOME 3: INCREASED AND ENHANCED EFFORTS TO COLLECT RELIABLE NATIONAL STATISTICS IN ORDER TO CARRY OUT RESEARCH AND SHARE KNOWLEDGE ACROSS INSTITUTIONS AT NATIONAL, REGIONAL, AND GLOBAL LEVELS Data collection and analysis lie at the heart of sustainable and evidence-based action to combat forced labor. Reliable statistics are essential to understand the nature and extent of the problem, including its causes and consequences, and to inform policy-makers and other stakeholders involved in action against forced labor. Regular data collection also enables the assessment of progress and impact of the implementation of policy, action plans, and specific programs and projects to eradicate forced labor. OUTCOME 4: STRENGTHENED WORKER AND EMPLOYER ORGANIZATIONS TO SUPPORT THE FIGHT AGAINST FORCED LABOR IN COLLABORATION WITH OTHER INTERESTED PARTIES The new Protocol and Recommendation provide an important opportunity for further engagement of workers and employers in action against forced labor. The preamble of the Protocol notes, for example, that an increased number of workers are in forced labor in the private economy; and that effective and sustained suppression of forced labor contributes to ensuring fair competition among employers as well as protection for workers. The Protocol also ensures that employers&#x2019; and workers&#x2019; organizations are consulted on national action plans and policies on forced labor. OUTCOME 5: STRENTHENED AWARENESS AND LIVELIHOODS PROGRAMS TO PREVENT FORCED LABOR AND TO PROVIDE VICTIMS WITH ACCESS TO REMEDIES This outcome will support national and local governments and other key partners in Mauritania, Nepal, and Peru to implement prevention and remedy-related interventions in source communities. This will include efforts to sensitize local populations on the relationship between discrimination and forced labor and will pilot outreach programs in affected areas. It will also offer and/or evaluate livelihoods and education programs for people at risk and victims of forced labor with a special emphasis on ethnic minorities and children. The project will support integrated community-based prevention programs in partnership with governments, social partners, and other concerned groups. To reduce vulnerability of to forced labor, these programs will include components on awareness-raising and livelihoods, including through skills training.</narrative>
