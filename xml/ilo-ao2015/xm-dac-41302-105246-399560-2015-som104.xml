  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In Somalia women play as significant role in agriculture and food production and household food security both in paid and unpaid labour, constituting to 50% of women in total labour engagement. The number of women household&#x2019;s in Somalia has increased due to increased insecurity and male migration. Extension services especially designed to target women farmers are limited in the region with little or no training in entrepreneurial income generating activities such as production, agro industries, access to finance and protection. The action will therefore support women&#x2019;s economic empowerment as part of the development agenda attaining decent work. Empowering women economically through development of their entrepreneurship and business skills makes a strong contribution to achieving the third MDG on promoting gender equality and empowering women. The project also promotes women&#x2019;s ability and well-being while reducing household poverty, increasing growth and productivity. Women need to be prioritized as agents, rather than just beneficiaries of economic intervention and there is increasing acknowledgment that eco&#xAC;nomically empowering women is essential to realising women&#x2019;s rights and to achieve broader development goals such as economic growth, as well as poverty reduction. In the last few years, the ILO Somalia programme has been com&#xAC;mitted to the goal of women&#x2019;s economic empowerment, economically empowering women as a win-win situation benefiting not only women, but society as a whole. Overall Objective: Enhancing women entrepreneurial skills This will be achieved through interventions such as the equipping of women, entrepreneurial skills training in alternative sectors, resources to compete in markets and to have fair access to economic institutions. The project will also support women&#x2019;s voices and representation Women will be empowered and will be able to make and act on decisions, control resources and profits, have better access to markets, grow their businesses, employ more people, generate sustainable and better incomes.</narrative>
