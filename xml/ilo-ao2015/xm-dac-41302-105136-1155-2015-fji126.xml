   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The development objective of the project is reduced unemployment, underemployment and subsistence activities in Fiji, while its immediate objective is a strengthened job information service in Fiji. In support of the development and immediate objective, the key outputs under the project include: 1. A data-driven robust employment projections model to identify occupations and sectors most likely to grow in the medium-term future. A data-driven approach provides a common reality grounded in facts instead of perceptions. The model will be housed and maintained by MSPNDS and will rely on data from the various Population Censuses, various Employment and Unemployment Surveys, various Household Income and Expenditure surveys, and other establishment surveys. The model will build upon a previous Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model developed for Fiji developed by MSPNDS to include labour market variables and analysis. This quantitative approach will be paired with a qualitative approach, including discussions with the social partners as well as other experts to revise and validate the results; 2. &#x201C;Outlooks&#x201D; of a range of occupations, which carefully integrate gender concerns, developed in collaboration with the NEC of MLIRE, Fiji Ministry of Education, the Fiji Higher Education Commission and the social partners. Following the availability of the validated employment projections results, occupational outlooks will be developed that contain information useful to jobseekers in making career choices and to students planning their course of study, such as on the future employment prospects of the a specific occupation, the most common level of educational attainment in the occupation, share of women in the occupation, average earnings and working hours in the occupation, and other information, all contextualized to the average of all occupations (Box 1 provides an example of a possible occupational outlook in the case of accountants). The occupational outlooks, which will contain also the methodology, will also be shared within the ILO and with external partners to support knowledge-sharing.</narrative>
