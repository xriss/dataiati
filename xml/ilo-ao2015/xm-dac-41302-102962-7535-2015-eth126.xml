   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The joint programme is designed with the aim to contribute to the realization of the gender outcome within the UNDAF &#x201C;Women&#x2019;s empowerment, gender equality and children&#x2019;s rights promoted and strengthened&#x201D;. The ILO assumed leadership on the output &#x201C;Increased accessibility of financial and non-financial services to economically disadvantaged women&#x201D;. The output attempts to address the most critical gaps and concern areas identified with regard to economic empowerment of women. Economic empowerment is expected not only to directly improve the livelihoods of women, but also critically contribute to improving the overall position of women in their day-to-day life, including the realization of their rights. The principal outputs of this outcome focus on: Strengthening the capacity of institutions providing financial and non-financial services to support women&#x2019;s economic empowerment; providing accessible and affordable financial services to aspiring women entrepreneurs; enhance competitiveness and profitability of female-owned businesses. The joint programme will be implemented in close collaboration with governmental sectoral bureaus as well as other institutions providing financial and non-financial services to women. It will benefit from the existing experiences of the various interventions and initiatives being undertaken by different institutions and partners. While most interventions provide direct support (through training services, availing credits, etc.) a few activities are indirect by nature in that they are designed to strengthen the institutions which play a mediating role. A specific focus across all the different related activities will be to support to economically and socially disadvantaged women.</narrative>
