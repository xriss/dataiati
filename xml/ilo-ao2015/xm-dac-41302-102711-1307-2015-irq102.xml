   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Promoting civic values and life skills for adolescents through education in Iraq</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The original UNFPA programme aims at strengthening the institutional and human capacity of the Education Sector in Iraq to deliver quality education through the promotion of civic values and life skills among education providers, public sector managers/decision makers/legislators and young people (age group 12-19). The promotion of civic values and life skills among the targeted beneficiaries is expected to facilitate and improve the access to education of vulnerable and marginalized groups, as well as enhance youth personal and social skills, which would place them on a better footing and enable them to pursue their own educational, cultural and later on career development schemes. This would allow an increase in personal income, improve welfare and help reduce poverty rates. Significantly, life skills activities will be geared towards assisting young people to contribute to their own protection from abuse and exploitation. The programme will be implemented in partnership with the central Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs, the Ministry of Human Rights, the Ministry of Youth and Sports, as well as with the KRG Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Social Affairs, the Ministry of Human Rights and the Ministry of Sports and Youth. It will contribute to Human development and Human Security through the development and dissemination of new educational materials and encouraging life-long professional development of educational staff, and will be implemented in line with the framework set by the National Education Strategy. The envisioned capacity building activities will be based on a strong institutional analytical component which will lead to the development of a specific action plan for promoting civic values and life skills on the national level. Specific educational, training and awareness raising material and curricula will be developed in the prospect of promoting civic values within different governorates, pilot schools and institutions, that serve to reinforce a sense of &#x201C;national identity&#x201D;, citizenship and promote human rights - including gender equality - in Iraq. The ILO will use the contribution to provide technical, operational and programmatic assistance to the UNFPA to achieve the outcome of the project: Capacity building of the formal education system to integrate life skills, health life styles, and gender equality into curricular activities in the schools and the vocational centres operating under the Ministry of Labour and Social affairs, the Vocational Education Schools and the Ministry of Education both at the central Government and in the Kurdistan region. The set of activities the ILO will undertaken is detailed in Annex I TOR in relation to its component in collaboration with UNFPA, and building on ILO&#x2019;s operational strategy with both MOE and MOLSA, and to ensure stronger linkage of UNFPA life Skills programme with ILO&#x2019;S KAB and CBT packages which the ILO has been working on within the context of the two projects: Skills Development for Employment Generation in Iraq, and Technical Vocational Education Training funded by the UNDG Iraq Trust Fund. The project site will be Amman. The project includes attention to gender equality. The project duration is one year.</narrative>
