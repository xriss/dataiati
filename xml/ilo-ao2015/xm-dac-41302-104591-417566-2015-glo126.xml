  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In June 2010 at the Toronto Summit the G20 leaders welcomed the G20 Training Strategy for a Skilled Workforce for Strong, Sustainable and Balanced Growth developed by the International Labour Organization (ILO). In preparing this strategy the ILO worked closely with employers and workers, consulted other international organizations, and drew on the Conclusions on skills for improved productivity, employment growth and development adopted by the International Labour Conference in June 2008. In Seoul, in November 2010, Leaders pledged to support developing countries in implementing national strategies on skills for employment, building on the G20 Training Strategy This proposal is a response to interest indicated by the Russian Federation to work with the ILO in supporting the application of the G20 Training Strategy to the skills development and employment needs in a range of countries. The initiative will be implemented in line with Concept of Russia&#x2019;s Participation in International Development Assistance. The overall objective is to develop the capabilities of each country to improve their training delivery systems, extend better training to those who need it most, and thereby contribute to each country&#x2019;s competitiveness and economic growth. The project focuses on improving the delivery of demand-led training in the formal technical and vocational education and training system (TVET). Specific interventions in trade related economic sectors to identify skills needs, and development of new methods of skills foresight in economic sectors whose skills needs are significantly affected by technological change will complement the activities. The national components will target Armenia, Jordan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Viet Nam. The sub-regional component will focus on capacity building in these countries based on the exchange of experiences and good practices between the project countries, as well as the global community of relevant researchers working on foresight of skills.</narrative>
