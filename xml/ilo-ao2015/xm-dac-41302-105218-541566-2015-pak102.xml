   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Executive Summary Global Component a. To increase Stora Enso&#x2019;s capacity to effectively align global policy and practice with relevant international labour standards. The first step toward achieving this objective is the identification and review of Stora Enso&#x2019;s relevant internal policies. Stora Enso and the ILO will jointly determine whether further complementary research would be required specifically on the alignment of Stora Enso&#x2019;s global policies and practices with fundamental international labour standards. Should complementary research be deemed necessary, documents for review would include all reference material aimed at guiding the actions of Stora Enso with respect to the prevention, identification, mitigation and remediation of child labour; as well as to the other mutually supportive enabling rights that contribute to the elimination of child labour: This documentation would be reviewed against the context, content and intent of the relevant international labour standards, the ILO Multinational Enterprises Declaration and the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. In addition, interviews would be conducted across all relevant business units to gain an understanding of how labour rights policies are put into practice. Following this review, the ILO would produce a detailed report on the alignment of Stora Enso&#x2019;s global policies and practices with fundamental international labour standards. The ILO will then create and deliver a training programme for relevant SE staff, including management and workers and their representatives, drawing on the findings of the research and geared toward the strengthening and implementation of a robust management system that is aligned with fundamental international labour standards. b. To increase Stora Enso&#x2019;s knowledge base of the effect on the use of child labour and other FPRW violations of socio-economic and legislative context of countries in which it operates. The first proposed activity to increase Stora Enso&#x2019;s knowledge base in this area will be to conduct high-level desk reviews of selected countries and sub-sectors in which Stora Enso operates. The second activity will be in-depth research into labour rights and socio-economic conditions in selected sub-sectors in the Stora Enso supply chain. The proposed in-depth research will provide valuable information for Stora Enso and concrete recommendations on how Stora Enso can put its policies regarding human and labour rights into practice while taking into consideration varying local socio-economic and legal conditions in sourcing countries. 3.2 Pakistan component a. Baseline Study to identify decent work deficits in BSP Value Chain and clarify SE&#x2019;s and BSP&#x2019;s responsibilities A comprehensive study will be designed and implemented, in consultation with the social partners, and with ILO technical support, to assess the decent work deficits in the entire value chain of BSP in Pakistan and to do a precise mapping of the value chain. The study will help define the scope of future collaboration between the ILO and SE. Drawing on this research and the HR assessments done for SE, the ILO will help SE and BSP determine their respective responsibilities in accordance with the applicable standards of the ILO and the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. The findings of the study will be treated as confidential business information relating to BSP operations. Any public communication of the findings of the study will be done only with BSP consent and approval. b. Orientation and sensitization of BSP Management and workers and their representatives on dividends of decent work In parallel with the study, a series of orientation sessions would be prepared and implemented for all relevant management, workers and their representatives of BSP, and trainers of trainers on the relation between decent work and increased productivity, sustainability of enterprises and enhanced reputation.
