  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project will further support and extend the ongoing rural employment work in Sekong Province and expand activities to one additional district in Savannakhet Province. It will further strengthen partnerships with national and local agencies. The project will work at national, provincial/district and village level. Strengthening of capacity at local level to promote rural employment strategies for poverty reduction is a main aim. The project will work through local partners to strengthen such capacity in the process of implementing activities. Counterparts will be trained in various activities and time will be allocated for local partners to be able to contribute and absorb the new technologies and tools. The capacity of local partners basically will set the implementation pace for the project. At national level the aim is to influence and shape national policies and programmes and to include rural employment promotion strategies and create safety nets for the rural poor. Good progress has been made in partnerships with the MoLSW and PRF/RD and the project will further support and strengthen these partnerships. The latter is the biggest community development and investment programme in the country and has expressed interest in working with ILO to integrate rural employment strategies into their programme. This collaboration will start with joint work in a newly selected pilot district under this project. At village level activities to improve village assets, skills, value chains and create better working conditions have started and will be continued under this project. Various activities have been completed (gender training, entrepreneurship training, mushroom training, motorcycle repair training) but more work and follow-up is needed and new activities to promote employment for poverty reduction will be identified and supported.</narrative>
