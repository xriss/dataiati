   <narrative xml:lang="EN">WED-EE phase II will build on the achievements of WED-EE Phase I and use the infrastructure and delivery mechanism in place as well as the new partnerships that were forged. Phase II of WED-EE aims to serve at least 2,100 women entrepreneurs with business development services that should result in the creation at least 150 new businesses by women in Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda. At least 30% of the enterprises reached will be located in rural areas, and at least 30% of the women entrepreneurs served will be young women. The three outcomes of the project are: (a) women-led businesses increase their business perfomance, (b) selected policies and programmes are reviewed by policy makers to mainstream women&#x2019;s entrepreneurship development, and (c) selected ILO-WED tools and approaches are made available beyond the project&#x2019;s lifespan.The project combines country components with a global product and links to Outcome 3: Sustainable enterprises create productive and decent jobs, with the expected impact of &#x2018;more women-led businesses contribute to job creation, economic growth and gender equality&#x2019;, which is the development objective of WED-EE phase II. To achieve the stated objectives, the following outputs will be delivered: &#x2022; Non-financial service providers&#x2019; capacity to provide business services to women entrepreneurs is strengthened and accredited. &#x2022; Financial service providers&#x2019; outreach to women entrepreneurs is increased. &#x2022; WED-EE partners&#x2019; capacity is strengthened to link women entrepreneurs to national and regional markets. &#x2022; Action plans on WED developed with constituents and other stakeholders, based on WED Assessments. &#x2022; WED-EE advocacy partners&#x2019; capacity strengthened to advocate and lobby for priority WED assessment recommendations. &#x2022; National sustainability action plans are developed for replication of select ILO-WED tools and approaches. &#x2022; ILO-WED tools enhanced with videos and audio to support trainers and their outreach. &#x2022; Policy briefs for advocacy, formalization and men&#x2019;s involvement in WED initiatives are developed and shared with WED-EE constituents, partners and stakeholders.</narrative>
