   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Northern Cebu and Tacloban With limited funding and the local needs for continuing assistance, the geographical focus will be in Region 7 and Region 8. This focus also coincides with the Government National Rehabilitation and Recovery Framework and Plan for Business and Livelihoods (hereafter &#x201C;the National Plan&#x201D;). All of these regions also have significant potential in further economic development in the identified industry focuses where the ILO&#x2019;s comparative advantages can be maximized as below. ILO will continue to work with victims of Haiyan in Coron, Region 4B, with funding from different donors. Background On November 8, 2013 Typhoon Haiyan devastated the Philippines: cities, towns and communities across the Visayas region were destroyed; roads blocked, and airports and seaports impaired; water supply and power were cut, with much of the food stocks destroyed. In addition to the immediate humanitarian crisis, the disaster left 6 million people stripped of their primary sources of income overnight; 2.6 million of these were in vulnerable employment before the typhoon hit, living at or near the poverty line. One year on over 160,000 vulnerable workers have been assisted through short-term and immediate emergency employment for debris clearing and minor repairs. Over 166,000 individuals benefited from skills training and enterprise development support. Many roads and irrigation systems have been cleared and some public infrastructure has been restored. The magnitude of the work to be done on livelihood recovery and sustainable development continues. Providing immediate sources of income is not enough. Workers need long term employment opportunities with at least minimum wages, safe work environments, social security and heath and insurance coverage to ensure sustainable livelihoods. With the immediate emergency response completed the it is recognised that, during the rehabilitation and recovery post-Haiyan phase sustainable livelihoods, enhancing employability and capacitating local organisations for job creation is a priority.</narrative>
