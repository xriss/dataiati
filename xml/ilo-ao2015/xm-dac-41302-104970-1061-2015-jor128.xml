  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project &#x201C;Promoting Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work in Jordan&#x201D; will implement a two-pronged strategy to improve compliance with freedom of association and collective bargaining rights in the country. It will first support the tripartite constituents in bringing national legislation in conformity with the ILO&#x2019;s principles and Conventions on freedom of association and collective bargaining rights (ILO Convention No. 87 and No. 98). To this end, the project will take into account the findings of the ILO&#x2019;s report on the scope of labour law reform in Jordan produced in late 2013. It will also build on the ILO&#x2019;s previous consultations with the Ministry of Labour and the social partners regarding the recognition and exercise of freedom of association and collective bargaining rights. Particular attention will be paid to address the tripartite constituents&#x2019; concerns and interests regarding the recognition of freedom of association and collective bargaining rights at all levels for independent trade unions and migrant workers. The project will conduct separate technical advisory sessions for each constituent to help identify constructive proposals to amend the legislation in conformity with ILO principles and Conventions on freedom of association and collective bargaining rights. These consultations and proposals will feed the project&#x2019;s Technical Memorandum on Legal Reform on freedom of association and collective bargaining rights. The Technical Memorandum will provide ILO&#x2019;s recommendations for consideration by the tripartite constituents on this particular matter. Accordingly, the project will support the Ministry of Labour efforts to initiate and advance tripartite dialogue on the recommendations. The project will provide technical advice to support this process, and if an agreement is reached on the legal provisions to be developed or amended, it will support the drafting of relevant provisions. If necessary, the project will facilitate discussions between the tripartite constituents and the Parliament for the adoption of relevant legal amendments. The project&#x2019;s second objective is to promote sound industrial relations and the effective exercise of collective bargaining rights at the sectoral level, particularly in sectors with a high density of migrant workers. Accordingly, the project will develop the capacity of the Ministry of Labour to improve the effectiveness of its work in these critical areas. The Directorate of Labour will specially benefit from the project&#x2019;s assistance, given its mandate on collective bargaining and labour dispute prevention and resolution. In doing so, the project will build on previous work carried out by other ILO projects in the country. More particularly, the project will contribute to the implementation of the collective bargaining policy developed under a Norwegian-funded project. The project will also benefit from the training activities on conciliation and mediation to be carried by a Canadian-funded project on &#x201C;Improving Labour Law Compliance in Jordan&#x201D;.</narrative>
