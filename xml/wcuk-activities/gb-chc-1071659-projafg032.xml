   <narrative xml:lang="EN">EMERGENCY RESPONSE:
An integrated emergency response child protection project to address the growing humanitarian child protection needs created by drought, conflict, COVID-19, and other emergencies affecting boys, girls, women, and men in three provinces of Afghanistan over six months. The project&#x2019;s purpose is to ensure vulnerable children and families have timely and effective access to child protection assistance and increase their psychosocial wellbeing and resilience to future shocks.

The project has three main objectives:
1) To strengthen community-based child protection mechanism to create a protective environment and to address child protection issues, and create a sustainable link for the promotion of child protection
2) To increase the psychosocial well-being of boys and girls affected by conflict, drought, and COVID-19 through the provision of PFA and PSS
3) To provide specialized child protection services through the case management approach, including FTR.

The project will also strengthen Community-Based Child Protection mechanisms through capacity-building, coaching, and mentoring, organizing joint awareness-raising campaigns, and strengthening coordination and referrals. WCUK will establish and train six Mobile Child Protection Teams who will target hard-to-reach areas and locations including house-to-house outreach in the host communities. These teams will be responsible for delivering the following activities: Psychological First Aid to affected children; case management support; awareness-raising activities for children and adults; PSS activities for children; and Identification, Family Tracing, and Reunification services to unaccompanied and separated children.

Static child protection services will be provided through 9 Child-Friendly Spaces across the three targeted provinces. WCUK will provide safe spaces for children to play, learn in, and access psychosocial support to enable their continuous development in a protective environment. WCUK will also establish a team of trained caseworkers to provide Case Management to emergency-affected boys and girls, including unaccompanied and separated children, in the three target provinces to address child protection needs and reduced negative coping mechanisms.</narrative>
