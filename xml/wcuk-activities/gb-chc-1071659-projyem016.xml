   <narrative xml:lang="EN">OCHA: Provision of critical child protection services for vulnerable children living in the conflicted affected districts of Maqbanah and Makha, Taiz Governorate</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project will support 6,592 conflict-affected people from the host and IDP communities in Maqbanah and Makha, Taiz Governorate, by strengthening community-based protection mechanisms that prevent, mitigate, and respond to protection issues and providing specialized assistance to children and adults with specific protection needs. War Child UK will establish three community centers each of which will serve as a hub to the local community for the provision of protection services and reach out to IDPs through mobile teams (social workers)

The project will address the immediate protection needs of highly vulnerable people through identifying protection risks at the community-level and referring people to the appropriate service, including women, children, elders, and people living with disabilities. War Child UK will ensure that case management and referral mechanisms are in place, including child protection services. Legal assistance will be provided through civil documentation issuance and the importance of civil documentation awareness. The community center activities will include a protection cash assistance component for persons (girls, boys, women, and men) facing urgent protection risks.

To address mental health needs and to ensure that psychosocial support is provided for targeted communities, child-friendly spaces will be established and managed by hired trained facilitators. War Child will be providing PSS for adults through its community centers and promote positive parenting skills.

Furthermore, Community Based Child Protection Committees (CBCPs) will be established and strengthened (representing age, gender, and diverse groups of displaced and conflict-affected communities), to address and mitigate protection concerns, promote social cohesion and enhance community self-protection mechanisms.

Mine Risk Education awareness sessions and IEC materials will be provided to children and their caregivers by the established committees at the field level after training them by the Yemen Executive Mine Action Center (YEMAC) staff.</narrative>
