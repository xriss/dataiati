   <narrative xml:lang="EN">War Child&apos;s school gardens project aims to promote a sustainable solution for schools thanks to gardening activities which foster better access to quality education and supports a sustainable school meal system. The Rangoonwala Foundation has agreed to provide a grant to War Child for both Kibabi primary school and Beho primary school to take part in this project. With the use of that grant, the following will be achieved:

-War Child will work with the community and local authorities to identify, rent and prepare an additional 3-5 hectares of land, including clearing and ploughing
- War Child will purchase and distribute agricultural inputs such as climate-smart seeds, pesticides, fertilisers to improve productivity, agricultural tools
- War Child will work with the community to ensure good crops&#x2019; maintenance and protection measures are in place for the gardens to yield a strong productivity
- War Child will train parents and teachers in efficient and sustainable agricultural techniques for fruits and vegetables production
- War Child will train cooks, teachers, committees and pupils on food hygiene, healthy eating and nutrition
- War Child will support the transformation of harvest into school meals.
- War Child will provide kitchen equipment to Beho primary school who already have developed their school gardens through FCDO funding but need kitchen equipment to be able to provide the school meals.

1,388 children will benefit from the gardens as follows:
- 883 school children (405 girls and 478 boys) will have access to meals in the Kibabi primary school.
- 100% will attend lessons about botany and their environment (as part of the national curriculum) in the school gardens.
- 75% of children will report an improvement of their learning.
- 80-100% of children will receive 3 meals per week for a term thanks to the gardens&apos; production.

- 505 children (235 girls and 270 boys) will have access to school meals in Beho primary school.
- 80-100% of children will receive 2 school meals per week for a month thanks to the school gardens.

Both schools will see improved attendance.</narrative>
