   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This award strives to support the science and practice of food, feed, and fiber production (including forestry, wildlife, fisheries, aquaculture and floriculture) and its relationships to natural resources, processing, marketing, distribution, utilization (including nutrition), and trade. In addition, this award The municipalities of Catacamas and Dulce Nombre de Culm&#xED; in eastern Honduras are in an area with limited opportunities for employment and consistent food insecurity, a situation which has often led to residents damaging the fragile ecosystems of protected areas while they try to make a living and grow food. Unfortunately, few outside investments flow into the area that would make it easier for communities to jump-start their development. At the IAF, we support community-led approaches to unlock private, public, and community resources for grassroots development. Our grantee partner, the Instituto para la Cooperaci&#xF3;n y Autodesarrollo (ICADE) works with the leadership of an indigenous federation, cacao and coffee producer&#x2019;s associations, and 18 communities to strengthen their organizations so they are able to effectively expand opportunities for economic development, enabling local residents to better make a living and meet their food security needs while protecting natural resources in their own municipalities. This grant is part of the IAF&apos;s efforts to address the root causes of irregular migration in Central America..</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">Alarming levels of crime and violence, high levels of poverty and food insecurity, and ineffective governance and corruption all threaten Honduras&apos; fragile democracy. U.S. foreign assistance plays a critical role in supporting Honduras&apos; development as a safe, democratic, and prosperous nation that offers hope to Hondurans so they see their future in Honduras and not elsewhere. U.S. assistance supports civil society engagement in shaping public policy, a necessary component of a healthy democracy. The President&apos;s Feed the Future (FTF) program also figures prominently in the programs to reduce extreme poverty and increase economic opportunity in the poorest rural areas of the country. These activities will be provided through technical assistance, grants, and loans. By supporting targeted activities in these areas of intervention, USAID will also help address the underlying factors contributing to migration to the United States. In October 2014, the U.S. government launched the U.S. Strategy for Engagement in Central America (Strategy), which complements the work undertaken by national governments and multilateral development banks, to support the priority objectives identified in the Plan of the Alliance for Prosperity in the Northern Triangle. The Strategy focuses on three overarching lines of action: 1) promoting prosperity and regional economic integration; 2) enhancing security through continued and expanded Central America Regional Security Initiative (CARSI) activities; and 3) promoting improved governance. Therefore, the Department of State and USAID&apos;s FY 2017 request of $750.0 million in bilateral and regional assistance for Central America - a part of the Administration&apos;s $1.0 billion whole-of-government request for appropriations and financing assistance to support the Strategy - includes and aligns the resources necessary to increase economic opportunity, reduce extreme violence, strengthen the effectiveness of state institutions, address climate change and food insecurity, and address challenges that have resulted in an influx of migration.</narrative>
