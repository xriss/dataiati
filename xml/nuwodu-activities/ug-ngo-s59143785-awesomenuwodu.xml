       <narrative xml:lang="EN">2 national advocacy meetings held for improved implementation of policy and legal frameworks and plans for the realisation of all women&#x2019;s rights, including WWD.

Advocacy meetings are targeting policy change, with 3 types of people joining (those in charge of policy making at district and national levels; those in charge of approval of policies at different levels; those in charge of implementation at different levels). NUWODU&#x2019;s approach is to have all 3 categories in the space, so they identify what is relevant, to be included, to remove, on a particular policy related to WwDs.

The particular topics will change year-on-year. The approach is that NUWODU first works with WwDs to assess their whole environment, what are the gaps, what is there, what are their priorities? Then in Year 2, NUWODU will start off the advocacy meetings. The first meeting in 2022 is focused on budgeting processes and discussing the challenges that WwDs faced in this process, and how to address those gaps in future processes.</narrative>

      <narrative xml:lang="EN">The media is a key platform to create space on issues of WwDs, but it is not yet instrumental in either highlighting the situation of WwDs or redressing it. NUWODU&#x2019;s experience and conversations with communities tells us that media (radio, tweets, etc) do create debates, and feedback from communities confirms that media does impact on their attitudes and behaviours. 

For example, before AWESOME, there was no reasonable accommodation for WwDs in the health sector. Within the first year of AWESOME working on media, in Katakwii and Amuria, the authorities have now purchased adjustable maternity beds to accommodate WwDs - as a result of the media advocacy. It was a result of one woman telling her story of giving birth without the right facilities, which then received a lot of community feedback, and so stakeholders had to react, which they did by buying the beds.
At the baseline, NUWODU recognises that there is low participation of WwDs in the media. Testimonies from participants tell us that they had never had opportunities to participate in media before. NUWODU&#x2019;s training with WwDs helps them to see how they can use media such as the radio to bring out the views that they want to air to the whole public, so that they create space for WwD&#x2019;s demands and change the public debate about disabilities.

NUWODU&#x2019;s hopes to ensure participation of WwDs through a number of radio talk shows, TV shows, and social media: so that they recognise that media is a space where they can raise their issues. This will be complemented by training journalists on disability reporting: following trainings within year one, journalists testified that because they have learnt more about sensitive issues, they will be reporting more closely on WwDs&#x2019; issues in the future, and this reporting does have influence over decision-makers.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">As a result of the media activities, we want to see a change at community level, we expect more engagement of PwDs at community level, and more participation of women in leadership at all levels. Changes will happen from household through to community, county and district levels. The media interventions should change perceptions towards PwDs, and perception change begins at household level. We hope to see change that is not just about representation, but also about WwDs actively influencing decisions being made, to improve issues of PwDs. 

One of the greatest hindrances for WwD&#x2019;s participation are perceptions: of them, both as a woman, and as a PwD. Through the media work, the women themselves have to identify the potential within them, and then their community must be open to seeing that WwDs can achieve and do many things (need to change thinking and negative norms).
From our baseline&#x2019;s key informant interviews, we heard that although the government aims to bring PwDs into leadership positions, WwDs do not have confidence to speak up. So we want to build their capacity to speak out and influence change, in all spaces, including the media.</narrative>

      <narrative xml:lang="EN">The women movement is not inclusive of women with disabilities, so this indicator focuses on strengthening capacities of WwD leaders. 

The 350 women are women with different categories of disabilities, and are WwD leaders at different levels. They are already leaders: the majority are political leaders (at village, parish, and district levels), but also religious leaders (church groups), and leaders from savings groups.

In terms of their current capacity, AWESOME plans to work with them to strengthen their capacities in lobby and advocacy, to be active participants in different processes within their communities. As leaders, they have the potential to influence laws and policies and processes within their communities, but are keen for support in how to lobby and advocate for these changes. By targeting WwD leaders, NUWODU will work with 350 women who represent a much wider constituency of WwDs and will trickle-down the benefits to the wider community. 

Baseline information is 0 because the women target will be new women.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">By end of AWESOME, we want women with disabilities to feel empowered to organize themselves and come up with a collective action through increased participation in women&apos;s movements.

By targeting WwDs who are already leaders, we hope to affect change in their capacities so that they can then create change for the wider communities of WwDs. We hope to see these women, as leaders, influencing laws and policies and processes within their communities and in their roles.

 &quot;Actively participating&quot;: is defined as being actively involved through, for example, being member or holding a position within the movement (such as leader, chairperson, secretary, treasurer, mobiliser, or vice chair person).</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">44 WWDs (and 16 MWDs, so 60 PWDs in total) participated actively in year 1. A key highlight was the formation of the association. 
An association that brings all persons with disabilities together was formed in Katakwi (Katakwi District Women with Disability Union) so as to continue advocating for the rights of persons with disabilities especially GWWDS. The association formation had an expected number of 40 WWDS but 60 attended the formation. According to disaggregated data 25 WWDS are physically disabled, 5 were visually impaired, another 5 were persons with hearing impairments, 1 was a person with albinism, 2 had epilepsy, 4 with mental illness and 2 represented little persons, 10 were men with physical disabilities, 1 man with a hearing impairment, 3 men with visual impairment and 2 men with low vision. 
Furthermore, through the capacity building of these women on their roles and responsibilities, leadership skills to demand accountability from duty bearers as well as in budgeting. There is increased know
knowledge of the budget progress processes, the leadership. There is increased ability by these women to actively participants in different processes at the district and local community levels to lobby and advocate for the rights of women with disabilities. 
When PWDS got the information of the association formation, they all struggled to attend. In year 2 we shall try change the venue that will not be easily accessed by everybody. NUWODU plan to keep the target as 350 WWDs over 5 years.</narrative>
