    <narrative xml:lang="EN">Like its neighbors, Belize faces multi-faceted challenges affecting security, economic diversification, and social development, particularly in the health and education sectors. Continued steadfast partnership with Belize is critical to advance Belize&apos;s citizen security efforts, fight against transnational criminal networks, and foster development. U.S. assistance supports the modernization of the country&apos;s security forces and continues to build the capacity of the Belize Defense Force (BDF) and Belize Coast Guard (BCG). Assistance in FY 2017 will further develop Belize&apos;s ability to plan and conduct interagency operations from the Joint Intelligence and Operations Center, an endeavor between the United States, Canada, and the Government of Belize, and will improve military and intelligence capabilities to provide actionable information for Countering Transnational Organized Crime efforts. The U.S. Strategy for Engagement in Central America focuses on three overarching lines of action: 1) promoting prosperity and regional economic integration; 2) enhancing security through continued and expanded Central America Regional Security Initiative (CARSI) activities; and 3) promoting improved governance. Therefore, the Department of State and USAID&apos;s FY 2017 request of $750.0 million in bilateral and regional assistance for Central America - a part of the Administration&apos;s $1.0 billion whole-of-government request for appropriations and financing assistance to support the Strategy - includes and aligns the resources necessary to begin to comprehensively increase economic opportunity, reduce extreme violence, strengthen the effectiveness of state institutions, address climate change and food insecurity, and challenges that have resulted in an influx of migration.</narrative>
