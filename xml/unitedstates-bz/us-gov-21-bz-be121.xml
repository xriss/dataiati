  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Female entrepreneurs in low-income neighborhoods around Belize City in Belize operate in an informal economy, with little access to capital or financial services to improve their businesses. They often lack the financial literacy they need to make their businesses efficient and profitable. At the IAF, we support community-led approaches to expand economic opportunity by encouraging small business growth and strengthening excluded communities, such as women, so they can participate equally in their nation&#x2019;s economy. Our grantee partner Belize Enterprise for Sustainable Technology (BEST) will work closely with YMCA Belize City to offer enterprise development training, leadership training, and capital to small businesses to increase families&#x2019; incomes in high-risk neighborhoods and prepare them to operate in the formal economy..

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">Like its neighbors, Belize faces multi-faceted challenges affecting security, economic diversification, and social development, particularly in the health and education sectors. Continued steadfast partnership with Belize is critical to advance Belize&apos;s citizen security efforts, fight against transnational criminal networks, and foster development. U.S. assistance supports the modernization of the country&apos;s security forces and continues to build the capacity of the Belize Defense Force (BDF) and Belize Coast Guard (BCG). Assistance in FY 2017 will further develop Belize&apos;s ability to plan and conduct interagency operations from the Joint Intelligence and Operations Center, an endeavor between the United States, Canada, and the Government of Belize, and will improve military and intelligence capabilities to provide actionable information for Countering Transnational Organized Crime efforts. The U.S. Strategy for Engagement in Central America focuses on three overarching lines of action: 1) promoting prosperity and regional economic integration; 2) enhancing security through continued and expanded Central America Regional Security Initiative (CARSI) activities; and 3) promoting improved governance. Therefore, the Department of State and USAID&apos;s FY 2017 request of $750.0 million in bilateral and regional assistance for Central America - a part of the Administration&apos;s $1.0 billion whole-of-government request for appropriations and financing assistance to support the Strategy - includes and aligns the resources necessary to begin to comprehensively increase economic opportunity, reduce extreme violence, strengthen the effectiveness of state institutions, address climate change and food insecurity, and challenges that have resulted in an influx of migration.</narrative>
