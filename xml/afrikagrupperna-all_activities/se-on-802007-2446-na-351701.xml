As the main litigation vehicle of LAC, the bulk of the work of the SJP relates to court litigation.  Litigation is almost never an easy or short intervention although the increasing use of mediation in the early stages of a litigious matters has led to some early settlements. LAC has worked with access to health through vaccination cases (All 9 matters went to mediation which subsequently failed.  The claims will now proceed through case management to pre-trial procedures.  &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;SJP solicited the assistance of a local expert witness who specialises in paediatrics.  This witness has provided SJP with relevant research and will also testify at the trials.), forced sterilization matters (Following the settlement agreements reported on earlier: Clients were provided with a financial contribution to compensate for the injuries they had suffered at the hands of the state.  Payment from Government was, however, delayed and as a result SJP had to place the matters back on the court roll for contempt of court proceedings forcing government to make payment.  Payment has now finally been received and the files have been closed.) and other forms of medical negligence. &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Cases of medical negligence continue to rise and the right to health is under serious threat in Namibia.  During the reporting period LAC has also dealt with litigation in cases of police assault, matters involving minors and/or vulnerable persons, inheritance and property disputes, refugee/citizenship issues and constitutional disputes.&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
Advocacy and training within the SJP: A training on the provisions of the Traditional Authorities Act was held in Gobabis. Visits to the correctional facilities and police holding cells were undertaken to engage with inmates and take note of the conditions in which they are held and to obtain data for possible future training. No dedicated training to Key Populations took place in the first 6 months. This is expected to resume in the second part of 2018.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Gender, Research &amp; Advocacy Project (GR&amp;AP)&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Children and the law &#x2013; 7 workshops on corporal punishment was held during the period under review, in schools and with community groups. Students, teachers, social workers and parents participated (239 people: 187F/52M). Topics covered: alternatives to corporal punishment, corporal punishment and the links to GBV, family laws, combating of rape act, domestic violence, cohabitation and civil and customary marriages. The use of corporal punishment is so entrenched in people&#x2019;s attitudes that long-term interventions may be required to show significant impact.&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
GENDER gave an input on corporal punishment at the workshop for the Parliamentary Standing Committee. Unlike other groups, this group (primarily MPs near or past pensioner age) was not receptive to the idea of alternative discipline. Several MPs expressed the view that the introduction of &#x201C;rights&#x201D; has made children impossible to control, and with respect to school violence they seemed to find it acceptable both to use violence and to disrespect the rule of law &#x2013; which seems to show a lack of leadership. 16 participants (13F/3M).&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
GENDER submitted opinions, memos and comments on Child Care and Protection Act to key government stakeholders. The regulations to the Act have still not been finalized.&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Family law - LAC received warm acknowledgement at the launch of the BreakFree Campaign Against GBV. At least 100 persons from corporate businesses, civil society, UN agencies &amp; GRN organizations, inmates and victims were in attendance. The campaign involved victims, perpetrators, communities, inmates and frontline officers. &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;GENDER facilitated a workshop at the Namibian University for Science and Technology on date rape and the Combating of Rape Act. The workshop was well attended with a total of 50 students (20F/ 30M). The main aim of the workshop was to give information on what is considered rape, what date rape is and what steps victims of these acts can take (such as accessing PrEP). The students had no response when asked what date rape is. This is a clear indication that even individuals at the level of tertiary education, who are vulnerable to date rape, are not well informed on such matters. &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;GENDER facilitated sessions at a workshop to map out possible strategies for challenging the criminalisation of consensual sex between adults and improving other areas of law and social life where LGBTIQ+ people experience discrimination. It was hosted by Positive Vibes with participation from Human Dignity Trust and Southern Africa Litigation Centre, as well as many local groups and activists on LBGTIQ+ rights. The 5-day workshop had 40 participants (26F/14M). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;

LAC made 26 appearances in the media in the first 6 months of 2018. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;

A further 72000 reprints of the comics dealing with alternatives to corporal punishment and the comics were inserted into 2 newspapers &#x2013; English 32000, Oshiwambo 16000, Otjiherero 8000, Afrikaans 16000. Total publications distribution (all topics): 385 204.</narrative>
