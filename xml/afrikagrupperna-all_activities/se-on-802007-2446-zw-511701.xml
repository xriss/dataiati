  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">FACT trained 74 youths as facilitators (both in and out of school youths). The training gave the youth skills to cascade the gender norms education to the communities they are working with. As a result of the training, 11 clubs were formed (6 in-school, 5 out-of-school). The training has seen more youth gaining knowledge on HIV, SRHR and GBV. 102 youths have gone for HIV testing and the majority are claiming that they now use preventive measures (condoms) during sex. This increased uptake of condom use showed that the project is breaking cultural barriers since it was considered a taboo to even talk about condoms earlier. 
A talk show on SRHR, HIV and GBV issues for youth and young women was held, A total of 65 people (55 pupils, 5 teachers and 5 police officers from the Victim Friendly Unit) participated in the discussions. The discussions empowered children and girls in particular on issues of reproductive health and sexual rights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt; 
FACT also facilitated a community organised road show on SRHR, HIV and GBV awareness where 200 people (114F/86M) were reached. SRHR and HIV testing services were provided. 93 people got tested. The 3 that tested positive were linked to care and treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
FACT trained 26 care workers (20F/6M) on malaria, TB and PMTCT. The training aimed at disseminating information to their communities on the importance of PMTCT as well as prevention of malaria and TB. The care workers were educated about new developments in HIV and the new regimen of starting treatment as soon as you test positive, and not wait for CD4 count. FACT also conducted 5 community dialogues on PMTCT and SRHR and male involvement with 120 participants (71F/49M). The organisation also managed to conduct a training on male involvement in PMTCT and family health, 27 people participated (9F/18M)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Story of change:&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
One young man participating in the youth programme said that the work in challenging gender norms brought change to his community. The cultural values and beliefs previously directed their way of life. These norms deterred boys and girls from doing certain tasks in the home, resulting in boys doing very few tasks and girls being overburdened. Consequently, girls did not perform well in school and some dropped out. The youth programme by FACT was an eye opener to everyone in the community especially the youth whose life were transformed and resulted in sharing of duties at home by both men and women. The young man also shared that FACT&#x2019;s programme strengthened socialisation because it connected the youths through trainings and communiy meetings. Another important aspect that he shared was that before FACT&#x2019;s youth programme in the area, young people did not have much knowledge about HIV. Afraid of getting tested, fear that a positive result would mean the end of one&#x2019;s life. Also, they could not access condoms since they had been made to believe that condoms were a taboo. This resulted in many unintended pregnancies and HIV infections. Now however, when they are conducting meetings with other youths, they have begun appreciating the testing services and they can now access condoms.</narrative>
