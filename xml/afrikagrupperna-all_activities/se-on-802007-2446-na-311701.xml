   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Namibia Planned Parenthood Association (NAPPA) was established in 1996 to complement the Government&#x2019;s efforts in the provision of Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights (SRHR) information and services to the people of Namibia. NAPPA has grown over the years to become the leading national civil society provider of information, education, counselling and services on sexual and reproductive health, particularly to young people. NAPPA is a Member Association of International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF). NAPPA operates in 8 regions of Namibia with clinics in 7 regions. In addition to the services offered at the clinics, NAPPA conducts extensive community outreach to rural and remote areas in order to educate and mobilize target groups regarding key life skills, with a focus on raising awareness and understanding regarding SRHR.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The year 2018 started on a very sad note when NAPPA lost one of its major donors, Global Fund. This loss caused instability as it constituted up to 70% of the total budget for 2017. NAPPA also lost vehicles including mobile clinics which were bought and operated under Global Fund. Consequently, NAPPA was made to retrench some of the non-clinical services staff members as well as some of the nurses. This lead to the reduction of services especially the outreach and mobile based services.&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
The management has since been engaged in resource mobilization strategies to turn the situation around. Fortunately, the Ministry of Health has continued to support NAPPA with free clinical commodities for the operations of the clinics.&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
Without the budget contribution by Global Fund, NAPPA performed 40% lower at this period compared to the two preceding years.&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
All the service delivery points, except two, were operational but operating at much lower levels. NAPPA has worked hard to continue the services for adolescents. Despite all challenges and funding shortages, NAPPA managed to provide 77497 services (including family planning, counselling, testing, ante natal care etc). 13322 adolescents and youth aged 10-24 was reached with SRH information and 20034 clients received Ante Natal Care Examination. NAPPA is also progressing steadily with the roll out of ART services at the youth friendly clinics. The target was to enrol at least 50 young people at the 4 priority clinics and 179 clients were enrolled by end of June 2018. In addition, NAPPA has also rolled out PrEP to 228 young people.</narrative>
