   <narrative xml:lang="EN">AMODEFA is a Mozambican organisation established in 1989 and member of International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF). Its main purpose is to raise awareness and defend the sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) of youth, women and men through the dissemination of information, training, and by offering quality services in collaboration with the public and private sectors as well as with civil society. Its ultimate objective is to contribute to the good health and well-being of the Mozambican population. AMODEFA mainly operates in the domains of HIV, family planning, lobbying and advocacy, and sexual and reproductive health. 
The organisation is present in the provinces of Maputo, Gaza, Zamb&#xE9;zia, Manica, Cabo-Delgado and Sofala. In Maputo and Zambezia AMODEFA runs its own clinics. They also collaborate with health authorities in the development of activities in home-based care for people living with HIV. Activities are focused on Advocacy, Awareness raising and Access.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In the Strategic Area (1) - Defense of Rights: Throughout the first half of the year, several advocacy efforts with the government and co-operation partners have been made to influence them in supporting the program for comprehensive SRHR in Mozambique. At the international level, advocacy efforts continued to minimize the impact of the Global Gag Rule in the medium and long term and the promotion of sexual and reproductive rights. AMODEFA is working on advocacy to produce an anti-draft Law on Premature Marriages. In this context a hearing with the average adolescents and young people was carried out aiming to feed the anti-draft law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In the Strategic Area (2) - Empowering Communities: 226 324 adolescents and young people were sensitized throughout the six-month period. Awareness-raising activities took place through comprehensive sexual education sessions in schools and outside schools, women&apos;s groups and during the week of Comprehensive Sexual Education held in commemoration of the day of AMODEFA Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Strategic Area (3) - Serving People: Provision of Family Planning, Safe Abortion, HIV &amp; ITS services as well as other sexual and reproductive health services, including services for adolescents and youth.
a) Family Planning Services: In the first half of 2018, AMODEFA provided 90 593 FP services. This result was positively influenced by the greater community coverage compared to last year, plus the massification of mobile brigades and health fairs.&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
b) Safe Abortion Services: In the first half of 2018, abortion services registered a decrease both in the number of abortions performed and in the other related services, reaching only 309. It is hoped that in the second half of the year AMODEFA will focus on the dissemination of the Law on abortion as well as awareness of the use of the services available both in the Public Clinical Units and at the AMODEFA clinic level.&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
c) HIV and STI services: A total of 65 730 HIV services were provided in the first half of 2018. Mobile brigades, health fairs and fixed points of service contributed to this performance. 16 793 STI services were provided.&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
d) Other Sexual and Reproductive Health Services: The number of medical services provided in the first half of 2018 was 22 658.&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Strategic Area (4) - Unite and Acting: The actions were aimed at improving aspects of governance and management. AMODEFA has been present in national and international bodies in actions that contribute to the marketing of its image. To ensure quality services, AMODEFA is focused on its internal restructuring to become a small and functional organizational management structure as well as ensuring a framework of organizational excellence. &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;AMODEFA participated as part of the Mozambican Delegation for the second consecutive year at the International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD51) organized by the United Nations. &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;AMODEFA&apos;s participation in the Gender Forum in Stockholm was a moment of learning about the need to include faith-based organizations, work on SRHR to better understand their approaches and find common ground. &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;With advocacy work, it was possible to mobilize significant resources to face the impact of the Global Gag Rule. Dissemination of policy impact within and outside the country, including participation in international events at the invitation of partners to share advocacy experience in the area of SRHR, safe abortion and AMODEFA involvement in advocacy for key population rights, such as LGBT, within the framework of the objectives of sustainable development, on the principle of &quot;leaving no one behind&quot;, have been the focus of attraction of resources.</narrative>
