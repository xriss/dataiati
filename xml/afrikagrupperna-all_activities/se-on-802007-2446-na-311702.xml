   <narrative xml:lang="EN">PV has developed and consolidated some of its specific and cross cutting initiatives in the first six months of 2018, while also making substantial progress in relation to the institution building aspects as outlined in the proposal. &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;PV has continued developing LILO Faith, taken forward the process of developing LILO Women and established the Adolescent Girls and Young Women Programme in Namibia as a follow-up to previous work. The KP REACH Programme is in the last year of its current phase. In terms of institutional changes, PV has initiated the updating of its website, focussed on strengthening the board of trustees and integrating new board members while also building the team based strategic capacity of the Strategic Leadership Team and enhancing internal communication. The Decriminalisation Convening held in Namibia last year has been taken forward with the establishment of the &#x2018;decriminalisation plan&#x2019; and PV has played a role in support of the Diversity Alliance Namibia (DAN) to take forward this strategic advocacy work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
LILO Faith - PV together with the Global Interfaith Network on Sex, Sexuality, Gender Identity and Expression have developed Hearts Set on Pilgrimage, a process guide to a 5-day experience to prepare LGBT People of Faith to participate in dialogue with mainstream religious leaders. The objectives of the Curriculum are to firstly, prepare and equip LGBT people of faith to participate in dialogue with religious leaders; and secondly to build the internal capabilities of LGBT people of faith to claim their faith with confidence and resilience, as part of the community of believers. PV is pleased to have a tool to begin significant engagement with faith leaders and communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
LILO Women - Over the last three months PV has been working to develop a pilot project that intersects its personalisation approach (LILO) with Hivos&#x2019; cutting-edge Women&#x2019;s Programming across East and Southern Africa, leading to the development of a new curriculum for Women Leaders. PV and HIVOS are exploring opportunities to develop a more comprehensive women&#x2019;s leadership program where this new cutting-edge product can be used. PV also sees an adapted version of this content as a valuable addition to its new Adolescent Girls and Young women program starting in Namibia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;  
Adolescent Girls and Young Women Program - Building on its previous work with adolescents in Teen Clubs, PV has initiated the programme. In the first six months, several stakeholder meetings have been held with NANASO and the government to build relationships and ensure effective implementation. Staff have been recruited. A start-up process has introduced the programme to authorities and stakeholders in the three target regions. A five-day TOT training session for the program staff was done during the first week of July 2018. In total, 10 people were trained in this TOT including five key staff (PV), three facilitators (one from each region), one key staff from NANASO and one key staff from the anticipated partner in implementation (Walvis Bay Corridor Group).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;   
KP REACH - is a three-year programme in its final year of implementation. It is delivered in eight countries in Southern Africa: Botswana, Swaziland, Lesotho, South Africa, Namibia, Malawi, Zimbabwe and Zambia. Highlights from the last six months include: &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Coordination and delivery of three Linking and Learning Exchanges in Botswana, Swaziland and Lesotho and Zimbabwe; Attendance by Key Correspondents (KCs) at key local meetings and international conferences to gather stories; Publication of the third PV KP REACH Newsletter, Reaching Out in May; Completion and upload of an additional 5 new articles onto the KC website (www.keycorrespondents.org); Delivery of the SATF Dialogue Facilitation Skills training, Meaningful Dialogue and Representation Action (MDRA) roll out planning and the Trans leadership coaching induction in May; Piloting of new PV &#x2018;Looking In, Looking Out&#x2019; method, LILO Sustainability, with Gender Dynamix (GDX) in May; Attendance at Global Fund meeting with potential funders in Johannesburg in May; Since December 2016, 357 cases have been recorded by REACtors, with 478 individuals affected (multiple people can be affected in one case); Significant work to strengthen referral systems through REAct has been undertaken as part of steps to ensure sustainability of response to human rights violations post-2018.</narrative>
