   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The concern of adolescents and young people about their HIV status continues to grow, as the number of adolescents and young people who seek and adhere to services, has increased by 25% in relation to the year past.&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
There is a greater commitment to the cause, will and interest in changing behavior and attitude among students, adolescents and young people, due to the lectures and debates that are made in the schools in partnership with the activists. As evidence of this result, in the first semester of this year, there was a decrease of -18.6 for girls pregnant in schools and no girl dropped out of school due to pregnancy or premature marriages.&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Othoko provided training in Human Rights and SRHR to 40 members of the District Advisory Council and 30 MPs.&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Othoko has also worked for empowerment of midwives and other health personnel and community awareness of the need to have safe childbirth, adhere to prenatal consultations, including advocacy to improve the quality of service delivery.&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
As a result of the work done by Othoko, PLWH recognize and accept their HIV status, change their behavior, break the silence, seek and adhere to medication without abandonment, accept Home Care services, leave critical bedridden stage and resume their normal life. In 2017 and 2018 there were no drop-outs among PLWH, assisted by the health platforms coordinated by OTHOKO.&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
There is also a change in the behavior of pregnant women in relation to HIV testing: in 2018 there was a 10.7% increase in the number of women who had their first HIV test compared to the same period in 2017.</narrative>
