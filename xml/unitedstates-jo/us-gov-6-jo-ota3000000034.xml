   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Governance refers to the exercise of political, economic, and administrative authority to manage a country&apos;s affairs at all levels, including the capacity to formulate, implement, and enforce public policies and deliver services. Good governance includes modes of administrative authority that are inclusive, participatory, transparent, responsive, effective, and accountable. This includes support for strengthening legislatures and local governments; capacity-building; security sector reform; separation of powers through institutional checks and balances, between the executive and legislative branches, in particular; and avenues within government structures for accountability, oversight and meaningful public participation. In conflict or post-conflict environments, this includes support for reconstruction of state institutions and systems.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Government of Jordan (GOJ) continues to be a critical partner to the United States on major regional priorities, including combating the threat of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) and other extremist groups, pursuing Middle East peace, and achieving a political solution to the Syrian conflict while addressing the ongoing humanitarian and energy crises. U.S. assistance supports the long standing U.S. Jordanian, bilateral relationship by bolstering Jordan&apos;s economic and political reform agenda, and by helping Jordan temporarily absorb over 635,000 Syrian refugees and 52,000 Iraqi refugees. The FY 2017 request will promote U.S. and Jordanian efforts to further five overarching goals: 1) expand Jordan&apos;s contributions to bilateral and coalition efforts to address the threat of ISIL and other regional threats; 2) accelerate inclusive economic development; 3) strengthen Jordan&apos;s ability to deliver essential health, education, and water services; 4) strengthen democratic accountability and enhance effective governance; and 5) enhance gender equality and female empowerment. Separately, the FY 2017 Request includes funding within the humanitarian assistance accounts to enable the United States to continue to respond to humanitarian needs related to the ongoing Syria crisis in neighboring countries, including Jordan (see narratives for the humanitarian assistance accounts for additional details).</narrative>
