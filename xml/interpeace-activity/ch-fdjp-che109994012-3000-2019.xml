    <narrative xml:lang="EN">Developing new programmes allows Interpeace to have a greater impact in fulfilling the first part of its mandate, namely to strengthen the capacities of societies to manage conflict in non-violent, non-coercive ways, by assisting national actors in their efforts to develop social and political cohesion. The core funding by the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs that Interpeace receives is an essential contribution to programme development, which is dependent upon the organization having the financial freedom to explore if its approach could add value in new contexts. This often leads to leveraging of further funds to support the newly developed programmes, thus multiplying the impact of the seed investment made possible through core funding. Developing new programme work also contributes to attaining the overall goal of the Dutch Security and Rule of Law Division (SRoL) Theory of Change to &#x201C;enhance &#x2018;legitimate&#x2019; stability and sustainable peace in fragile contexts in order to achieve sustainable development&#x201D;. The oepning of new country and field offices contributes to these objectives.</narrative>

This further enables staff to design and implement activities utilizing clearly defined effective pathways of change to attain Interpeace&apos;s three underlying impact goals: 1) Reduced Violence and Enhanced Security; 2) More Inclusion and Increased Resilience; 3) Systemic Progress in Peacebuilding Influence and Practice.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Interpeace developed an organization-wide change framework through a participatory process in 2018. As a first step towards ensuring all of the organization&#x2019;s programmes and initiatives are designed and implemented in pursuit of the identified institutional objectives and impact goals, a process was subsequently undertaken to closely familiarize all staff with the Change Framework and its implications for their work. 

The framework is reflected in the 2019 workplan for the organization. The framework in place now also allows Interpeace to speak with one voice and more effectively contribute to the shared goal of sustainable peace.</narrative>
