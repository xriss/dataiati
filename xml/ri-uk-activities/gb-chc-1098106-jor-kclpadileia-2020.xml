  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Under  the  Strategic  Partnerships  for  Higher  Education  Innovation  and  Reform  (SPHEIR)  funded  by  the  UK Department for International Development, the Partnership for Digital Learning and Increased Access (PADILEIA) aims to facilitate access to higher education for those displaced and affected by the Syrian crisis in Jordan and Lebanon.  According  to  UNHCR,  legal  documentation,  high  student  fees,  lack  of  capacity  in  educational institutions,  and English language  are  the  main  barriers  preventing  refugees  from  entering  higher  education; these barriers are then compounded by specific legal and political contexts that vary locally and nationally, and potential  students  who  may  not  be  able  to  pay  even  modest  fees.  With  an  enormous  youth  population,  a generation of Syrians are at risk of being a lost generation in terms of higher education. With King&#x2019;s College London (KCL) as Lead Partner, Relief International (RI) will be implementing part of the project with the goal to equip Syrian refugee school graduates in Za&#x2019;atari Refugee Camp with the skills needed to excel in tertiary education. 
Outcome: 50 Syrian refugee school graduates in Za&#x2019;atari refugee camp are provided with access to quality foundational courses for tertiary education. Target Population: 50 Syrian refugees who have completed secondary education in Za&#x2019;atari Syrian refugee camp in Jordan. 
Location: Two study hubs located in Za&#x2019;atari Syrian refugee camp in Jordan. The study hubs were set up and are operated by RI as part of their comprehensive educational centres in Za&#x2019;atari camp.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">During the project&apos;s lifespan, RI referred 29 unique names and 69 repetitive names to 17 higher education institutions and scholarship platforms, including DAFI, Edu Syria, The University of People, and Luminous Technical College. Scholarships were awarded to 11 students, with two of them being overseas scholarships with settlement programs.

RI performed 18 21st Century Skills workshops to ensure employability skills during the project time, as part of its goal of providing a comprehensive program. CV writing, creativity, an introduction to the economy, data protection, and digital marketing were among the topics covered. Each session had an average of 16 students in attendance.

Upon project closure, RI conducted focus group discussions with KCL students to assess student&#x2019;s perspective on the project in general and its implementation, evaluate the curriculum in terms of difficulty, comprehensiveness, and effectiveness, evaluate the characteristic and advantages of the KCL program, analyze the challenges faced by the students faced during the implementation of the program and assess the distance learning modality of the project. 

In general, students had positive feelings about the project; both boys and girls rate their experience with the program as excellent, with positive feedback on its utility. Most students were satisfied with the curricula in all disciplines because they met the university&apos;s basic standards, and they all agreed that diagnostic examinations upon entering universities will mostly be based on the curricula. However, they agreed that the English curriculum lacked a clear strategy or syllabus, whereas a computer course didn&#x2019;t have a practical component. they also agreed that each subject needs more time to be covered. 

RI has also conducted an end of term satisfaction survey.  Out of 73 students that participated in the survey during the second semester, 48 (90.5%) approved to participate and answered the survey questions (B=21, G=27). The students were asked a total of 30 questions about the program&apos;s quality, interactions with teachers, center activities, distance learning, and feedback and complaint mechanisms. Students express their appreciation for the KCL program activities that were offered at Zaatari Camp. The findings of the survey were; 75% of respondents are satisfied with the KCL program, 21% are moderately satisfied, and 4% are completely dissatisfied.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">During the reporting period, from April to June 2021, RI reports the following achievements and key progress updates under this project:
-	RI finished developing the 21st Century Skills curriculum materials, which were then put into practice by the instructors throughout the second semester. 
-	In April 2021, 11 enrolled students registered and attended extracurricular activities, including language exchange. 
-	In April 2021, RI also conducted a satisfaction survey for the enrolled students to measure the impact of the courses delivered through the program as well as the online modality for delivering the courses. The survey consisted of 30 questions, which were designed to capture satisfaction around program quality, interactions with teachers, activities conducted in the center, distance learning, and the feedback and complaints mechanism. Overall, 63% of the students surveyed showed satisfaction, while 26% were moderately satisfied, and 9% were not satisfied.
-	In May 2021, RI finalized a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Kiron, which enables Kiron to utilize the space within RI&#x2019;s centers, which in turn is mutually beneficial as it allows for the facilitation of online sessions for students in Za&#x2019;atari Camp. A total of 21 students registered for the Kiron sessions. 
-	The second semester of the program was concluded by June 27th, 2021, while the post-tests for the semester were finalized by June 30th, 2021. To aid students with their studying, RI distributed books and notebooks to those enrolled in the program. 
-	Throughout the reporting period, RI provided support to 29 students in the process of applying for scholarships.</narrative>
