   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project aims to enhance the resilience of farmers in 5 communities in the Tulkarm governorate ( Izbat Shufa, Shufa, Ar Ras, Khirbet Jubara, and Kafr al-Labad-), due to the Israeli occupation practices and the harassments of settlers in Areas C, . These locations are exposed to human rights violations, such as demolitions`, displacement, settlers&#x2019; violence, confiscation of lands for settlements expansions, and building industrial zone, The population has been exposed to harassment for a long time, as there are still closed roads since the 2000 uprising, the demolition, burning, and confiscation continues in favor of the settlement of Annab and the settlement of Avni Hefetz that is dividing Shufa from Izbt Shufa preventing farmers from accessing their agricultural lands.  In addition to the bypass roads serving settlements.  This project is a priority in the list of projects for the Directorate of Agriculture in Tulkarm.&#x650; Although the project supporting the idea of national clusters projects and it is an agricultural cluster, these marginalized sites have not received aid from any other party until now.
The AAA conducted a comprehensive needs assessment in September 2020 that covered the needs of farmers in the Tulkarem, thus showed that the cost of agricultural water reaches more than 3 shekels and becomes scarce in the summer. There is water loss as a result of the destruction of the reservoir by the occupation, the roads are rocky and rugged, also parts of the roads have been destroyed many times by the Israeli forces. More than 800 dunums were recently confiscated for the establishment of an industrial zone (source: Tulkarm governorate, local council), in Kufer Al-Labad more than 800 olive trees were uprooted, water tanks were stolen by settlers, sheds were demolished, and farmers were prevented from accessing their lands, more than 20 confiscation orders and construction stops during the last year, 1100 settlement units built from the area&apos;s lands, the estimated volume of attacks on farmers in the last year was more than 60 attacks, settlers stealing crops of Palestinians farmers&apos; lands, burning fruitful trees, and a settler grazing 200 heads of sheep on agricultural lands, there are many cases of being run over and threatened with weapons.
The legal aspects will be taken into consideration during the implementation to avoid any obstacles by the occupying forces. 
The project will contribute to mitigating the negative impacts practiced by the occupation for 2209 farmers ( 613 men, 612 women, 498 children, 486 Girls) with the aim of enhancing livelihoods and resilience in their lands. The proposed activities will respond to the different humanitarian needs of the most vulnerable farmer to improve their living conditions by improving their access to services and inputs, rehabilitating lands and roads, provide farmers with water by the rehabilitation of a metallic tank where the farmer irrigates the crops actually through direct pumping to his land and this causes problems and crises at the time of irrigation, as the farmer is forced to irrigate his crops according to the reservation time and not according to the need of the crop for irrigation, and the farmer has to wait until his turn comes, which causes a waste of time and damage to the crop, as well as causing problems among farmers when the tank is available, the water is collected and thus never interrupted, and the time for its use is available at the time of need and thus the optimal use of water in a way that maintains the health of the soil and serves the crops, install water carrier lines. Women-headed Households will be the first priority when selecting the beneficiaries. The main activities of the project will focus on:
1- Rehabilitation of agricultural lands, including clearing and plowing, fencing, machinery work, building retaining walls for 50 dunums: Izbat Shufa 25 dunums, Shufa 25 dunums,...gtgtgt go  down to comment</narrative>
