   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Providing elective surgeries to patients registered on the waiting list at the Ministry of Health &#x2013; Gaza Strip - OPT</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The idea of the project is to provide surgical services to patients on the waiting lists at the MoH, this idea meets the HC Obj. 2 related to SO # 1amp the 1st and 2nd HRP SO in addition to the 1st allocation obj., adding to HNO 2020. 
Statistics of MoH 2020 indicated that 6759 patients are registered on the waiting list. The project aims to conduct 1474 electives surgeries targeting women, men, girls, boys, elderly amp PWD from North amp South Gaza Strip (GS). The services will include medical examination, lab., radiological services, surgical operation, hospitalization amp post-op follow up. 

The provided surgical operations will be as follows:
-	872 ENT
-	183 Urology
-	202 General
-	217 Orthopedic

1000 minor - 305 moderate - 169 major

To facilitate the access of beneficiaries from different locations in the GS, the services will be provided in 2 UHWC&#x2019;s health facilities: Al-Awda Hospital&#x2013;Northern GS (will conduct major, moderate and minor surgeries) amp Al Awda Health Center&#x2013;Southern GS (will conduct minor surgeries only).

This project is a continuation of a previous project funded by HF which targeted 827 patients from the MoH waiting lists in 2018-2019. By the implementation of this project the No. of beneficiaries from surgical op. services at UHWC&#x2019;s facilities will be expanded from 4384 in 2019 to 5858 in 2020.

In order to achieve the principle of coordination and complementarity, during the preparation of this proposal coordination has been done with the HC and MoH who emphasize the need and the important of this project, as well as coordination has been done with Al Ahli Arab Hospital in order to avoid any duplication in the provision of services. 

A partnership will be concluded through this project with the Central Blood Bank Society (CBBS) in order to provide the necessary blood units for patients to save their lives and mitigate the risks.

Upon the importance of involving the local community in determining the needs amp priorities, the UHWC held 12 FGs in 2020 (Report Attached) targeting different categories of gender amp age groups. The result of these FGs indicated that there is a need for the patients who are registered on the waiting lists at MoH to undergo surgical operations in order to reduce their suffering amp prevent complications. Another 10 FGs meetings will be held to monitor amp evaluate the project services at the mid amp end of the project.  While 100 questionnaires will be distributed to the beneficiaries to measure their satisfaction. This feedback will be used as direction to design future interventions.

To achieve the principle of protection, the project will target different age groups, including boys, girls, men amp women, as well as elderly amp PWD without discrimination. To respond to gender needs, medical staff of both sexes (M amp F) will be available. Moreover, pediatric surgeons will be available to respond to the age needs. 

To meet the principle of (DO No Harm), the cases will be targeted upon the list that will be sent by the MoH, where the project will ensure that the beneficiaries are not harmed during the provision of the services, by providing quality health services under the supervision of highly qualified specialists. To achieve the highest level of Do No Harm, a training course will be held for 12 persons from the medical staff in order to train them on the Sphere Standards related to health services amp the principle of Do No Harm.

To reach accurate amp easily accessible information, HIS system is in place and used at all UHWC facilities. The project will be documented through photography amp audio-visual report taking into consideration the dignity amp privacy of patients.</narrative>
