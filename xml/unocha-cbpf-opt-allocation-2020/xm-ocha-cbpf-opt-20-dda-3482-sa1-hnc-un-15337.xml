  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Around 33,000 Palestinians live in the H2 area of Hebron city in southern West Bank. The findings of the Humanitarian Situation Assessment report in the H2 area,  presented that  the living conditions of Palestinians in H2 area , mainly in the closed military zone, have deteriorated during 2019, following an increase in settler attacks and harassment, constituting a key component of the aggressive and stressful environment. In addition to regular frictions and clashes with Israeli military forces, affecting primarily schoolchildren. In this deteriorating context, 10 percent of children dropped out of school, and 70 percent of children lack access to extracurricular activities. Access to health services in the affected areas of H2, including in situations of emergency, has long been hampered by movement restrictions, and indirectly by the deterioration of the residents&#x2019; economic situation. People with mobility impediments who require regular medical treatment or rehabilitation, such as Persons with Disabilities or the elderly, are particularly impacted. They have to walk significant distances and cross a checkpoint to access transportation to the medical centers. Under the access restrictions in place, the health conditions of these vulnerable communities could be at higher risk in case of the outbreak of the COVID 19 viral infection in the surrounding areas of H2. The longstanding access restrictions and closure orders have devastated the commercial life in this area, depriving thousands of families of their source of livelihood. According to the Hebron municipality, 512 Palestinian businesses in the affected areas of H2 have been closed by military order, and more than 1,000 others have shut down due to restricted access for customers and suppliers. The deteriorated economic situation in H2 area has affected the population`s food consumption levels. This is a consistent to trend in the poorest areas of the West Bank, where food insecurity is driven by high unemployment and poverty and not by the lack of food in the market. Referring to the Humanitarian report in H2, 98  percent of the households surveyed indicated that they had to adopt some type of coping mechanism to deal with food insecurity, primarily the consumption of food of reduced quantity and less quality and skip daily meals. In this context of deteriorating socio-economic and protection conditions, poor and food insecure pregnant and lactating women and children under five years old, who have special nutritional needs, are among the most vulnerable groups. Their existing hardships have exacerbated with additional massive movement and access due to the COVID 19 outbreak in the West Bank, impacting their food security and nutrition status . Movement restrictions and home quarantine forced Palestinian residents to stop going to their work in the oPt and in Israel. The lack of income could push vulnerable households to resort to coping strategies which will negatively impact their food security and nutrition status. Women are normally the first to be affected by lack of food in the house as food is diverted to the children or to the males in their families. To ensure access to nutritious food and increase the awareness of the most vulnerable groups in H2 area in Hebron City, this proposal focuses on supporting the food needs of 1,000 pregnant and lactating women and children under five years, facing deep poverty and food-insecurity. WFP will provide complementary food assistance (USD 10 per capita) on a monthly basis to mitigate the impact of people&apos;s reduced purchasing power and increased use of negative coping mechanisms. In order to synergize the efforts and have a comprehensive Maternal Infant Young Child -Emergency project, WFP in partnership with local NGO, potentially the Palestinian Medical Relief Society (PMRS), will target the same number of mothers (1,000) for nutrition awareness and behavior change activities, in addition to 100 men and 500 school children</narrative>
