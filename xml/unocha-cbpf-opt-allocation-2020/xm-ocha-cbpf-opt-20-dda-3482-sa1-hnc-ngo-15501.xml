   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The overall project objective is to continue PMRS&#x2019; core activities and mission to ensure that all Palestinians have the right to adequate, evidence based, fair and equitable healthcare, so they may live full and effective lives. We intend to do this by perpetuating our ethos and efforts with respect to focusing on prevention within our most vulnerable communities with the delivery of exemplary primary healthcare, with a focus on holistic health and a psycho-social model of care as the foundation of all our healthcare. In addition, in taking a completely collaborative approach with the view to ensuring long term sustainable impact is achieved, we endeavor to focus on activities that will further strengthen our overall health system, prepare and equip our communities through education and resilience building and ensure an overall inclusive strategy is implemented. We intend to achieve this in three of PMRS&#x2019; key strategic areas for our work in H2 in the next 10-12 months.  These include: 
-Expanding and strengthening our primary health care in two key areas: Mobile outreach for remote or cut off communities such as H2 
-Ensuring women and youth have access to SRH and SRHR in addition to effective and relevant health services. This involves our education and awareness sessions with women with respect to GBV topics. 
-MHPSS which in turn will ensure an engaged, resilient and prepared community through our various initiatives. These objectives will be addressed with the following activities 1. Ensuring all our mobile outreach teams in the H2 and Hebron area are sufficiently stocked and prepared with necessary equipment and requisite teams which consist of a multidisciplinary team including Doctors, nurses, MHPSS care team practitioners. Incorporated in our mobile outreach clinic practice is general screening and follow up for non-communicable diseases i.e. diabetes, hypertension etc. Women&#x2019;s health and SRH with pre and post-natal checks, screening including breast checks, PND and GBV related screening and support. Furthermore, more recently, our mobile outreach have expanded to include activities and support for PWD and families with PWD as well as MHPSS services and screening. In addition, in light of our most up to date research with UNFPA, we are working to strengthen our services with respect to SRH and SRHR to ensure women&#x2019;s needs are being addressed in this area. Lastly, we work with individuals to ensure our PWD demographic is being catered to and included and that importantly they don&#x2019;t just have access to existing services, that our services are also sensitive and specific to their needs. Importantly, with respect to health care services in H2 and Hebron, accessibility is a key issue for those living in this area and it is imperative that we address the inherent issues due to occupation and a restrictive permit system enforced by the IOF. Accessibility is a fundamental component of the right to access healthcare.</narrative>
