   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Humanitarian response to improve access to adequate shelter spaces for the vulnerable families living in extreme conditions in the Jordan Valley.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Action Against Hunger (AAH)&#x2019;s proposed intervention aims to address the needs listed in the 2020 oPt Humanitarian Needs Overview (HNO), specifically shelter needs in the Jordan Valley communities. This intervention aligns with the 2020 oPt Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP) through the project submitted by AAH in partnership with the Rural Center for Sustainable Development (RCSD) (reference HPSE20-6-159674-1). The most vulnerable communities of the Jordan Valley will be the main focus of this intervention in particular the communities of Al Mu&apos;arrajat East, Ibziq, Khirbet Yarza, Khirbet &apos;Atuf, and Khirbet ar Ras al Ahmar, extremely exposed to protection threats including Israeli administrative (demolitions) and military (firing) constraints and forcible transfers. These communities also suffer from severe weather conditions. Vulnerable families&#x2019; access to safe, adequate and healthy shelter spaces will be improved through the project activities, ensuring protection and dignity for family members. Households including one or more family member(s) with a disability will also be of specific focus their vulnerability is twofold as they deal with protection and social concerns daily. They are affected by limited access to basic services (including water, electricity, education, health care), while also suffering from socio-economic problems such as stigmatization and limited livelihood opportunities associated with the disability of one or more family member(s). Female-headed households will also be prioritized based on their vulnerability, using the material assistance ranking tool which will play an integral part in the selection of beneficiaries and design of project activities.

To improve the living conditions of targeted communities, project activities will span over 10 months and will be articulated around a)the upgrading/rehabilitation of 33 shelters for vulnerable and marginalized families living in communities in Jordan Valley Area C, including household adaptation for people with disabilities (PWDs), and b)the provision of 15 tents to Tubas Governorate for temporary shelter for displaced people, protecting the displaced families in periods of Israeli military trainings in these areas. 

AAH and RCSD have extensive experience in shelter projects and a strong understanding of the current protection and legal concerns of Area C and Jordan Valley communities. Both organizations will ensure protection mainstreaming and risk mitigation by employing a low-profile approach in rehabilitating structures from the inside and will select adequate working times to avoid exposure and prevent harm to the beneficiaries and communities. The partners will ensure that targeted communities are actively engaged in different phases of the project to foster a community-based approach through direct implementation methodology whereby beneficiaries will be supported with in-kind and cash-based assistance to rehabilitate their own shelter, increasing ownership and self-awareness of rights. Prior to the construction works, the selected households will be informed on their rights and potential risks involved with shelter rehabilitation as well as on land and property issues. The beneficiaries&#x2019; consent to all proposed project activities will be sought.

The proposed intervention is time sensitive for the targeted households, as these families may not be able to conduct maintenance and/or afford another summer and winter within their existing shelter conditions. The unsafe, insalubrious and uncomfortable situations these families experience daily create a destructive environment, affecting their resilience and eroding their capacities. This emergency response will provide much needed support to the targeted families through providing healthy and sturdy shelters, decreasing their exposure and vulnerability to enable them to withstand deteriorating living conditions.</narrative>
