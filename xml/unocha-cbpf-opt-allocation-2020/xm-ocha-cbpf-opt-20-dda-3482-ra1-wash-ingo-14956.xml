   <narrative xml:lang="EN">PREVENT WATER-BORNE DISEASE OUTBREAK THROUGH CRITICAL MAINTENANCE TO CRITICAL WASH FACILITIES AND DISINFECTION OF WATER SOURCES IN THE GAZA STRIP</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed project is designed in response to the recent appeal by CMWU at the WASH Cluster meeting (28 January 2020) and is in line with WASH Cluster&apos;s Objective 1) Ensure equitable, affordable and sustainable access to safe and sufficient WASH services with dignity for the unserved, underserved and most vulnerable Palestinians living under occupation in Gaza Strategic HRP Objective 2) and Sustainable Development Goal 6). The project aims to support the entire population of the Gaza Strip (i.e. 2,047,969 individuals with 44.1% children, % 27.7women, 28.2% men and 7% PWD) (according to pcbs population projection 2020) with access to safe water for drinking amp domestic use and reducing the risk of outbreaks of water-borne diseases in Gaza by ensuring the water is free from biological contamination. 
The project will target the entire population of the Gaza Strip, regardless of age, gender or disability. Although the project does not directly respond to the distinct needs of women, men, or elderly, the services provided under this project will ensure that all the population of the Gaza Strip has equal and meaningful access to safe drinking and domestic water. 
Key interventions will include:
- Conducting critical maintenance works for 5 essential water wells located in Beit Lahia and Bani Suhaila. These wells are: Salateen water well, Bisan water well and Bani Suhail water booster. The wells are located.
- Reconstruction of WASH facility destroyed on 5Feb in Beach Refugee Camp based on recommendation of WASH Cluster and OCHA.
- Conducting essential repair, maintenance and replacement of key spare parts for the chlorinators/chlorine dosing pumps, to ensure the right dose of sodium hypochlorite is injected in the pumped water through the network.
- Ensuring over 99% disinfection efficiency of all water distribution system in the Gaza Strip through provision of chlorine to cover 284 water wells, 55 water reservoirs, 26 water lifting and booster stations, over 2,987 km of water networks and carrier lines, 48 small-medium sized brackish water desalination plants (50m3/day to 1000m3/day), and three connections of Mekorot water supply across the Green Line with Israel with average total annual supply capacity of 10MCM. 
- Carry out regular and consistent water quality testing for three months Samples from 580 locations across the Gaza Strip will be tested for water quality and/or residual chlorine level on a monthly basis to monitor water quality amp or residual chlorine level to ensure safe water delivery to the population of Gaza. All test results will be logged into the monitoring database to inform actions required for water safety plans.

This project aims to fill in short-term funding gap by providing chlorine and essential maintenance to pre-identified water wells. After the 3 months, it will be the responsibility of CMWU to continue to mobilise resources and collection mechanisms to cover the cost of chlorine for the rest of the year. Carrying out critical preventive and corrective maintenance of essential WASH facilities will increase the lifespan of WASH facilities and improve service delivery on the mid-term and possibly longer-term. The project will also target public desalination plants including the ones in marginalised and vulnerable areas ensuring women amp children benefit equally as men and other vulnerable groups.
Human Appeal (HA) initiated work in Palestine in 2017 and has registered offices in Gaza and the West Bank. HA is fully operational in Gaza with qualified and experienced field staff, has complete access in the target locations and has the necessary resources for ensuring a successful implementation of the project. Furthermore, HA regularly coordinates with the PWA, CMWU, UN, and other actors. We maintain regular communication with area focal points and ensure that all our projects are well-coordination. HA also participates in sub working groups e.g. WASH in Health.</narrative>
