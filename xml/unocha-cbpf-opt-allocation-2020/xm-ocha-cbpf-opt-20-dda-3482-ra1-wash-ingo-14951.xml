   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Enhanced quality of life for communities at risk of flooding in Jabalia</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Due to the poor storm water network in most of Gaza residential areas, communities use the sewage network to drain the rainwater, and this in turn caused the overloading of sewage networks and the sewage pumping stations. This pressure caused breakages in sewer pipes, causing storm water mixing with sewage water that in turn over-floods residential areas and sewage pumping stations. Due to poor infrastructure and power outages, Jabalia area is often subject to frequent floods of rainwater mixed with sewage, as rainwater is drained through sewage networks in most areas. 
Al Saftawi basin was constructed in a residential area at the western of Jabalia, with a total volume of 41,000 m3. The filtration system is insufficient and its efficiency has reduced due to accumulate of sludge and the sewage flood into the basin. In January 2020, the area was subjected to two successive floods and more than 7000 people were directly affected by the flood, while the flood caused restriction to the movement of 15,000 persons. The proposed project aims to mitigate the flooding and health risk for more than 7,000 persons in Jabalia and is designed to reduce the HHs and the public&#x2019;s loss of economy and livelihood assets through improving the capacity of two main storm water facilities. Under the first outcome, the drainage capacity in Al Saftawi basin will be improved by constructing a new 2,150 m of 18-inch storm water pressure pipeline to discharge rain water from the basin to the existing storm water gravity pipeline. In parallel, SC will   carry out awareness raising activities to improve the flood risk awareness as well as hygiene promotion for 3,200 people from the targeted communities surrounding the storm water basins. 
The project proposal directly responds to the allocation strategy where it will address the need to repair pumping stations and storm-water facilities in order to deal with storm-water and wastewater floods. This will enhance the winter preparedness and protection for 21,000 vulnerable and unprotected people in Jabalia from storm-water and wastewater flooding. The project will reduce public health hazards affecting the targeted population by introducing mitigating measures to prevent untreated sewage contaminating critical water sources in the area, the flow of untreated sewage directly to streets damaging the surrounding environment.
The project builds on SCI experience in the oPt since 1956, and the established strong relationships with key stakeholders. SCI has extensive experience in directly implementing WASH projects in Gaza, where it is currently the WASH Cluster focal point for North Gaza and is part of the WASH Monitoring group. The proposed project will leverage SCI&#x2019;s close working relationship with the PWA and CMWU for all WASH components, as well as other implementers of WASH interventions and local partners within the WASH Cluster.</narrative>
