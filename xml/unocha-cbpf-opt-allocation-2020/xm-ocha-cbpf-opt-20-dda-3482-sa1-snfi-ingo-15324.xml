   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Urgent emergency response aiming at improving the living conditions of highly-vulnerable and deeply under-served Palestinian families in Area C in Jordan Valley area. It consists on a tailored package of interventions involving the rehabilitation of shelters for households exposed to and affected by natural or man-made hazards
The action includes the rehabilitation and/or upgrading of 63 shelters reducing the exposure of targeted beneficiaries to both man-made and natural disasters, weather conditions, risk of water borne diseases and health problems. Specifically: in Jericho community the action consists of transferring the targeted shelters, made of un-protected wood, zinc and tent covers, to block with isolated roof in Tubas and Ramallah communities, will be rehabilitated the existing tents through floor casting, building a perimeter of 1m walls and, for families with PWDs, the rehabilitation of the tents&#x2019; surroundings. Further, in Jordan valley communities, the action intends to assist households who lack shelter protective materials providing the needed fencing and rehabilitating PWDs&#x2019; access to the shelters, contributing to reduce the risk of settlers&#x2019; and IF&#x2019;s violence and mitigating the effects, vulnerabilities and risks associated with living in Jordan Valley communities, especially for elderly and people with disabilities.
The action, is fully in line with the 2020 HRP Strategic Objective 2 and 3, addressing the West Bank&#x2019;s purposes of the allocation strategy. The activities contribute to the Shelter Cluster Objective 1 and 2 &#x2013; 
the basic needs of vulnerable Palestinians living under occupation are met through the provision of quality basic services and improved access to resources, displaced populations are provided support that mitigates immediate harm and ensures adequate and safe temporary shelter solutions, through the rehabilitation of substandard housing units, the provision of coaching/training for shelter rehabilitation through the community implementation approach (self-conducted HHs rehabilitation), and the provision of protective material assistance.
The intervention complies with the minimum shelter cluster standards for adequate housing, gender, and adequate access to housing by people with disabilities. Specifically, the proposed activities consist in a full rehabilitation and/or upgrading of concrete and stones shelters, in WASH works, and provision of technical coaching/training for shelter rehabilitation.
Providing adequate shelters will contribute to dignity and safety of beneficiaries, reducing the risk of IF violence and mitigating the effects of eviction on the affected families, vulnerabilities and risks associated with living under the threat of annexation for their communities. These activities will also support communities&#x2019; resilience in face of protracted threats, chronic vulnerability and eviction threats. Shelter rehabilitation and upgrading activities, coupled with the implementation of a community participation methodology, will allow to advance in the fulfillment of the objectives, empowering communities in terms of coping capacities, ownership and expertise, and protection response mechanisms. 
The 9 selected communities are located in  3 Governorates: Tubas, Ramallah and Jericho. The community in Ramallah is close to Jericho and people go to Jericho most of the services
The leading agency of the action is WW&#x2013;GVC, in partnership with Palestinian Housing Council PHC: two NGOs complementing each-other experiences. WW-GVC has offices in Tubas and Ramallah while PHC has offices in Nablus and Ramallah therefore ensuring a constant and close activity follow-up, WW-GVC is responsible to transfer protection knowledge in rehabilitation to PHC.</narrative>
