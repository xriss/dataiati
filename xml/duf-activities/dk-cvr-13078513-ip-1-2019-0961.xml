   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Pilot project: Improving Jordanian children?s health and rights by increasing trust in the healthcare system</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">IMCC is a non-profit student, volunteer-based organization with the  vision  ?To create a fair world, in which all have equitable access to health, and are physically, mentally and socially healthy.? Our proposed project is well within this vision as we will work with children directly as well as through their parents.  As such, an essential part in reaching the vision of IMCC is for us to make sure that relevant information is accessible for parents to make an informed decision regarding the health of their children. It is also essential for us to engage children directly with the Jordanian healthcare system in a positive way. As an organization, IMCC is governed democratically and composed of a national board, six regional boards (Aalborg, Aarhus, Copenhagen, Esbjerg, Odense, Roskilde), approximately 30 activity groups, and a secretariat with three full time employees and one student assistant. IMCC has approximately 1800 members working voluntarily in the different activities all aiming to reach the above-mentioned vision. These activities are divided into four groups; International Exchange programs, Education and Information, Society and Debate and Development and Aid. There is  great opportunity to collaborate and gather knowledge with and through other IMCC activities such as the other 9 international partnerships through the collaborative called ?the Green Group?, where all international partnerships share knowledge and do workshops together, Universities Allied for Essential Medicines (UAEM) who works for equal access to medication and The Teddy Bear Hospital who works with improving children?s trust in doctors.</narrative>
