   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Many girls in Uganda are vulnerable and move to Lake Victoria where many end up in prostitution The local partner, Kamuzinda Community Outreach Association (KCOA), in Uganda has a big heart for those girls and want to start a girls project KCOA is an outreach centre that aims to help locals with sustainable farming and social work They have told us about a vision of connecting the farm with a project that can give these girls another chance One of our local partners said ?if you train a girl, you train the entire society, because girls have a lot to say in child rearing So we want the girls to see that they are important and give them the resource to speak up in their society? The purpose with the preparatory study is to examine if the project will be suitable as a pilot project, by researching about the girls and their needs and wishes We also want to network with locals who could be interested in volunteering in the project, look for possibilities to involve the local youth, find similar projects and see what we can learn from them Through the preparatory study we also want to compose a financial plan for the project and set up pros and cons by having the project on the demonstration farm</narrative>
