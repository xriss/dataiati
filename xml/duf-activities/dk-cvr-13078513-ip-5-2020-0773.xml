   <narrative xml:lang="EN">With this application we are applying for a Partner Identification in Nepal with NNDSWO We have been in contact with each other for the last year, and we do have an idea about what a potential future project could look like, as well as a sense of mutual ambitions on behalf of our respective groups - but we still need to work on our foundation, and most importantly match our expectations in a partnership   When we first got in contact last year after a conference about international partnerships, we matched because both our organizations work hard on creating an environment where young people feel heard and where they can express themselves in democratic ways Both organizations aspire young people to be a part of a community where their participation matters and where they can grow into strong and responsible citizens All of this happens while they participate in or organize projects for their peers, and that?s where we see a huge potential with an international project like this; what existing projects can we learn from, what can we create with this target group and how can we build an even stronger group of young people in both Nepal and Denmark</narrative>
