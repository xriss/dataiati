  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">As the first partnership project between DRCY and MRCS ended this year this preparatory study will seek to gather all lessons learned in order to get a full overview of how to best continue with a new partnership project. The previous partnership focused on strengthening youth in the districts of Mwanza, Mangochi and Chikwawa through skill-development and community-based youth activities as well as capacity-building of local and national youth structures. It was implemented as a parallel project to the youth component of the MRCS Community Resilience Project (ComRep), supported by the Danish Red Cross (DRC). MRCS and DRC has agreed to initiate a new phase of ComRep running from 2020-2023, as it has shown great impact including great results regarding the empowerment of the youth in both MRCS and in the targeted districts.  The purpose of this study is therefore to tie together the recently ended partnership with a new, by ensuring that all details are discussed to safeguard a close integration with the new ComRep and a close involvement of MRCS. The study will prioritise workshops with core volunteers and staff from MRCS. This application has been developed in a participatory process including volunteers from the DRCY YPA network and two board members from the MRCS Youth who took part in the DRCY AGM in October 2019 and with inputs from the DRCY secretary.</narrative>
