   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The four youth leaders will be attached to our Youth First program in A?t Ourir in Morocco. The aim with the exchange is to work in depth with the project on the actual location. The leaders will work on spreading awareness in the local area, which will be done through a more intense focus on social media and social gatherings with the youth of A?t Ourir and making local exhibitions showing the youth projects. By consistently spreading awareness, making the project familiar to the citizens and arranging gatherings where young people can come and learn about their role in their community as well as getting the tools to carry out their visions in their local area. A focus will also be in building the Youth First Alumina together with the mentors. The Danish youth and the Moroccan youth will support AFCD in reaching the goals in the Partnership project and work in depth with the cultural obstacles and analyze what can be done to prevent this. At the same time, the exchange will connect the partners in the partnership even more and make sustainable relations that will strengthen future cooperation.</narrative>
