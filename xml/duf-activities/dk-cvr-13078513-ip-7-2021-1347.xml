   <narrative xml:lang="EN">After 4 years of cooperation, we want to discuss new aspects of our partnership.  Due to corona we want to see if we could find a way to arrange the local forum day from our Partnership Project. We still think this activity is important for our partnership. We want to involve the elected officials of Aalborg and F?s to create other channels of collaboration between the various actors of the two cities.  Another aspect of our partnership is democracy. Both AY and CSworks daily with democracy and the involment of youngpeople in community life and the promotion of youth participation through participatory democracy mechanisms and citizen participation. For this project, we want to involve the peer education group ?Aalborg Youth council? in our partnership so the peer education approach can combine the peer education group ?Sexualisterne? with the ?Youth council in Aalborg and the local youth council in COS. We want to train and support its organs and the use of peer education as a means of training and sensitizing young people for effective participation in local governance.</narrative>
