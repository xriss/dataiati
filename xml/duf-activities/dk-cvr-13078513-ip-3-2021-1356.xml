   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project aims to increase the impact and stability of the STUDEM youth centre in Balti Moldova. The centre was established in 2019 after 2 years of cooperation between Silba and CREEDD. The Centre has shown to be very popular for the young people of Balti mainly due to the large responsibility and ownership the youth itself can take. Contrary to many Moldovan youth centres, -politics, and activities, STUDEM is managed by a youth board of 11 democratically chosen youngsters in the age of 12-30. These 11 board members are managing the centres activities, the general assembly, the physical space, and two youth grants. Furthermore, the centre supplies trainings, social events and educational activities in relevant topics and is a platform for youth initiatives made by youth for youth promoting voluntarism, Moldovan culture, freedom under responsibility, trust and transparency, and civic activism. The current project aims to increase the centre?s outreach to more vulnerable groups and establishing an advocacy campaign to promote a relevant youth topic in Balti. All activites that implies learning by doing methods and has representativeness and needs assessments at its core.</narrative>
