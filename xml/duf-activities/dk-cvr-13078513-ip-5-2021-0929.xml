   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Summary of Partner Identification:  Today Belarus is widely considered to be Europe?s only authoritarian regime. The Belarusian people, and particularly youth, are under great pressure by their lack of civil liberties such as their inability to organise,  and exercise free speech, and in their right to protest. Silba wishes to establish a partnership in which we can work with a partner organisation to strengthen the youth of Belarus through dialogue and youth empowerment. It is on this basis that we have established contact with, and wish to further develop the potential for a future partnership with the Belarusian Youth Organisation ?Civil Forum?. Further exploration of this potential partnership, through a partner identification, is now necessary to ensure the strengthening of our relationship and the possibility of engaging in and encouraging the budding hope for a stronger democratic culture through the youth of Belarus. The purpose of this project would be to strengthen youth empowerment, democratic participation, and the relation between our two countries.</narrative>
