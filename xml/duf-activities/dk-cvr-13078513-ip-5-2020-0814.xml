   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Destination:  The destination is Kampala, Uganda - Concretely: Kasubi Parents School  Overall purpose of project:  1) to help the Ugandan partner-students establish more democratic student institutions - such as a student council with real influence on school decisions -  and a culture of more voluntarism, democratic participation and gender equality at Kasubi Parents school, which could - longer term - inspire other schools to take some of the same steps, and then potentially, translate into a more vibrant democratic civil society in general in Uganda. 2) To inspire the Danish students to engage even more in their own democracy and national fight for gender equality, and likewise continue their strive for the world-wide broadening of democratic rights and formation of a gender equal global culture.   Purpose of the partnership identification:  To find out if the values and goals of Kasubi Parents School and Rysensteen are as much aligned on democratic rights and gender equality that they have seemed to be during online conversations. And to agree on the next concrete steps in the project - that is:  Establishing a functioning student council with real influence on school strategic decisions Finding concrete ways to promote a more gender equal culture - through fx. campaigns, leadership programs etc. Finding ways to involve as many students in the project, and hereby - through concrete involvement - help promote a culture of voluntarism Agreeing on the communication lines and collaboration guidelines between the voluntary students at Kasubi high and Rysensteen high school  The trip and the Corona-virus:  We plan to travel in November, but are - due to the Corona-virus - flexible with regards to the travel dates. We are open potentially open to traveling all of 2021. We are hoping to establish a long term collaboration, that will last for many, many years.</narrative>
