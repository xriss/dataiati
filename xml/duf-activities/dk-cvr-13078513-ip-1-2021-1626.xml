   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Through a collaboration that exploits the best of both organizations, YWCA of Zambia &amp; VU wants toestablish a mentorship programme. The aim of the pilot project is therefore to teach young people, whose lives have hitherto been difficult, that they, too, are worthy and capable of becoming part of society. The mentorship program will initially take place in a youth center chosen in collaboration between the two organizations. Whereas the core activity will therefore be to facilitate mentoring sessions, other activities include developing the mentor guidelines as well as recruiting and educating mentors. Moreover, the pilot project is tightly connected to DUF?s development triangle as its core focus is mentoring sessions for children and young people. Moreover, it will build organizational capacity for YWCA, strengthening ties to youth centers in need. Finally, the program will strengthen the young people?s capacity to express their needs, ambitions, and hopes for the future. The pilot project will take place between January &amp; July 2022 and will be strengthened by the capacity and presence of local as well as Danish Youth leaders.</narrative>
