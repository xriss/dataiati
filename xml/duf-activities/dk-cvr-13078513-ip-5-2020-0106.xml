   <narrative xml:lang="EN">A project group in Ung Mosaik has due to previous trips to Lebanon and contact with the potential partner, Eagles in Christ (ECY), a desire to determine whether a formalized partnership between the two organizations can be established The project group has seen a great need of support and help in the suburb of Beirut where ECY is located, which is an area with a huge influx of Syrian refugees ECY?s initiative to empower and educate the local youth has sparked an interest in the Danish group to support this objective in order to have an even greater impact and sustainability ECY has a vision to build up capacity in at-risk youth to become active agents in their own lives, instead of being passive victims of war and injustice and to participate actively in their local communities Through activities, workshops and meetings during a partner identification trip our goal is to determine if a future sustainable partnership is possible The dream scenario is to lay the ground of a fruitful partnership that supports and empowers the leaders in ECY to have a greater impact on the Syrian and Lebanese youth at risk</narrative>
