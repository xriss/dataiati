   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Due to long distances and shortage of boarding facilities at
Fr. Borghols Vocational Training Institute, the Ngora Trust
approached JOA with a project to convert a dilapidated
Chapel building to boarding facilities for girls as many miss
out on vital services offered by the Institute. Many feel very
vulnerable and easily fall out of education programmes due
to socio-economic pressures. It is for this reason that most
parents are wary of putting their daughters in a school that
does not have adequate and secure boarding facilities. The
new dormitory once constructed, furnished and fenced in,
would provide a safe and conducive environment for the girl
students at the Institute. It would enhance concentration and
stability of the girls on courses thereby contributing greatly
towards realization of the Institute&#x2019;s overall goal of passing
out job creators and community developers.
JOA awarded a grant of &#xA3;80,547 and a further grant of &#xA3;10,133
to be issued in 2016.</narrative>
