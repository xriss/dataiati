   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Equileap works to accelerate gender equality in the formal workplace as a powerful but neglected lever for addressing poverty and inequality. In this project it is conducting research looking at gender balance and equality in African companies. Unequal opportunities for women in businesses affect companies&#x2019; efficiency and growth. They can have negative consequences for their reputation, ability to hire the best people as well as profits. The results of the Equileap research will provide much needed transparency on exactly how African companies perform on gender equality. This research will have a triple impact bringing positive returns for investors, companies and women in the African region. Impact for Investors: Gender Lens Investing- Investors will be able to identify those companies is Frontier Markets in Africa with the highest gender equality. Moreover, investors in frontier markets will have a list of those companies with the least gender inequality and will be able to chose what companies to invest in based on gender equality performance indicators. Companies will be able to identify the areas where they still need to invest in and grow in terms of women&#x2019;s empowerment and gender equality. And there will be. Better jobs and career opportunities for women. Equileap is researching 120 companies from 20 countries in Africa</narrative>

   <description>
    <narrative xml:lang="EN">Activities for this quarter: Equileap began the recruitment of a specialist Research Analyst - Emerging Markets, for this project. In January 2018, Equileap hired a qualified Researcher who began work on 20th February 2018. The Research Assistant is based in Nairobi, Kenya, she was trained by the Director of Research in Equileap&apos;s research methodology and introduced to the rest of the team. The Universe was selected and 121 African companies in the target countries with a market capitalisation of USD 250 Million were included. In collaboration with the team, questionnaires were finalised to go out to the relevant companies. Contact details were collected and the questionnaires sent out. Research on 27 companies had begun by the end of this period, March 31, 2018. The technical team has been working in Q1 on expanding and professionalising the Equileap database in order to make the research gathering process for the research analysts and the engagement process with companies through questionnaires more efficient by developing the outline for an online portal. The groundwork for this new online portal has been finalised, resulting amongst other things in a report setting out the necessary IT roadmap for the required development work that is needed for the rest of the year.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">During Q4 2018, we realised that our research results can be sensitive to the location of our researchers. Internet search engines customise the search results leading to a potential bias or inaccuracy. To minimise this risk, we decided to do a final evaluation of all 120 companies by 2 Equileap researchers based in London and Amsterdam. They conducted another round of evaluation of the companies in the African universe. When the dataset was completed and finalised, we incorporated it into our database. We analysed the results and provided insights by country, sector, and against the Top 200 global benchmark, i.e. the top 200 companies performing in gender equality. We prepared a report with key findings, identifying the top performers and the laggards and highlighting the areas where African companies can improve.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">During this quarter, the 4 interns (hired by the partner institute on behalf of Equileap) have completed the research for the 121 companies using Equileaps 19 Criteria. The quality control checks have been done for this research. The Executive Review Committee helped to tailor the questionnaire to the African context. All their suggestions were collated in Questionnaire Review Suggestions. The most notable edit was the decision to change the terms in Q7 (Parental leave) from &#x201C;primary carer&#x201D; and &#x201C;secondary carer&#x201D; to &#x201C;maternity&#x201D; and &#x201C;paternity&#x201D; leave respectively as this is the commonly used reference in African countries. The Equileap Questionnaire was sent to the 121 African companies on 23rd July with an anticipated return date on 23rd August. The research analyst in collaboration with the interns contacted (by phone) the companies with respect to the questionnaire. The responses to the questionnaires by the companies have so far been very low with a 0.82% return rate. That notwithstanding, the received questionnaires have been checked and the incorporation of answers is now underway.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">During this quarter, we set up an expert review committee to revise and review our questionnaires and ranking. The committee comprises 11 professionals (5 men, 6 women) representative of the North, South, East and West African region. The committee has been instrumental in helping to review and edit our questionnaire which will be sent out to the 121 companies we are researching. Equileap has partnered with the British Institute of Eastern Africa (BIEA) which has offices in Nairobi, Kenya and London, United Kingdom. The BIEA is an age-old institute which offers logistical assistance to research projects in Eastern Africa. The role of the BIEA as the Partner Institute is to provide 4 research assistants to help with the research, sit on our Expert Review Committee to help review the research questionnaire and the final report (planned for December 2018) as well as provide support to find a location and co-host an event to publish the report (planned the first quarter of 2019) Research for 121 African companies in the Universe is complete using the Equileap 7 deep dive criteria. Through the BIEA, Equileap has hired four interns to help research the 121 companies using the Equileap 19 criteria. The research is underway and the interns have so far researched 37/121 companies in our Universe by June 30 2018.</narrative>
