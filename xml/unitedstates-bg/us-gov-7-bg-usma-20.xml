    <narrative xml:lang="EN">Bulgaria actively participates in North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and European Union operations, and is a reliable U.S. ally in a region of strategic importance to the United States. Bulgaria&apos;s Ministry of Defense remains committed to the transformation of its military from a large, static force to a more expeditionary military capable of deploying with its NATO partners to face the new security challenges of the 21st century. The FY 2017 request will support training and modernization of Bulgaria&apos;s military. U.S. assistance will continue to pay dividends by creating a more efficient, expeditionary, NATO-interoperable force in Bulgaria, with units capable of deploying alongside U.S. forces. U.S. assistance will advance defense reform, build capacity, and strengthen partnerships in the region to more effectively counter Russian aggression and other emerging threats.</narrative>
