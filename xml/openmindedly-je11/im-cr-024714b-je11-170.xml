   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Philippines were hit by a series of natural disasters which caused damage and destruction to an already vulnerable population. Around 3,000 families across 50 provinces were affected by Typhoon Nesat and Typhoon Nalgae, the majority of whom resided in 32 temporary evacuation centres including schools. Tropical Storm Ramon also affected 16,711 families, causing 634 families to seek temporary refuge in 11 evacuation centres. Water and sanitation soon became a major concern, especially in areas which were inundated. The rising incidence of diarrhea and respiratory tract infections coupled with the limited access to basic health services also increased the risk of acute malnutrition in children. Additionally, many schools had been heavily damaged and were in need of structural repair along with the provision of new school supplies to replace those which had been destroyed. JOAC awarded UNICEF &#xA3;30,000 to provide food, health kits, water kits and other essential non-food items such as tarpaulins, cooking sets, soap and blankets and school kits.</narrative>
