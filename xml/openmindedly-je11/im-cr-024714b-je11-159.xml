   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Chad experienced a devastating cholera epidemic which spread throughout the Chad Basin with over 38,000 cases reported and more than 1,200 people dying since the beginning of the outbreak, making it the worst epidemic in the country&#x2019;s history. JOAC awarded British Red Cross &#xA3;30,000 to provide chlorine to disinfect homes, latrines and wells thus reducing the number of potential reservoirs which may have been harbouring the disease. In addition to this, 200 wells in affected areas were protected from contamination (or re-contamination), through the construction of physical barriers around the wells, which prevented rain water flowing into the water supply. Vulnerable families with little or no access to sanitation facilities were also supported in the construction of their own latrines and through the provision of soap and jerry cans which were distributed to 10,000 and 8,000 families respectively.</narrative>
