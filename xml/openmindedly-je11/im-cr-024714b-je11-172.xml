   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Mauritania was facing a severe crisis due to the convergent effects of drought, chronic poverty and a sharp rise in food prices. By January 2012 it was estimated that 920,000 people would be affected by food insecurity and the number was projected to climb. Approximately one-third of the population would require food assistance with over one in ten children malnourished and suffering from life-threatening severe acute malnutrition. Lack of clean water was further compounding the risk of disease outbreaks among children who already suffered from malnutrition. JOAC awarded UNICEF &#xA3;30,000 for the provision of ready to use therapeutic food supplies and the delivery of basic health care services including vaccines, Vitamin A supplements and de-worming tablets. The Commission also supported the provision of clean water as well as sanitation services to drought-affected communities which included supplies such as water jerry cans, collapsible water tanks, oral rehydration salts, basic family water kits and tents.</narrative>
