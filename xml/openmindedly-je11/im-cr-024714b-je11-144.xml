   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Expected rains across east Africa largely failed and with a serious shortage of water for children and their families, lead to widespread devastation of farmland, failed harvests and livestock deaths. Families lost incomes and food supplies and prices soared. As a result, over 7 million people faced a devastating food crisis. Kenya was amongst those countries seriously affected. JOAC awarded Save the Children &#xA3;30,000 to aid distribution of essential items such as water treatment tablets and hygiene items to 8,000 vulnerable children and their families. These items had been specifically chosen to give people the essentials they would need to get their lives back on track. Items were distributed along with key health, hygiene and nutrition messages to ensure maximum benefit for vulnerable individuals and families.</narrative>
