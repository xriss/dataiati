   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Food Crisis, West Africa</narrative>
  </title>
  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Millions of people across West Africa were again at risk of a serious food crisis. Low rainfall, poor harvests, high food prices and a lack of pasture were all causing serious problems across the region, pointing to a likely food crisis in the first months of 2012. This came as vulnerable communities were only just beginning to move out of recovery following the last food crisis in the region in June 2010. Early reports suggested that 6 million people in Niger and 2.9 million people in Mali would be vulnerable to the coming crisis, while in Mauritania 700,000 people, over a quarter of the population, were reported to be at risk. In Burkina Faso, official estimates were likely to include over two million people at risk. In Chad, 13 out of 22 regions could also be affected by food insecurity. Early warning systems had worked well to alert the humanitarian community and Oxfam and other aid agencies had a window of opportunity by being able to immediately act thus saving lives and avoiding disaster.</narrative>
