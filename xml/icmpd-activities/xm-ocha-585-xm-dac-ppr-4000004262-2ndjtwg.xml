From the ICMPD side, the project manager took the opportunity to welcome all to the virtual meeting and reiterated ICMPD&#x2019;s commitment to ensuring that the project objectives are delivered and focused on a victim-centered approach.

Adoption of the minutes of the Inaugural meeting: The report of the JTWC inaugural meeting which had hitherto being shared by ICMPD (both in English and French) was unanimously adopted. 

Matter Arising, Discussions and Conclusion

a.	Status of the Draft MoU: NAPTIP with support from the Nigeria Ministry of Justice provided update on the status and internal processes required for the signing of the draft MoU. Prior to the meeting, both NAPTIP and ANLTP-TIM had agreed on the zero draft of the MoU and each agency was required to carry out consultation with their national stakeholders in line with their respective national procedures. From the Nigeria side, the Federal Ministry of Justice reported that it had completed the vetting of the draft MoU that largely entailed the readjustment of the structure of the document in line with its standard template with no additional input to the content.  As such, it was agreed that the latest version of the draft MoU be shared with ICMPD (both English and French) who will then forward to the Niger side for concurrence. Thereafter, the date for the signing ceremonies will be determined

b.	Joint Caravan Sensitization initiative: Both NAPTIP and ANLTP took turns to update on the justification, modalities and expectations for the sensitization initiatives scheduled to hold in the last week of September. The sensitization exercise is targeted at the local population living around the border communities on both the Nigeria and Niger sides. While NAPTIP is focusing its outreach exercise at the Babura local government area of Jigawa State and Kongolum area of Katsina, the ANLTP-TIM is focusing its efforts in Zinder, Niger. The sensitization activity is designed to hold concurrently on both sides of the border.

c.	Protection and Victim Assistance: NAPTIP took the lead to provide update on the current state and wellbeing of Miss Gloria Edobor and the on-going effort being made towards the investigation of her traffickers. Recall that the project successfully facilitated the return of Miss Gloria Edobor (VoT) from Agadez, Niger to Abuja. It was agreed that Miss. Gloria might recover faster if she is transferred to Benin City, Nigeria where members of her family reside but will remain under the custody of the NAPTIP Benin zonal command not to expose her to further vulnerability until investigation is concluded. 

AOB
&#x2022;	The ICMPD team is considering the joint training initiative proposed by NAPTIP and the timeline for its implementation will be communicated to the focal points of both the ANLTP-TIM and NAPTIP in due course.
