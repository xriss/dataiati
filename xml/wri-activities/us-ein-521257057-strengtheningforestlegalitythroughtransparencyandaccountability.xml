  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Strengthening Forest Legality through Transparency and Accountability Project builds on previous rounds of FGMC support. The first round supported WRI to launch Global Forest Watch (GFW), an online platform monitoring forests everywhere in near-real time. In the second round, WRI worked to demonstrate how transparency combined with customized information technology solutions could strengthen timber legality enforcement and private sector compliance, and drive greater accountability for tropical forest management.   

In the third FGMC round, WRI will deepen gains in forest and timber trade transparency while securing emerging processes and practices to hold governments and the private sector accountable for forest management and land use decisions. GFW remains central, and the Project will maintain and expand the global functions and reach of GFW. We will also expand ongoing engagement with actors and political processes globally and in key VPA and processing countries (Cameroon, Republic of Congo, China) to scale use of targeted information technology solutions.  These include: 

Forest Watcher &#x2013; a mobile app that brings near-real time deforestation alerts offline and into the field to assist law enforcement and civil society to identify and interdict forest crime.
Forest Atlases &#x2013; nationalized versions of the GFW platform owned and operated by forest ministries to enhance forest land use transparency and related policy enforcement.

Open Timber Portal (OTP) &#x2013; a web-based platform promoting trade in legal forest products by compiling information about forest sector compliance from government, companies and third-party forest monitors in producer countries.

Uptake of these tools will support governments and private sector to implement their commitments to eliminate deforestation and illegal logging, and enable civil society to hold these actors accountable for their commitments.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">Continuous engagement with users
Throughout the course of the grant, we engaged with OTP users, in particular importers, EU and UK competent authorities, Congo-Basin logging companies as well as Independent Forest Monitors. We also presented the OTP to government representatives at key events such as the ITTO Council Meeting in Togo and the EGILAT meeting &#x201C;Advancing the trade and distribution of legally harvested forest products in the APEC Region&#x201D; in Malaysia. Overall, we collected a total of 21 documented use cases for the OTP: 10 are about governments, 5 about the private sector, 3 about local CSOs and 3 about other FGMC or UKaid grantees. By the end of the grant, the number of new OTP users exceeded our expectations. Between the OTP release in 2018 and the end of the project in 2020, more than 6,500 new users located both in producer and consumer countries visited the OTP. We observed greater uptake from some major importing companies, who not only use the OTP regularly for their due diligence process but also started to actively reach out to their suppliers, asking them to make their compliance documents public on the OTP. This supported our outreach efforts towards Congo Basin logging companies, that shared an increased number of documents, significantly increasing the transparency of the forest sector in the region.  
In FY20-21, the OTP also started to gain traction with different government agencies in various producer and consumer countries. We received requests to further explore synergies with the VPA process and TLAS system deployment in Congo and Cameroon. We explored with customs officers how the OTP could better support law enforcement in Cameroon. Several U.S. government agencies contacted us, explaining how they use the OTP to guide importers who have to comply with the Lacey Act, to document cases, and to train law enforcement officials in Africa. The Korean Forest Service also requested the platform to be translated to Korean to support their efforts to lead Korean importers towards legal and more responsible sourcing. 
 
From a 2-country beta portal to an improved stable version covering 5-countries, available in 6 languages
User feedback informed the OTP development, from the 2017 pilot version available for RoC and DRC to a successful, improved stable version covering the entire Congo-Basin. Several upgraded versions were released throughout the course of the grant. In addition to new designs, improved and new features, we added Cameroon on the portal in April 2019 and Gabon and Central African Republic in December 2020. We also translated the portal to Chinese, Korean, Vietnamese and Japanese to support outreach to importers operating in Asian markets. 
 
More data, higher quality data
Throughout the course of the grant, we worked closely with Congo Basin logging companies and Independent Forest Monitors to train them on how to upload their data on the OTP. We also set-up, fine-tuned and implemented quality control processes to review company documents and IFM observations. The number of documents publicly accessible on the portal grew from less than 200 to almost 1,000 documents. Most of the 1,200 observations than had been initially uploaded to the beta version of the OTP were revised and more recent ones were uploaded.
 
OTP official launch
During Forest Legality Week in early October 2019, we officially launched the OTP, presenting it to a packed room of forest legality experts. We heard from Matthew Cassetta of the US Department of State, Patrick Duggan of the US Department of Justice, Jon Knut Berg of the Norwegian Embassy to the US, and Marieke Wit of the FGMC PMST. They showed how the information on the OTP can help better enforce forest laws.
 
Development of resources for OTP users 
We developed several support tools to increase the OTP uptake by users. These documents include a joint brochure for wood importers that we developed together with ZSL and other organizations (ATIBT, ETTF, NEPCon and BVRio) to disambiguate between different tools. The OTP brochure was translated to French, Chinese, Korean, Vietnamese and Japanese.
 
Coordination with other FGMC subgrantees
We worked closely with FGMC grantee ZSL to incorporate OTP data and scores into their legality indicators for their SPOTT assessment. We also attended several coordination calls with FERN and coordinated with CIDT on the CV4C project.</narrative>

   <description>
    <narrative xml:lang="EN">During the project period, the Forest Atlas database was continuously updated, and technical support given to the new team members from the cartographic service of MINFOF, as the former members were assigned elsewhere. We carried out an assessment to identify the needs of various stakeholders relating to the use of the tools included in the Forest Atlas and GFW for their duties on a daily basis. Following the assessment, we revised the structure of the database by including new data sets such as log yards, forest management indicators, and statistics displayed as dashboards on the platform online. New attributes were included in some layers, such as Annual Harvesting Areas to guide the analysis on the forest titles status. Trainings were carried out in the northern, southwest and central services of MINFOF to reinforce their capacity in forest monitoring and protected areas management using Atlas data, Forest Watcher, GLAD and fire alerts. Two training sessions using the same framework were delivered to Civil Society Organizations and the private sector to reinforce their capacity in forest and natural resources monitoring, and to enable them to play their role in sustainable agriculture commodity production. The team also supported the Ministry of Economy, Planning and Regional Development (MINEPAT) to design and develop a Land Use Portal, another channel where the forest data can be visualized and be used in decision-making processes. 
We also contributed to the publication of the annual report on landmark deforestation events (LDEs), drafted as part of Cameroon&apos;s Forest Cover Monitoring activities by the Ministry of Forestry and Wildlife (MINFOF) and the Ministry of Environment, Protection of Nature and Sustainable Development (MINEPDED), through the Operational Unit for Forest Cover Monitoring (UOSCF). This report will be released in February 2021. It aims to present trends in forest cover changes in Cameroon in 2019, using Global Land Analysis and Discovery (GLAD) alerts technology. More specifically, this report describes serial evolution of alerts by Region according to land use types and drivers of forest cover change. The report will facilitate proper planning of missions to implement the National Forestry and Wildlife Control Strategy as a decision-making tool, and will help provide guidelines for improved forest management policies.
We also participated in many other processes at the government level including the elaboration of the Framework for the National Restoration strategy.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">GFW has released our annual tree cover loss data update each year in conjunction with the University of Maryland (UMD), thus achieving all targets for this activity. The only change of plan was that we anticipated to use a 2.0 forest change algorithm for the 2020 data update. However, the research team at UMD, which is responsible for creating the data, was experiencing unforeseen challenges and decided it would be better to release the data using the original algorithm. Moving forward in 2021, we aim to determine a clearer timeline of when this 2.0 version of the global tree cover loss algorithm will be completed by UMD and can be visualized on GFW.
The Global Forest Review (GFR), previously named the Global Forest Update, had its first release in January 2021 after the completion of the initial beta platform in January 2020. At the outset of the grant, we intended to have our first report published in 2019 with an update in 2020, but this timeline has shifted to 2021 as we faced unexpected delays. This first edition of the GFR will be relatively humble, and we plan to immediately continue building on this foundation with new data and analyses later in 2021. Our initial outreach efforts will focus on communicating the purpose and added value of the GFR vis-&#xE0;-vis the FAO&#x2019;s Global Forest Resources Assessment and other well-known global reports.
We released a number of updates across the GFW suite of tools. On the Flagship site, we updated the dashboard and My GFW subscription services, which allow users to save and view more analyses for their areas of interest (AOI) and receive additional detail about change within their AOIs. My GFW is also now integrated across Flagship, the Forest Watcher (FW) mobile application, and MapBuilder. For MapBuilder specifically, we updated the backend infrastructure to use Vega to create, save, and share interactive visualization designs that will integrate MapBuilder with the GFW API. Lastly, we released FW 2.0, which has expanded offline capabilities, including the ability to share app data offline and between FW users, to upload data through an easy-to-use format, and to access all GFW data layers in the app. To support and optimize uptake of our data and tools, GFW released the new and improved Help Center, which serves as a hub for our global user base to access downloadable training materials, recordings of past webinars, and more resources.</narrative>

   <description>
    <narrative xml:lang="EN">In year 2, we hired a consultant with a private sector background to reach out to RoC logging companies. In year 2 and year 3, the consultant reached out to logging companies based in RoC to train them on how to upload their compliance documents to the OTP and to encourage them to do so. We carried out quality control on the documents that were uploaded and followed up with the companies to discuss any issue that arose during quality control. We also coordinated with other key stakeholders to mutualize outreach efforts. We participated in particular in an FAO-funded workshop organized by ATIBT for logging companies from South Congo to collect their feedback on the revision to the Forest Code and in a BVRio workshop organized in Brazzaville for key actors involved in timber legality verification in Congo. More than 58% of the logging companies based in RoC now share documents on the OTP, some of them sharing more than 90% of their compliance documents. In addition, a joint mission between the WRI team, key staff from the Ministry of Forest Economy and a representative of the Ministry of Finance in charge of information systems, showed how the OTP has prepared the ground for the deployment of the TLAS system in RoC and identified options to strengthen synergies between the SIVL and the OTP.</narrative>

   <description>
    <narrative xml:lang="EN">The WRI team worked with the Guyana Forestry Commission and other partners on the intended deliverables including: a learning exchange between a delegation of Guyanese stakeholders and the Ghana Forestry Commission and the Liberian Forest Development Authority, a scoping mission to conduct to understand the needs of various government agencies in relation to FLEGT licensing, the development of a training program for small forest operators, and a virtual learning event focusing on key topics related to the implementation of the VPA.

Through all of these activities the WRI team has built strong relationships with in-country actors that prepare the ground for the next phase of the project. In particular, the shift from a planned in-person conference to a virtual learning event was greatly facilitated by our existing relationships with the GFC, EFITAP, FAO-FLEGT, and other partners in Guyana. 

We also worked with the United Kingdom Timber Trade Federation (UKTTF) as a subgrantee to develop draft modules for a business management training program aimed at small and medium-sized enterprises. After consultations with other groups experienced in providing support to SMEs on business management and more specifically on forest management, UKTTF developed draft modules for initial review. Towards the end of 2020 the materials were validated by in-country actors who form part of the target audience as well as other stakeholders who understand the business management capacity of these enterprises. While we were not able to implement an in-person pilot training due to COVID-19, UKTTF and WRI plan to work on implementation of this program going forward.</narrative>

   </title>
   <description>
    <narrative xml:lang="EN">The engagement in Latin America on NDC enhancement of the forest and land use sector was carried out successfully during FY 2020-21 despite the COVID-19 crisis. Seven countries (Colombia, Costa Rica, Chile, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua and Peru)1 were engaged directly, leveraging their active participation in Initiative 20x20, the regional restoration movement in Latin America. Additionally, we were able to reach many other countries including Argentina, Brazil, Ecuador, El Salvador, Mexico, Panama, Peru, Uruguay, through Initiative 20x20&#x2019;s webinar series.  

Some country specific achievements for FY 2020-21 include:
&#x2022;	Chile included the restoration of 1 million hectares of degraded landscapes in its updated NDC submitted to the UNFCCC in April. The inclusion is based on the National Restoration Plan draft whose development is being supported by WRI and other Initiative 20x20 partners. The Plan is currently under internal review and it is expected to be launched in early 2021. The roadmap towards its launch was updated in April with the support if WRI and partners. The project team developed an in-depth country profile for Chile and engaged country officials in high-level webinars as well as technical workshops.
&#x2022;	Colombia&#x2019;s NDC update included a target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 51 percent by 2030, a scenario that includes land use-based interventions and was proposed and analyzed in the work supported by the project team. A technical note on the analysis is available here; and a presentation summarizing the results, here. The project team also developed an in-depth country profile for Colombia
&#x2022;	Nicaragua&#x2019;s 2020 NDC update explicitly mentions the country&#x2019;s goal to restore 2.8 million hectares in its efforts to better manage watersheds, improve the resilience of rural livelihoods to the effects of climate change, and conserve biodiversity. The project team engaged country officials in high-level webinars as well as technical workshops on the links between restoration and climate change mitigation and adaptation, and landscape restoration monitoring and its connections to NDC progress. 

Detailed information on regional and country-specific activities can be found in the synthesis report from country engagement available here.

A 10-meter global land cover map was started with a very innovative way of machine learning and artificial intelligence. We developed more than 1 million training pixels and trained the algorithm. To date 10% of the globe has been mapped in 10-meter detail. The full global map is expected to be completed in 2021 without need for additional resources.</narrative>

   </title>
   <description>
    <narrative xml:lang="EN">Throughout the project lifetime, we maintained the Forest Atlas fully functional and up-to-date. Overall, we updated over a hundred new datasets on various forest titles including Annual Cutting Areas (AACs), development series, and five-year production units. Aiming at improving the uptake of the Forest Atlas by forest agents, our approach consisted of gradually transferring responsibilities to those agents in the update of the Atlas database. Further, in year 2, we conducted two training sessions in the Lekoumou and Niari departments respectively. The training which was followed-up by a field mission in the Lekoumou department to test various scenarios aimed at strengthening the capacities of forest stakeholders on the use of the Forest Atlas and Forest Watcher for enforcing and monitoring the enforcement of the law. Subsequently, a data sharing protocol was developed to fluidify information flow between local and central levels. On the policy engagement front, the project team has been a key player in the VPA-FLEGT implementation process. We supported the preparation of and took part in all major events of the VPA-FLEGT convenings. In the final year of the project and based on the demand from the CLFT staff aware of the Atlas (the legality team in charge of the computerized timber legality assurance system &#x2013; SIVL), we conducted a field mission in order to identify possible synergies between the Forest Atlas and SIVL. This mission has helped identifying strong options for linking both platforms in order to improve the legality of the forest sector.</narrative>
