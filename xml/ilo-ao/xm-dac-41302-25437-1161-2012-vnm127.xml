   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project will develop a replicable and sustainable approach that contributes to pro-poor and pro-jobs tourism development in Vietnam (development objective). The approach will be designed and first applied in Quang Nam province. The emphasis will be on young women and men, but not to the exclusion of others. The project will build on the experience and make use of lessons learned and approaches of local economic and tourism development projects of the ILO in Vietnam, Sri Lanka and other countries. It will also apply best practice in pro-poor enterprise development as currently emerging globally. This has demonstrated the effectiveness of interventions that focus on the development of specific value chains as compared to more generic approaches such as general business management training or other business service development. The project strategy will therefore be to: &#x2022; use a value chain development (VCD) approach to identify main constraints to and opportunities for pro-poor and pro-jobs development of the inland hospitality and travel industry in Quang Nam &#x2022; develop proposals to address these constraints and opportunities &#x2022; support, financially and technically, some of the key proposals, while others are implemented by provincial and district authorities, the private sector, and other projects, without such support, or with technical support only &#x2022; follow this by similar VCD exercises in related inland tourism value chains in the province The project will use the ILO&#x2019;s participatory approach to VCD, which has proven to result in greater relevance of the proposals that result from a value chain analysis, more ownership among local stakeholders over the findings of the analysis and the proposals for interventions that result, and therefore, more success in implementation of the proposals and greater impact. The project is designed to be complementary to a Government of Luxembourg-Development project in the hotel and tourism sector. It will closely involve the Da Nang Tourism Vocational School, which is supported under that project. Lessons learned will be shared with other Tourism Schools as well as donors and projects in the tourism sector in Vietnam.</narrative>
