   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Executive Summary Ghana Global Fund Proposal The thrust of this proposal is to further open up world of work possibilities in combating HIV/AIDS and mobilize workplace infrastructures to support the fight against the epidemic in Ghana. It will provide valuable assistance to trickle down to workers the National Workplace HIV/AIDS Policy and translate it into concrete actions in the workplaces. In concrete terms, the aim is to broaden the scope of the ILO Workplace Education Project to expand access by workers to prevention, treatment and care and support and thereby enhance their prospects for continued gainful employment. It will utilize the existing and well-functioning infrastructure of the global ILO Workplace HIV/AIDS Education Programme and the ongoing collaborative arrangements with the Ghana Employers Association, Ministry of Social Welfare and Employment, The Informal Economy players and workers&#x2019; organizations as well as the network of nongovernmental organizations trained on behaviour change communication for the workplace by the project. This will be done by participating in the Nations Global Fund Round 8 proposal implementation by offering technical assistance and hands on training to the ILO constituents in policy development and programme implementation; Thus, enhancing ongoing work within the target enterprises with special attention given to reinforcing action to expand access to treatment and care and support. A dual approach will be pursued to achieve this by mobilizing in-houses services as well as linking to community-based services with the support of collaborating NGOs. This proposal aims at expanding action in the world of work in Ghana to district level and informal economy workers who will benefit from a prevention program and a referral system to voluntary counseling and testing, care and support services for them and their family members</narrative>
