   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Executive Summary The Government of Liberia has secured a loan from the African Development Bank and has set aside part of the proceeds to fund the rehabilitation of farm and feeder roads from the irrigation schemes to the processing facilities. The Food and Agriculture Policy and Strategy (FAPS) adopted in 2008 by the Government of Liberia set out a goal to attain a &quot;revitalized and modernized agricultural sector that contributes to shared, inclusive and pro-poor growth and development&quot;. To attain this long term goal, the following objectives must be achieved in a shorter term: i) food security; enhanced, inclusive and pro-poor growth in agricultural production, productivity, competitiveness, value addition and diversification, and linkages to markets; and iii) enhancing effective and efficient human and institutional capacities stakeholders to undertake planning and delivery of services. The project comprises three components: i) Agriculture Infrastructure Rehabilitation; ii) Agricultural Productivity and Production Improvement; and iii) Project Management. The project is being executed by the Ministry of Agricuture Projects Coordination Unit (MOA PCU). The main objective of the services is to undertake to design, document and construct farm/feeder roads to improve accessibility between farms and markets. Roads form an integral part of agricultural systems, linking the producers to the markets. Most roads in the rural areas are either in poor state or impassable, making it impossible for the farmers to transport inputs and produce. In order to improve the current situation, the roads connecting the rice irrigation schemes, the processing facilities are to be rehabilitated as part of the effort to revitalize the rice irrigation sub-sector. This intervention, through its labour-based approach, will empower local people with skills to rehabilitate roads and earn a living.</narrative>
