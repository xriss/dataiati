  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Bridging for Local Area Development Programme (LADP) Phase II LADP Phase I was implemented in 5 Governorates of Sulymaniyah (co-ordinated by ILO), Babylon (UN HABITAT) and Basra, Missan and Thi-Qar (UNDP). During Phase II, the project is intended to include additional governorates. The Area Coordinating Agencies (UN-HABITAT, ILO and UNDP) will continue to lead in their respective regions and consolidate the LADP Phase One planning experience in 5 LADP Governorates. LADP Phase II represents an enhancement moving and expansion from the initial district-based pilot planning process to strengthening an institutionalized, all inclusive governorate-wide iterative development planning and implementation process. The LADP Bridging Phase will contribute to three Outputs that will prepare the ground for LADP Phase II. These outputs are: Output 1 Stronger institutional capacity in selected districts and governorates to plan and manage sustainable socio-economic development. Output 2 Local men and women empowered to identify and address their needs and priorities for poverty reduction. Output 3 Ministry of Planning Development Cooperation has improved capacities to facilitate and monitor local planning in relation to central planning. The Bridging Phase will: prepare for Community Driven Initiatives informed by gender equality principles and map and support Civil Society Organizations (CSOs) to participate in planning and oversight of local development. It will include working with the Ministry of Planning, Development and Cooperation to: determine a coherent, standardized sub-national planning framework; assess the Ministry&#x2019;s institutional development needs; provide some strengthening of the Ministry&#x2019;s capacities; and support the Ministry in playing a lead role in advocating and securing sufficient resources to support the institutionalization of local planning processes through their integration with national and local government planning and development frameworks to ensure long-term sustainability and durability of programme initiatives and approaches under LADP Phase II. The project and partners of the programme build upon ILO&#x2019;s international technical capacity in supporting local governance (including CSOs and private sector organisations), promoting local economic recovery and development for sustainable employment generation, and enhancing the vocational and entrepreneurial skills of the workforce, including within post-conflict countries.</narrative>
