  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Executive Summary (one page) Nepal has been in the forefront of the combat on child labour. At the request of the Government of Nepal and the Social Partners, the new ILO project, &#x201C;Support to the Implementation of Nepal&#x2019;s National Master Plan on the Elimination of Child Labour&#x201D; will support the implementation of the National Master Plan 2011/20. A key challenge is the inadequate and ineffective institutional and human resource capacity, particularly of public institutions with responsibility for governance, coordination, monitoring, and reporting on child labour elimination efforts. The Child Labour Elimination Section (CLES) under the lead Ministry of Labour and Transport Management is the key national entity for coordinating, monitoring and reporting on child labour interventions in the country. The Government recognizes that without an effective and capacitated CLES, the goals set out by the National Master Plan will not be achieved. The Project will contribute to the national Outcome (2) of the ILO Decent Work Country Programme (DWCP) for Nepal, that is: &#x201C;strengthened labour market governance by 2012&#x201D;. The key project outcomes are; informed and conducive policy and legal framework for child labour elimination and prevention will be in place and functional and the governmental and non-governmental agencies and social partners will be engaged in concerted and effective implementation of the NMP 2011-20 on child labour elimination and prevention, with a priority on its worst forms. The proposed project, through direct support to the CLES of the MOLTM, will launch and support the implementation of the National Master Plan on the Worst Forms of Child Labour. The ILO will achieve the two outcomes with the strategies outlined below. It will collaborate closely with the CLES and will engage the social partners, local and international NGOs working in Nepal, relevant agencies and groups and the donors. The project will be administratively and technically administered by the ILO Country Office for Nepal, based in Kathmandu. An international adviser, on EXCOL contract, will be appointed by the ILO and will administratively work under the direct supervision of Director ILO Country Office Kathmandu. The ILO will provide administrative and management oversight through its Country Office in Nepal, and technical guidance and oversight through its Decent Work Country Team for South Asia and its technical department, namely IPEC.</narrative>
