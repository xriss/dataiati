  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">EXECUTIVE SUMMARY The project promotes the rights of indigenous peoples in Bangladesh through capacity building and advocacy initiatives based primarily on the principles of ILO Conventions and other instruments relevant to Indigenous and Tribal Peoples. The project aims to provide assistance at the national level to ensure the integration of indigenous peoples&#x2019; rights in the national legal and policy environment, in line with the relevant national and international standards and policies. In doing so, it will strengthen coordination among the relevant stakeholders for implementing indigenous peoples&#x2019; rights in Bangladesh. With a view to reaching beyond the policy environment, the project will also include capacity building and advocacy activities at the grassroots level. The project aims to build on the solid foundation developed during the 21 months start up phase of the ILO national project to promote indigenous people&#x2019;s rights in Bangladesh. The integrated approach of capacity building and advocacy aims to promote increased understanding and a shared sense of value for the culture and rights of indigenous peoples among other citizens of Bangladesh, which will ultimately enhance social harmony and long-term peace in the country. The project will facilitate the process of promoting indigenous peoples&#x2019; rights for inclusive democracy and good governance in Bangladesh. The main objectives of the project are: 1. Stakeholders at national and local levels have a clear understanding of the provisions and application of indigenous peoples&#x2019; rights in the Bangladesh context 2. Indigenous peoples&#x2019; rights, as enshrined in ILO Convention No. 169, are included in the national legislation and policies 3. Mechanisms for effective coordination and monitoring of the implementation of indigenous peoples&#x2019; rights are in place.</narrative>
