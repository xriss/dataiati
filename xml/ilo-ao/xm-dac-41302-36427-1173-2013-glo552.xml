   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This is the third successive ILO/Norway TC project focused on strengthening labour administration and inspection systems in selected countries. The project supports the overall achievement of Outcome 11 under the ILO&#x2019;s Strategic Policy Framework 2010-2015 and covers seven ILO member States, all of which are priority countries (target CPOs) in the current biennium. The countries include: China, Costa Rica, Indonesia, Lebanon, Namibia, South Africa, Ukraine and Vietnam. The immediate objectives of the project are: 1. to improve the working conditions, skills and/or knowledge of labour administration and labour inspection staff in order to enhance performance and strengthen labour law compliance; and 2. to strengthen labour administration and inspection systems by establishing or improving cooperation with the social partners and/or other relevant public administration bodies. While specific approaches and activities towards achieving these objectives will vary from one country to the next, the main areas of action under the project include: 1. Capacity development for labour administration/inspection systems. This mainly includes the development of national training plans and the training of labour inspectors and labour officers based on the ITC-ILO training package. It further targets improving coordination between relevant government bodies and social partners as well as improving the role of women and effectively addressing gender equality issues in labour administration and inspection. 2. International knowledge networks. This will in particular include the exchange of good practices and the provision of mutual assistance under LAB/ADMIN&#x2019;s coordination between project countries as well as other countries with good experiences and knowledge to share in the area of labour inspection. 3. Coordination, planning and evaluation. The Office will assist member States in strengthening the capacity of governments to improve coordination and institutional development of national systems of labour administration and inspection as well as in enhancing the ability of institutions to plan, programme and evaluate their activities, including through the development or improvement of data collection and management systems. 4. Promotion of relevant international labour standards. The Office will encourage the effective application and, where relevant, ratification of the relevant ILO Conventions related to labour administration and labour inspection (C. 81, C. 129, C. 150). These strategic areas of action, carried out at the national level, will be technically coordinated by LAB/ADMIN in Geneva, and supported with the help of global products and, where possible, complementary national activities and TC projects. The main target group and direct recipients will be the ministries of labour, including the management, the inspectors and labour officers. Social partners will also be recipients as they play an indispensable part in implementing workplace policies jointly with labour administration.</narrative>
