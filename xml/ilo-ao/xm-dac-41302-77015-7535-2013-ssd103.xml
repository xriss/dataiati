   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Project Outputs and Key Activities: The proposed project is a joint initiative of ILO and UNIDO to provide market-relevant vocational and business training for young men and women in Southern Jonglei, specifically in the counties of Akobo, Pibor, Twic East, Pochala, and Bor. The project outputs and activities are divided into two components that are summarized below: 1) Technical Skills Training: Young men and women will be trained in improved food security and technical skills, using mobile training approaches in bomas (homesteads) and marketplaces. A number of courses will be specifically tailored to women. Market-relevant skills training will be provided and agro-processing income generation and micro-enterprises will be supported in bomas and marketplaces. UNIDO will be the main implementing partner of this component. 2) Business Skills Training: Income generation and market-relevant business training and outreach services will be established. Young men and women will also be trained in financial literacy and supported to form groups of their choice, family and own account agro-enterprises and cooperatives. ILO is the main implementing partner for this component. A joint project inception phase with State and County government will locate specific target communities / geographical areas within the counties identified. The inception will review existing related initiatives and identify needs accordingly. Monitoring and evaluation indicators will be refined during the inception phase. There will be two modalities for delivering the training: One is mobile training units which will move with the target beneficiaries. The second is fixed training centres, which will make use of existing structures and will be established by the project in agreement with local authorities, partners and communities. For instance: Akobo youth enterprise centre; Pibor county support base (UNMISS); and Pamot and Makolchuei vocational training centres. The project will train a total of 1500 young men and women. Among the women targeted, priority will be given to those of &#x201C;marriage age&#x201D;, or recently married and with higher levels of vulnerability.</narrative>
