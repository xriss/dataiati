  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project to come will build upon the foundation laid by preceding and ongoing ILO projects to promote effective social dialogue and sound industrial relations in which the promising commitment by all levels of unions have been secured. The project will address the needs of multi-level unions in order for them to better support BWV programme in its implementation and thereby to better support improvement of labour compliance in the garment industry in Vietnam. BWV programme aims to establish harmonious and functioning bipartite cooperation in export oriented enterprises in the garment sector. To that end, PICC union members will particularly need capacity-building training in order for social dialogue to be effective and sustainable. The project aims to train 1500 PICC union representatives in 300 enterprises. At the completion of training trade union PICC members will have been equipped with a good understanding of their responsibilities and problem-solving capacity in participating in Better Work improvement process; unions at different levels will have acquired knowledge about and exposure too, a range of union and representation issues including different and best practice approaches to negotiation skills, consultation/communication, recruitment/organising, dispute settlement and collective bargaining; the roughly 15 EAs will have acquired more skills and professionalism in facilitating the establishment of PICC in participating factories, and subsequently in guiding both managers and worker members on PICCs to fulfil their respective roles and responsibilities.</narrative>
