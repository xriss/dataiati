   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The expected outcome of the Better Factories Cambodia (BFC) multi donor programme (comprised of 11 donors and TC project budgets) is to that working conditions in factories in the garment industry are improved through monitoring and documenting compliance with national labour law and ILS and through remedial training and capacity building of workers and employer organizations The BFC started in 2001 benefits workers, employers and their organizations as well as consumers in Western Countries while helping reduce poverty in the country. It does this by monitoring and reporting on working conditions in Cambodian garment factories according to national and international standards, by helping factories to improve working conditions and productivity, and by working with the Government and international buyers to ensure a rigorous and transparent cycle of improvement. The project grew out of a trade agreement between the US and Cambodia. Under the agreement the US promised Cambodia better access to US markets in exchange for improved working conditions in the garment sector.</narrative>
