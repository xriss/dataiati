   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The 2013 Education for All Global Monitoring Report by UNESCO will examine the effects of education on economic, social, political, environmental and health outcomes (looking both at cross-country and country-specific evidence). As input to the above report, the project output envisaged is a report of about 6,000 words that shall investigate one of these relationships, namely, the effect of education on labour force participation and the quality of employment. Education is known to play a strong role on employment in two broad ways. First, it improves employment chances for women. This happens both because it increases labour force participation and employment (even if the relationship varies across countries according to the level of national income) but also it reduces the gender wage gap. Through these channels, education empowers women at the psychological, cultural, social, economic, and political levels. Second, education is credited with improving the chances of both men and women to access better employment opportunities defined in terms not only of pay but also of occupation, formality and stability (e.g. lapses into unemployment). Labour force surveys provide valuable evidence on these aspects of the relationship between education and employment outcomes. The findings in this report shall provide indications of the extent to which: &#x2022; females are disadvantaged in relation to their male counterparts in employment outcomes and how the relationship varies by education; and &#x2022; less educated people are disadvantaged in relation to their more educated counterparts in employment outcomes The analysis will look at the relationship between education and employment characteristics (for the entire population and by gender) disaggregating selected indicators where possible by: &#x2022; age group &#x2022; residence &#x2022; wealth</narrative>
