   <narrative xml:lang="EN">For effective participation in social and policy dialogue, the parties to dialogue have to be strong, representative and independent. Strong and effective employer organizations are critical for good governance of the labour market and promotion of policies conducive to the creation of decent and productive work. Employer organizations play an important role in influencing the business environment to this effect and strengthening their capacity to represent and serve members to find optimum workplace solutions to international, national and enterprise-level employment is key. The proposal strategy under the PCA is threefold. It will support Outcome 9 by: 1) Strengthening organizational structures and internal management of employers&#x2019; organizations enabling them to develop new and improved services for their members; 2) strengthening the institutional capacity of employers&#x2019; organizations in policy development and lobbying so that they can influence national, regional and international policy debates; and 3) providing assistance in specific policy areas, such as climate change and sustainable development with particular focus on the needs of women in business and women entrepreneurs. Effective employer organizations attract and retain member enterprises through the delivery of value-added services, representation and advocacy. Therefore this proposal includes the development of capacity building tools, knowledge building and sharing, and the development of partnerships and networks/alliances which will lead to the enhanced effectiveness, delivery of value-added services to members and the strengthened institutional capacity in policy development and lobbying of employer organizations. The proposal also supports the promotion social dialogue at the national level and encourages joint work involving workers and employers through bipartite and tripartite activities. A key element of Outcome 9 strategy is also to promote women in business and women entrepreneurs. The proposal will support greater emphasis in this area by promoting greater gender equality and diversity at the workplace as well as enhancing women entrepreneurship.</narrative>
