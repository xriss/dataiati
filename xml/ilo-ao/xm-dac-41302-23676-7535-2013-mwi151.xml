   <narrative xml:lang="EN">HIV Prevention and Impact Mitigation in the Agriculture and Transport Sector Corridors for Malawi</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Government of Malawi has a Malawi Growth and Development Strategy (MGDS), which guides national development agenda. Meeting the MGDS is an enormous challenge and requires scaling up investment, credible planning as well as annual sequencing of interventions. Sectoral, district and urban development structures need to develop MDG-based development planning tools. Integrating HIV/AIDS prevention and mitigation in development planning is a central part of this process. It is worth noting as well that HIV and AIDS has reduced productivities of employees due to increased deaths and absenteeism caused by prolonged and frequent illnesses or incapacitation and high attrition among other factors, this is according to the assessment of the impact of HIV and AIDS in the Public Sector of Malawi conducted in 2003. ILO has supported Malawi in responding to HIV/AIDS through targeted interventions in the workplace, through collaboration with UNDP, FAO and UNAIDS. This proposal will have the following objectives: &#x2022; To support the completion of the draft National HIV/AIDS Workplace Policy for Malawi &#x2022; To support the implementation of the National HIV and AIDS Policy and Strategic Framework of Action for the Transport Sector in Malawi. &#x2022; To support the coordination of HIV and AIDS workplace programs both in the public and private sectors This support will enhance the Governments Ministry of labour to take a lead role in its coordination of the workplace HIV/AIDS programming in collaboration with the Employers and Workers Organizations and other stakeholders. This will also help the Occupational Safety and Health Directorate within the Ministry of Labour build its capacity to undertake quality inspections that will include issues of HIV/AIDS in all of their inspection tools, and furthermore have adequate resources to effectively carry out its role.</narrative>
