   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Development objective To contribute to the efforts under way in Central America and the Dominican Republic in the construction of institutional capacities related to labour legislation implementation and a culture of compliance with national and international labour standards. Specific objectives 1. Upon completion of the project, the Ministries of Labour, the judicial system, the employers&apos; and workers&apos; organizations and other sectors will have relevant information, updated every six months, on the progress achieved in the implementation of the recommendations established at the national and regional levels in the White Paper in six priority areas (1. Labour legislation and its implementation; 2. Budget and personnel needs of the Labour Ministries; 3. Strengthening the judicial system in labour law; 4. Protections against discrimination in the workplace; 5. Worst forms of child labour; and 6. Promoting a culture of compliance). 2. Upon completion of the project, the countries (Ministries of Labour, the judicial system, employers&#x2019; and workers&#x2019; organizations and other sectors) in the Central American region and Dominican Republic will have shared new and systematized knowledge and improved mechanisms in selected priority areas with major difficulties identified for reaching the benchmarks and the implementation of the recommendations voluntarily expressed by the Ministries of Labour. 3. Upon completion of the project, selected labour norms related to the priority areas mentioned in the White Book will have been disseminated among relevant institutions and sectors (Ministries of Labour, judicial system, workers&#x2019; organizations and employers&#x2019; organizations and others). Outputs 1.1. Enhanced ownership established in the relevant institutions regarding the implementation of the White Paper recommendations. 1.2.

National follow-up mechanisms to evaluation reports improved. 2.1. Regional studies and compilation methodologies on priority areas as an input for the verification process. 2.2. Regional cooperation improved among national authorities related to labour issues and exchange of knowledge, experiences and good practices carried out at the regional level. 3.1.
