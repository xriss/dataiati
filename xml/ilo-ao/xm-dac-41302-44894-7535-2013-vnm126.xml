   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The revision of the 2006 Law on Vocational Training forms part of the Vietnamese Government&#x2019;s efforts to further socio-economic development by promoting human resources and skills development. ILO has been requested to assist the Government in revising and updating the Law for improved governance and so that it becomes more responsive to current developments in the labour market for better matching demand and supply. The project has a three -pronged approach: first, it will provide direct technical assistance in revising and drafting the new law; second, it will build the capacity of relevant stakeholders in drafting laws, preparing decrees, guidelines and managing the processes leading to its implementation while at the same time securing and building capacity for coordination and tripartite dialogue. The latter will be the third approach. As the third-pronged approach, and to ensure a regular consultative process, the establishment of a more permanent tripartite consultative mechanism is envisaged. Capacity for this can be delivered if the partners agree on such an approach. Such a consultative mechanism will also be useful in other contexts as well as securing the longer terms sustainability of the project and its objectives. The project will be implemented in a tripartite manner in a coordinated effort by the Ministry of Labour, Invalids and Social Affairs (MoLISA), the Vietnam General Confederation of Labour (VGCL) and the Vietnam Chamber of Commerce and Industry (VCCI). The project is funded by the One UN in combination with support from ILOs regular budget and in-kind contributions from partners. The budget is USD 129,600 and the project duration is 16 months, aiming for completion by December 2014 with the approval of the Law by the National Assembly.</narrative>
