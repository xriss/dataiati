   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Sustaining Competitive and Responsible Enterprises (SCORE) is a practical training and workplace improvement programme to increase the productivity of small to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) while promoting respect for workers&#x2019; rights. The programme demonstrates best international practice in manufacturing and service sectors and helps SMEs to participate in global supply chains. Under SCORE Phase I (2009-2012 &#x2013; funded by SECO and NORAD), the ILO has built the capacity of 19 institutions (government agencies, training organizations, industry associations and trade unions) in emerging economies in Africa, Asia and Latin America to offer SCORE training to SMEs. SCORE Phase II as proposed in this document will extend the project to 2017, focusing on programme sustainability after donor funding ends. Preliminary estimate of results of SCORE Phase I As of October 2012 (6 month before project end), the project has achieved the following: - The project has built capacity in 19 institutions (government agencies, industry associations, training organizations) in seven countries to offer the SCORE training programme. These institutions have trained more than 250 SMEs representing more than 49.000 workers and conducted more than 500 consulting visits. More than 2000 managers and workers have jointly participated in classroom training. - Enterprise Improvement Teams consisting of managers and workers in SMEs are meeting on average 3.4 times per month to implement 8 jointly identified improvement projects. More than 50% of enterprises report cost-savings due to the training (from 300 to 15,000 USD within 2-3 months), 80% report reductions in defects (-10% on average), 42% report reductions in energy consumption (-2% KwH per production unit), over all participating enterprises, absenteeism has decreased by 3.6%. - An independent final evaluation in October 2012 concluded that &#x201C;SCORE covers essential aspects of workplace relations and working conditions, and generally responds to the needs and requirements of most of the SMEs encountered. Relationships between management and the workforce have improved through workplace cooperation (particularly reaching down to the workforce level).</narrative>
