   <narrative xml:lang="EN">EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 1. Project Background Liberia&#x2019;s 14 years of civil war has clearly undermined its huma n development and devastated the country&#x2019;s infrastructure. To address this unfortunate situation, there is the need to rebuild infrastructure, human, institutional and societal capacities. Therefore, the Government of Liberia (GOL) with the support of its technical and financial partners, including the Bank Group, has recognized that the infrastructure rehabilitation and capacity challenges in Liberia have to be addressed as priorities. 2. Sector Goal, Project Objective and Brief Description The sector goal is to contribute to the improvement of productive livelihoods and service delivery. The specific project objective is to improve capacities for infrastructure maintenance and local development. 3. Project Cost and Source of Financing Total project cost is UA16.04 million, of which the total African Development Fund (ADF) contribution amounts to UA15.24 million, or 95 percent of total project cost. The total ADF contribution will be provided as a grant and used to finance the project&#x2019;s total foreign exchange costs and part of the local currency costs. A Government counterpart contribution of 5% of the total project costs, amounting to UA0.80 million is required. 4. Project Implementation The Ministry of Public Works (MPW) will be the executing agency for the proposed project. The Special Implementation Unit (SIU) under the MPW will be responsible for the day-to-day management of the project. ILO and Liberia Agency for Community Empowerment (LACE) will be engaged to implement parts of the Project in conformity with specific responsibilities to be outlined in Delegated Management Contracts with GOL. 5. Conclusions and Recommendations The I-PRSP of Liberia identifies infrastructure rehabilitation and capacity building as key to the country&#x2019;s recovery, economic growth and poverty reduction. Therefore, by focusing on these aspects, the project will address the very negative effects of the conflict on Liberia&#x2019;s reconstruction and development. Therefore, it is recommended that an ADF Grant not exceeding UA15.24 million be granted to the GOL for the purpose indicated in this report, subject to the conditions stipulated in the Protocol Agreement. It is also recommended that the Government&#x2019;s contribution to the proposed project be reduced to 5 percent of total project cost, in compliance with Bank Group ADF X Financing Policy Guidelines</narrative>
