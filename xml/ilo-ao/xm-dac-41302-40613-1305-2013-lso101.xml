  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The focus of Better Work Lesotho is assistance at the factory level through enterprise assessments and corrective action. Compliance with Lesotho labour law and ILO&#x2019;s core international labour standards will be assessed at each participating factory. The project is centred in the enterprise assessment, which identifies both (a) compliance requirements and (b) recommendations to improve systems that will support proactive management and compliance. Enterprise assessments are followed up with enterprise-level assistance in identifying priorities, developing improvement plans and providing training opportunities for managers and workers. Information from the assessments will be posted into the Better Work information management system, known as Supply Chain Tracking of Assessments and Remediation (STAR). Enterprises and international brands will be able to purchase subscriptions through STAR to track the progress of factories in reaching compliance with international labour standards and Lesotho labour law. Better Work Lesotho will invest in localizing and translating the Better Work global programme resources, practical tools and training materials to support the project. In addition, Better Work Lesotho will design its own materials to address issues particularly relevant to local factories. The project will include training services targeted to supervisors and workers at the factory level. Topics will include: (1) working with sensitivity in multicultural workplaces, with an emphasis on Basotho and Chinese cultures and communication; (2) clean production; and (3) HIV/AIDS. The direct beneficiaries of the project will be the participating factories and the supervisors and workers at the enterprise level, as well as the brands. Expected Impact of Better Work Lesotho: &#xB7; Improved working conditions, including correct payments of wages and entitlements, and job opportunities; &#xB7; Increased market access and enhanced relations between suppliers and international buyers, as a result of a credible demonstration of labour standards compliance and reduced worker turnover, leading to improved productivity for enterprises; &#xB7; Export growth, increased employment and positive social and human development outcomes; &#xB7; Enhanced reputation protection for international buyers, made possible by the provision of credible information on compliance in supplier factories and assurance that suppliers are taking remedial action; and &#xB7; Cost savings due to reduction in duplicative auditing and remediation. Stakeholder Engagement and Sustainability: The project will apply a cost recovery approach by charging fees to international buyers and factories for services and training, and move towards sustainable cost recovery.</narrative>
