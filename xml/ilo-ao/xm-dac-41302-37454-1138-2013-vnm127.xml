  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The primary focus of PROPEL - Vietnam will be placed on continued support to the development of an enabling legal and policy environment. At the request of the Ministry of Labour, Invalids and Social Affairs (MOLISA), technical advice will be provided in the development of a regulation to give effect to the Law on Persons with Disabilities, with a particular emphasis on employment-related provisions. Support will also be provided to the development and later implementation of an Action Plan on Employment and Vocational Training of Persons with Disabilities, linked to the draft National Disability Action Plan (NDAP) of Vietnam, 2012 &#x2013; 20, currently under consideration by the Government. Another pillar of this project&#x2019;s activities will be to further strengthen the capacity of the INCLUDE service provided by DP Hanoi, facilitating the effective inclusion of persons with disabilities in programmes and services relating to training, entrepreneurship and employment. Partnership will continue with Hanoi Law University (HLU), to enable the disability equality legislation course to continue into the future, once the pilot test is completed, and to encourage attention to disability-related topics in the HLU graduate and faculty research agenda. As a 4th pillar, there will be an emphasis on knowledge sharing and capacity building for key stakeholders, including media partners. Overall, PROPEL-Vietnam will ensure the sustainability of achievements of the previous phase of the ILO/IA PP and by working in collaboration with other UN agencies, using the One-UN mechanism, as well as seeking mutually supportive linkages with the 2nd Irish Aid- Vietnam Country Strategy 2011 &#x2013; 2015.</narrative>
