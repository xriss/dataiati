   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The United Nations Development Assistance Plan (UNDAP) is the business plan of 20 UN agencies, funds and programmes in Tanzania for the period July 2011 to June 2015. This &apos;One Plan&apos; for Tanzania supports the achievement of the international development goals, the Millennium Declaration and related Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), national development priorities which are consistent with the MDGs, and the realisation of international human rights in the country, including the right to humanitarian assistance for refugees. The UNDAP replaces the current joint UN programmes and the multiple UN-supported initiatives in the United Nations Development Assistance Framework (UNDAF) with a single, coherent business plan for all UN funds, programmes and agencies in Tanzania, in which each is responsible for delivery on a set of key actions that jointly contribute to shared results. UNDAP enhances national ownership and UN accountability by articulating the precise UN contribution to the national priorities outlined in the national poverty reduction strategies, MKUKUTA &amp; MKUZA II 2011- 15.1 These national development frameworks are seen as supportive of international commitments including the MDGs. UNDAP is aligned to the national annual planning cycle, July to June. The accountability of the UN system at normative functional and programmatic level is fully articulated, down to the individual agency, and guided by the principles of effective development cooperation laid down in the Joint Assistance Strategy for Tanzania ( JAST). The UNDAP responds to the UN mandate and mission in Tanzania in ensuring inclusiveness of all state and non-state actors in the development of the country. The Human Rights Based Approach (HRBA) and Results Based Management have been central to the development of the UNDAP. The former underlines that participating in and enjoying the benefits of development is a right of every individual. Therefore, HRBA provides an analytical lens to assess the capacities of both the duty bearers and rights holders; identifying which capacity deficits require attention in order for rights to development to be realised. Furthermore, gender equality and women&apos;s empowerment is a UN mandate, a GoT goal, and a programming principle for development assistance within the UNDAP. The situation of women and children in Tanzania calls for additional, coordinated and comprehensive gender-specific activities to deal with persistent gender disparities. UNDAP also systematically mainstreams environmental sustainability and capacity development. Relevant crosscutting issues of conflict prevention, disaster risk reduction (DRR), food security, indigenous people, volunteerism, HIV and AIDS and employment and decent work have been considered and reflected where relevant in planning. UNDAP reduces duplication in planning requirements for UN agencies and national partners, for some agencies replacing the current requirements of the UNDAF and agency-specific country programme planning documents. The new approach is in line with the UNDG approved guidelines on UNDAF simplified programming and Action Plans. UNDAP enhances the UN focus on results by bringing together agency specific planning requirements in a consistent and seamless manner, ensuring a &apos;necessary and sufficient&apos; programme logic in the results chain and resource requirements. The plan outlines linkages to regional and global initiatives at the sectoral level, forging greater synergy between UN plans in addition to support of larger multilateral and bilateral programmes. Annual reviews and adjustments ensure the continued relevance of the UNDAP; the plan and its implementation modalities ensure coherence and consistency from actions to results to reporting, yielding a synergistic effect. UNDAP&apos;s programme matrix is structured such that each key action has one agency responsible for delivery. Outputs are at times deliverable by single agencies, but more often by more than one, whilst a</narrative>
