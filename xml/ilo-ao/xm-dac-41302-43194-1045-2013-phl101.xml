  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project proposal aims to assist communities affected by Typhoon Bopha in Davao Oriental recover through emergency employment and livelihood recovery. ILO, in collaboration with the Department of Labour and Employment (DOLE), the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the United Nations Fund for Population Activities (UNFPA) will apply the ILO local resource-based approach to create temporary jobs for both men and women and improve longer term income and food and nutrition security through restoration of production in agriculture, the province&#x2019;s major source of livelihood. The proposed project will be an expansion of the current debris clearance work in the Municipality of Baganga, Davao Oriental, implemented with funds from the Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF). The areas for this proposal are Cateel and Boston, the other two equally devastated municipalities of the province. After clearing the surroundings of debris and using locally generated construction materials to repair damaged shelters and community infrastructure, appropriate agricultural production methods will be introduced on small landholdings devoted to coconut and banana. Interventions to conserve and protect the fragile upland ecosystem exposed by the typhoon will be applied where appropriate. These will create emergency employment, reduce future negative impacts of adverse weather events, develop sustainable sources of livelihood and improve food security and nutrition for the Bopha-affected communities. The project will capitalize on the experience of the ILO in providing quick impact employment that transitions into longer-term jobs and livelihood recovery as applied in the aftermath of several extreme weather events in the country, including in Typhoon Washi (Sendong) that devastated Cagayan de Oro and Iligan in 2011. The project will benefit directly at least 1,000 vulnerable men and women by engaging them in cash-for-work (CfW) and livelihood development and recovery. The project will create 30,000 work-days and directly inject into the local economy AUD$304,000.</narrative>
