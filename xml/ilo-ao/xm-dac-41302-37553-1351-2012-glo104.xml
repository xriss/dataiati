   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The overall objectives of the Partnership are to build and disseminate evidence on youth employment outcomes and proven methods to improve them in the Africa and the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) regions. In FY12, YEN will continue contributing to these objectives while preparing the foundation for sustainability and anchorage of tested initiatives developed through the DGF. Objectives by component: 1. Broadening the evidence on what works &#x2013; the Youth Employment Inventory: The component aims at improving knowledge on youth employment programs by analyzing and sharing results from the systematic stock taking exercises of youth ALMPs in Kenya and Egypt. 2. Promoting rigorous results based management &#x2013; the Taqeem Evaluation Fund: The component increases the evaluation evidence from youth employment programs by encouraging practitioners to learn and go through rigorous impact assessments and by sharing the results with the broader public. 3. Laying ground for new alliances and replication of tested youth employment initiatives supported by the DGF in Africa: This component supports a sustainability and anchorage strategy for a tested, successful DGF product designed to support youth participation and employment for young Africans. 4. Increasing collaboration with other DGF partners: This minor component provides visibility and reputation for the DGF for uniting all four DGF partners in a common purpose &#x2013; to host the &#x201C;go to&#x201D; conference for regional youth employment programs and policies in Africa. It also allows for wide spread communication of learning of what works. Direct beneficiaries for all three components include policy makers and planners, practitioners, researchers and academics conducting program evaluations and/or specializing on impact M&amp;E, grant making organizations serving youth, and World Bank staff and clients. Results and findings from these components can already have a positive impact in the short-run by providing program information and platforms for sharing of experiences. In a longer term, results from meta-studies and impact evaluations as well as the adoption of tested products by local partners will feed into policy and program design and will support the effort of governments around the world with improved tools to address youth unemployment. While YEN&#x2019;s 2012 activities preserve a regional-wide scope, they feature a dedicated focus on Kenya and Egypt, and to a lesser extent on Algeria and Senegal.</narrative>
