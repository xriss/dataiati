  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">EAST is designed around the life cycle approach, taking into account the close relationship between needs of youth at all stages of the learning cycle; from participation in basic education to training opportunities in or through the workplace. To address the obstacles experienced by adolescents and youth in accessing education and training, and to facilitate their transition to the world of work, EAST will target &#x2022; Children aged 13-15, both out of school and in school (NFE, Junior Secondary School); &#x2022; In-school youth aged 15-18 (Vocational and General Secondary Schools); and &#x2022; Out-of-school youth aged 15-29 who are or want to be enrolled in public and private training and education programmes The interventions cover 4 main areas of action with young people in-school and out-of-school: - Enhancing learning opportunities: - Improving access to career guidance and counselling: - Building capacity to deliver market-oriented livelihood and technical skill training: - Building entrepreneurship culture among youth: These targeted interventions are supported by cross-cutting strategies, which focus on making available top-quality research, enhancing capacity for policy advocacy, strengthening structures and networks at national, provincial, and district levels, and mainstreaming gender equality issues. Direct recipients of technical assistance will be teachers, tutors and instructors in formal and non-formal education and training institutions; education, manpower and planning authorities at the district, provincial and national level; employers&#x2019; and workers&#x2019; organisations at local and national level; the National Education Standards Board; the National Agency for Professional Certification; and selected universities. EAST will focus specifically on five provinces in Eastern Indonesia where human development indicators are particularly poor, the private sector is least developed and local political commitment to improving education and training is high. In addition, the programme also will implement selected activities in Aceh, to the extent that they complement ongoing ILO assistance, lend themselves to quick replication or upscaling, and/or respond to identified needs that have not yet been met by national or international development agencies.</narrative>
