   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The development objective of SCORE is that SMEs are more sustainable through being cleaner, more productive and competitive and provide more sustainable and decent employment. The project is expected to achieve the following outcomes: a) Industry associations can market and coordinate enterprise upgrading services to their local members. b) Service providers can effectively deliver training and advisory services for workplace upgrading on a commercially sustainable basis. c) Labour inspectorate services work with mass media to disseminate progressive workplace practices. SCORE is currently completely funded by the Swiss State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO) and implemented in six countries, Colombia, Ghana, South Africa, Indonesia, India and China. A global component coordinates the project and serves as a knowledge hub. The Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation (NORAD) will provide funding to expand SCORE. Funding will support the global SCORE component, activities in the six current SCORE countries and introduce SCORE to Viet Nam. Each country will implement the programme in minimum one sub sector and at least two clusters targeting 10-15 enterprises in each cluster. The following overall impact is expected in participating enterprises: &#xBF; Business growth as a result of improved competitiveness and better access to markets &#xBF; Overall improvement in the culture of worker-management collaboration leading to continuous improvement as well as reduced labour absenteeism and turnover &#xBF; Improved quality in terms of reduced defects and improved on time delivery &#xBF; Improved productivity through better environmental management (reduced waste and energy consumption) and better workplace management (reduced labour accidents and sick leave).</narrative>
