  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In Africa, the first phase of the partnership seeks to build upon the actions carried out in Zambia between in 2010-11. According to the measurement criteria outlined above, Zambia achieved two results during the last biennium in relation to criteria 1 and 2 referring to new institutions that had been created to fight trafficking and ILO&#x2019;s supervisory body noting with interest the country&#x2019;s new anti-trafficking legislation. These results can be attributed to the previous Irish Partnership project in Zambia. As for the new phase, the objective is to prepare Zambia for an exit strategy while still focusing on the achievement of further results for this biennium. Action will be guided by Outcome 15&#x2019;s country strategy as set out in ZMB177 &#x2018;Greater capacity of national stakeholder to prevent forced labour and human trafficking in Zambia.&#x2019; The strategy aims to continue strengthening assistance mechanisms to victims of forced labour, including capacity building of shelters that were mapped during the previous biennium. Further support will be offered to the Central Statistics Office and other government agencies to provide up-to-date sex-disaggregated data and information on forced labour and responses to it. Action against forced labour and trafficking requires a comprehensive strategy and broad-based stakeholder consultations in order to better incorporate the elimination of forced labour in Decent Work Country Programmes. This is particularly relevant for countries such as Niger, Mauretania, DRC, Sudan and Liberia where the elimination of forced labour lacks political will and determination. The project will therefore develop a strategy paper for Africa, focusing in particular on the countries mentioned above, for further fundraising and targeted action during the second phase of the Irish Partnership.</narrative>
