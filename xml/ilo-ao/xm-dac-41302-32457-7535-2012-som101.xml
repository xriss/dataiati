   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Executive Summary The United Nations Joint Programme on Local Governance and Decentralised Service Delivery (JPLG) in Somalia is a five year programme from 2008 to 2012 of ILO, UNCDF, UNDP, UN-HABITAT and UNICEF. This document is the Annual Work Plan and Budget (AWPB) for the JPLG in south central Somalia and covers twelve months from January to December 2011. The total budget planned for this period is USD 4,203,629, of this amount, USD 2,886,242 is secured, leaving a funding gap of USD 1,317,187 (31 per cent) at the time of writing this document. The JPLG is aligned to the programming frameworks of the Somalia Reconstruction and Development Programme (RDP) 2008-2012 and the UN Strategic Assistance Plan (UNSAS) 2011-2015. It is envisaged to achieve as wide coverage as resources and conditions allow with a comprehensive approach to rendering local governments as credible basic service providers and strengthening civic awareness and participation in decision making on local development. The overall objective of the JPLG is that local governance contributes to peace and equitable priority service delivery in selected locations. The specific objectives are that: (i) Communities have access to basic services through local government, and (ii) Local governments are accountable and transparent. The two specific objectives make separation between the &#x2018;supply&#x2019; side and the &#x2018;demand&#x2019; side of local governance. The supply side is the delivery of services by local governments to communities. The demand side is that communities demand accountable and transparent delivery of services and management of funds from their local government. Throughout the JPLG strong emphasis will be placed on the role of marginalised groups, human rights, gender and good governance principles of transparency, accountability and participation. The current partners in the JPLG are the Transitional Federal Government (TFG) as well as regional and district authorities that have been established through a legitimate election processes, as well communities and other relevant actors in the target areas. The primary target groups for the interventions are local communities. The secondary target groups are district and regional councillors and staff, as well as staff in relevant central government institutions, notably Ministries of Interior, Planning, Women and Family Affairs, Labour and Finance. Where relevant, non-state actors will be used to assist with capacity development among the primary and secondary target groups. Note that it is important to regard this work plan as a flexible document that can be adjusted and responsive to changes in the context and lessons learnt. JPLG developed a &#x2018;JPLG Approach for south central Somalia &#x201D; in September 2009. This approach follows three phases: &#x2022; Phase 1: No official local council with capacity in place however there could be a community driven consortium of local level leadership and capacities in place in service delivery or specific technical areas which can lead to generating a demand for social services and effective local management; &#x2022; Phase 2: Official local council and some capacity; and &#x2022; Phase 3: Official local council and capacity in place. With each phase forming part of a coherent progression towards having a representative local government delivery services in an accountable, transparent and participatory manner. The JPLG approach for south central Somalia will be three tiered in 2011: &#x2022; Scaling-up of Phase I interventions in the 16 districts of Mogadishu. &#x2022; Initiating Phase II interventions in Adado district. &#x2022; Policy and capacity development support to the Ministry of Interior (MOI) and the Transitional Federal Government (TFG) and Benadir Administration. The expected results of the JPLG in south central Somalia for 2011 are: (i) Local government policy, legal and regulatory framework reviewed, developed/enacted. (ii) The capacity to govern and manage service delivery enhanced in target d</narrative>
