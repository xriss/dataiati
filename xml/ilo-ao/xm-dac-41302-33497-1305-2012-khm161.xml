   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Strengthening the scope &amp; capacities of Better Factories Cambodia</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Strongly supported by the tripartite constituents, Better Factories Cambodia (BFC) has been successfully implemented in Cambodia for more than one decade. It has been contributing to increasing the competitiveness of the garment industry in the country and improving the compliance of enterprises with both international labour standards and Cambodian labour law. The BFC programme is now working with 272 factories, which supply to 33 registered international buyers. After a decade of operation, the programme is now proceeding with its technical alignment with Better Work in terms of types of services, data management system, technical tools and other modus operandi. Gradually, BFC will shift under the umbrella system of Better Work&#x2019;s global Quality Assurance Control, while moving toward financial self-sustainability. With this perspective, this project aims at supporting the technical alignment of BFC with Better Work Programme as well as improvement of service quality by BFC. Specifically, with the support from the Better Work Global Programme, BFC will implement a series of activities to address both internal and external needs of the programme concerning its integration into Better Work as an outstanding country programme. These activities will focus on: (i) developing the strategy and workplan for BFC&#x2019;s technical alignment with Better Work in close consultation with project stakeholders (ii) strengthening relationship with programme multi-stakeholder partners with a view to building a joint vision of BFC&#x2019;s future strategies; and (iii) together with Better Work programme, developing a quality assurance system and retaining a highly-motivated professional team equipped with necessary skills to provide quality service in the area of workplace assessments, training and advisory services. It is expected that at the end of the project implementation BFC programme continues to provide diversified high quality services to the Cambodian garment and other potential industries, and thereby to contribute to the creation of employment and ensuring improved working conditions in the Cambodian garment industry.</narrative>
