   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The overall project strategy aims at concrete results in two ways: internally, the strategy is to develop the analytical capacity to evaluate the primacy of productive employment as the central vehicle for pro-poor growth, and to do so in a robustly sound and integrated, rather than piecemeal way; externally, the strategy foresees the generation of this analytical capacity as a powerful resource for advising governments and the social partners on how best to enhance the productive employment content of the own strategies for pro-poor growth and poverty reduction. The focus will be on results rather than process, with particular attention paid to achieving robust links between analysis and methodological work and policy, and between policy and policy impact. The ILO comparative advantage in this proposed project reposes on the many years that considerations of employment creation and poverty reduction &#x2013; and the relation between the two &#x2013; have been core spheres of activity of the ILO. The present proposal would build upon and substantially strengthen ILO&#x2019;s longstanding involvement in the elaboration of national employment policies, and in placing productive employment at the heart of Poverty Reduction Strategies. While the analytical &#x201C;roll out&#x201D; of the work envisaged in the project at the country level will be demand-driven, a number of &#x201C;comparator&#x201D; case studies will be undertaken. Geographical representativeness will be one criterion. A more significant criterion, however, will be based on the comparison of contrasting experiences. Work has already begun on constructing a data base that ranks countries on the basis of (1) the relationship over time between economic and productive employment growth and poverty reduction, and (2) the relationship between recent multi-year averages of employment growth relative to &#x201C;needed&#x201D; employment growth, defined as the &#x201C;labour-absorbing rate of employment growth&#x201D; or LAREG. An initial catalogue of countries that have explicit employment targets is also under construction. Development objective To achieve full and productive employment and decent work for all, including women and young people. Immediate objectives /Outcomes and Outputs Outcome 1:Employment targets are introduced as key features in national development strategies Outcome 2: A &#x201C;user-friendly&#x201D; methodology for employment and enterprise diagnostics has been developed and tested, and is being used to underpin national employment policies and development strategies The overall project strategy aims at concrete results in two ways: internally, the strategy is to develop the analytical capacity to evaluate the primacy of productive employment as the central vehicle for pro-poor growth, and to do so in a robustly sound and integrated, rather than piecemeal way; externally, the strategy foresees the generation of this analytical capacity as a powerful resource for advising governments and the social partners on how best to enhance the productive employment content of the own strategies for pro-poor growth and poverty reduction.
