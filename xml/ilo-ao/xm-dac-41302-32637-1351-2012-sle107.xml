   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The lack of productive employment for youth is not only an economic problem, but also represents a major political and security risk. The Government of Sierra Leone, with financial support of the World Bank, has launched the Youth Employment Support Project, with the objective of increasing access to short-term employment opportunities and to improving employability of targeted youth. The ILO will provide training services on employment intensive approaches to emerging enterpreneurs and government implementing staff. The training will focus mainly on roads rehabilitation and maintenance and renewable energy/environmental mitigation sectors. The proposal for training was prepared jointly by the ILO and Sierra Leone Roads Authority (SLRA) in response to the request from National Commission on Social Action (NaCSA) to provide sustainable training courses with quality content for both supervisory staff and contractors&#x2019; personnel. NaCSA has launched an ambitious and innovative programme of providing employment for the youth through the implementation of public works projects. The primary objective of the programme is the creation of stability in the country by the provision of livelihoods in roads, agriculture and solid waste sectors. The principles or guidelines that NaCSA has adopted to achieve this objective involve (i) Maximising Labour Input for job creation purposes to create social stability and reduce poverty, (ii) Maximum use of private sector since it is considered the most efficient means of works execution and (iii) Decentralisation &amp; capacity building.</narrative>
