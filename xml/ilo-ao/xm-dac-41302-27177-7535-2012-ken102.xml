   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Following a year-long design process divided into various stages, the UN system in Kenya has in July 2007 finalized the Joint UN Programme of Support on AIDS aimed at increased effectiveness and harmonization of its support to the national HIV response. While anchored in the premises of UN reform towards &#x2018;Delivering as One&#x2019; and the UN Development Assistance Framework, the Joint Programme is also fully aligned with the Kenya National HIV/AIDS Strategic Plan (KNASP). The Joint UN Programme of Support on AIDS is based on a 3-tier analysis on i) the epidemic and sources of new HIV infections, ii) the HIV response stakeholders, interventions and gaps and, iii) comparative advantage of the UN system. Not being in a position to provide large-scale financial support to the national HIV response, it was important for the UN system to build the joint programme on its strategic role as a &#x2018;normative knowledge house&#x2019; strengthening the country-level response through translation of international guidance and best practices into locally meaningful and standardized programmes. Although the Joint UN Programme of Support on AIDS is designed to provide meaningful inputs to all the four KNASP priority intervention areas, it has a deliberate focus on Prevention/Reduction of new HIV infections as the one area that is critical for long-term control of the HIV epidemic and for which the UN system is well placed to make a significant contribution. The first Kenya Joint UN Programme of Support on AIDS covers the period from July 2007 to December 2012 with total estimated budget of USD 93.3 million. Out of this amount, USD 38.6 million is projected to be covered through internal UN sources and USD 20 million from existing pledge from DFID. The remaining USD 34.7 million unfunded balance is expected to be covered through existing contributions and joint resource mobilization from external donors. The total budget incorporates procurement support through the World Bank, and a further USD 68 million credit contribution by the World Bank brings the total funding proposed through the UN system to USD 161.3 million. The Joint UN Programme of Support on AIDS is implemented by the Joint UN Team on AIDS, which operates under the UN Resident Coordinator system and consists of technical UN staff working on HIV. The Kenya Joint UN Team on AIDS was established in June 2007 following final agreement on division of labour and official designation of members by the UN Resident Coordinator.</narrative>
