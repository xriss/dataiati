   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Support to the Government of Zambia for the implementation of policy and the national plan of action against human trafficking</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Recognising the value of coordinated and collaborative programmes of support to the Government of Zambia, the UN Country Team has established a joint programme against human trafficking, involving ILO, IOM, and UNICEF. The objective of this programme is to contribute to the protection of people (especially children and women) from the harmful effects of trafficking by supporting implementation of Government&#x2019;s policy and action plan against trafficking. The programme has two purposes: first, to support GRZ programmes to reduce the incidence of human trafficking, and second, to build capacity amongst public officials, service providers and non-state actors to detect and respond to cases of trafficking. These purposes will be realised by: &#xBF; Building resilience amongst people at risk of being trafficked &#xBF; Building a protective environment at local level and developing broad based vigilance including diverse community, local actors, householders and employers &#xBF; Enhancing the response to trafficking through detection, response and improved services to victims. The programme includes activities at national level, such as awareness-raising and capacity building, as well as targeted action in sending communities and in receiving communities within the country. These communities are located in various parts of the country, including urban and peri-urban along major transport routes, border areas and very poor rural areas with limited economic opportunities. Information from the 2007 EC funded study on child trafficking and the 2008 study on trafficking and forced labour (both ILO) will be combined with information from on-going support to victims of trafficking by IOM and national partners in order to map out vulnerable communities to be targeted. In-depth research on trafficking for domestic labour will contribute to further define geographical target areas, particularly those poor rural areas that serve as sending communities.</narrative>
