   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The World Council of Churches (WCC) and the International Labour Organization (ILO) are designing a project building on convergences in values and shared institutional capacities of the ILO and the WCC. Its overall development objective is to establish cooperation on matters of social justice and decent work for the advancement of peace and reconciliation among religious communities at national, regional and global levels. It encompasses two immediate objectives: the first is to initiate and facilitate cooperation of religious leaders and of their communities in advocating for social justice and decent work at national and community levels, as contributions to peace and reconciliation. A second objective is to foster networking and cooperation at regional and international levels for the same purpose. The desired project will provide as outcomes a new momentum to interreligious cooperation for peace and reconciliation through mutual empowerment of religious leaders; constructive initiatives for decent work that contribute to positive changes for the lives of peoples, families and communities; and functioning cooperation for advocacy at national, regional and international levels. The project includes: - Developing in Egypt a national platform of representatives of relevant Faith-Based Organizations (FBOs) with reference to the experience, knowledge and methodology accumulated in Ethiopia. The national interreligious platform (NIRP) will be focusing on a rights-based approach and utilizing decent work as a pathway to reconciliation and peace. Participating FBOs and religious leaders will be identified and invited by the ILO and WCC in cooperation with ILO national and regional offices, National Councils of Churches, Interreligious Councils where they exist, and church-based religious and community-based networks. The national platform will develop plans of action, mobilize resources jointly, and execute projects in local communities in cooperation with the ILO, the WCC, and other partners. - Facilitating and fostering networking between national platform in Egypt and other platforms established through the ILO and the WCC during the pilot phase of the project. At both national and regional levels, the exchange and cooperation through platforms will enhance advocacy for social justice and decent work principles towards sustainable peace, especially in interreligious fora.</narrative>
