   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In order to overcome the causes impairing the implementation of the NAP, this Project will therefore enhance the capacity of both the Government and social partner to engage entities that were not part of the NAP design, as well as involve those who were indirectly part of the process, notable the local actors at district level. This Project will thus build up from the previous TBP experience that was operational in 16 districts in Tanzania out of 128. In only 11 Districts there are existing and operational child labour monitoring/reporting units, whose focal points are in close contact with the national level. The unified reporting channel it is not yet fully operational country wise. In this context, this Project will have three outputs. The first one will concentrate on the social dialogue mechanisms and for that the Brazilian experience will be very useful. Both countries will then establish a Task Force for the implementation of this Project, very likely to be sheltered under the National tripartite steering groups; CONAETI in Brazil and NISCC in Tanzania. A high level mission to Tanzania would take place to seal this commitment and a national Seminar would be organized involving representatives from the 128 districts. Output number 2 would be devoted to social partners taking into consideration their existing role in the process. In this context, the present Project will seek to strengthen the capacity of trade unions at local (village) level to address the issue of child labour in the informal sector by means of training on monitoring and on data collection. The culture of unionization in Tanzania is relatively young, and considering that only very recently the employer&#x2019;s organization decided to divide the country in zones, this Project will endeavor efforts to strengthen their institutional plan to improve structure for the next ten years and reach out to at least 4 zones. A &#x201C;Zone&#x201D; is comprised of representatives from different regions. The approach will be to establish focal points in these four zones capable of covering village, district, branches, zone and national levels. For this, it would be necessary to map out good business practices and disseminate them through affiliates and give national visibility, perhaps by means of prizes or certificates of good practices. Therefore, for both Employers&#x2019; and Worker&#x2019;s organizations, the setting up of a network of focal points on child labour will be fundamental to the implementation of the NAP. For the employers, it is crucial to have someone who is able to develop agenda, based on the local needs and expectations. There is a need to translate the national &#x201C;framework&#x201D; into a language that can be easily understood by local business. Thus, the activities foreseen under the present Project were developed envisaging the establishment of focal points in all regains and training of these focal points will be the major tool. A social mapping of good business practices will be undertaken as a show case and base line to build up on. From the workers&#x2019; perspective, a similar approach will be sought and a Rapid Assessment on the situation of child labour in the informal sector will be the platform from which the establishment of workers&#x2019; focal point will be built. Workers&#x2019; focal points will be established in all districts after the training. The Rapid assessment will be a first baseline to assess the extent of child labour in the informal sector that will also serve as a training resource for the workers focal points in all districts. Once all the focal points from both social partners have been trained, a bipartite consultative meeting will be organized with aims at setting a network countrywide. Apart from strengthening the role of social partners at policy level, Output 3 of this project will contribute to the re-structuring of the National Committee on child labour and training on the reporting mechanism, information and data collection. The topic of the training will be disc</narrative>
