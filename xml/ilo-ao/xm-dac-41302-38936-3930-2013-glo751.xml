   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Strategies for Accelerating the Pace of Elimination of the Worst Forms of Child Labour</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This descentralised project is totally linked to the preparation of the III Child Labour Global Conference that will take place in Brazil in 2013. The first strategy of the project (IO1) will be to prepare technical inputs to support tripartite consultations at the national and international levels on the challenges to achieve the target of eliminating the worst forms of child labour by 2016 and all forms of child labour by 2020, and taking stock of existing successful public policies to address child labour worldwide. Based on the ILO Conventions No. 138 and its Recommendation No. 146 and Convention No. 182 and its Recommendation No. 190; as well as the records of the I and II Global Conferences on Child Labour, especially the Roadmap approved in The Hague in May 2010, the project will then revise all existing international documents and prepare a document named &#x201C;Baseline Document&#x201D; to be drafted for the preparatory regional consultations. The &#x201C;Baseline Document&#x201D; shall provide inputs and foster social dialogue, both before and during III GCLC/2013. The Baseline Document shall be accompanied by three other supporting documents: the first one, entitled Technical Input No. 1 for accelerating the pace of the reduction of child labour, will summarize obligations that derive from the ILO Conventions and their Recommendations on the theme and the Hague Roadmap. The two other documents will be than be prepared based on the structure of the Baseline Document. Thus, the Technical Input No. 2 document, to be named &#x201C;Challenges in Accelerating the Pace to Reduce Child Labour&#x201D; shall, from the perspective of public policy makers, address the obstacles, difficulties and the necessary knowledge required by the international community. Finally, the Technical Input No. 3 document, to be entitled &#x201C;Good Practices and Lessons Learned&#x201D; shall report on successful experiences in addressing and overcoming the obstacles to eliminate the worst forms. The second strategy of this Project is meant to keep record of all consultation that will take place involving Brazil and the international community participating in events related to the preparation of the IIIGCLC/2013. The objective is to process and systematize the any reports and outcomes of these consultations for wider dissimnation within the participating countries. In the context of IO No. 2, the project will make use of two additional strategies. One will focus on the creation &#x2013; through the national and international coordination and mobilization efforts &#x2013; of a favorable environment to hold the IIIGCLC/2013 and for this, the project will deelop a communication/sensitization proposal that will use the mass media, social networks and international events prior to IIIGCLC/2013, as a way to encourage countries to share their interest in supporting the international movement against child labour. Finally, the project will provide technical and operational assistance to Brazilian Ministry of Social Development and to IIIGCLC/2013 in channeling international demands related to the IIIGCLC/2013.</narrative>
