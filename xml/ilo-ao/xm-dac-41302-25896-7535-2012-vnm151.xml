   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Strengthening mechanisms for Implementation of Unemployment Insurance Law Project executive summary This UI support project has been designed as two-years project which is funded by One UN fund in Vietnam. The project aims at improving operational efficiency and legislation of the scheme so as to enhance the access of unemployed workers to UI benefits. This project follows system development approach as it focuses on strengthening institutionalized capacity of implementing agencies at national and provincial levels. In addition, it helps to reinforce co-ordination mechanism among key stakeholders for better services provided to unemployed workers when they lose their job. The main outcomes and outputs of the programme are: Immediate objective 1: By the end of the project, the UI functional efficiency, UI policy, legislation and procedures are improved to ensure the wider coverage of workers under the UI scheme, equal and fair accesses of male and female workers to, and benefits and services from, the UI scheme. Immediate objective 2: By the end of the project, the financial sustainability of the Unemployment Insurance scheme has been reviewed and improved. Immediate objective 3: By the end of the project, the overall management of the UI is improved through integration with management information system, quality assurance system and improved capacity. The project, under the National Cooperation Framework on Promoting Decent Work in Viet Nam for period 2006-2010 (Decent Work Country Programme or DWCP), continues to build on a number of past and present ILO&#x2019;s projects such as the Labor Market, Better Work, Flexecurity and some other UI support activities. It is also linked with the One UN programme framework (One Plan) which is the UN&#x2019;s key framework for strengthening national capacities and supporting the implementation of the national Socio Economic Development Plan (SEDP). By the end of project, the number of UI premium contributors is expected to increase by 10%. This will be complemented by efforts to develop quality control system, to improve actuarial work, and to expand trainings to reach about 200 staff running UI scheme. The project will be executed by the ILO Office in Viet Nam with technical support from provided by the Social security Department (SEC SOC) in Geneva and the Decent Work Team for East Asia, South-East Asia and the Pacific in Bangkok. MoLISA, VSS, MOF, VGCL and VCCI will be closely involved in policy guidance and project coordination process through a Project Steering Committee.</narrative>
