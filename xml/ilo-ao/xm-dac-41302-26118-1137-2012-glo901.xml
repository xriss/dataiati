   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project aims at building the capacity of social partners to be independent, representative, effective and pro-active actors in forging national jobs pacts, thus contributing to national development policies. More specifically the project will help employers&#x2019; and workers&#x2019; organizations to: &#xBF; identify major constraints to putting decent work, full and productive employment and sustainable enterprise development at the core of the policy response to the crisis; &#xBF; make use of ILO standards and tools relevant to crisis response; &#xBF; integrate their priorities in GJP processes as well as in DWCPs, Poverty Reduction Strategies and the implementation of the UNMDG; &#xBF; define pro-active policy responses for economic recovery, in the light of the recommendations formulated in the Global Jobs Pact as well as of the experience and lessons learnt from other countries. The definition of policy responses will have a double focus: what policy solutions yield best results, with special attention to the gender dimension and to the areas of economy and society more vulnerable to the effects of the crisis; and which institutional processes may be most helpful in reaching these results; &#xBF; develop the capacity for employers&#x2019; and workers&#x2019; organizations on the methods and processes to implement their policy proposals and exert more influence, through social dialogue, lobbying and advocacy, in the design and planning of National Jobs Pacts. The objective of the project will be achieved through national activities in El Salvador, Jordan and Indonesia as well as international knowledge-sharing activities with the involvement of more countries, including all the GJP pilot countries. These activities are designed to become an integral part of the broader Employers&#x2019; and Workers&#x2019; training programmes and, through cost-sharing arrangements with other funding sources, their results will be disseminated to a larger group of countries and organizations.</narrative>
