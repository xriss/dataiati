   <narrative xml:lang="EN">PROPEL-Indonesia aims to support the addressing of gaps in policy and legislative protection on employment and training of persons with disability to ensure they are consistent with international standards. Support will be given through provision of technical advice and support to the government, in consultation with key stakeholder; through national and provincial level workshops to consider the findings of a review to be commissioned and deciding on action required; and through technical assistance in follow-up to these workshop, to give effect to the decisions taken. PROPEL-Indonesia also aims to build capacity of key stakeholders in Government, trade unions, employers&#x2019; organization, and civil society organizations, national and provincial (district) levels. Officials of the Central Statistics Office will be included in relevant training, whenever possible. In order to enhance the understanding of rights of persons with disabilities concerning employment and training, as well as the provisions of the UNCRPD and the Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment (Disabled persons) Convention (No. 159), capacity building will be done through national and provincial trainings and workshops, as well as through disability inclusion courses offered at ILO&#x2019;s International Training Centre, Turin (ITC Turin). In the long-term perspective (2014-15), the focus will be on improving the capacity to implement revised and newly adopted laws, with a view to increasing access of people with disabilities to training and employment opportunities, on an equal basis with others.</narrative>
