   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Executive Summary UBRAF funded project Ghana on HIV and AIDS Considerable achievements have been made in HIV prevention in and through the world of work, including in the informal economy, ranging from targeting most-at-risk populations, increased number of persons undergoing voluntary testing and counselling and condom distribution. Implementation efforts have been supported by development partners, as well as by enterprises in the private sector. However, gaps still remain particularly among those most vulnerable populations that because of working or living conditions may be less resilient to HIV or may have less access to relevant health and social services. A gap analysis conducted in 2008 1 identified the following vulnerable young populations: &#x2022; Young migrant workers from rural areas; &#x2022; Young men and women apprentices and artisans; &#x2022; Young men and women workers in the indigenous hospitality industry (drinking bars and &#x201C;chop&#x201D; bars); and &#x2022; Young men and women informal workers in high-risk geographical areas (areas where large companies, mines and factories are located). This project will contribute to a reduction of HIV infections among young women and men workers in selected informal settings through interventions combining non-discriminatory access to services and empowerment programmes. Specific outcomes &#x2022; 5,000 young men and women workers in the informal economy have access to HIV services and programmes, in identified markets garages and bus stations. &#x2022; 2,500 young men and women workers report a change in behavior (in one of the areas assessed by the Knowledge, Attitudes, Behaviour and Practices Surveys (KABP) to be undertaken in the informal economy reached by empowerment programmes</narrative>
