   <narrative xml:lang="EN">PROPEL Zambia will focus on supporting the implementation of Action Plan on Inclusive Vocational Training , which aims to put into effect the Disability policy (2007) and address the noticeable lack of access to vocational training for persons with disabilities. The goal is to increase their employability through training provided by the TEVET institutions. In parallel to its support to the pilot testing of the Inclusive Vocational Training Action Plan, PROPEL-Zambia will collaborate with other agencies in supporting a process of legal and policy review and revision, to bring existing provisions governing the training and employment of disabled persons into line with international standards and in particular the ILO Convention concerning Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment (Disabled Persons), No. 159 and the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN CRPD). The main aim of this effort is to strengthen the enabling environment for training and employment of people with disabilities. To support an inclusive planning and provision of services to people with disabilities, PROPEL-Zambia will also collaborate with the Ministry of Information, Broadcasting and Labour (MIBL), the Ministry of Finance (MoF) and the Central Statistical Office (CSO) to improve the capacity to collect and analyse disability information as part of national statistics. PROPEL-Zambia will support the development of greater awareness of the capacities and rights of persons with disabilities through a series of events (workshops, seminars), and through partnerships with the media. These activities, targeting a range of stakeholders, from instructors who provide training to policy-makers to the media, seek to address and dismantle stereotypes, mistaken assumptions and prejudices that hinder people with disabilities from accessing to vocational training and employment. Awareness-raising activities will highlight specific challenges faced by women with disabilities.</narrative>
