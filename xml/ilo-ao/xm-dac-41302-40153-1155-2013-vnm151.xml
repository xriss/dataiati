By promoting and building unemployment insurance and employment services, this project aims to bottom-up low income workers and improve people&#x2019;s welfare, and cultivate effective demands in Asian region as results. Most of the Asian countries, however, do not have fully functional public employment service agencies or unemployment insurance systems. There is a concern that lack of social security for un- and underemployed workers in those countries might lead societal instability incurred by enlargement of gaps and inequalities in society. In this regard, there are immediate needs in particular, unemployment insurance system, and building the capacity of employment service agencies which can implement the system in fair and effective manner. This project aims to provide technical and financial assistance with the expertise of the ILO for building-up unemployment insurance system in Asian countries in collaboration with ASEAN Secretariat.

A platform to extend income-security measures (for those workers who lose employment or whose income is reduced) and employment services for workers in ASEAN countries is strengthened through awareness raising activities and research; 2. Unemployment Insurance scheme in Viet Nam functions effectively, with improved financial sustainability and overall management and increased population covered; 3. A network of expertise among ASEAN countries on unemployment insurance schemes and employment services is strengthened.
