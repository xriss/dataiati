   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Public awareness around Rio+20 has generated questions about the green economy and its potential to provide sufficient opportunities for productive and decent employment. More and more countries understand the strong linkages between sustainable development and the need to create decent work with a reduced impact on the environment &#x2013; in short green jobs. The rationale and direction of policies and programmes for green jobs are increasingly recognized and underlined by international organizations and national stakeholders. However, the knowledge and tools to shape and implement policies and to build the domestic capacity for continuous green jobs support are just beginning to emerge. Therefore, there exists an urgent need to further build on and share practical knowledge and tools for policy dialogue and policy formulation. The ILO project &#x201C;Global Product Green Jobs&#x201D; will focus on knowledge generation and knowledge sharing regarding the employment aspects of transitions to the green economy. Project activities will be implemented at global and national level: I. At global level, the project will respond to the growing demand for knowledge and technical support through the development of knowledge products and practical tools for green jobs policies. A knowledge sharing strategy will help to make this knowledge accessible to constituents with the objective to strengthen their capacity for articulating the decent work implications of national sustainable development strategies. The knowledge sharing strategy will include the organization of workshops and the creation of network building will build new linkages among constituents and allow them to create new forms of cooperation. II. At national level, awareness raising, capacity building and green jobs assessments will build the ground for the design of national strategies that focus on the creation of decent work for women and men in green or greened economic sectors. The project will implement activities in two countries, Brazil and Kenya. Both countries have shown increased interest in formulating national policies for the creation of green jobs. Past ILO activities in both countries have achieved substantive impact. The project aims to build on these impacts and expand them. The intended impact of the project is to benefit job seekers and workers by creating gainful and productive job opportunities. Enterprises, esp. SMEs, will be taking advantage of new business opportunities in green markets and will be adopting green business practices in their operations (greening-up and greening-down the value chain). Special emphasis will be given to the challenge to overcome skills shortages for green jobs. The two level project strategy (national &#x2013; international) aims to strengthen the ability of national stakeholders to design strategies for decent work in prioritized sectors/areas and to expand their policy initiatives for green jobs to other sectors/areas, seeking coherence and collective efficiencies among ministries and social partners.</narrative>
