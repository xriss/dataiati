   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Solid growth in the past has not led to the expected job creation and other traditional engines of job creation in MPCs, such as public sector employment, although being complementary will not be sufficient to meet the employment challenge in the coming decades. While addressing these issues was important for poverty reduction and social inclusion before the Arab Spring, it has become even more important because it also determines future political stability. Tackling the unemployment challenge will require a mix of short-term and long-term interventions to mitigate the immediate effects of high unemployment while setting the basis for sustained job-rich growth. As high growth has not necessarily been producing the expected number of jobs, the role of investment projects funded by IFIs in contributing to a job-rich growth must be carefully scrutinised. This is particularly true in a period that every stone must be turned in search of new job opportunities for the high number of youth seeking an entry into the labour market. The proposed study aims to provide an in-depth analysis of the employment outcomes of IFI-financed investment projects in the MPC. The ultimate goal will be to provide a set of recommendations as to how IFIs and bilateral agencies active in the region could maximize - within existing constraints - their results both in terms of the quantity and quality of jobs created. The MPCs covered are Tunisia, Morocco, Egypt and Jordan.</narrative>
