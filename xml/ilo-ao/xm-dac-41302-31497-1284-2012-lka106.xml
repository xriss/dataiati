   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Executive Summary The global maritime industry faces an increased risk of HIV infection in many regions of the developing world. In January and February 2010, the ILO and the National Union of Seafarers Sri Lanka (NUSS) conducted a Rapid Situation Assessment (RSA) on knowledge, attitudes and behaviours related to HIV &amp; AIDS among seafarers, dockers (Colombo port) and students from three maritime schools based in Colombo, Galle and Panadura. Nearly 72 % of the respondents were between 18- 24 age group. The HIV response in Sri Lanka must address low condom use in commercial sex and the importance of targeted programs for clients of sex workers. The objective of this project is to prevent HIV and reduce related stigma and discrimination among maritime workers in Sri Lanka. Key activities are as follows: 1. Advocacy 2. Behavioural change communications at ports 3. Establish an HIV resource centre at the Colombo Port 4. Develop a maritime HIV training module and train trainers 5. Conduct a knowledge, behaviour and attitude survey to form the evidence base to develop an action plan for the sector Expected outputs are as follows: 1. Port authorities commit to programming and integrating HIV prevention into their routine work 2. Curriculum for maritime schools is developed and integrated into regular curriculum 3. BCC materials for maritime workers are revised and improved 4. Port authorities, shipping company management and relevant staff are trained to deliver on going HIV prevention programmes. 5.
