  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Through Phase III of the Promoting Gender Equality and Women&#x2019;s Empowerment in the World of Work in Brazil, Angola, South Africa, India and China (BASIC) project, the ILO will continue to work with governments and social partners to create decent employment, achieve women&#x2019;s economic empowerment and gender equality in the workplace. The overriding aim of Phase III will be to build upon and consolidate what has been achieved in Phases I and II, such that the ILO&#x2019;s approaches and tools will be embedded and ongoing. BASIC III will seek to develop the knowledge base on gender equality in the workplace; promote representation, advocacy and voice for women workers; and build the capacity of constituents to promote gender equality and combat gender-based discrimination. One central way of advancing this objective will be through using the results of research and outreach commissioned during Phases I and II to provide training and technical assistance to ILO constituents. Research and advocacy undertaken in respect of the ILO&#x2019;s four &#x2018;gender equality&#x2019; conventions in South Africa, India and Angola, on decent work for domestic workers in China and India, on work-life balance in Brazil and Angola, and on making labour force data more gender sensitive in South Africa will be followed up and where practicable developed into tools for constituents. As per the first two phases of the project, the ILO&#x2019;s Participatory Gender Audit (PGA) will be used to advance gender equality in the workplace. PGA trainings have been undertaken with constituents in South Africa and Angola, and the methodology will be expanded to other countries. Given that (with the exception of Angola) the target countries are the dominant political and economic countries in their respective regions, Phase III will seek to replicate some of the good practices developed under Phases I and II in neighbouring Least Developed Countries (LDC). Thus the project will seek to replicate South African good practice in Zimbabwe; Indian good practice in Nepal; and Chinese good practice in Mongolia. Given the linguistic links, the project will also seek to replicate Brazilian and Angolan good practice in Mozambique.</narrative>
