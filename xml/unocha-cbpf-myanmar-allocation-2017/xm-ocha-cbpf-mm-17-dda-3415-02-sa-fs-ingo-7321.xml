  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project is a partnership between World Vision International &#x2013; Myanmar and Local NGO Meikswe Myanmar (MSSM). The project aims to meet the emergency food assistance and early recovery needs of 3,934 HH (1,100 direct and 2,334 indirect) and  19,673 beneficiaries (8,000 directly (2000 men, 2560 women, 1712 girls, 1728 boys) /11,673 indirect ( 2,697 men, 3198 women, 2855 boys, 2923 girls) in communities in Kyauktaw, Mrauk-U, and Pauktaw townships. MSSM has access to the targeted conflict affected villages. The project will coordinate with other key actors, especially WFP WV has included regular monitoring visits to Rakhine which will be timed around coordination meetings allowing for full and active participation while WVM will support MSSM participation at cluster meetings as require, especially coordination with WFP. Activities will consider gender considerations, including risk and vulnerabilities of women, for e.g it is anticipated that 50% of members of the Cash Management Committees will be women, while assets will be selected based not only on women&#x2019;s capacity to take part, but also on the overall benefit to women and girls. Most marginalized will include landless households, those without access to employment, those without ability to access food (i.e. land/subsistence activities, female headed households, and households with PLWD.) A detailed selection criteria for beneficiaries and projects is provided In line with the MHF&#x2019;s priorities the project aims to prevent an increase of needs and reduce vulnerability, providing support to both displaced persons and host communities. These townships have been significantly impacted through the recent conflict with impacts on their livelihood and access to markets, and have received little to no external assistance since the renewed violence began on August 25, 2017. Through Cash for Assets activities, 1100 households will receive cash for their basic needs (based upon household rations) while 10 village assets such as road renovation/construction and water ponds will be created For areas where cash is not assessed to be feasible, WV will explore a voucher system modality. Should a voucher system not be possible, in consultation with MHF and WFP, WV would seek to conduct in-kind activities. . The project will provide the community with materials such as stones, bricks, cement to assist with construction. It is estimated that a further 9,111 (2054 men, 2380 women, 2305 boys and 2373 girls) people will benefit from the use and access to community assets. In addition, in kind or emergency cash based agriculture and non-agricultural livelihood support will be provided to 500 households and the immediate family members 2500 (625  men, 800 women, 535 boys, 540 girls) will be benefited by this project to improve and restore livelihoods impacted by the conflict.. This support will be accompanied by appropriate livelihood skills training and support. Recognizing the security and safety concerns of the current context, the project will distribute cash through a financial service provider. Gender, protection, and conflict sensitivity have been considered throughout the design of this project. WVM and MSSM will ensure that distribution is fair and equitable in safe locations). This approach aims to target those who currently are not receiving assistance nor have agencies working there. WV will coordinate closely with WFP to ensure there is no duplication of villages or beneficiaries, selected villages have been further informed from WFP beneficiary list for the project. . WV will encourage and support MSSM to also take part in relevant coordination meetings. In-kind or cash based livelihood support activity will target communities who are not beneficiaries of CFA, who have the required skills, experience and motivation, and who are seeking sustainable employment or self-employment.</narrative>
