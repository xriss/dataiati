   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Integrated WASH, Child Protection, Food Security   Livelihoods support to displaced people in Kachin and Northern Shan states</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project will provide an integrated response to the needs of children (boys and girls) and their families displaced by conflict in Northern Shan and Kachin states. It will be implemented by Save the Children (SCI) for WASH, CP, and FSL and by Wunpawng Ninghtoi (WPN) for CP and FSL. The project beneficiaries are displaced to 18  camps in 5 townships in Northern Shan and Kachin, where a comprehensive WASH, Child Protection and Livelihoods package will be implemented. In addition, an integrated multi-sector rapid response mechanism for WASH, Child Protection, Food Security and Livelihoods will be implemented.. For this integrated response, the breakdown is as follows: we will be conducting Child Protection activities in 18 camps, WASH activities in 14 camps, and Food Security/Livelihoods activities in 13 camps (please see beneficiary annex). WPN will also provide CP and livelihood support in 8 host community and boarding house locations in Kachin. 

The WASH component will complete the construction of WASH infrastructure to meet 100% of minimum standards for water and sanitation in 14 camps. SCI will also support hygiene promotion through recruitment and training of local volunteers and delivery of hygiene promotion messages. SCI will also focus on building capacity of the community to self-manage the water, sanitation and hygiene in their camp through training to Camp Management Committees on operation and maintenance of facilities, water testing and water safety. 

The Child Protection (CP) activities will be conducted by SCI and WPN and will provide a comprehensive CP response including case management, psychosocial support through child friendly spaces, protection monitoring, awareness-raising on child protection risks (including MRE), and capacity building of community-based child protection groups. 

The Livelihoods intervention will provide business skills and financial literacy/education to 440 households in both Kachin and Northern Shan living in 13 camps. Targeted households will be identified through the participatory wealth rankings and other criteria outlined in this proposal. Each household will be provided with training on livelihood skills and business management skills and after completion of the trainings, these households will receive a cash grant in support of a business proposal for $200. 

In addition to these interventions in protracted camps, a rapid response mechanism incorporating WASH, CP, Food Security and Livelihoods will be implemented. In the case of a displacement, the MEAL team will be dispatched to undertake a multi-sector needs assessment and in response, WASH, CP, Food assistance and livelihoods support will be provided according to identified needs. WASH assistance includes construction of emergency infrastructure and distribution of NFI and hygiene kits and hygiene promotion. Child Protection interventions in emergency includes risk assessment and reporting, establishment of child-friendly spaces, awareness-raising and MRE. Food will be delivered by cash or in-kind based on a rapid cash feasibility assessment and is based on an allocation of $11 per person per   month. Through the RRM, we plan to provide emergency food assistance sufficient for 30 days according to WFP standards for 3,000 IDPs across Kachin and Northern Shan states. A livelihoods cash support will also be provided for $200 per household up to a maximum of 95 households, where it can be established that there has been significant damage to livelihoods or assets in the return area. This will be distributed prior to or after return, depending on accessibility.   In support of the rapid response mechanism, SCI will also provide capacity building through two trainings to local service providers on Child Protection in Emergencies (5 days), and WASH in Emergencies (5 days).  Any remaining stock from the current RRM project (4078) will be deployed in support of these activities.</narrative>
