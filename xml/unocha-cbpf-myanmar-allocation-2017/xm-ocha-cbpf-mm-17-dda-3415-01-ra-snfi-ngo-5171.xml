  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The on-going Kachin conflict that restarted in 2011 has resulted in large scale displacement of people.  Most of the internally displaced persons (IDPs) have sought shelter in camps and camp-like settings across the area.  As a first line of response providers, many of the religious facilities such as churches and monasteries were used to provide temporary shelters for the IDPs.  About 1/3rd of shelter support to IDPS was provided by local faith based organizations.  Five years since these shelters were constructed in 2011-12, many of these structures are in various degrees of dilapidation making them less than suitable for habitation.  Anticipating that the conflict will end soon, the shelters were designed to last for about two years.  However, as the conflict continues it would therefore seem like the majority of those displaced will continue to be so for some time yet and the shelters they are occupying are deteriorating further. 

Heavy fighting since late December,2016 has reportedly resulted in the displacement of almost 7,000 people, including three camps in non-government areas (Zai Awng/Mung Ga Zup, Hkau Shau and Maga Yang), as well as additional displacement in Mansi and Shwegu townships. While people from the three camps were initially displaced to temporary locations within non-government areas, an increasing number of people had also started to arrive in government areas in very early February, 2017

As of 25 January, approximately 1,000 people displaced from non-government areas have arrived in Sadung, Myitkyina and Waingmaw Township, according to information from the Government, JST and partners in Myitkyina. New IDP displaced from Zai Aung and Maga Yang camps arriving in Myitkyina and Waimaw are being accommodated in the existing 5 camps, where they are receiving humanitarian assistance through existing camps structures.  

The proposed shelter project focusing on the shelter component of MHF is seeking support to improve the shelter conditions for the newly IDPs from NGCA to arriving the exiting IDP camps in Waimaw and Myitkyina Township. 
Area of Intervention	Focus of Shelter Project	# of Camps and Location	# of Families benefiting
Mytkyina	Focus is to meet the shelter needs of the newly displaced families arriving from Zai Awng and Maga Yang camps in NGCA.  Renewed fighting has displaced new communities to new locations and this project will try to meet the shelter needs of families who do not have appropriate shelter to stay in the existing camps of Waimaw and Myitkyina Township.</narrative>
