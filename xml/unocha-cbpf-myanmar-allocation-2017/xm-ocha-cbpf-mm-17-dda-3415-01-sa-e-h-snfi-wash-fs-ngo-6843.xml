  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">ln June 2011, conflict in Kachin State, Myanmar resumed between the Kachin Independent Organization (KIO/KIA) and Myanmar Government, ending a 17-years ceasefire. The fighting is intensively ongoing. Those conflicts have resulted in destruction of infrastructure, loss of lives and livelihoods, deterioration in education and health services and large displacement, and the impact on local populations has been devastating.

KBC is the faith based organization and founded in 1910. It helps to many affected communities across the country to recover from the impact of decades of civil conflict and natural disaster in order to have access to the protection and assistance they need. 
KBC is implementing ago-ecological farming, micro credit unions, capacity building, income generating groups, small scale business, Organic rice business, money transfer and Sustainable Development Diploma Program for non IDPs and IDPS since 2000. Especially KBC is involving in CCCM, Shelter, NFI, Protection, EIE, Food, Livelihood, WASH, EMDR, Civic and Peace Education, Village Mapping and right to land for extremely vulnerable which includes women and children, the sick, the elderly and people with disabilities. 

This Emergency Response through Multi Sector Assistance for Intensive Prolong Conflict-Affected Displaced women, men, girls and boys in NGCA and GCA , Kachin and Northern Shan States proposal for 1st November, 2017 to 31st July 2018 represents a plan to be undertaken to improve and have access to emergency in education, Health Care Services, emergency temporary Shelter and water and sanitation response of conflict-induced displacement for disaster affected IDPS in IDP Camps of Kachin State and Shan State to save IDPs life. 

(1) Education: :To ensure equitable and safe education services and kits are provided to girls and boys through parent teacher meeting , KBC will communicate to Students&#x2019; Parents with stakeholders, provide of Student kits, Teaching kits, monthly meeting and maintain Temporary learning space and learning/teaching material for primary and post primary schools.

(2) Health: : To improve and have access to Health Care Services in IDP Camps of Kachin State through Regular Humanitarian Services Provision and Rapid Response Mechanism, this project will support primary healthcare services to 17,947 beneficiaries (men = 5,370, women = 6,034, boys = 3,286, girls = 3,257, under 5 = 2310, pregnant women = 260) through KBC Healing Ministry Department, Camp leaders and Health Workers in IDP camps. The beneficiaries for health service are men, women, girls, boys, pregnant women and under 5 years old children. During the project, primary health care services would be implemented both on a regular basis and through rapid response mechanism in conflict or disaster affected areas.
(3) Shelters/NFIs: The project will also focus on shelter construction for displaced persons in Lana Zup Ja. And also there will be renovation of shelters which will be done in Shwezet camp, and Mansi KBC camp.   KBC will focus in 231 households, including 5 households with people with disabilities, 63 households with elderly people, 112 women headed household and one child headed household. Constructing the shelter as a single unit will contribute to reduce the risks of GBV issues.  If we construct the shelter as a single unit we can reduce women safety and increase privacy because they must stay as an ownership together one family one housing. There is opportunity for the family enabling to maintain and extend with attached to the main shelter if there is their family member getting marriage. Metal fame shelter could sustain them housing for long.

(4) WASH: Interventions will address the highest priority needs based on the cluster wide prioritization. Using a participatory approach, the CCCM of each camp will be consulted to ensure the differential needs of men, women, boys and girls.</narrative>
