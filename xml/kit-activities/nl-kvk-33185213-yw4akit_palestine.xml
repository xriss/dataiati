   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Young Women for Awareness, Agency, Advocacy, and Accountability Palestine - PW1</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The programme aims to strengthen and diversify young women&#x2019;s participation and amplify their voices to effectively influence decision-making towards gender-just laws, policies, norms, and practices related to their bodily integrity and equal participation.
The main objective of pathway 1 is to strengthen the advocacy capacity of 6 women&#x2019;s rights organizations (WROs) to amplify young women&#x2019;s voices in Palestine by 2025. As specific objectives this pathway envisages amplifying young women&#x2019;s voices by promoting that WROs provide space in their internal organizations for young women and establish internal inclusive processes and practices in decision-making, management, and programming. Also, by working with WROs to include, represent, hear, mentor, support, and prepare young women to take part in advocacy initiatives, link them to strategic decision-making forums, and scale-up local advocacy strategies. KIT, Equality Now and the Country Leads facilitate capacity strengthening. KIT is responsible for the design and implementation of the WROs advocacy and organizational capacity assessment, the design of the individual WRO/FBO capacity development plans, and a collective learning agenda as well as the facilitation of reflective monitoring and adaptive learning approaches with the WROs.</narrative>

      <narrative xml:lang="EN">A couple of the 21 sub-domains under assessment in the AOCA are linked to the programme&#x2019;s short term outcomes focusing on enhanced organizational vitality, inclusivity and focus on a diverse group of young women and increased advocacy capacity. STO 1.1 improved practices in internal organization to strengthen young women&#x2019;s voice, agency, leadership, and representative participation in decision-making processes and safety of young women leaders is assessed through domain 13 in the AOCA tool (commitment to, and practices to promote, young women&#x2019;s voice, agency, leadership). STO 1.2 key programme documents of WROs include intersectional analysis and approach to increase/broaden reach of all groups of young women is assessed through domain 3 (Policy and legal analysis and insights into policy processes from young women&#x2019;s perspective and using gender and intersectionality lens) and domain 14 (Connections with broader and diverse groups of young women) in the AOCA tool. 

In year 1, two WROs in Palestine are assessed at basic capacity whereas four WROs are at moderate capacity when it comes to promoting and strengthening young women&#x2019;s roles within their organizations. Five of the WROs are women-led (WRGE045) and the FBO is male-led (WRG047). Overall, all WROs have some (employment, recruitment, etc.) strategies in place to promote and ensure young women are recruited and represented among staff, general assembly, or the board (of directors). Some of the organisations indicate that their efforts are put into place to ensure a diverse group of young women is represented, mostly based on their age, religion, location, and in a few cases disability, though mostly this is not documented in specific strategies. Two WROs have a non-discrimination policy in place. Most of the organisations have some forms of safety measures and mechanisms in place, varying from an actual anti-harassment policy, to practices which are often not yet structured/documented, or a SEAH policy and mechanism currently being developed. 
Overall, rating on the intersectional lens to policy and legal analysis is low and most organisations in Palestine expressed the need to strengthen this. Depending on the policy/law under assessment, specific groups are analysed (e.g. refugees, women survivors of SGBV). One of the WROs brings in a disability lens but does not yet link it to other determinants of exclusion such as age.
With respect to connections with broader and diverse groups of young women, five out of six WROs in Palestine have moderate capacity, and one organisation has basic capacity. All WROs have good relationships and feedback loops and mechanisms, such as women committees, youth platforms, focal points, often with adequate efforts to include young women. Those young women are mostly engaged to inform the design phase of interventions or during monitoring and evaluation, rather than at programmatic or institutional decision-making level. The extent to which a diverse group of young women is engaged depends largely on a project/programme&#x2019;s objectives, topic, intervention location, or even donor requirements. For most of the WROs, this seems rather ad-hoc and not a systematic process.</narrative>

    <description>
     <narrative xml:lang="EN">In order to asses the advocacy and organisational capacity of the WROs, KIT designed the Advocacy and Organisational Capacity Assessment (AOCA) method measuring 21 different sub-domains. These sub-domains concern a selected number of capacities that are considered instrumental for WROs to effienciently and successfully carry out their advocacy activities, and speficically capacity to involve and amplify young women&apos;s voices.  
The assessment results in the AOCA measure, which indicates a WROs current advocacy and organisational capacity level to amplify young women&#x2019;s voices and promote young women&#x2019;s leadership and equal participation in (political) decision-making, their bodily integrity, and the prevention and elimination of sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV). 
There are seven different categories reflecting the WROs capacity level:
1.	Well-developed (score 11 or higher)
2.	Good (between 9 and 10.9)
3.	Moderate (between 7 and 8.9)
4.	Fair (between 5 and 6.9)
5.	Basic (between 3 and 4.9) 
6.	Limited (between 1 and 2.9)
7.	Very limited (lower than 0.9)</narrative>
