   <narrative xml:lang="EN">KIT is a technical partner of Power to You(the) (PTY), and has been responsible for the desk reviews and baseline studies conducted in the 7 PTY  countries in collaboration with in-country research teams.
The country-specific desk reviews objectives were:
&#x2022;	To provide an overview of available literature, evidence and lessons learned related to the pathways of change in the Power to You(th) Theory of Change
&#x2022;	To provide background information for the country-specific baseline studies that follow after 
&#x2022;	To provide country teams with an overview, to be able to identify remaining knowledge needs and gaps for the implementation of the power to you(th) programme
The overall aim of the baseline studies was to provide a situational analysis of the focus areas of the programme and provide insights which can be incorporated into the design and/or adaptation of programme interventions. These baseline studies
used a mixed-methods design, involving qualitative and quantitative research methodologies.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Power to You(th) (PTY) programme focuses on harmful practices, such as female genital mutilation/cutting (FGM/C) and child marriage, sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV) and unintended pregnancies. All of these are persistent &#x2018;key issues&#x2019; where insufficient progress has been made in recent years.

Funded by the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the programme is led by a consortium between Amref Flying Doctors, Rutgers, and Sonke Gender Justice, with KIT and Choice for Youth and Sexuality as technical partners. It is being implemented in seven countries by partners of these three consortium organisations in Ethiopia, Ghana, Indonesia, Kenya, Malawi, Senegal and Uganda, with coordination support and advocacy activities conducted in the Netherlands and globally.

The consortium strives to foster ownership at the country level, with locally formed coalitions and representation of beneficiaries in its governance. The implementing partners believe in the power of young people (especially young women and girls) to bring about positive change, and think they should be meaningfully included in discussions and decisions regarding key issues.

Accordingly, the programme will empower adolescent girls and young women to increase their agency, claim their rights, address gender inequalities, challenge gender norms and advocate for inclusive decision-making. Boys and men will be engaged as positive contributors to this process of change.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The knowledge and information provided out of the 7 desk reviews and the 7 baseline studies targeted the whole Power to You(the) (PTY) Consortium, but more specifically the PTY country teams, and CSO and state actors that will be part of the implementation of the PTY programme. Furthermore, the desk reviews and baseline studies informed the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The participants of the baseline studies were adolescents and young people between the age of 15-24, social and state actors, civil society organizations and youth advocates active in the area of harmful practices, SGBV and teenage pregnancy in the implementation areas in-country.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Co-designing the desk reviews and baseline studies: 
During the first quarter of the year, a Terms of Reference (ToR) for the desk reviews, as well as the baseline research objectives and research outline, were developed. Between the country teams and KIT, a clear role division was established. The focus of the baseline study for KIT was on the external environment and influences (pathways 1, 3, and 4 of the Theory of Change),

The 7 desk reviews covered the following:  
&#x2022;             Overview of the available country-specific evidence on the four PtY ToC pathways: 
o            Young people&apos;s knowledge, agency and decision making around harmful practices, SGBV and unintended pregnancy 
o            Online and offline civic space for CSOs, and existing power dynamics 
o            Existing social norms and other factors (economical)  influencing harmful practices (Child marriage, FGM/C), SGBV and unintended pregnancies 
o            Policies on harmful practices, SGBV and SRHR preventing unintended pregnancy and their implementation 
&#x2022;                 Overview of recent advocacy programs addressing HTP, SGBV, unintended pregnancies, lessons learned and examples of successful advocacy strategies with a specific focus on
o            Workable approaches to transform norms
o            Engagement of young people in advocacy
o            Role of Media</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In April 2021, KIT developed a mixed-method research proposal with input from the Technical Working Group (TWG) on Planning monitoring evaluation and learning (PMEL), the PTY country teams and KIT&#x2019;s research partners in each country. The proposal included 10 (qualitative and quantitative)
tools, including specific youth-friendly research tools /methods (eg. photovoice and vignettes) to engage adolescents in a youth-friendly manner in this research. This mixed-method baseline study proposal was submitted and approved by the TWG PMEL and the Research Ethical Committee (REC) of KIT at the end of May.

As a result of consultations and discussions between KIT, country researchers, and PTY country teams, seven country-specific research proposals were developed in June. This co-creation process was encouraged so that the baseline could best contribute to the knowledge and information needed for the Power to You(th) project&#x2019;s implementation. (sub)Counties and youth structures were selected in close discussion with the PTY country teams and sometimes government district officials. All country-specific research proposals were submitted by the end of June to all in&#x2013;country ethical research boards. In some countries, these procedures took a lot more time and effort/details, than it was the case before. The last ethical approval (for Senegal) was granted early September. At the same time, the spread of Covid-19 increased and this led to renewed lockdowns in Uganda, Kenya, and Indonesia, which also meant that it was not feasible for the research teams to make a pre-visit to the specific study areas to prepare and to connect with district officials. Due to Covid-19, the decision was made in Indonesia to move to online data collection instead of face-to-face. In Uganda and Kenya, it was decided to wait until the lockdown restrictions were lifted, as the research teams in Uganda and Kenya did not see a possibility to collect data online with young people in refugee camps, fisher communities and nomadic communities.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In July and August, the kick-off training workshops were conducted. During these workshops the PTY country teams presented PTY, so all research teams were well informed about the country specific PTY programmes.  In the seven countries a quantitative baseline survey was conducted with adolescent girls and boys (15-19) and young women and men (20-24) who are involved with registered youth structures (including Civil Society Organizations (CSOs), Youth Clubs, and in-school youth groups) working in the focus areas
of the PtY programme in the study counties, using an Open Data Kit (ODK) and electronic
tablets. The qualitative strand of the study included focus group discussions with adolescents and young people;
semi-structured &amp; key informant interviews with social and state actors; and in-depth interviews with
adolescents/young people, and youth activists/leaders. Photovoice was used to provide space for young people to express themselves in a different manner, during interviews. They made pictures of their surroundings in which they could explain how they have influence on situations happening around them and to discuss these pictures as part of interviews.

Data analyses, validation and report writing:
In October, data collection in all countries was completed, and the research team began
coding, transcribing, translating, and analyzing all data. In the same month, analysis workshops
were held, and on November 1st, a report with preliminary findings about the basket indicators
of the seven country baselines was presented to the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MoFA).
In November and December, draft reports were shared and validated with PTY country teams
and other stakeholders in -country. 

In the first quarter of 2022, a synthesis report was shared with the main findings of the 7 baseline studies to the Dutch ministry of foreign affairs. Furthermore the desk review and baseline data have been used to co-create knowledge products (products like social media campaigning, policy briefs, stories that can support evidence-based advocacy) during knowledge translation workshops facilitated by KIT with members of the TWG PMELR group</narrative>
