  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The programme aims to strengthen and diversify young women&#x2019;s participation and amplify their voices to effectively influence decision-making towards gender-just laws, policies, norms, and practices related to their bodily integrity and equal participation.
The main objective of pathway 1 is to strengthen the advocacy capacity of 9 women&#x2019;s rights organizations (WROs) to amplify young women&#x2019;s voices in Kenya by 2025. As specific objectives this pathway envisages amplifying young women&#x2019;s voices by promoting that WROs provide space in their internal organizations for young women and establish internal inclusive processes and practices in decision-making, management, and programming. Also, by working with WROs to include, represent, hear, mentor, support, and prepare young women to take part in advocacy initiatives, link them to strategic decision-making forums, and scale-up local advocacy strategies. KIT, Equality Now and the Country Leads facilitate capacity strengthening. KIT is responsible for the design and implementation of the WROs advocacy and organizational capacity assessment, the design of the individual WRO/FBO capacity development plans, and a collective learning agenda as well as the facilitation of reflective monitoring and adaptive learning approaches with the WROs.</narrative>

    </title>
    <description>
     <narrative xml:lang="EN">In order to assess the advocacy and organisational capacity of the WROs, KIT designed the Advocacy and Organisational Capacity Assessment (AOCA) method measuring 21 different sub-domains. These sub-domains concern a selected number of capacities that are considered instrumental for WROs to efficiently and successfully carry out their advocacy activities, and to involve and amplify young women&apos;s voices. 
The assessment results in the AOCA measure and category, an ordinal scale, which indicates a WROs current advocacy and organisational capacity level to amplify young women&#x2019;s voices and promote young women&#x2019;s leadership and equal participation in (political) decision-making, their bodily integrity, and the prevention and elimination of sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV). 
This score represents the baseline value for IO1. There are seven different categories reflecting the WROs capacity level: 1. Well-developed (score 11 or higher) 2. Good (between 9 and 10.9) 3. Moderate (between 7 and 8.9) 4. Fair (between 5 and 6.9) 5. Basic (between 3 and 4.9) 6. Limited (between 1 and 2.9) 7. Very limited (lower than 0.9).
Since we are not able to present ordinal scale in IATI, we are presenting the baseline values of the WROs in the respective countries as a unit, reflecting the number of WROs disaggregated by leadership that are at a certain capacity scale.</narrative>

This score represents the baseline value for IO1. There are seven different categories reflecting the WROs capacity level: 1. Well-developed (score 11 or higher) 2. Good (between 9 and 10.9) 3. Moderate (between 7 and 8.9) 4. Fair (between 5 and 6.9) 5. Basic (between 3 and 4.9) 6. Limited (between 1 and 2.9) 7. Very limited (lower than 0.9).
Since we are not able to present ordinal scale in IATI, we are presenting the baseline values of the WROs in the respective countries as a unit, reflecting the number of WROs disaggregated by leadership that are at a certain capacity scale.</narrative>

    <description>
     <narrative xml:lang="EN">In order to assess the advocacy and organisational capacity of the WROs, KIT designed the Advocacy and Organisational Capacity Assessment (AOCA) method measuring 21 different sub-domains. These sub-domains concern a selected number of capacities that are considered instrumental for WROs to efficiently and successfully carry out their advocacy activities, and to involve and amplify young women&apos;s voices. 
The assessment results in the AOCA measure and category, an ordinal scale, which indicates a WROs current advocacy and organisational capacity level to amplify young women&#x2019;s voices and promote young women&#x2019;s leadership and equal participation in (political) decision-making, their bodily integrity, and the prevention and elimination of sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV). 
This score represents the baseline value for IO1. There are seven different categories reflecting the WROs capacity level: 1. Well-developed (score 11 or higher) 2. Good (between 9 and 10.9) 3. Moderate (between 7 and 8.9) 4. Fair (between 5 and 6.9) 5. Basic (between 3 and 4.9) 6. Limited (between 1 and 2.9) 7. Very limited (lower than 0.9).
