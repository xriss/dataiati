  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Save the Children is intending to reduce the vulnerability of the drought affected communities and ensure the retention of children at schools in rural villages in Bari and Hiran regions through provision of life-saving basic WASH services via the schools. The proposed intervention will link with SC&#x2019;s ongoing emergency response interventions of WASH, Education, Heath, Nutrition and Food Security, Livelihoods, all defined to provide a combination of lifesaving and resilience building support to drought affected communities in Puntland and Hiran. The proposed project activities will include provision of water supply through voucher system via schools to drought affected communities and school children to meet the drinking, cooking and personal hygiene needs, rehabilitation of strategic water sources at the community, provision of operation and maintenance tools, rehabilitation of WASH facilities in the target schools, trainings and dissemination of hygiene best practice through IECs. In addition, Save the Children will provide 4000 households from the drought affected populations with 2 water storage containers of 20 litters per household and PuR sachets for water treatment at the household level. SC confirms that an integrated intervention is required to meet the urgent and inter-connected food security, nutrition, and WASH needs in the drought affected geographical locations of Puntland. It is with this understanding that this project is designed to act in complementarity to other Save the Children projects such as Education, Joint Health and Nutrition, WASH and FSL that is currently being implemented in Bari and  Hiran region. 
The beneficiaries will be selected through a community consultative process with the community leaders and community education committees (CECs) in order to ensure that only those who meet the specified vulnerable criteria are identified for support. Female headed households, families with low income, pregnant and lactating mothers among others will be given high priority while accountability and transparency measures will be put in place to ensure equity within an all-inclusive aid administration process. SC will maintain and expand synergies across all the programs by ensuring that this project is implemented alongside the education and that benefits arising out of multiple actions to the same target groups are exponentially increased. For example Save the Children will use 24 schools as entry points for the provision of WASH services under this project and the target communities and students will before the provision of the water supply. 
Furthermore, through collaboration with community members, Community education committees, parent teacher associations and students, Save the Children will also work to bring positive changes in hygiene and sanitation situation of targeted communities and schools. The team will identify respected community members (including elders, religious leaders, Women/Youth groups, teachers etc) who are interested to work voluntarily in their communities. Save the Children will provide these community volunteers (comprising male and female) with training on community hygiene promotion through community-based sessions. The trained volunteers will then work with Save the Children&#x2019;s WASH staff to disseminate hygiene and sanitation related messages to all community members and school children. Save the Children will adopt, print, and use graphic IEC materials developed by the Somalia WASH cluster to facilitate further the implementation of soft component of the project.
This project is designed to improve the quality and access to services in communities, in particular the provision of safe water at the community level. Save the Children is therefore proposing a 6 month project under this SHF allocation for 24 severely drought hit villages in Bari and Hiran for 4,687 households (28,122 total beneficiaries, Men: 7,282 Women: 7,557, Boys:6,694 Girls: 6,589).</narrative>
