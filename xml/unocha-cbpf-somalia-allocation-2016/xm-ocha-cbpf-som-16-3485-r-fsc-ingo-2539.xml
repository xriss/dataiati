  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project targets Internally Displaced Persons, returnees and vulnerable host community affected by conflict, forced evictions and floods along the Indian Ocean. It has dual objectives namely:  (1) Target groups meet their immediate food needs. This will be achieved through unconditional cash transfers to vulnerable Internally Displaced Persons, host communities and returnees aimed at improving household immediate access to food. This corresponds to Food Security cluster strategic objective 1 &#x201C;Address humanitarian needs by providing life-saving and life-sustaining assistance to people in need, prioritizing the most vulnerable&#x201D;(2) Target groups have alternative livelihoods / resume productive activities. This corresponds to Food Security cluster strategic objective 2 &#x201C;Strengthen the protection of displaced and other vulnerable groups and catalyzes durable solutions&#x201D;. This objective aims to increase household productive assets as an alternative livelihoods source. In Kismayo, women headed households are particularly vulnerable with limited livelihoods source. The objective of creating an alternative livelihoods source will be achieved through training on income generation activities (IGA) and consequent support with conditional cash transfers grant to facilitate business start-up. This project targets more the 70% representation of women as beneficiaries. 
The activities planned under each objective are: Activity 1: Unconditional cash transfers to 555 households in Kismayo (Farjano, Dalxiska-255 households, Alanley-200households, and Fanoole-100households) reaching approximately 3,630 individuals. At least 70% of the beneficiaries are expected to be female headed households. The transfers will determined by mean minimum expenditure basket for Kismayo ($ 100). Cash  Transfer Programs will take into account seasonality of needs and agricultural calendar in order to maximize positive effects of cash injection to markets and target communities. Unconditional Cash Transfer will benefit 555 households (389 female 166 male) in Kismayo targeting vulnerable female headed households, flood and evictions affected individuals with a focus on women and youth.
Activity 2: Conditional cash transfers to 57 households in Kismayo spread out in Kismayo (Farjano-50 households) reaching approximately 342 individuals. The 57 women headed households will undergo intensive training on entrepreneurship and business development skills training for 2 weeks. The training curriculum will include: numeracy and literacy, business skills development, awareness on nutrition and child feeding practices and environmental conservation amongst others. At the end of the training, each business each trainees will be given start-up cash grant to $ 500 to start up, / boost their business undertaking. This will be given in 2 phases, one after the raining and another half a month later. Each of these women headed households will also get 2 months/transfers of cash meeting food need of $ 50 in Kismayo.

The money will be transferred through mobile money transfer platform. Two transfers will be made, one immediately after the training is complete and the other one month later. This time lag will allow room for monitoring and follow-up as business incubation takes place. It is estimated that 20% of beneficiaries will not have mobile handsets &#x2013; this is budgeted for. Post distribution monitoring will be carried out 4 weeks after cash transfer is complete in order to monitor expenditure patterns and take timely remedial actions accordingly whenever findings from post distribution monitoring deem necessary. At the end of the program, an Endline survey will be initiated in order to ascertain the change on beneficiaries attributed to the program. NRC will coordinate and network with all relevant stakeholders and actors in order to avoid duplication and optimize the use of the limited resources.</narrative>
