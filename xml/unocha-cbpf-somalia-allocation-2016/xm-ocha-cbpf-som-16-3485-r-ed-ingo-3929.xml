  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The largest proportion of Internally Displaced Persons in Mogadishu reside in the two newly established districts of Deynille (33%) and Kahda (19%), which hosts both newly arrived Internally Displaced Persons, returnees, economic migrants as well as longer term Internally Displaced Persons forcefully evicted from other parts of the city. Daynille and Kaxda districts have the highest number of settlements &#x2013; 142 and 120 settlements respectively, and Internally Displaced Persons are consistently more vulnerable, experiencing a lower standard of living, and basic services are extremely limited. In particular, access to education is poor. Only 35% and 39% of children are able to attend school in Daynille and Kaxda compared to 45% for other districts. Inability to afford private school fees ($20/month) and  lack of education facilities nearby are the most frequently given reasons The number of school facilities available are minimal, and those that are availalble have insufficient infrastructure to absorb the number of children, there are limited teaching and learning materials available, and the quality of teaching is poor, resulting in poor retention and poor performance. To address these,  the project will construct and furnish18 additional temporary learning spaces in 6 existing schools (3 classrooms per school) to accommodate new influx of Internally Displaced Persons and returnees (note: these schools already have 18 classrooms, so this will ring the total number of classrooms to 36), as well as provide the 6 targeted schools with teacher and learning materials, and provide 600 girls with sanitary materials recognizing that tis is one of the many barriers facing girls&apos; access to education. This will be complemented by community mobilisation campaigns to highlight the importance of education for Internally Displaced Persons children, with a special focus on girls and children with disabilities/special needs, who are typically excluded from education due to socio-cultural barriers. It will also provide in-service teacher training to 24 teachers (4 per school) to improve the teacher&#x2019;s skills in basic child centered teaching and learning approaches including multi grade and multi age teaching system and cross cutting issues on child rights, child protection and teacher code of conduct to enhance high quality education delivery, as well as provision of incentives to support their continued motivation and committment and specific training and mentoring activities for headteachers (1 per school) and the Community Education Committees (42 members in total (7 per school)) in managing and maintaining the school, including engagement of the local community and local resource mobilisation. The project will also support the establishment of school clubs, enabling students (boys and girls) to come together and work on different initiatives (for example school hygiene, girls forums, sports amp recreation, debating etc).</narrative>
