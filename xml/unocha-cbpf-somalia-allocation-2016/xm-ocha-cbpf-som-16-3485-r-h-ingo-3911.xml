   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Providing Lifesaving Essential Primary Health Care Services to Vulnerable Populations  living in the IDP camps of Daynile in Mogadishu.</narrative>

  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">CESVI responded to the AWD outbreak in early Jan 2016 in Kaxda and Deynille IDPs camps by providing essential life saving primary health care services and by distributing HKs (with support from Health/WASH Clusters and UNICEF) through 2 static health facilities (MCH) and outreach services (mobile teams). Cesvi is present in the area since 2014 with 2 MCHs located in Tabelaha and Elasha (K7 and K13) along the Afgoye corridor. Cesvi is currently referring malnourished cases to ACF and CWW. In addition, Cesvi is implementing livelihood activities in the area under the framework of the Agency&#x2019;s resilience Programme. The proposed project will continue to support one of CESVI most successful programs: the provision of essential life saving primary health care services targeting IDPs and vulnerable host communities. It will also continue CESVI&#x2019;s current efforts to improve healthcare and livelihood conditions, further feeding into the Humanitarian response plan for Somalia 2016. In fact, the intervention will contribute to strategic objective 1, namely to address humanitarian needs by improving access to essential lifesaving health services for crisis-affected populations aimed at reducing avoidable morbidity and mortality. The intervention will target the IDP population, children under the age of 5, pregnant and lactating women. IDPs present the poorest health situation among the target groups, including deliveries at homes, increased cases of diarrhoea, with data from Banadir hospital indicating 40% of the diarrhoea cases from the IDP camps. Moreover poor health seeking behaviour, especially for major childhood illness, is worrisome with slightly less than 50 % of children reporting acute respiratory infections (ARIs) taken to a health professional. A number of gaps identified in the targeted IDP camps influencing the health and nutrition situation include but are not limited to: low access to quality health services, especially in actors providing essential primary healthcare services, coupled with recurrent epidemic disease outbreak that have significantly affected the displaced populations, low health worker knowledge and skills on maternal, new-born and child health, limited awareness and socio-cultural factors around maternal, new-born and child health and low immunization coverage. Poor living conditions and overcrowding increases vulnerability and risk of epidemic disease outbreaks, The project activities prioritize the most vulnerable IDP population in this area and are integrated in nature offering lifesaving assistance to the 41525 target beneficiaries in &#x201C;emergency&#x201D; and &#x201C;crisis&#x201D;, including 8,305 (4028 boys, 4277 girls) under age of 5 who are more vulnerable to frequent shocks such as food insecurity and epidemic disease outbreaks. The lives, dignity and welfare of women/girls will be fully respected and protected in every phase of the project. The project will respond to the gender needs of the IDPs by addressing special needs of women and girls and sensitivities. In particular, Cesvi will provide reproductive health services to women/girls of reproductive age, PLW by-providing antenatal care to pregnant mothers, 24 Hours of maternity service deliveries by skilled birth attendants, postnatal services to mothers seeking postnatal care, GBV care- treat, counsel, referral and start mothers on modern methods of family planning service. The essential life saving primary health care will focus on the health of the most vulnerable women, boys, girls and men including the elderly and the disabled as well as the minority who may be discriminated in the IDP camps. The health education messages will be carrying negative effect of FGM and underage pregnancies among others.</narrative>
