   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Reduction of morbidity and mortality related to severe acute malnutrition through integrated outpatient therapeutic feeding  program(OTP) among  Kaxdha IDPs in Kaxda district.</narrative>

  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The largest, most vulnerable and protracted internally displaced persons (IDP) live in Mogadishu.More than half residing in the outskirts, along the Afgooye corridor in two districts, Daynille and Kaxda. Kahda has approximately 120 IDP camps and 76739 individuals.According the IDP profiling report,no settlement reported availability of nutrition services.100% of households had health services within 5 km, vaccination coverage was about 60% and 85% of households had access to latrines, although the number of persons per latrine  (109) was way above the recommended Sphere standards (20).100% of households were within 500m from a water point, most 69% use borehole water, and only only 43% of households consumed treated water more than half of  IDP population do not treat drinking water. . The most common method used to dispose waste was through Burying (53%). Open defecation is a major challenge.Majority use communal latrines that are not segregated by sex and are not lockable, with the number of users per latrine being more that five times the recommended sphere standards,giving the population the open defecation option.
82% of female and 83% of male are employed, although for these the primary work is daily labour, mostly in small service and construction sites, indicating poor livelihood that exacerbates poverty.
The recently released FSNAU 2016 Gu report on IDPs indicate Mogadishu IDPs recorded Global Acute Malnutrition (GAM) and Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM) prevalence of 14.7 percent and 3.5 percent respectively.Crude and under five death rates were 0.33 /10 000/day and 0.99 /10 000/day respectively among Mogadishu IDPs at the time of assessment.The assessments indicated the main causes of under-five deaths being fever, diarrhea and acute respiratory infection.SAM was at 3.5, a significant increase from Deyr 2015 (2.5). The high SAM rate indicates a need for emergency life saving intervention before the situation deteriorates further. These nterventions should cover primary , secondary and tertiary prevention of malnutrition. Morbidity rates remain high among IDP (44.6), which is an increase from the Deyr 2015  rate ( 29.7) (FSNAU,2016). Diseases of concern were diarrhea diseases and respiratory tract infections (FSNAU,2016), with diarrhea cases  on the increase (Health cluster,2016). Of particular concern is the vaccination coverage reported by households interviewed. Under 60% of individuals were reported to have received vaccinations for polio or measles, and under 55% reported receiving the DTP or BCG vaccinations.
IYCF indicators are seen as weak, especially those relating to breastfeeding as most mothers do not deliver in health facilities, neither are they frequent users of health services/facilities (Banadir hospital, 2015).
Considering all these,SAF UK therefore proposes to intervene with treatment of uncomplicated SAM through 1 mobile OTP, targeting children 6-59 months. Treatment will integrate basic nutrition service package (BNSP) activities , that will include IYCF education and support for PLW, including peer support groups. Other BNSP activities will include NHHP education, vaccination and micro nutrient supplementation for children 6-59 months and PLWs. The project also proposes to integrate health social behaviour change communication that is already being implemented by SAF UK.Children 6-59 months and PLWs will be identified through screening that will be done by both Community based workers (CBWs) and project staff. The project will also target grand mothers, women of child bearing age, fathers and child caregivers , that might not have children with malnutrition. These will be reached through CBW  (who will be  residents of the IDP community),  planned awareness campaigns and mass screening exercises.</narrative>
