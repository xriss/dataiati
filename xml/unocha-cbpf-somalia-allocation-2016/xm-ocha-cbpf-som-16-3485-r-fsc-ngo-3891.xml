  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The food security and livelihood project intervention for Dayniile District seeks to improve immediate access to food provision and livelihoods support through provision of livelihood-specific inputs for 145 vulnerable IDP Households. The project will support 145 IDP households (60% being women-headed households) assessed as most vulnerable identified during the vulnerability assessment to be conducted by CPD FSL at the beginning of the project, to acquire sustained livelihood means. This will be though the provision of donkeys and donkey carts per beneficiary household to provide them with  income generating means through transport of building materials, food commodities, water and other critical transport services within Mogadishu city. The households shall use the earned income estimated at US $15 per day per beneficiary household to purchasing food for their families among other needs. CPD will develop selection criteria which tentatively prioritize women currently registered as clients in the CPD&#x2019;s current Health/Nutrition Centre in Dayniile&#x2019;s K13 area and with spouses capable of working with the donkey-carts. Women-headed households with women involved in menial low waged labor and households supporting the sick and disabled have also been identified as tentative priority ones subject to completion of the vulnerability assessment. Other eligibility rules shall be considered all which will ensure the most vulnerable are targeted.  The beneficiaries will be registered and donkey tags attached to the donkeys provided with the contact telephone numbers stamped on them for ease of monitoring on its management and welfare. They shall be required to enter into a 6- month contract to remain with the donkeys before they can decide to dispose of them. A beneficiary group approach will be applied to ensure the terms are honored. The donkeys shall be examined for diseases by a certified veterinarian and also be de-wormed and a startup kit provided. The CPD FSL Team with support from Brooks Horse and Donkey Organization manuals shall also train the donkey owners on the proper donkey husbandry to ensure humane treatment. 

The beneficiaries shall also be required to become members of 5 Table Banking Groups to be formed under the project to encourage savings and avail business development Sharia-Compliant working capital. The Table Banking groups shall be trained on the Table Banking Concept and facilitated to make them operational for their members use. The Table Banking group shall be managed by their own elected management committee to encourage savings and provide Sharia compliant working capital among themselves. Table banking has been proved to enhance social contact through group based decision-making, saving money and availing group managed loans which enable the members of such a group to start small businesses or to benefit their families in one of many ways. The idea is for each member of the group to agree to contribute an agreed amount every week called shares and the contribution is noted in a savings passbook issued. A member is eligible for a loan after saving for an agreed length of time with the Table Banking Groups being mentored for a period of 8 months after formation to ensure they become viable entities.
The project will undertake a Post Distribution Monitoring (PDM) after the end of the distribution of the donkeys and donkey carts and assess their impact on the targeted beneficiaries. The 5 Table Banking Groups shall be mentored monitored monthly to assess their success and where shortfalls are noted be supported to act on them.
The project seeks to achieve two outcomes namely, 1). Improved household immediate access to food for 145 IDPs Households in Dayniile District and,  II). Sustained alternative livelihood means for 145 IDP Households supported with donkeys and donkey-carts. The provision of the donkeys and donkey carts is designed to provide the targeted households with a means to generating income.</narrative>
