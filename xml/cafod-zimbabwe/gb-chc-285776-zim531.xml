  </title>
  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The quality and speed of CAFOD&#x2019;s humanitarian work depends on the strength of its partners. The management of large-scale emergency programmes by these local organisations place a great strain on their staff and systems. There is therefore need for much greater investment to develop and reinforce permanent local capacity to prepare for and respond to emergencies. The aim of the Humanitarian Capacity Strengthening Programme is for Caritas Hwange to be able to prepare, plan and deliver effective humanitarian programmes

Humanitarian capacity strengthening is not a one off training or programme of capacity strengthening activities, it is an approach, designed to effect sustainable organisational change over a longer period of time. This Capacity Strengthening Project takes a distinctly holistic approach in identifying areas needing development and tailoring ways to tackle them. The approach has the following characteristics:

Understanding of Humanitarian Capacity: A holistic understanding of humanitarian capacity, this captures leadership, programme skills and knowledge and systems and support sectors.

Organisational commitment and ownership: The programme works with organisation&#x2019;s who are committed to strengthening their emergency capacity as only the organisation can change itself. Required is commitment from and involvement with the highest levels of leadership such as the Bishop or Board. The organisation must be open to reflecting on their strengths and weaknesses and creating space for organisational change.

CAFOD&#x2019;s role: A Humanitarian capacity development officer will work closely with Caritas Hwange. The Officer will support the organisations to identify and prioritise their capacity development needs in relation to their emergency context and their existing capacities. The HCD Officer will support the partner to identify their priorities, to inspire, motivate, advise and encourage them to create the change. 

Capacity Development Journey: The capacity development journey is characterised by trust, collaboration, self-reflection and peer support. The path Caritas Hwange takes will have 5 key stages.

Variety of Methods: Encouraged is for Caritas Hwange to look beyond training to ensure learning is incorporated into their organisation&#x2019;s culture and systems. The methods include accompaniment, peer support, self-assessment, strategy, policy and systems development, emergency simulations and on the job training.

The capacity strengthening approach that will be used is rooted in CAFODs niche of partnership. This is rooted in local ownership, choice and commitment (by the partner). The project aims at facilitating, empowering and enabling hence desisting from imposition or partner manipulation. It will not try to substitute the work of CAFOD&#x2019;s partners, or undermine their roles and responsibilities.</narrative>
