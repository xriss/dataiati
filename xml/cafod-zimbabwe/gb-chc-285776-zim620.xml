   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The overall objective of the project is to contribute to improved access and availability of food in drought prone areas and promote productive planting for 2020/21 season in the six dioceses negatively affected by drought in Zimbabwe. These are the dioceses of Chinhoyi, Masvingo, Gweru, Hwange, Gokwe as well as the Archdiocese of Bulawayo. The project will reach out to 3400 households [ 17 000 individuals] at a total cost of Euro 1,017,915.00.

Caritas Zimbabwe expects any scale up of humanitarian assistance to focus on rural communities with high population density and/or who fall into IPC4, leaving potential gaps in other districts. 

Because of its local presence in many of these communities, Caritas is better placed to reach these communities than many other agencies.  This project will therefore not focus on the worst affected districts. Instead it will make use of existing Church structures and infrastructure to target those people who may otherwise receive little or no assistance. 
The primary issue facing rural communities in Zimbabwe is food insecurity. The appeal strategy is twofold: contribute to reduction in current urgent food needs and promote future food security. 

In normal circumstances, food assistance would only be required until the start of the harvest season (April- July). However, given the poor projections for 2019/2020 harvests and ongoing economic uncertainty, Caritas Zimbabwe is anticipating the traditional lean season will extend into Autumn 2020. Working on worst case scenario, this project will therefore provide 8 months of food assistance between February and September 2020. The strategy will then shift and focus on agricultural inputs to facilitate the 2020/21 planting season and promote more sustainable access to food. 

The project will work with the same target households throughout with the aim of increasing their resilience.</narrative>
