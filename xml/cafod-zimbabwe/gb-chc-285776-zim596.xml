  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project responds to the Zimbabwe Civil unrest in Zimbabwe which was as a result of a fuel price increase of over 150% announced on January 12th. Responding to the immediate increase, the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Union (ZCTU) and several civil society organisations called for a total national shutdown which people took heed of. All services were shut off and in order to control social media interactions which were regarded as the main medium of calling for the shutdown, there was total internet shutdown by the Government of Zimbabwe. While it is a constitutional right to demonstrate in a peaceful way, the demonstrations turned violent with barricades, roadblocks, and looting. In response, police and military moved to break up the demonstrations employing disproportionate physical force, followed by a campaign of house to house searches. As part of the searches, indiscriminate and targeted assaults and arrests have been widely reported. There are many reports of temporary displacement as residents fled or sought to hide. Numbers are likely to significantly exceed documented cases. For example, the Zimbabwe Council of Churches (ZCC) and Catholic Commission of Justice and Peace (CCJP), both with a national reach in the country&#x2019;s 10 provinces and with direct contact with the affected, confirmed 600 people have been affected by violent assaults (including rape which is presumed to be under reported given anecdotal accounts). Many of those detained were denied access to medical treatment. Medical facilities were overwhelmed in the immediate aftermath and only those with the worst wounds were treated. As a result, many who are in urgent need of medical care, remain without it.</narrative>
