   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The National Civic Engagement Program for Peace, Good Governance and Accountability in Zimbabwe is a three year project focused on mobilising individual and collective action in addressing issues of public concern in 4 thematic areas:
Theme 1: Advocacy and Liaison for a victim centred national peace and reconciliation process 
Theme 2: Primary Justice, Inclusive Participation and Cohesion 
Theme 3: Resource Governance, Economic Justice and Stewardship of Creation
Theme 4: Policy Engagement and Development
Project goal: Increased influence of Zimbabwean citizens, acting collectively through formal and informal spaces for peace and good governance.
This goal is supported by 4 mutually reinforcing objectives as follows:
1. National peace and reconciliation processes that effectively address the negative effects from past and present violence. 
2. Zimbabwe leaders, both moral and elected, tolerate diversity and promote cohesion for the common good by December 2024
3. Locally available resources conserved and transform the livelihoods of locals by December 2024
4. By 2024, policy/decision makers and the general public, including the youth, are challenged to apply their minds creatively and practically to solve immediate challenges facing Zimbabwe
The project is informed by the realisation that democratic space is fast closing and this calls for church to use its influence and structures to engage citizens to have meaningful conversation on issues such as participation in  democratic forums, good governance, development as part of efforts to promote justice and peace. The project therefore seeks to create platforms of dialogue and discussions between community and the local governance institutions, leadership and other service providers. The communities would be capacitated to demand transparency, accountability, responsiveness and service delivery.</narrative>
