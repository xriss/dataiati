  </title>
  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This capacity strengthening initiative has been born out of the realisation that there is need to strengthen the capacity of Caritas Mutare as they respond to the devastating effects of Cyclone Idai so that they are able to plan, respond and deliver humanitarian work effectively and efficiently. The capacity strengthening project is not premised on training sessions only or on a set or series of capacity strengthening training activities. The project is a longer-term approach which encourages Caritas Mutare to take ownership of its own organisational change processes. The project is tailored for identification and prioritisation of strengthening of needs in relation to their emergency context and existing capacities mainly linked to the Cyclone Idai response. The humanitarian capacity strengthening framework will guide engagement with Caritas Mutare.

In order to enhance Caritas Mutare&#x2019;s capacity to implement the current response effectively and efficiently, there is need to have their capacity strengthened in all facets of emergency preparedness and response. The capacity strengthening process will ensure that Caritas Mutare will be positioned to respond to disasters of such magnitude in the future. 

This engagement will build on the work that is already existing/ongoing within the Capacity Strengthening team. This will further build on the EUAV funded PEOPLE project that is in its second year of implementation. The process will also take advantage of Caritas Zimbabwe National and Caritas Harare that are already part of the PEOPLE project. The PEOPLE Project has a focus on 1) Strengthening emergency preparedness and response capacity; 2) strengthening volunteer management capacity; and 3) strengthening peer exchange and learning on emergency response.</narrative>
