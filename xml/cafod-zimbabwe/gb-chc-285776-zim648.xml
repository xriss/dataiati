  </title>
  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project will embark on an intensive process of tracking abandoned child protection and GBV cases and bringing these back into the national justice delivery system and help build confidence in the use of the referral pathway and justice systems by survivors of GBV. The project seeks to target an initial 12 abandoned cases per month and aims to connect these to child protection and justice delivery systems. Most of these cases are complex and involve a single child suffering multiple violations that include rape, pregnancy, abandonment, and lack of care. In some instances, these cases have stalled because there is lack of proof of age for the child, intimidation of witnesses or survivors by alleged perpetrators and in some cases bribing of authorities.  This project will track the cases and provide safe shelter to the survivors whilst the cases are being followed up and worked on.  Through this project St Alberts will also facilitate upgrading  and refurbishing ,  and furnishing of the safe house/GBV shelter to meet the minimum standards recommended by the Ministry of Social Development for child-survivors of GBV.  St Alberts will also work with the established community structures in the district  to track cases, follow-up and referral. In a bid to reduce the cases of GBC and child Abuse , St Alberts will conduct back to school campaigns in the District and advocate for the right to education for children in the Muzarabani District.  St Alberts Mission hospital has established a community based Police post in CHadereka Ward, where there are high incidences of child violations have been reported and also under reported , and there is need to improve on the WASH facilities at the Police Post and to make the place child friendly.  The safe house, among other things, will facilitate and helps in survivor management, including provision of medical , accompaniment and psychosocial support. Community foster care mothers will also receive training on parenting, guidance and counselling before they refer cases.</narrative>
