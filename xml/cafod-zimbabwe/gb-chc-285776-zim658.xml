  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project is focusing on the eight diocesan Caritases in Zimbabwe who are the implementing partners of the Caritas Zimbabwe Network. The eight dioceses have three dioceses already being supported by CAFOD&#x2019;s capacity strengthening program. These are Caritas Mutare, Caritas Gokwe and Caritas Harare. These dioceses are also expected to take part in the Caritas Zimbabwe coordinated capacity strengthening activities. However, the Caritas Zimbabwe budget will therefore cater for activities that are not funded in the current capacity strengthening project that CAFOD is supporting. The other five dioceses are expected to get full support on the Caritas Zimbabwe National office budget for the execution of the planned activities and wherever possible support with own materials, complement from other funding sources, as part of organisational contribution to reduce costs for implementing the activities.

This project has also been designed in response to the growing recognition within the wider humanitarian sector about the need for a fundamental shift in approach to place national organisations at the centre of humanitarian action. To ensure that this is achieved, then there is need to strengthen Caritas Zimbabwe through the following objectives and outcomes and activities.

Overall Objective: Improved capacity for Caritas Zimbabwe network to prepare and respond to emergencies effectively and efficiently.

Specific objective:
Strengthening of Caritas Zimbabwe Network in emergency preparedness and response through use of cutting-edge emergency preparedness and response strategies.</narrative>
