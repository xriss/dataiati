   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Peace, stability and good governance are pre-requisites for sustainable development and social cohesion. However, post-independent Zimbabwe inherited a culture of conflict and violence which to this day affect national peace and stability. Since electoral violence that began in intensity ahead of June 2008 Presidential run-off elections, it has become a trend in Zimbabwe to experience intimidation, coercion, threats, and even deaths caused by political intolerance. The unresolved past conflicts in Zimbabwe such as the civil war or Gukurahundi of 1980s, fast track land reform of 2000 and political and electoral conflict and violence which became more profound in 2008 have continued to haunt the nation resulting in compromised democratic processes. Politicisation of state institutions has made it difficult for one to distinguish between the state and the ruling party in the country. Since 2009, the government, with support from the international community has initiated national healing, peace and reconciliation processes which included the formation of the Government of National Unity (GNU), establishment of the Organ of National Healing and Reconciliation (ONHR) and the subsequent adoption of a new progressive Constitution in 2013. The constitution has an elaborate bill of rights I that provides for the establishment of independent Commissions to support and entrench human rights and democracy in the country. This includes the National Peace and Reconciliation Commission (NPRC) mandated with post-conflict justice, healing and reconciliation in the country. This project is therefore intended to strengthen the role of the church in facilitating an effective national peace and reconciliation process especially before, during and after the 2018 harmonized elections.

Project Goal: Zimbabwe society lives in peace, harmony and justice

Specific Objectives:
1. A national peace and reconciliation process in line with the country&#x2019;s legal frameworks and Church&#x2019;s / citizens&#x2019; expectation &#x2013; a national peace and reconciliation process we want - is carried out
2. Electoral environment is more peaceful and citizens participate freely and independently
3. Church reduces potentials for violent conflict.</narrative>
