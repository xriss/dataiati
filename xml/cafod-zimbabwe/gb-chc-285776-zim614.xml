   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Putting Children First Phase IV - Justice for Children Trust (JCT)</narrative>
  </title>
  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">PCF IV goal is to have Children and youths in selected communities of Harare and peri-urban areas of Harare to realise their rights. Working with Justice for Children Trust, the project aims to improve access to rights by children in the targeted communities. The programme will work with children to improve their understanding of their rights, and work with the community at large to build their capacity to create and foster an enabling environment for children and women to see their rights fulfilled. Project staff will focus on capacity building communities on:
- improving communities&apos; attitude and behaviours 
- increasing Household incomes through income generating activities for improved financial capacity at household levels
- training and capacitating community activists on GBV awareness raising.
- improving the knowledge base of households on Child protection and positive parenting  
The project will work with service providers and ensure they provide a better-quality service through improved engagement with the community and improved accountability, with some duty bearers targeted with advocacy by community leaders to improve access to services for children and women (education, health and justice as well as reduce violation of children&#x2019;s rights in the communities). 
Upon completion of a three year cycle the three partners working on this PCF IV should be project be able to reflect:
