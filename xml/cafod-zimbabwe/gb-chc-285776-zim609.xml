   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Drought Response Project in Binga District</narrative>
  </title>
  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Zimbabwe is facing a national food security emergency for the current agricultural season (2019), caused by extensive drought and an escalating economic crisis &#x2013; meaning low food availability, rising market prices, and a lack of both cash and bartering power. During the current 2018/19 agriculture season, Binga district, which is in Matebeleland North province of Zimbabwe, received a mean total of 221mm of rainfall against a mean annual average of 500mm. The district is facing a drought which has affected the crop and water for both domestic and productive purposes.  The effect of the current drought has also affected access to safe and clean water. The majority of water sources, including the Zambezi river, are drying up at a faster rate. 
The proposed project will address WASH challenges at local clinic, management of catchment areas and protection of springs through whilst meeting immediate food needs for vulnerable populations in Chuunga and Luunga wards of Binga district. The food needs will be met through conditional and non-conditional food distributions. The protection of catchment areas and springs protection will be done by members of households with labour  at ward level. The WASH aspect will increase access to clean and safe water and sanitary facilities at a local clinic for the two wards.  Water for the clinic will be done through extending a pipeline from Chuunga primary school that was completed during the MF4 project. The sanitation facilities will be constructed by communities with support of skilled builders resident in the area. These human resources were identified during development of ward plans. MF4 project worked with these builders in doing masonary  works for the project.</narrative>
