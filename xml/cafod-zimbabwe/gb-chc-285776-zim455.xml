   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Overall objective: to contribute to progress towards the Millennium Development Goal 7 of halving the proportion of people without sustainable access to basic sanitation in Zimbabwe. Specific objective: to sustainably improve living conditions, health, human dignity, economic productivity and the environment in poor urban and peri-urban areas of Nyanga and Murehwa, Zimbabwe, through an integrated approach to sanitation

At the highest level, this will lead to significant and sustainable improvements in health, living conditions and economic opportunities, particularly for the poorest people in Zimbabwe. The MDGs are closely inter-linked and progress in Goal 7 towards achieving improved access to water and sanitation will have an impact on the realisation of many others. For example, increased access to sanitation will reduce the incidence of water-borne diseases, therefore contributing to the achievement of Goals 4, 5 and 6 related to mortality and disease. Similarly, access to basic sanitation in institutions such as schools is likely to increase children&#x2019;s attendance and performance, contributing to MDG 2 on education. Improvements in the physical environment which will be brought about by integrated and sustainable approaches to sanitation, will contribute to MDG 7 on environmental sustainability.

Joint working with the local councils, District Water Sanitation Sub-Committees (DWSSC) and community-level structures including user groups and Health and Hygiene Clubs in the two project areas of Nyanga and Murewa is fundamental to this action. This is to ensure firstly that interventions are appropriately designed and carried out, harnessing local knowledge to ensure the quality and effectiveness of the outcomes. Secondly, the active involvement of existing structures will ensure local ownership and buy-in, thereby significantly increasing the likelihood of continued sustainable impact beyond the end of the project period. Finally, the model of joint working offers a real opportunity for CAFOD and its project partners to support capacity building in terms of skills, knowledge and technical and management expertise in the sanitation sector, from community to local authority level. This will ensure sustainable impact not only of this particular project, but of other interventions in the project area and beyond, which will be influenced by the training, on the job accompaniment, and material support provided through this action.</narrative>
