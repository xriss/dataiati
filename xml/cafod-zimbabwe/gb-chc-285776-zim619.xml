   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Zimbabwe Cyclone Idai Response [CAFOD CI EA11/2019 Contribution 2]</narrative>
  </title>
  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Following its landfall in Mozambique on 14 March 2019, Cyclone Idai continued across land as a tropical storm, hitting eastern and southern Zimbabwe with heavy rains and strong winds. The storm caused high winds and heavy precipitation in Chimanimani and Chipinge districts causing riverine and flash flooding which left a trail of destruction including unprecedented loss of life, livelihoods and infrastructure damage. A total of 299 people were killed, 200 injured, 500 missing, 10,000 displaced and more than a quarter of a million impacted [2019 Flash Appeal]. Seven districts were severely affected with Chimanimani and Chipinge being the worst affected. 

Reports indicate that 270,000 people with existing acute levels of vulnerability, have been directly affected across all districts in Manicaland and parts of Masvingo and Mashonaland East provinces. The force of the Cyclone was concentrated in Chimanimani and Chipinge districts, with at least 50% of the population affected. There has been significant damage to crops, livestock and particularly infrastructure including roads, bridges, water installations, power and communication and many homes, schools and community structures have also been damaged. 

The cyclone Idai response is being implemented in the Archdiocese of Harare, Diocese of Masvingo as well as the Diocese of Mutare.  Cyclone Idai came at a point were most of the households were struggling to adapt and cope with the effects of an El Ni&#xF1;o induced drought. Thus, to the communities that have been affected this is a double tragedy which makes the affected household more vulnerable as they struggle to absorb the shock.

The Cyclone Idai drought response [CIEA11/19 ] is currently underway and has gone past the first 6 months of the project. This grant is a USD 200,00.00 pledge made to the Caritas Internationalis appeal during the appeal launch. The project has reached to affected people through provision of food, WASH, Livelihoods as well as Shelter.</narrative>
