  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Zimbabwe has been hit by cyclone IDAI which has left atrial of massive destruction and loss life after its landfall in Mozambique on 14 March. The cyclone continued across land as a Tropical Storm and hit eastern Zimbabwe on the 15th of March with heavy rains and strong winds. The storm caused high winds and heavy precipitation in Chimanimani and Chipinge districts causing riverine and flash flooding and subsequent deaths, destruction of livelihoods and properties.

Chimanimani and Chipinge districts have been hardest-hit, with riverine and flash flooding reported. The hardest-hit district of Chimanimani remains inaccessible as heavy rains have damaged roads and main access bridges have been washed away.

The town of Chimanimani was reportedly cut off after bridges across Mvumvumvu River (Matsororo and Muusha bridges) along the Mutare-Chimanimani Highway were washed away and other sections of road were blocked by fallen trees and landslides. Power supply in many areas is affected.

At least 82 deaths and over 200 injuries have been reported, mainly in Chimanimani, and 217 people are reportedly missing. In Chimanimani alone, eight bridges have been destroyed. Crops and livestock have been destroyed in all affected areas. Overall, across all the areas affected more than 2,500 households (12,500 to 15,000 people) are estimated to be affected. However, an accurate assessment of the number of people impacted and displaced is difficult to establish at this point, as many district wards remain inaccessible.
The cyclone has been declared a National Disaster in accordance with provisions of the Civil Protection Act.</narrative>
