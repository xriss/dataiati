  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">As part of the national privatization program and in order to modernize 14 regional airports, the Hellenic Republic in 2013 launched a tender for two clusters of seven airports each, Cluster A and Cluster B, through the Hellenic Republic Asset Development Fund S.A. (HRADF). In 2014, the concessions were awarded to Fraport Regional Airports of Greece A S. A. and Fraport Regional Airports of Greece B S. A. (collectively Fraport Greece). The shareholders of Fraport Greece are Fraport AG Frankfurt Airport Services Worldwide (Fraport) and Slentel Ltd. On 14 December 2015, the concession agreements were signed with HRADF and the Hellenic Republic. The Project consists of the privatization, upgrade, maintenance, management and operation of the seven Greek regional airports of Cluster A, under a 40 year concession (the Project). The airports service some of the most popular tourist destinations in the country.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">IFC&apos;&apos;s involvement in this Project is expected to: (i) contribute to the modernization, refurbishment, operation and maintenance of country&apos;&apos;s tourist focused airports without recourse to public funding; (ii) increase the capacity, improve the efficiency of airports operations and service levels of these airports for airlines and passengers; and (iii) support the growth of the regional economy of Greece by not only upgrading the airports but facilitating regional tourism and enhancing openness and competiveness. As a flagship privatization initiative, involvement of the private sector in the airports will provide a demonstration effect for future privatization projects both in Greece and neighboring countries.   It should serve as a precedent to generate investor appetite and attract further large scale external investment into the Greek economy.</narrative>
