   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Towards Zones of Stability-Libya is a twelve-month project supported by the kingdom of the Netherlands Ministry of Foreign Affairs that builds accountability and works towards strengthening security, stability and good governance in the municipality of Gharyan, Libya. Towards Zones of Stability-Libya brings together a coalition of Key stakeholders from municipal and central level government and a range of community actors and civil society members to identify and agree on the most pressing security and justice related issues facing their community, and to develop an action plan to address these issues. As a result of this process the stakeholders will enhance their ability to collaboratively identify and address sources of instability and related institutional challenges; develop and hone skills to create actionable strategic plans; build mechanisms to skillfully respond to the concerns of the community; and establish stronger relationships between the municipal and central authorities. Designed to be scaled-up, by the end of this project a replicable model will exist that can be applied to other areas to build wider zones of stability across Libya</narrative>
