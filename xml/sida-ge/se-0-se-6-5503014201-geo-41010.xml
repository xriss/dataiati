    <narrative xml:lang="EN">General question: Results related to the intended outcome 2015Question: Summarise results related to the intended outcome (this information will be sent to Open Aid)Answer: The overall goal of the project to Clean Up Georgia to challenge waste management in the country through Society Awareness Campaigns, introducing new (3R) systems and modern methods have been reached by the cooperation partners Greens Movement of Georgia/Friends of Earth of Georgia, GNSE &amp;quot;Orchis&amp;quot; and Eco-vision.  Number of different type of activities were implemented under the project three objectives according to the plan that resulted in mobilizing communities in (Tbilisi+63 municipalities) and increasing public awareness of population on reduction of waste in Georgia.  The cooperation partners organized countrywide clean-up activities and World Clean Up campaigns during three days annually on third week of September. Results of Clean Up Georgia-Clean Up the World Campaign 2013-2014 are total number of participants 41 685, Cleaned up area (ha)- 596,65 ha and collected waste (m3)- 1347,6 m3. 
Results of Clean Up Georgia-Clean Up the World Campaign 2014 -2015 are total number of participants 51 516 Cleaned up area (ha)- 700.45 ha Collected waste (m3)- 1998.5m3. So total number of people mobilized during all clean up campaigns for the project implementation period is 93, 201 and 3, 346.1 m3 waste has been collected from uncontrolled dumpsites (river banks, forest adjustments, village edges, dry ravines etc) total 1 297 00 ha. territory has been cleaned. 
Under objective 2 all three organizations conducted different type of meetings, workshops, seminars in 64 municipalities (total 1912 participants), 10 regional meetings were conducted and 327 participants attended and 1 national meeting  was conducted with government officials, line ministers and Region Governors including City Hall Deputy Mayor (total 33 participants). 4 public health related workshops were conducted for 140 participants providing information and recommendation related to proper waste management and health effected by polluted water and land. Clean Up Georgia project phase II increase public awareness on modern approaches of waste management, new (3R) systems, methodologies, experience of EU countries. This objective was reached by preparing and disseminating different type of printed martials, producing waste minimization, recycling, composting promotion commercials to raising awareness on clean environment.  Target oriented public raising events, meetings,  presentation were conducted in the country that resulted in creating at certain level in population of Georgia new habits and demand to promote clean environment.
Georgia is facing ecological problem due to having poorly managed waste in the country. It is the main source of environment pollution that has negative impact on human health. The Ministry of Environment Protection of Georgia currently does not have a complex waste management system in place, the state inventory of waste is not conducted. Accumulated waste during the Soviet and post Soviet period is still problematic (especially toxic waste). Comprehensive information on such waste was not existing, there was no data collection on national and local level on the amount and types of waste annually generated. Clean Up Georgia project under phase II inventoried uncontrolled dump sites polluted by solid waste and placed the location on interactive map. 
Collection of waste due to lack of proper machinery is very poorly managed across the country. Waste is not removed via standard systems from village residences. Due to the above mentioned the waste is moved outside the residential area and dumped to the adjacent territories, in ravines and river beds. Litter collected during cleaning of streets, gardens, parks, public gardens, beaches is allocated in bins or neighbouring areas. Therefore, Clean Up Georgia project addressed this issue by establishing new habits in the population of stopping littering of nature at some certain degree, reducing dumping of waste and raising overall knowledge of pubic participation in collection and new practices of waste management in all generations. 50% of general population is informed about waste related problems in all regions; 60 journalists are trained on waste management issues.In total 80 thematic Reports on round table with stakeholders about the waste management problems and threats to human health from remaining waste have been prepared. 6 Power Point Presentations were developed on International Experience in Waste Management; on Ecological Problems, Environmental Pollution and Influence of Polluted Environment on Human Health, Forest Restoration Strategy etc.  Bio restoration and tree and shrub seedlings planting activities were carried out. Site-specific Method Statements have been prepared and 10 ha of cleaned up areas have been restored with native tree and shrub species.
All those activities supported to reduction of waste in Georgia by 10 % as per project created interactive map, phase II  red spots management statistics. 
Thus the project reached its intended outcome. It proved its high relevance to the need in the country to reduce littering and change attitude, behaviour of population regarding waste management. The project played important role in public sector and Government prioritizing improvement of waste management in Georgia. Cooperation during phase II of three NGOs with the national and local government regarding reducing of waste (uncontrolled dumpsites across the country) resulted in achieving targets of the project.</narrative>
