   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Drawing and Calculation: Integrated Design and Climate Adaptive Cities in Taiwan (Triokast)</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">&#x2022;	Short general project overviewThe pilot study for Taipei City in Taiwan, will make advanced hydraulic calculations accessible in the design process of urban planners and that effects of the design on water safety are immediately visible. In addition, a toolbox of urban planning measures supports the process of solving the water problem concretely and effectively. This combination of designs and (quantitative) tests of effectiveness makes it possible to re-design a city in a climate-resistant way. To date, these methodologies and tools have only been used in experimental design, but in this case are combined used in the pilot for a concrete practical situation.&#x2022;	Initial activities and results of the project- A new improved methodology for designing the climate-resilient city to achieve participatory decision making with multiple stakeholders (urban planners, administrators, water specialists, etc.). Innovative here is the combination of technical instruments (3Di and drawing and calculation tool) and the participatory decision-making process.- Create a link between a graphical &quot;drawing&quot; interface of urban designers and a hydraulic modelling package, a &quot;calculation&quot; package. For the calculation environment, 3Di will be used to calculate spatial and detailed flooding.- An integral toolbox for water-sensitive design, in which urban development measures are included that can be applied to tackle water problems in an integrated manner.- 3Di can make fast and detailed water calculations via a cloud-hosted environment in the Netherlands. For use abroad, a new architecture will have to be developed that makes it possible to store confidential data within national borders and to carry out water calculations elsewhere.&#x2022;	What are the results of the projectThe ultimate goal to achieve is to improve water safety in Taiwan in a sustainable way. This goal can be made concrete into the project objective, with the focus on demonstrating innovative technology and working methods abroad. The objective is formulated as follows:Within this project it is demonstrated that a design for a climate adaptive city can be made quickly and effectively using the integrated approach and tools (drawing and calculating).This happens in the following areas:- Process. The final design is supported by multiple stakeholders (urban planners, administrators, water specialists, etc.). They made the choices together and assessed the effects of the choices on water safety.- Technology. A new improved methodology for designing the climate-resilient city to achieve participatory decision making with multiple stakeholders (urban planners, administrators, water specialists, etc). Innovative here is the combination of technical instruments (3Di and drawing and calculation tool) and the participatory decision-making process.- There must be a link between a graphical &quot;drawing&quot; interface of urban designers and a hydraulic modelling package, a &quot;calculation&quot; package. For the calculation environment, 3Di is used to calculate spatial and detailed flooding.- An integral toolbox for water-sensitive design, in which urban development measures are included that can be applied to tackle water problems in an integrated manner.- Due to 3Di fast and detailed water calculations via a cloud-hosted environment in the Netherlands can be made. For use abroad, a new architecture will have to be developed that makes it possible to store confidential data within national borders and to carry out water calculations elsewhere. demonstrated in the demonstration project.- In addition, the project aims to increase the export of Dutch knowledge products abroad. The desired situation is that partner MicroX can work as a local &apos;reseller&apos; for the package and thus market the Dutch products and advice from Taiwan. The consortium parties will be included in the &quot;slipstream&quot;. In this way a joint market is created, which creates a sustainable cooperation.</narrative>
