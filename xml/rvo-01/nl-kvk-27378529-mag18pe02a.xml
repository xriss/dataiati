   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Peru is highly dependent on its water sector because of the large share of agro and mining in the economy. Both commercially as well as from an environmental aspect, water management has lagged behind considering its economic importance. Expo Agua Peru 2019 provides the opportunity for foreign companies to connect with Peruvian counterparts in order to solve the various challenges facing Peru and its water sector. New technologies that can be applied to the Peruvian situation, as well as knowledge transfers on how to better manage water will have a positive impact on water availability and quality.Dutch efforts for participation in Expo Agua Peru 2018 is a textbook example of a successful aid / trade approach. The combined use of public (PSDApps) and private contributions contribute to the effective positioning of the Dutch water sector (both public and private actors) and ensure mutual cross-fertilization. Permanent availability of RVO instruments plays an important catalytic role in this. For countries like Peru, this is essential for securing orders for BV the Netherlands and realizing the SDGs, in particular SDG6: water.1. From 15-17 October 2018, Peru&apos;s (largest) international water fair took place in 2018. The Netherlands acted as &quot;co-host&quot;. The Dutch delegation was headed by Dennis van Peppen (Special Envoy International Water Affairs of RVO) and further consisted of 3 representatives of the Union of Water Boards, 2 representatives of Deltares and representatives of 9 Dutch companies. This mix of public, private and knowledge institutions (&quot;triple helix&quot; &quot;) has contributed to an extremely successful Expo Agua for the Netherlands.2. The opening ceremony was attended (for the first time in the four-year existence of Expo Agua) by the President and the Minister of Housing, Sanitation and Construction. President Vizcarra, who is an engineer himself, gave a short improvised speech which showed that he knows exactly what sustainable water management is about and in which he set the cooperation with the Netherlands as an example. President Vizcarra also visited the Holland Pavilion and became acquainted with a number of Dutch companies. The program also consisted of keynote speeches by Dutch water experts (including Klaas de Groot, regional water expert for the World Bank in Colombia) and Professor Eelco van Beek (affiliated with IHE Delft, University of Twente and Deltares), master classes in the field of integrated water management. and OECD access with over 100 participants and round table meetings with both Dutch and Peruvian experts. Expo Agua closed with the signing of 2 &quot;Letters of Intent&quot;.3. The Dutch commitment to Expo Agua was fourfold: i) contributing to the positioning of the Dutch water sector (including for the current tendering projects in the context of the reconstruction of Peru), ii) establishing cooperation in the context of the &apos;Blue Deal &apos;program of the Union of Water Boards, iii) initiating a pilot project In the field of &quot;valuing water&quot; in the context of recommendations of the United Nations / World Bank High Level Panel on Water in which both the Netherlands and Peru participated and iv) promote general cooperation between the Netherlands and Peru in the field of water management.4. Positioning of Dutch companiesDutch companies were represented at Expo Agua with their own stand in the Holland Pavilion (funded by contributions from participating companies). In addition to various networking events during Expo Agua, an intensive and tailor-made matchmaking program was set up by ZMA Lima through proactive scouting for participating companies with both the Peruvian public and private sector. During Expo Agua, this not only led to a large number of new &quot;business leads&quot; and follow-up contacts, but also to a number of concrete orders. Potentially interested Dutch companies have also been able to strengthen their position with regard to the reconstruction projects, especially with a view to current tenders for the development of integrated water management plans in Piura and Tumbes.5. Blue Deal programThe Blue Deal program, a joint initiative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Union of Water Boards, aims to provide at least 20 million people in 40 different river basins with safe and good water by 2030. The Dutch approach to integrated water management is central to this. In Peru, the regions of Tumbes and Piura have been identified as areas of cooperation because of the similarities with the Netherlands on the one hand and the high degree of vulnerability to flooding on the other (the worst floods took place here during El Ni&#xF1;o Costero in 2017). Prior to Expo Agua, the Dutch delegation (Special Envoy Van Peppen and the 3 representatives of the UvW) visited relevant stakeholders in the water sector in Tumbes and Piura. During Expo Agua, this visit led to the signing of a &quot;Letter of Intent&quot; (between the Dutch Water Authorities &#x2013; UvW, and the Peruvian water authority -ANA; about a long-term collaboration for technical assistance and knowledge transfer in the field of integrated water management.6. Valuing WaterDuring his visit to Peru on 23 August last, Water Envoy Henk Ovink and Director ANA decided to start a &apos;pilot project&apos; in the field of &apos;valuing water&apos; in the agricultural sector in Peru in the context of the follow-up of the participation of both Peru and the Netherlands at the High Level Panel on Water. During Expo Agua, presentations and discussions took place to further shape this project. This &quot;pilot&quot; is expected to start in 2019.7. Collaboration between the Netherlands and PeruDuring Expo Agua, a cooperation agreement was concluded between the National Authority of Water of Peru and the Dutch embassy in Lima to strengthen cooperation in the field of sustainable water management. The purpose of this is to further enhance the visibility of Dutch knowledge, expertise and experience in the field of water.8. Expo Agua has led to a great deal of attention in various prominent Peruvian media for sustainable water management and the role that the Netherlands can play in this (newspapers, weekly magazines and (live) TV). An overview of the media coverage is attached</narrative>
