   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Sustainable production of high quality organic certified cocoa on recuperated degraded farmlands in the Brazilian low land rain forest, Mata Atlantica</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Note: This project has been cancelled, because RVO has no confidence that it will be successfully completed in the short term.During the first part of the 20th century, Brazil belonged to the world&apos;s top cacao producers and was a major exporter. In 1989 a rapid spreading disease, known as &quot;Witches&apos; Broom&quot;, devastated virtually all plantations in the State of Bahia, the main producing region. The sector never recovered and Brazil today is a net importer of cacao beans.Horst Holding BV and its partner Boca do Rio acquired a 250 ha farm in Camamu, Bahia, to recuperate the degraded cacao plantation (initially 60 ha) by introducing state-of-the-art organic agro forestry farming and increasing production levels in a sustainable way. Innovative harvest and post-harvest techniques as well as modern packing and storage methods will also be introduced.A group of 20 local farmers (representing another 60 ha) will be participating in the project and will receive training in organic farming and in adequate (post-)harvest techniques. The project will implement a technology support centre that provides participating farmers with know-how as well as post-harvest treatment of their produce as a contract service.Both project partners will set up a cooperation agreement, and manage the project as a separate Business Unit within their group of companies, but there will be no new joint venture.The project will result in significant development effects, as it will give local farmers an opportunity to generate additional income from land that has been practically abandoned. At the same time, the replantation of indigenous fruit trees, native to the Mata Atlantica, will help restore the original bio system, benefiting the environment. The organic cacao that will be produced is sold at premium prices to specialty chocolatiers, due to its exceptional quality.Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)Partners&apos; CSR policy states that the project will:- provide jobs and job training to local farm workers and pay them according to Brazilian laws, including social security, holidays and all other benefits;&#x2022; give special attention to (equal opportunity) for women regarding jobs and training;&#x2022; provide safe working conditions by training all workers with regard to safe use of equipment;&#x2022; not tolerate any discrimination, particularly no gender or racial discrimination nor the use of child or forced labour;&#x2022; actively restore the environmental damage existing at the project site by reforesting heavily degraded and deforested areas with native species;&#x2022; will take care that no damage will be done to the environment by its activities by avoiding any kind of pollution;&#x2022; actively avoid and not get involved in any form of corruption practice.Impact&#x2022;	Employment and working conditionsAt the end of the project 17 full-time employees will be working at the joint venture: 14 at basic-level and 3 at medium-/high-level. Two years later, this will be 22 FTE (18:4).All staff will be paid according to Brazilian labour laws, basic-level staff earning minimum salary and medium staff, starting with 1.5 times minimum salary.In Brazil, by law, the following benefits are added to the basic salary: child allowance, 13th month, one month paid holidays, social security contribution, equalling the cost of 1 month&apos;s salary per year, and a contribution to a reservation fund to be paid out as compensation at the end of the contract, equivalent to one monthly salary for each year worked.It is expected that in addition to the permanent staff around 15 season workers, half of which women, will be employed for (post-)harvest activities. Salaries of men and women will be equal.For all staff, working cloths including boots and gloves as well as safety equipment will be provided.&#x2022;	Innovation / Transfer of knowledgeThe training that will be given to farm employees as well as to local farmers is not really new. Actually, the Dutch Ministry of Agriculture (LNV) recently supported 2 projects in the same region, involving exactly the same subjects &quot;organic farming and sustainable agro forestry&quot;, and &quot;recuperating degraded cacao plantations&quot;.Small farmers do lack financial means to invest in post-harvest facilities and just continue to work in the way they were taught by their parents.The project will invest in modern post-harvest equipment not available to the farmers in the region, and all participants will be trained in the use of these techniques (fermentation &amp; drying), resulting in the adoption of new skills that are crucial to achieve better quality of the products.&#x2022;	Chain effectsAs a result of the project, 20 small cacao farmers in the region will learn how to recuperate their degraded plantations, increasing their productivity and income.Thanks to the training, they will be able to produce more beans, of a better quality, obtaining premium prices from new clients.Particularly, the opportunity to buy the processing services (fermentation &amp; drying) from the joint venture (which they would never be able to acquire as individuals), will significantly improve their income.&#x2022;	EnvironmentThe project site is situated in an environment protection area. By legal obligation an environmental inventory has been made indicating the so called &quot;legal reserve&quot;, that will remain untouched by any activity.The environmental condition of the remaining area of the project site will improve as the choice for organic farming in an agro forestry system is the sustainable answer to the threats the local ecosystem is facing. It will result in reduction of deforestation and recuperation of already degraded lands within the regions fragile eco system. Organic certification is part of the project.&#x2022;	Position of womenWork at local farms is traditionally shared by men and women, tasks being divided according to the different physical requirements. It is expected that at least 4 out of 17 workers will be women. The participation in the training courses on organic farming and post-harvest techniques will be equally divided between men and women. The training course related to nursery activities will be especially directed to women in view of their specific interests and proven abilities in this field. Medium-level management training will be given without any gender preference. The objective is that at least half of the management jobs will occupied by women.</narrative>
