   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Through capacity building and knowledge transfer, the cities of  Lima and Piura will be able to improve parts of their Solid Waste Management (SWM) plan as a base for future decisions. The project execution will result in direct improvements to the environment, reduction of climate change emissions and will create temporary and long-term employment in both cities. Thisproject will enable Lima and Piura to involve the local private sector in the form of tenders and concession contracts in various Solid waste management aspects. The project focusses on the efficient use of existing facilities and improve the valorisation of solid waste throughout the chain, by extraction of valuable recyclables, improvement of the selection and recycling technologies, extraction of methane gas as energy source and by limiting necessary space for landfill activities and reuse the space of old landfills. The project includes technical, financial, political and juridical aspects needed to improve the overall waste management systems in both cities. Counterparts are the Municipalities of Lima and Piura, The Ministry of Environment, local NGO&#x2019;s and organizations of informal recyclers, consultants and holders of large scale waste concessions.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">A one week study tour to the Netherlands was carried out including :

PERUVIAN DELEGATION 
- Two staff members from Lima municiplaity (both male)
- Two staff members from Piura minicipality (1 female and 1 male). 

- The study tour provided a complete picture of what can be done in Lima and Piura, some aspects in the near future, others need large investments and will take longer before they will be implemented. Many  aspects of solid waste management were shown on location. The covering and reuse of old landfill and dumpsites converted into recreational areas, gas extraction practices, various recycling companies showed in detail their organization and technologies, municipal officers in Amsterdam presented small to large scale recycling initiatives and technologies, Waste to Energy and hospital waste incinerators were visited. 
- The Study tour provided various direct contacts between Peruvian delegation and Dutch companies and municipal staff which presently are being followed up.   

 VISITS in the Netherlands were implemented to:

- Trisoplast Mineral Liners / GID Milieutechniek BV
- Huiskesmetaal,: Metal and precious metal recycling plant (active world-wide). Collection, treatment, market aspects
- ZAVIN CV: Large scale hospital waste collection and incineration plant.
- HVC Large scale waste incineration plant, bottom ash treatment, transport and collection 
- Sortiva: Mechanical waste separation and pre-treatment before incineration at HVC

- Landfills: De Meerendonk, De Vlagheide, de Sluiner, Vink

- Municipality of Amsterdam
- Plastic Recycling plant in Amsterdam, Umincorp</narrative>

Metropolitan municipality of Lima: Male: 5  / Female: 5,
Municipality of Piura: Male: 5 / Female: 5 .

Capacity building on :
a- waste analysis targeting 20 technical officers of solid Waste Departments. 
b- Composition determination of existing landfills &amp; added value recyclables
    - 2 landfills in Lima: Zapallal and Portillo Grande.
     - 1 dupside in Piura 
c- Cost - benefit analysis for the methane emission for sanitary landfills was performed. 
Field visits were implemented involving local taff and concession holders for the calculation of methane content. Detailed calculations were carried out at the consultants home office based on waste composition, height, age, moisture content, climatological criteria and existing covering layers. The results and methodology were presented to the local staff of both municipalities and staff was trained to carry out these exercises. 
Based on the data coming out of this specific determination and cost analysis an evaluation waqs done to identify next steps for further segregation options and methane extraction involving further Dutch knowledge.  The value of specific solid waste components were identified in order to be able to make decisions to make processes and waste management more Circular.  Positive results were obtained in Lima where the concession holder is now evaluating the feasibility of installing Dutch Technology for gas extraction. Final calculations indicate a payback time of about 3 years after which makes energy production economically viable.

d- Design of new infrastructure for future landfill: Two basic construction designs (1 Lima and 1 specifically for Piura) including gas extraction for a new landfill, proposal that includes available options to make landfills more environmental friendly, latest solutions for &#x201C;hazardous&#x201D; waste material (f.e. hospital waste), most recommendable gas extraction technologies suitable for Peru, lessons learned in the Netherlands, recommendations for const</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Input for two new policies on key themes of Integrated Solid Waste Management: 

1- Inclusion informal recyclers in transfer stations with focus on woman rights and independence, T
- The local and Dutch experts revised existing programs managed by the Ministry of Environment of Peru (MINAM) and national egulations to provide recommendations for improvement and on how to improve the position of the Woman in the current situation as being reality in Peru. Practical pilots have to be suggested to be implemented directly in Lima.e project provides a set of recommendations for the inclusion of informal recyclers in transfer stations with focus on the independence of women. 
- Together with a local specialized NGO visits were made to organizations of informal recyclers and waste pickers. Their existing practices were analysed and compared to more efficient and more workers and women friendly options. Some of their initiatives are already good in line with common practices in other countries but on a very small scale. In presentations, discussions during site visits  and in reports the proposed systems were explained. The options include small scale separation and transportation but also and preferably large scale recycling centres at the transfer stations or at the entrance of the landfills, where larger amounts and partially mechanical systems will help to raise th e profitability of the recycling and at the same time reduce the need for landfill space.

Sets of recommendations for the inclusion of informal recyclers in transfer stations with focus on the independence of women in Piura and Lima werer deliuvered for each local government, taken differences in local circumstances into account. 

2- Recovery of existing degraded landfills in Lima and Piura

A work plan including Instructions and examples of the closure and ruse of degraded areas were provided. to both municipalities. Main challenges for the recovery of existing degraded landfills

 Officers of the Solid Waste Management department were instructed in the theoretical basis of waste characterization in office presentations, workshops and discussion sessions, making use of local existing data and experience from the Netherlands. 

actical training was carried out on two landfills in Lima, Zapallal and Portillo Grande and on the dumpsite of Piura, where the content of incoming waste trucks was analysed in detail. 

The participating staff was than explained how to extrapolate these data and taught to elaborate best estimates for the waste content of a large area or city, needed fro the further design of the waste management system and landfill capacities.</narrative>
