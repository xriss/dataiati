   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Summary of the Delta Adaptation Colombia (ProCAD) projectBackgroundThe Government of the Netherlands, through the Partners for Water programme, funded a project for the Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development of Colombia (Minambiente). The project, with a focus on coastal deltas, was executed during the second half of 2021, aimed to analyse maritime deltas in Colombia with existing information, identification of knowledge exchange needs and capacity development; to identify of possible projects to be executed in the deltas, with possible sources of financing; and to obtain a roadmap for further cooperation in the Delta Coalition, envisioning a future regional project with Argentina and opportunities for cooperation with other wings of the Delta Alliance network.Analysis and selection of maritime deltas in ColombiaThree selected deltas were analysed, namely Magdalena, Sin&#xFA; (on the Atlantic coast) and Pat&#xED;a (on the Pacific coast). Four criteria were proposed for delimiting these deltas, namely geomorphology of the river mouth, delimitation of lagoon systems and coastal water bodies connected to main rivers, presence of populated areas, Coastal Environmental Units (Decree 1120 of 2013), as an articulation with the Coastal management and planning figures in Colombia. Battery of projects and priorisation31 project proposals were analysed concerning adaptation to either climate change or climate risk management in the three deltas. They were prioritized by their degree of alignment with regional and national planning instruments, their response to climate adaptation challenges, their approaches to adaptation on coastal ecosystems, their technical knowledge and their stakeholder engagement. After evaluating the criteria and their indicators, twelve projects were priorised. Six of them address the Magdalena Delta, three the Sin&#xFA; delta and three the Pat&#xED;a. Identification of needs and capacity buildingAn initial diagnosis was carried out, identifying capacity needs from all 31 collected project proposals. In addition, a stakeholder consultation was done (via an online workshop) to identify gaps and capacity needs. A capacity needs assessment matrix was proposed with five categories, namely Human and institutional capacity, Technology and infrastructure, Governance structure, Stakeholder interactions, and Business opportunities &amp; readiness. Most of the capacity gaps identified from the project proposals were related to Human and institutional capacity, specifically related to the lack of technical knowledge on natural resources and river basins as well as on climate change topics. Possible funding sources for the prioritized projectsThe 12 shortlisted projects were categorised in the themes of restoration and conservation of ecosystems projects, comprehensive planning and governance projects, and knowledge and use of information projects. National sources were focused on those projects addressing environmental and climate change issues. International sources were focused on small-scale projects for which sub-national public entities and local organisations could apply themselves.</narrative>
