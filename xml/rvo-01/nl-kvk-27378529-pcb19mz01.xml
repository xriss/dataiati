  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The National port and freight study study addresses the current challenges faced by the regional economies of Mozambique and hinterland countries (mainly: Zimbabwe, Malawi, Zambia and eSwatini), that demand efficient transport services for goods and services for key economic sectors in the country, such as the agri-food &amp; nutrition and the extractive sector.  The results of the project provide a clear pathway to empower the role of the current Mozambican ports, in particular through the main corridors: Maputo, Beira and Nacala. The project also identifies opportunities to increase competitiveness of the Mozambican transport corridors, which in turn would improve the competitive position of the Mozambican ports and thus increase cargo volumes and corresponding economic growth and employment opportunities. Besides, the study also defines opportunities to improve the cabotage system that will enable efficient North-South transport of cargo and passengers along the Mozambican coast. This would especially be beneficial for coastal communities away from one of the main seaports (Maputo, Beira, Nacala and Pemba). These communities often face issues such as a lack of market access, low availability of goods, high transport costs and corresponding prices. The results of the study summarize the assessment of Mozambique&#x2019;s port and maritime sector and provides a strategic vision for the development of the sector. This analysis has been undertaken by Royal HaskoningDHV on behalf of The Dutch government for the Mozambican Ministry of Transport and Communication to support development of the maritime sector.The National port and freight study study addresses the current challenges faced by the regional economies of Mozambique and hinterland countries (mainly: Zimbabwe, Malawi, Zambia and eSwatini), that demand efficient transport services for goods and services for key economic sectors in the country, such as the agri-food &amp; nutrition and the extractive sector.

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">The results of the study summarize the assessment of Mozambique&#x2019;s port and maritime sector and provides a strategic vision for the development of the sector. This analysis has been undertaken by Royal HaskoningDHV on behalf of The Dutch government for the Mozambican Ministry of Transport and Communication to support development of the maritime sector.
3 staff members from CFM (national port and rail authority of Mozambique) have been included in the project team and participated in the main study activities&gt; e.g. site visits, meetings with stakeholders

The study identified six key points to better position and develop the maritime transport of Mozambique. It provides concrete and pragmatic recommendations for the definition of: 
a)	Provision of efficient transport corridors to serve the domestic market and hinterland countries such as Zimbabwe, Malawi, Zambia and eSwatini.
b)	Establish a cabotage trade network with secondary ports as a &#x2018;coastal highway&#x2019;.
c)	Ensure a flexible and robust future development strategy for Northern Cabo Delgado.
d)	Create a vision on Inland Waterway Transport and related inland port development. 
e)	Maintain proper educational / skill training opportunities for Mozambican staff. 
f)	Ensure the maritime sector develops in a sustainable way in harmony with society and environment.</narrative>
