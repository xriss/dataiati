   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Integrated poultry production in Mali</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Note: This project has been cancelled, because the applicant has requested to prematurely terminate the project. The local partner was unable to fulfill its obligations within this project.The business opportunity explored is twofold. First of all, Mali&apos;s existing poultry sector is very informal, mostly limited to unregulated backyard poultry. The project will address this situation by introducing an integrated poultry production line according to high international quality standards. Secondly, the project will make safe local poultry meat accessible to more people. Poultry meat has a high feed conversion rate, making it a relatively inexpensive source of valuable animal protein. The high end of the market , Mali&#x2019;s growing middle class will be targeted with  this project.The project partners, Pas Reform B.V. and Wawa Groupe International, will establish a high quality integrated poultry production facility with a hatchery, a broiler house and a slaughter house. The project will produce 19.000 good quality, slaughtered and packed chicken per week. It will create 42 jobs.Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)This project touches upon a wide range of CSR related issues. Most notably with respect to labour standards, the environment, product quality and animal welfare.The project will employ 42 fulltime employees. All of them will receive official labour contracts and good and safe working conditions. The joint venture will not make use of any form of forced or child labour, nor will they work with suppliers or sub-contractors that do.Impact&#x2022;	Employment and working conditionsThe project will employ 42 full time employees. All of them will receive official labour contracts and good and safe working conditions. Working hours will respect applicable local law and not exceed 48 hours a week. Overtime hours will be voluntarily, no longer than 12 hours and will be paid at a premium rate. Remuneration will be at least 171% of the legal minimum wage. Furthermore, all employees will receive a social security package via the National Institute for Social Security (INPS). Upon request the joint venture will assist its employees administratively with obtaining bank loans. The joint venture will do all that is reasonable and practicable to protect the health and safety of its employees. Accordingly, all employees will receive training on aspects relating to health and safety at work and all necessary safety equipment. In addition they will receive training on the prevention of HIV/Aids.&#x2022;	Innovation / Transfer of knowledgeTransfer of knowledge will be an essential aspect of this project. It is crucial for a successful course of the project.The project envisages extensive training on the technical management of hatchery, breeding and slaughter. That knowledge is still very rare in Mali, even though industrial poultry production in Mali has real potential. The newly acquired knowledge and skills will thus be of great value for both the employees and the country in general. The employees will see their position on the labour market improve and perhaps even more importantly, Mali can start to develop its poultry sector with a qualified labour force. Training on health, safety and hygiene will be as important for the project. The employees will acquire new skills and knowledge that can be used in their daily life but also in their future professional activities. Moreover it will also set an example of good practices to other operators in the local food sector. The partners hope their example will induce other local operators to start following hygiene norms and supply more safe food.&#x2022;	Chain effectsThe Malian poultry sector is expected to benefit from the project as it is can serve as an example for the production of high quality, integrated poultry production and reduces dependency on imports. Another party benefiting from the project are the local farmers that will be involved in feed production in a later stage of the project. A local veterinary will also benefit from the project. The partners will sign a service contract with a local veterinary to supervise all medical aspects of the whole production chain.&#x2022;	EnvironmentThe joint venture will do all that is reasonable and practicable to prevent any adverse effects of its activities on the environment. In general, poultry, which has a relatively high feed conversion rate, is an environmentally efficient source of animal protein. The hatchery equipment has a highly efficient heat management system that reduces energy consumption to a minimum. For all operations employees will receive environmental training to create awareness about working efficiently, reducing resource consumption and limiting pollution and waste. For the collection of its waste the Joint Venture will sign a contract with a professional local company. As in Mali soil depletion is the major reason for desertification, chicken manure is not as in Europe a nuisance, but a blessing of which numerous farmers, especially in the vegetable growing segment will happily profit.&#x2022;	Position of womenIn Mali, women&apos;s access to employment and economic opportunities is limited. That is why the partners will reserve 13 of positions to women. This is 31% of the total workforce. The partners feel it is their duty to put a quota, otherwise all the positions would be filled by men.Men and women will be treated equally at the workplace. They will all have the same opportunities. Promotions will be based on merit and performance strictly. Male and female employees will receive equal pay for equal work. Sexual harassment will not be tolerated.In order to facilitate a combined private and work life of their employees, the partners will set up a daycare for the employees&#x2019; children.</narrative>
