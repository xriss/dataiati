   <narrative xml:lang="EN">&#x2022;	Short general project overviewAmphidesh focusses on the construction of floating/amphibian housing with sanitation for the flood sensitive areas in Bangladesh. The consortium wants to offer floating amphibian housing on a large scale. This lowers the cost price. The first objective of the Piloting phase is to assess the suitability and feasibility of Amphidesh floating foundations with the different housing design as a solution for safe housing in flood prone areas in Bangladesh. To do so, four Amphidesh housing units will be built and lend to local neighbours for them to live in. This is a crucial step for the Upscaling phase later on. The pilots will be enabled by support of the agency HBRI (Housing Building Research Institute) that is part of the ministry of housing and public works, and strong commitment and investments of Bangladesh (private) partners. The project will take place in a lake in Dhaka that is owned by and next to the HBRI and will focus on a local community of slum dwellers living across the lake. Members of this community will be invited to test living in the floating houses. The second objective of the Piloting phase is to finalise the Business Plan.&#x2022;	Goal of the projectThe goal is to realize a pilot project which will serve as the start for implementing the Amphidesh concept in Bangladesh. The project will be the marketing tool for the upscaling to thousands of units a year. A floating structure with sanitation for 4 homes will be designed and approved together with HBRI and BRAC in Dhaka. The location will be prepared and materials will be ordered. A marketing campaign will be introduced for the upscaling. During the pilot the employees of ADT will be trained and prepared how to work with the Dutch technologies and to maintain them. If any improvement occurs they will be noted and added to the redesign of next versions.The combination with innovative floating sanitation and the provision of multiple models that also contain local materials that are processed is strong. Moreover, by explicitly including the financing via microcredit in the project, the consortium works as much as possible towards a total concept with the necessary flexibility for potential buyers for different models and the associated microfinance.&#x2022;	Results of the projectAt the end of Q4 - 2017 and early Q1 - 2018, the total project was completed with a slight delay compared to the original planning. The floating sanitation unit and the floating houses are ready and ready for use. The desired habitation / use has not materialized in connection with a dispute about the contract between HBRI and Amphidesh. Because not all desired parts of the EPS were installed, many problems arose during production and with product quality. The quality of the floating body is not comparable to the quality delivered in the Netherlands. Despite the delays, the difficult communication and problems with the management, we have achieved an appealing result. The government organization HBRI involved was very impressed with the project. Contacts with employees of the Ministry of Housing and the Water Development Board confirmed that an amount of 4,000 euro to 5,000 euro is certainly a good starting point for a climate-proof home.</narrative>
