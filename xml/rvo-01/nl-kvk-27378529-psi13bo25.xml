   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Update on the project:Project has been finalized successfully. The joint venture company HYM has already extended with additional area to park the trucks. It has acquired 11 additional trucks according to EURO 3, 4 and 5 norm, as such contributing to less air pollution in Bolivia as compared to the trucks used by most companies. All trucks were changed to 4x4 traction, so drivers experience less problems on the dirt roads between the forest areas and the clients of HYM. Seen the difficult situation of the forestry sector in Bolivia HYM decided to also provide services to clients in other sectors. Thanks to the implementation of ISO 9001 management system and the GPS tracking devices in the trucks large companies in the food/beverage sector as well as gas and oil companies make use of the services of HYM. The company is ready for the future thanks to the PSI project. Cooperation between the two partners is good. CSR standards are high at HYM. The principle achievement in the project regarding CSR aspects is application of workers safety standards as well as environmental mitigation measures. In the area of Human Resources, the staff of the company reaps the benefits of the project because of trainings, well-maintained equipment and protective equipment, as well as a profit-participating scheme for truck drivers. The company HYM has grown from 13 to 24 full time employees, one more than expected before PSI. Further it employs a number of temporary drivers, sometimes up to 10 additional. Four of the 24 employees are women, all working in management and administration.DescriptionA growing interest in FSC certified tropical wood has been noticed over the last ten years. Bolivia has one million hectares of natural forests FSC certified, which used to be two million hectares. One of the obstacles is the logistics to get the wood from the forest towards the customer in Europe. The applicant company Van der Werf-Schuilenga Beheer B.V. is very interested to buy larger quantities of certified tropical wood from Bolivia. Together with their partner Empresas de Transportes HYM S.R.L. they will start an ISO 9001 certified timber transport company for FSC certified wood in Bolivia. The company will specialise its services to the FSC certified forestry companies working in the most remote areas with difficult access in Santa Cruz. The company will buy and convert twelve trucks to 6x4 in order to be able to provide reliable and environmentally conscious transport services during eleven months a year in hard accessible areas. The company will have its own workshop for maintenance and repair of the trucks. The truck drivers will benefit from better working conditions, receive living wages and have the opportunity to be owner of their own truck after seven years.Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)The company will only transport FSC certified wood and will be ISO 9001 certified. The drivers will be trained in safety, car repair and maintenance and road behaviour. The trucks will comply with the European norms on emission control EURO 3 and 4. The company will pay living wages, good working conditions and fringe benefits and provide the opportunity to the drivers to become owner of the truck in seven years or to participate yearly in the profit sharing scheme. The company will always submit invoices and work 100% legally. The transport price per km will be lower as compared to the informal sector, offering advantages for the forestry sector. The company will evaluate yearly whether their targets on environment, health and safety will be met.Impact&#x2022;	Employment and working conditionsThe project pays more than living wages to the truck drivers and the mechanics. In addition the truck drivers can participate in a profit sharing scheme, either choosing to receive monthly part of the profit of that truck or to become the owner of the truck after seven years. The company will be ISO 9001 certified. Employees will be trained but will also have the possibility to participate in other courses for instance on financial administration, vehicle maintenance, management, etc. The drivers will directly benefit from the new trucks in terms of working environment, as the new trucks are cleaner, better suspension, less noise, on-board bed and will be maintained after each trip (meaning less dirty work for the driver on the road). The company will pay all services on the road like hotels, food, medical services, etc.&#x2022;	Innovation / Transfer of knowledgeThe project will offer transport services for FSC certified companies (in need of formal arrangements) with well-maintained trucks and trailers suitable for heavy dirt roads and with well-trained drivers.Further innovative key points are:- The number of rides will extend during the rainy season by adapting the trucks and trailers (double rear driven axle (6x4 traction), heavy duty springs, raising of front springs, raising coupling height of the trailers, extra height blocks, manual gearbox, GPS system, AdBlue, higher tires, lower weight, higher engine power).- Usage of trucks complying with EURO 3 and 4 norm regarding emissions.- Intention to use 30% biodiesel.- The weight of the trucks is 10% lower, enabling the company to carry 10% extra load of timber per ride (25 m3).- The company will be ISO 9001 certified. It will be the first ISO certified transport company in Bolivia.- Transport of only FSC certified timber.- Creation of a loyalty system for drivers, resulting in them becoming owner of the truck in seven years&#x2019; time.- Training of the drivers in safety standards and code of behaviour.- Constant maintenance of the truck after every trip.&#x2022;	Chain effectsAll materials are sourced locally, however, as the company is already existing it is a continuation and extension of the current supply relations. At least seventeen companies will be supplying &#x20AC; 492,484 of goods and services.Local customers will benefit substantially of this project. They can focus themselves on their core business and the joint venture will take care of the transport of their timber to the different cities in Bolivia or to Arica in Chile. The joint venture will be able to transport eleven months a year, which means a bigger transport capacity a year, less chance of problems during transport, lower prices, higher reliability through better and well maintained trucks, less time needed for the transport and less time needed to use their skidders to pull the trucks with cargo from the mud (meaning more time for the core business of the skidder). The sawmills will be enabled to operate for more months a year and as a result be more profitable.&#x2022;	Impact on the sectorThe company will have agreements with local universities on traineeships for students and with NGOs on sustainability. By improving and extending the transport capacity the entire forestry sector will benefit, as the other companies will be more easily available.&#x2022;	EnvironmentThe better trucks and well trained drivers will cause less damage to the forest roads and the forest. The fuel consumption of the new trucks will be lower, meaning less pollution of the environment. At the same time all trucks will comply with the strict EURO 3 and 4 norms. The used oil will be separated in the workshop. The project will prevent wood to remain in the forest after cutting through improved logistics. The company will work only with FSC certified companies, assisting them to become more viable companies, as such stimulating others also to obtain FSC certification.&#x2022;	Position of womenFour out of 23 people will be female.</narrative>
