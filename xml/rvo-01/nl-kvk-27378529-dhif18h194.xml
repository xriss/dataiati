   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The aim of the feasibility study is to investigate the feasibility of a dairyfarm and dairy training project in the Northern Region (Jaffna) of Sri Lanka. The North of Sri Lanka has predominantly a Tamil population. This region has been badly damaged by the Tamil war and is slowly trying to rebuild itself. There is a great need for socio-economic infrastructure and employment, especially in rural areas. There are plans to set up agricultural food projects in combination with practical training in order to increase the employment and knowledge level of the rural population.The Vanni Development Forum (NGO) approached the consortium through its contacts in the Netherlands to support this development. A local construction company, Hari Engineering, is prepared to realize and exploit such a project for its own account. He seeks cooperation with Dutch companies and institutes for the necessary knowledge and technology. The subject of the study will be the feasibility of a dairy farm with 125 cows, the technical layout in the prevailing climate, the market for milk and milk products, the forage harvesting and preservation, milk processing, transport and cooling, type of cows, the problems surrounding the marketing of male animals with respect to the Buddhist philosophy of life, the prevention of Lactose intolerance by production of special so-called A2 milk.As a second component, the feasibility and design of a Dairy Training Center will be investigated. This DTC must be self-supporting so that continuity is guaranteed at all times. In the past, this element has been shown to be of vital importance. Previous attempts from the Netherlands (80s) have not been successful as a result. The uniqueness of this concept is the practical design, the relatively low investment and the fact that the training facility is directly linked to a practical company.Furthermore, cooperation and connection will be examined with the local educational institutions as well as institutions in the Netherlands, such as Wellantcollege, Dairy campus. Finally, the financial feasibility, the total investment and ROI, ROE and cash flow will be investigated. The starting point is that the local partner will at least cover the local part of the investment. If possible, export financing will be attracted for the import part.Through this set-up, the project will teach the local farm families how to manage an efficient dairy farm and to acquire a family income on a relatively small farm farm. This will greatly improve employment and family income in rural areas. The study aims to demonstrate and substantiate this.The final result of the study must be that a basis is created for healthy rural development in which the local population can work and obtain an adequate income. The project also fits in with government policy to become self-sufficient in dairy production in the medium term.</narrative>
