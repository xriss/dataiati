  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The joint venture which is going to be established in this project consists of three partners and will introduce a new alcohol free beverage to Nigeria which has potentially excellent commercial opportunities because of the enormous size of the Nigerian Market.A small-scale canning plant will be established in Ogun State near Lagos in which an alcohol free beer concentrate bought from Germany will be (automatically) blended with mainly water, flavours and CO2. This blended beverage is a (pale) lager beer look-alike which will be canned in 33 cl cans and marketed to the domestic Nigerian market as a healthy drink and alternative to alcohol containing ordinary beer. This concept allows for a relatively low investment because brewing equipment is not necessary. The project is expected to employ 48 persons and the production line which will be installed has a capacity to produce 3,200 cans per hour. The project&#x2019;s output will be 21,000 hl (approximately 6.5 million cans) of this beverage per year.One of the two Dutch partners in this project is a retired Bavaria Beer brewery expert (Brewery Advice). He has been involved in the R&amp;D of this beverage which has in Africa already been introduced by Bavaria in South Africa, DR Congo and Zimbabwe.The other Dutch partner (ISPS) is a small company specialised in the development of food processing projects in general. The Nigerian Partner (Honor&apos;e Ventures Limited) is importing and trading food products and this company already has a business relationship with ISPS. The trio has jointly developed this project triggered by the commercial opportunities and the absence of such a beverage in Nigeria. The drink should appeal to persons of all religions and it is hoped to be a good alternative to those who like to drink something which looks similar to beer but which does not have the negative impact the drinking of alcohol might have.Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)The partners will follow the OECD guidelines for multinational enterprises and act according to the ILO declaration on fundamental principles and rights at work and will implement their written CSR policy. The local partner has hired the services of a special CSR consultant to advice on this issue.All 48 employees will receive official labour contracts and a so-called &apos;living wage&apos; of at least 122% of the minimum wage. Furthermore, all employees will receive a social security package including social insurance, health and accident insurance and a pension scheme. Normal working hours will respect applicable local laws: in Nigeria 6 days per week is common practice.The proposal states that 27% of the workforce will be female.The factory will follow the obligatory GMP rules. A HACCP certificate is not deemed necessary. The production process contains no risk for contamination and the final product will be pasteurised.Impact&#x2022;	Employment and working conditionsSee Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR).&#x2022;	Innovation / Transfer of knowledgeAlthough the production process (blending of concentrate and canning) is not an innovation in Nigeria, the product as such is new to the country.&#x2022;	Chain effectsLocal suppliers of the following products are expected to benefit from the project- Carton boxes.- Chemicals for cleaning and maintenance.- Office supplies.- Safety clothing and equipment.- Services from IT providers, local Insurance companies and laboratories (the partners intent to collaborate with local laboratories for further testing of their products).- (in the future) Fruit concentrates, to be added to the beverage in order to adapt it to the local consumers&apos; tastes.Furthermore, transport will be out-sourced to local companies.If the quality is satisfactory, also the tin cans might be sourced locally however so far research into this matter was not promising.Local customers like the distributors will be able to increase their assortment of drinks and will be able to attract more customers.The impact on consumers is foremost health related: the drink is a healthy alternative to beer drinkers with possible concerns related to alcohol and to consumers of soft-drinks (with lots of sugar) because it does not contain sugar.The local partner also mentioned a plan to approach students for selling the beverage on a commission basis. If this works out well it could provide these students with a new source of income.&#x2022;	Impact on the sector- The applicant has indicated that other local operators are free to replicate the concept. The partners will not apply for any patent for the production method in Nigeria.- To increase the diffusion of new knowledge in the country and especially among the youth, the joint venture will collaborate with local training institutes and vocational centres to recruit interns and apprentices in the fields of production and distribution.&#x2022;	EnvironmentThe environmental effects will be assessed in an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA). It is expected that the outcome will show a neutral effect and that no substantial risks are involved.- The water to be used in the project will be sourced locally and some boreholes will be drilled for that purpose. The applicant even expects that the project shall positively contribute to the issue of water availability in the region: water used will be purified and will be made available to locals.- The aluminium can waste is recycled in Nigeria: tin cans are melted and transformed into pots and pans. This is common practice in the country.&#x2022;	Position of womenNeutral.&#x2022;	Impact on government/society levelThe applicant has identified a social role for this drink: it could act as a community building tool because both dominant religious groups (Christians and Muslims) in Nigeria can drink it together.An open day will be held at the end of the project and the population will be invited to visit the manufacturing unit.&#x2022;	Impact on food safetyThe project will positively contribute to the issue of food security because it will bring a healthy, rich of vitamins and minerals, and non-alcoholic drink on the Nigerian market. This beverage can help in fighting malnutrition but it is also helpful in the struggle against the growing problem of alcoholism in Nigeria.&#x2022;	Impact on the local shareholders&apos; positionThe implementation of this project should allow the local partner to realise his ambition for a further growth by entering into food processing/manufacturing, in this case a beverage. Financial benefits look promising.</narrative>
