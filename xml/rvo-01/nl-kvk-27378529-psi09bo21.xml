   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Developing a reliable supply chain of quality wild cocoa</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Applicant, Pronatec AG, is a Swiss trader of mainly organic products, who supplies wild cocoa beans to the chocolate industry. Local Partner, Rainforest Exquisite Products S.A. (REPSA), is the only major exporter of Bolivian wild cocoa beans, which it sells to Pronatec AG.The commercial trade of wild cocoa is extremely rare and mostly sourced from Beni and Cochabamba departments, in Bolivia. The wild cocoa beans from Bolivia are recognised by the high end of the chocolate market, as an exclusive product for which top chocolate makers are willing to pay an exceptional price. On average some 200 to 250 tons are collected annually, of which only 20% can be exported due to quality problems This situation is unsatisfactory for all parties in the supply chain; the high ratio of non-exportable beans translates in lower average returns for the collectors; the volume of only 40 to 50 tons per year is too small for traders to be profitable; and the European market has a higher demand that cannot be met from the current supply. Thus, with the aim of substantially increasing the volume of exportable wild cocoa beans, a project is proposed comprising several interventions to improve quality and reliability throughout the supply chain:&#x2022; Organisation of 800 cocoa collectors into groups resorting under 6 buying stations.&#x2022; Provision of fermentation-drying units and camp sets to collector groups.&#x2022; Training of collectors in quality-oriented harvesting, fermentation, drying and transport.&#x2022; Establishment of 3 new and upgrading of 3 existing buying stations.&#x2022; Training of buying station staff and quality control staff.&#x2022; Improved transport to La Paz by investing in cargo tracking and better shipping.&#x2022; Organic / FairWild certification.As a result of these interventions, the total volume collected is projected to increase to 350 tons with the exportable share eventually doubling to 50%, or some 175 tons exported per year. This will provide a profitable and sustainable basis for the wild cocoa business whereas Pronatec will benefit from a reliable and substantial volume of quality wild cocoa beans.The collectors will see their income improved, their number will double to 800 and new employment is created at the buying stations.Partners will establish a joint venture, who will enter into a long-term sales contract with Pronatec with regard to the export and sales of wild cocoa beans.Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)Both, Pronatec and REPSA, are companies with strong Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) profiles as reflected in the mission statement of the 2 companies and put into practice in their contracts with their suppliers (organic premiums, technical assistance, guaranteeing market, health insurance, etc).The joint venture&apos;s CSR policy with regard to social standards will be made explicit in a document to be produced as part of one of the Results.All members of staff as well as the collectors will receive training and coaching in their respective fields and secondary benefits, like health and first aid training, supplemental health insurance and 13 months payment for all permanent staff. The salaries are at least 25% above minimum wages in Bolivia. The joint venture partners have continuous contact with the collectors groups to tackle gender and child labour issues.Safeguarding the environment lies at the basis of every activity REPSA undertakes in the highly diversified &apos;hotspot&apos; eco region of It&#xE9;nez and Chapare. As such, the joint venture has a strong environmental policy and the joint venture partners will maximise their efforts in raising environmental awareness amongst their staff and collectors to ensure environmental friendly business practices. Staff will be trained in forest ecology, implementing an internal control system for organic / wild harvest certification and complying with organic harvest standards, whereas a complete training module is dedicated to sustainable harvesting, to educate the collectors in avoiding fire and combat small fire outbreaks, manage the wild cocoa stands in the forests, hunting rules and camp and waste management. The joint venture&apos;s production will be Organic / FairWild certified.Impact&#x2022;	Employment and working conditionsAt the end of the project, the joint venture will employ 28 staff (18.5 FTE). This will increase to 37 (25 FTE) two years after the pilot. As the activities only take place during part of the year, the employment figures must be detailed:- The complete staff from REPSA (5), will be managing the joint venture during the harvest period, and is included in the 28;- 12 persons (for each buying station: 1manager + 1assistant) will be permanently employed by the joint venture throughout the year;- 13 persons will be hired by the joint venture for 4 months per year, during harvest, and will work in REPSA&apos;s organic cocoa activities, during the remaining part of the year.The joint venture&apos;s unskilled labour will be paid a minimum of 20% above the legal minimum wage, and they will enjoy the following fringe benefits:- 13 months payment per year;- A bonus received for every year they complete working with the company;- Contribution to employee&apos;s health insurance and state pension fund.&#x2022;	Innovation / Transfer of knowledgeAlthough the collectors in It&#xE9;nez are already receiving technical assistance on some topics by REPSA personnel, the scope, intensity and professionalism of the training modules being implemented in this proposed project is new to Bolivia, and will serve as an example for other fair and sustainable collected ingredients throughout the region. New knowledge will be transferred in the practices of sustainable wild cocoa collection according to the FairWild standard which is novel to Bolivia.&#x2022;	Chain effectsThe number of collectors involved will increase from 400 to 800, and their income will increase by 10%, due to the fact that a larger share of the collected beans will meet export quality, for which better prices are paid.As the total export volume is projected to triple, the project will generate additional economic activities for transportation companies (by river and by road) and for REPSA (in quality inspection and storage and forwarding).&#x2022;	EnvironmentThe effect of the project on the environment is neutral. Most of the beans fall from the trees naturally or, when harvested, it will take place in a careful and traditional way not harming the trees. No chemicals whatsoever are applied; certified wild cocoa is a completely natural product. Indeed, this project will be beneficial to the environment if it succeeds in raising environmental awareness among the collectors through education and knowledge transfer on various aspects of forest ecology and sustainable harvest practices; in addition, the promotion campaign will create ecological awareness with a wider public by making use of various local media.&#x2022;	Position of womenAbout 20% of the total workforce will be women, mainly in management and quality control, as the field operations are remote and involve physical work such as lifting heavy bags.</narrative>
