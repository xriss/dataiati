  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Note: This project has been cancelled, because the applicant has requested to prematurely terminate the project.The applicant Hanegraaf B.V., the Netherlands, and the local partner Cumacor 189 Pty Ltd, South Africa, will form a joint venture to produce semi-finished, 100% natural oils with a cosmetic grade, and to sell the oils to the cosmetic industry. The type of oils to be produced are Macula, Moringa and Macadamia oil, all produced from the nuts from these trees. The processing unit which will have a production capacity of about 30,000 litres annually will be located near Alldays, Limpopo, South Africa next to the location of an existing (former) PSI project. In sourcing the raw material African Oil wants to involve local suppliers and local communities, but will also establish an own plantation. The project will lead to increased employment and income for people from all levels of education and thus will boost the local economy. The intention is that outgrowers will supply organically produced nuts to African Oil to enable the product be certified as organic.African Oil will reduce its carbon footprint by using solar energy, reducing the use of office paper and  by planting carbon-fixing Spekboom trees.Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)CSR will not be an issue. The basis of the joint venture&#x2019;s CSR is the present policy of both partners.The formalized CSR policy of the applicant deals with the following subjects: human rights, rights of local communities, HRM policy, health and safety of employees, environmental protection, food safety, combating bribery, and chain responsibility.Impact&#x2022;	Employment and working conditionsThe joint venture will strive to be at least 25% above minimum wages which are the standard wages that are being used in South Africa for the several functions. All joint venture&#x2019;s employees will be paid fair, living wages which are above the minimum sectorial determined minimum wages. Employees will be paid a fixed wage and be given an incentive bonus based on performance. By designing a state-of-the art factory, safe working conditions will be ensured for the joint venture&#x2019;s employees. The factory will also be accredited by HACCP and by the Occupational Health Association of South Africa (OHASA). The joint venture will offer transport, educational workshops and one meal a day to each of its staff members free of charge. It will also offer first aid training and arrange for a mobile clinic to visit the factory regularly in order to treat its employees for any conditions they may have.&#x2022;	Innovation / Transfer of knowledgeThere are other natural oil producers in South Africa (Macadamia), but these are mostly for food purposes and there is no single company in South Africa that produces the presented natural oils with a cosmetic grade. Therefore, the project is new compared to other natural oil producers as it produces something completely different and has completely different clients.&#x2022;	Chain effectsImpact on local suppliersAfrican Oils wants to involve local suppliers and local communities. They will train them and make them an asset and function as a good promotion. The project will lead to increased employment and income for people from all levels of education. This will boost the local economy. The projects expect to reach out to outgrowers (10 outsourced growers who will supply organically produced nuts to African Oil; and 10 outsourced collection points who will supply organically produced nuts to African Oil).Impact on local customers or consumersAlthough the largest market will be the international one, the project partners indicate that they have discussed their ideas with several clients and have already potential interested parties in South Africa (10) and Western Africa (4).&#x2022;	Impact on the sectorEverybody active in South Africa in the field of African Oil&#x2019;s activity will have the opportunity to join the programme of the joint venture. Better partners and suppliers will provide better products; therefore the joint venture will focus on developing the knowledge and skills of the local long-term suppliers.The partners have contacted fruit processing companies in Limpopo and Mpumalanga provinces, (who are buying fruit collected by community projects to process Marula pulp for sale to fruit juice producers) to buy nuts. In a later stage, fruit collected by the joint venture, will first be brought to these companies and the joint venture will buy the unprocessed nuts. New kernel collection points will be established in several other (sub)regions.&#x2022;	EnvironmentAll operations will be organically certified, therefore the project will have a positive impact on the environment. African Oil will affect the environment in positive way where possible, they will insert solar energy into their plant and implement a paperless office. Spekboom will make the plant carbon neutral, next to its energy neutrality due to its solar panels and other smart energy measures.&#x2022;	Position of womenThe project partners expect to supply jobs for approximately 42 women, accounting for 70% of the company. The joint venture will also influence their direct environment, where possible, to engage in these activities.&#x2022;	Impact on food safetyThere is an indirect effect on food security since the Moringa tree is considered as a &quot;wonder tree&quot; with very nutritious leaves which can be prepared as food supplement. More trees mean more leaves and more people that can benefit especially in rural areas.&#x2022;	Impact on waterAll operations will be designed in such a way to reduce the usage of water. In addition, Moringa oleifera leaves are used to flocculate water. Therefore, African Oil will treat local water supplies to clean water and supply this water to the local community.</narrative>
