   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Through this project, the knowledge and understanding of the Dutch cargo bikes and bicycle logistics sector is broadened among Colombian stakeholders. The goal is to learn how Dutch innovations in this sector could be applied in a more strategic and structural way in the Colombian context. By doing so, last mile logistics in Colombia&#x2019;s main urban areas could be enhanced and optimized by innovative solutions, contributing to the development of a niche market that offers local employment opportunities.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">A total of 10 persons from 9 different Colombian organizations participated in the International Cargo Bike Festival - ICBF- 2019 

A balanced and diverse group of Colombian key-representatives was composed, consisting of 1) three experts in the manufacturing, import, marketing and sales of cargo bikes; 2) four delegates specializing in offering innovative urban logistics; 3) three representatives that are highly involved in planning and influencing policy.

The ICBF is the venue where policy makers, designers and manufacturers of cargo bicycles meet annually, resulting in many direct, new contacts for the Colombian organizations that dedicate themselves to the same activities.
- The conferences and workshops provided the opportunity to meet with local governmental entities, that were happy to demonstrate, explain and detail their interventions in the promotion and use of the cargo bike.
- Dutch mobility experts were also part of the talks and workshops.
- The City Summit, that took place during the ICBF, allowed for the Colombian delegation to meet with representatives of different cities around the world who came to Groningen with the same objective of learning and exchanging ideas to improve the logistics sector in their respective cities.
- Each of the Colombian delegates established at least 20 useful contacts for the near future.

Fields for future investment oportunities are: 
 - Design and manufacturing of cargo bikes: Innovation and technology used to produce more efficient cargo bikes. 
- Infrastructure: Urban planning in the hands of local governments in favor of the promotion of cargo bicycles.
- Logistics solution: Identification of social and economic benefits in the use of cargo bicycles as an alternative means of logistic solution.
- Business: Commercial samples for the purchase and marketing of cargo bicycles.

Wider perspectives identified in terms of more efficient and environmental-friendly urban freight systems (especially in last-mile logistics), based on the Dutch model and lessons learnt.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">From June 13-18 an incoming visit of a Colombian delegation, consisting of 9 entities (with 10 delegates in total) active in the manufacturing and policy development of the bicycle and logistics sector, was welcomed to the Netherlands to be part of the International Cargo Bike Festival in the City of Groningen, with the aim of broadening their understanding of the Dutch sector of cargo bicycles, and possible applications in the Colombian context. This was accomplished through the exchange of experiences, strategies and ideas that have been implemented in the Netherlands regarding the promotion and use of cargo bikes as a means of transport but also as a logistics &#x201C;last mile&#x201D; solution. Starting with the premise of &#x201C;Zero Carbon Emission by 2025&#x201D;, most of Dutch cities have formulated a plan led and accompanied by the local governments and implemented by local companies and entities that aim to contribute to zero carbon footprint but also to improve sustainable mobility in the cities. The Colombian delegation did not only learn from the Dutch knowledge and experience, but also showcased the current situation, developments and progress in the City of Bogot&#xE1; during recent years. Holland House Colombia, in close cooperation with the Dutch Embassy in Bogot&#xE1; and RVO, were responsible for organizing the visit and constructed a programme through which the delegation participated in a broad spectrum of activities, workshops and conferences within the framework of the International Cargo Bike Festival and also in other Dutch cities such as The Hague and Amsterdam.</narrative>
