  </description>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Note: This project has been cancelled, because the companies involved have lost confidence in each other and in the fact that the project will still be executed successfully.Currently in Bolivia, there are no companies selling asphalt products to third parties. There are only construction companies applying asphalt products in huge road construction and rehabilitation projects at national level, except for the Municipality of La Paz, which uses its own asphalt plant. Therefore, all municipalities and private companies use the much more expensive concrete pavements for roads and parking places. The asphalt sector therefore is not a well-developed sector in Bolivia. The two project partners want to change this situation and at the same time resolve several environmental problems. Saglas Obras y Servicios S.A. is a Spanish company specialised in large road construction, rehabilitation and maintenance projects. Latinoamericana de Proyectos S.A. (LAPSA) is a Bolivian consulting and service company involved in major public and private infrastructural projects. The project partners will start the first private company in Bolivia to produce and sell asphalt products to third parties in the road construction, rehabilitation and maintenance sector. The company will introduce three environmental conscious technologies:- Reclaimed Asphalt Pavement (RAP),- Rubber modified Asphalt (RMB asphalt) and- Warm Mix Asphalt (WMA). RAP is old asphalt pavement recycled into raw material for new asphalt products. RMB asphalt is produced with recycled tires as one of its ingredients. Therefore, a used tire collection system with third party collectors will be organised, contributing to the control of sources of dengue proliferation. The production and application of WMA safes energy and is more worker friendly as compared to the currently used Hot Mix Asphalt bitumen. The joint venture will construct the OHSAS 18001, ISO 9001 and ISO 14001 certified pilot plant in Viacha in the Department of La Paz, generating employment for 47 people.Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)The project will introduce new technologies to reduce the environmental impact of asphalt production in Bolivia. Tire recycling is a solution for a waste and a health problem (dengue) and the use of rubber in asphalt reduces the use of bitumen with 16%. Old asphalt pavement will be reused as raw material for asphalt production, saving 30% virgin aggregates and reducing landfill space. The production of warm mix asphalt (WMA) will reduce natural gas requirements, CO2 and VOC emissions and improve working conditions for production and application staff. The joint venture will implement an occupational health and safety management system according to OHSAS 18001 and a quality and environmental management system (ISO 9001 and ISO 14001). Further, the salaries, fringe benefits and working conditions will be very good in the company as described below.Impact&#x2022;	Employment and working conditionsThe joint venture will contract all employees on full-time basis and will pay living wages. The living wage is based on the normative food basket calculated by CEDLA in 2011 to be Bs 1,792. With inflation and including 10% for savings this would be an individual living wage of Bs 2,160. In addition transport is provided from and to the plant. The occupational health and safety is safeguarded by working according to the OHSAS 18001 certification. Working cloths are provided. The employability will be increased through the specific trainings also on ISO 9001 and ISO 14001 standards.&#x2022;	Innovation / Transfer of knowledgeThe project is innovative in the following aspects for which training is required:- There are no other companies selling asphalt to third parties.- No one uses RAP as ingredient for its asphalt in Bolivia. Nowadays, the old asphalt layers are dumped without being used, destroying natural resources and occupying space. In addition new bitumen and new aggregates are used for the new asphalt layer. Moreover, the company will offer the service for RAP milling.- No one produces RMB based on recycled car tires in Bolivia. In terms of logistics, no end-of-life tire collection centres exist.- No other company produces WMA.- No other company collects and recycles used tires on industrial scale (only small-scale use to make slippers).- The company will be certified according to ISO 9001, ISO 14001 and OHSAS 18001.- It will introduce new marketing techniques.&#x2022;	Chain effectsImpact on local suppliers Nearly 100% of the raw materials will be sourced in Bolivia. Nine collectors of tires can use the project collection centres in la Paz and El Alto, making it easier for them to start a tire collection company. Base bitumen and PMB will be supplied by BIBSA. The RAP will be delivered by independent truck drivers. Stones, sand and gravel will be supplied by quarries which will be selected and screened on their legal, environmental and social performance.Impact on local customers or consumers All products are meant to be for local clients. The clients can be local companies or Governmental institutions at National or Municipal level. The clients will have continue access to products which earlier were not available in the market, like RAP, RMB, PMB and WMA. The different bitumen products will be available also for road construction companies at lower prices than the imported ones. It will enable local governments to use bitumen products instead of concrete pavements, decreasing their budget expenditures for road pavement by 80%. Bolivian consumers will benefit by better quality road pavements and by increased number of paved roads, reducing travel time and improving road safety.&#x2022;	Impact on the sectorThe joint venture will produce the asphalt mixes according to the internationally recognised AASHTO standards and tests will be done in the BIBSA laboratory. As such a guaranteed product will be introduced in the road construction sector. The joint venture partners hope to foster the creation of an asphalt institute in Bolivia, similar to those in neighbouring countries. Such an institute will promote technical discussions and experience sharing in the road construction community. However, this will take place after the PSI project. The company will actively work together with research institutes and universities, creating also opportunities for traineeships for students.&#x2022;	EnvironmentStart of a tire collection system, resolving the problem of breading places for mosquitoes or preventing the burning of tires together with conventional waste. It will also reduce the disposal of removed asphalt pavements in landfills, reduce the required amount of virgin aggregates and virgin bitumen. It will reduce CO2 and VOC emissions during the production and application of WMA instead of HMA. Finally it will reduce the CO2 emissions by using natural gas for its industrial plants instead of diesel. The joint venture will obtain the ISO 14001 certification for environmental management. Stones, sand and gravel will be supplied by quarries which will be selected and screened on their legal, environmental and social performance. Roads paved with rubber modified bitumen lasts longer than conventional asphalt, presenting also environmental benefits.&#x2022;	Position of womenOut of 47 employees six will be women, of whom two on medium-/high-level. All positions which are suitable for women will be given to women.</narrative>
