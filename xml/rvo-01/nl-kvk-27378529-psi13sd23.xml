   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Establishment of certified peanut sorting line in El Daien Sudan</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Peanut is one of the most important crops in Sudan, especially in the three Darfur States. As the main cash crop, it is grown by most of the farmers in this area. It is a crop of major economic importance and caters for food security as well as the people&apos;s livelihood as a cash crop. Most of the peanuts traded in the region are shelled by mobile units at the farms and delivered in bags of 80 kg. However, since the de-shelling facilities are rather old and use outdated technologies, the percentage of damaged or broken kernels is very high and the product will not satisfy the HPS (Hand Picked Selected) quality requirements for the &quot;ready to use&quot; food sector and the peanut confectionery industry. The project is located in Ed Daein, East Darfur State.The applicant is the French company Onyx D&#xE9;veloppement SAS, specialised in nutritional products for the treatment and prevention of moderate and severe malnutrition. The local partner, Say Company, is directly involved in various food processing facilities and since 2010 the company is a joint venture partner of the applicant in the production of high value nutritional peanut products.The project will be incorporated in the joint venture of the partners.The envisaged project intends to create a business platform whereby peanut farmers, cooperatives and key stakeholders and to establish a long term partnerships to foster sustainable production of peanuts in the region with high standards. The project enables farmers to move from traditional agriculture under subsistence levels to commercially based activities in a post-war/conflict zone.Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)CSR will be an important part of the project.The business partners are very committed to implement the measures to be taken in the field of corporate social responsibility.- SocialThe partners will give an equal opportunity to both men and women. Female workers are expected to participate in all levels in the company.It is planned that female workers are appointed to operational processes, especially in the sorting area, quality control section and packing. However, the joint venture will put extra effort on recruiting women for higher-level managerial jobs as well.- EnvironmentalThe project&#x2019;s focus is to obtain a HACCP certificate.- EconomicEmployees will receive a wage 10% above the relevant average.The annual refreshment course and complementary training will consequently improve the value of employees on the labour market, leading to a higher supply of skilled employees as well.- OtherThe project would like to establish cooperation with the University of El Daein, East Darfur. During the implementation of this project, it is planned to team up with the Ministry of Agriculture&#x2019;s Extension Department with the aim of reviving the collapsed extension services in the field. This effort can be done in collaboration with UNDP and FAO Sudan.Impact&#x2022;	Employment and working conditionsThe peanut sorting facility will offer good wages to both FTE and PTE, which will be at least 10% to 20% above the ones for similar occupation in the region as well as above the minimum wage in the country (which is around SDG 425 or &#x20AC; 70) and much higher than the poverty threshold under which 95% of rural inhabitants live in Darfur (USD 1.25 or &#x20AC; 0.94 per day). Given the current high inflation in Sudan, the wages will be revised at least once every two production seasons. All employees will be provided with additional (financial) benefits.- Working conditionsSpecial attention to prevent health or safety hazards as well as to personnel (security) protection will be given. In line with the HACCP principles protective clothing, such as disposable gloves, vented splash goggles, closeted shoes and a coat, will be provided as well as regular relevant safety trainings. Several guards will be also present at all times in the sorting facility.- Fringe benefitsThe local partner currently provides good secondary employment conditions as well. Similar ones will apply to the new peanut sorting plant. The fringe benefits will consist of holiday benefits; first 45 days of sick leave with fully paid salary, followed by 60 days of half salary and 75 days of unpaid sick leave; coverage of medical insurance; free transport from home to the factory and vice versa; subsidised meals at the canteen; at least the minimum vacation days per year as per the local labour law and one additional day for every year in service as well as national holidays; first aid treatment; ample training opportunities for in country education.&#x2022;	Innovation / Transfer of knowledgeThe envisaged project intends to establish the first Certified Sorting Facility for the processing of premium graded peanuts in Darfur.There is an urgent need to increase investment in agricultural production in the entire region of Darfur and having a venture of this nature in a post-war/conflict zone is itself a milestone to move from traditional agriculture under subsistence levels to commercially based activities.&#x2022;	Chain effectsRaw material suppliers (farmers and cooperatives)The peanut sorting facility will solely depend on and source locally produced raw material (e.g. raw peanuts).The partners will strive to ensure that the local producers are not only offered fair market prices but also to assist them through various initiatives in reduction of their farming costs as well as increase in their productivity (yields). The company will invest significantly in developing the peanut farming sector, through training programmes, assistance on the field, advises (on best practices, seed, agricultural inputs, etc.), supply of market information, financial support, etc., farmers developing and implementing specific initiatives.This venture will use the services of other local suppliers in the region, such as transport companies.&#x2022;	Impact on the sectorThe sorting process by-product, FAQ, is usually utilised for the production of Crude Peanut Oil and will be marketed to local Oil Mills. They benefit from having regular supply of cleaned product ready for further processing.&#x2022;	EnvironmentThe proposed certified peanut sorting facility will not pose any direct risks to the environment.&#x2022;	Position of womenThe impact on the position of women will be positive. The applicant and local partner apply gender equality in their current companies, as well as in their existing joint venture, which means equal pay for women and men for same work, equal work value, and equal job opportunities. The same principles will apply to the new sorting facility as salaries will be the same for both genders competence based.&#x2022;	Impact on government/society levelThe events over the last ten years lead to devastation of the Darfur formal industries due to the volatile climate, lack of Governmental support, poor infrastructure and unsafely environment. Although, this project intends to create hundreds of formal jobs, it will have a major contribution in the local economy as well by bringing investments to the region within a sustainable approach and will affect the livelihood of thousands of families in the region.&#x2022;	Impact on food safetyBy focusing on the agricultural sector, on which most people in the region depend on for securing their livelihood, the project will inevitably also contribute to the improvement of the food security issue in Sudan and in Darfur in particular.</narrative>
