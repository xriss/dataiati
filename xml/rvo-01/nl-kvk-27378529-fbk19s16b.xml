   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Arte purchases granite (Steel Grey) directly from her supplier Pokarna who owns a quarry inBallikuruva, Prakasam District, Andhra Pradesh. Pokarna also owns a factory where thegranite blocks are processed into slabs before being shipped to the Netherlands. Based on the audits conducted by Earthworm in the quarry and factory where Arte is sourcing part of its granitefrom and research conducted by Arisa we know that the child labour risk is highest at thelevel of natural stone quarries. Arte together with her supplier Pokarna, Arisa and the localNGO MV Foundation started a so called Child Labour Free Zone Project in the area where thequarry of Pokarna is located. This project ran from September 2017 until April 2020.Besides the 8 villages of FBK project I, the new project has been expanded to 4 new villages. MV Foundation had earlier been working only in villages in which quarries were operational. However, the project team noted that significant numbers of people in these 4 villages were engaged in processes such as cutting and polishing granite from the quarries. Quite a few of them were immigrants.  Gram Panchayat members and school teachers from these villages had also requested the organisation to expand its operations to their villages. As the new project will have a stronger focus on the business we will include those 4 extra villages in Ballikuruva area. A household survey was undertaken in these villages in order to identify the number of school-going and out-of-school children.  The survey brought out that there were 1249 school-gong and 29 out-of-school children aged 6-18 years from these villages.The project will also focus on the underage young migrant workers (15-17) who work in the quarries and processing units to prevent them from coming to the area and will address the working conditions of the migrant and local labourers. This project provides the opportunity to develop and pilot integrated interventions at quarry and community level to address occupational health and safety issues, the situation of migrant workers, wages, age verification systems, and bonded labour and learn how to address these issues. Improving local social dialogue and formalising labour arrangements are interventions that are likely to contribute to eradication of labour issues, including child labour, in the long-term,</narrative>
