   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The ambition of Water as Leverage, as a program, is to become a one that generates multiple bankable climate resilience projects globally following this first Call for Action which serves as a pilot. Key elements for this collaborative pre-project preparation Call is to include all stakeholders from the beginning; local governments, NGOs and businesses, international and local experts in the teams and partners with funding capacity for the proposals to be developed (i.e. development banks, public and private partners).Scheduled activities are divided into two (2) stages. Phase 1: Research and Analysis for the Development of Conceptual DesignsIn this phase the teams develop three (3) to five (5) Conceptual Designs for potentialsolutions to the challenges, based on new and/or existing research and analysis.Phase 2: Development of Proposals for Urban Water ProjectsIn this phase up to three Conceptual Designs from Phase 1 are transformed into Proposals for Urban Water Project(s) with a focus on physical infrastructure. These should serve as solutions to the challenges in the cities.The objective is to develop bankable, innovative and comprehensive Proposals for Urban Water Projects in Khulna (Bangladesh) to address the urgent water and climate adaptation needs. The proposals should have local support, a focus on physical infrastructure and be developed with local partners. The following elements should be taken into account and are described in more detail in the document &#x2018;Setting the Scene&#x2019;, downloadable from www.waterasleverage.org:1)	Proposals will be embedded in a complex planning context2)	Comprehensive proposals that endorse strategies combining water and urban challenges 3)	Water as Leverage asks for processes that incorporate local expertise into concrete solutions with global resonanceFor more info, please visit; waterasleverage.orgWithin Khulna city the project proposal from CDR-International included the following components;1.	100 Ponds project - 100 x 1 urban acupunctureThis project is focussing on protecting 100 ponds within the existing build area of the city in order to preserve (and further increase) there water storage capacity and function. The proposal envisions to go back to the future and again make the ponds a characteristic of the Khulna city.2.	Moyur river - big differenceThe aim for this concept is to protect Moyur river as a water storage. By using khals to direct rainwater towards Moyur river, it can function as a water reservoir. The goal is to protect the river from encroachment by assigning the function of linear park that runs across the city. This adds ecological, recreational and social value to the city.Based on different edge conditions of river, design principles are developed to meet these goals.3.	Multi-level city - step by step resilienceThe agriculture land in the west in case of urban growth gets sprawled. In order to provide sufficient water storage space for extreme events and work towards an inclusive city the proposal is to apply different types of building regulations. As inthe old town here the roof water storage and the water-plot ratio should apply for individual developments. In addition to this, project developments that include morethen one building should make an integral plan for a multi-level city. By developing new projects in a way that it can always store its own rainwater:&#x2013;&#x2013;25% storage area for frequent events (stored in gardens and public spaces)&#x2013;&#x2013;40% for extreme events (stored in parking garages, agriculture lands and gardens)By implementing such building regulation the run-off is mitigated preventing large investments in the future for drainage We envision an important role for business people &amp; project developers in and around Khulna; in developing a public-private partnership (ppp) pilot case.Local partners included: Defacto Architecture &amp; Urbanism, DevConsultants, Nelen &amp; Schuurmans, Khulna University, Wageniingen University and Research, Royal HaskoningDHV.</narrative>
