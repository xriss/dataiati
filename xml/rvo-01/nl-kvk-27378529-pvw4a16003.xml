   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Mid term review of Plataforma Mozambicana de &#xC1;gua (PLAMA)</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In 2013 the Plataforma Mozambicana de &#xC1;gua (PLAMA) was established to promote cooperation between public organizations, private firms and NGOs within the Mozambican water sector. The platform is a result of an MOU which had been signed between the Mozambican Government and the Netherlands in 2011 to work towards a public private water network organization in MozambiqueThe objectives of the mid-term review of PLAMA are twofold: 1) to verify the platform&#x2019;s efficiency and effectiveness; and 2) to provide clear recommendations regarding the future of PLAMA.The midterm review should cover both institutional issues (set-up, funding structure, capacity and staffing) and lessons learned from development of other international practices of cluster organizations.This assignment must result in the following deliverables:&#x2022;	Inception report with work plan (and list of interview or survey partners and questionnaires to be used); &#x2022;	Concise report on finding, conclusions and recommendations for the future of PLAMA&#x2022;	Presentations of key findings and recommendations to the Netherlands Embassy in Maputo and the PLAMA board;What are the results of the project?Observations:The activities for the 1st three years were valid and have been achieved but incomplete despite efforts made, e.g. the publication of tenders, creation of a Directory, a MoU signed with the programme ViaWater to fund innovation and publicity of PLAMA in the media. According to the members, the activity with more impact was the December 2015 conference.he majority of the milestones for the 1st year and output for the three years were partially achieved and members consider it insufficient to mobilize their interest until now.The current tools at the service of PLAMA are not being used and their effectiveness is inexistent.The initial funding plan was adequate, but the expectation to bring more contribution from membership fees and external sources of funding to pay services by PLAMA were too optimistic and failed due to the main activity of the organization over the 1st three years being oriented towards its internal organizational services with limited capacity to serve the members and respond to their interests.Recommendations:It will be important to define a Vision or global goal with the following purposes: i) to clear indicate the main driver of the organization; ii) to avoid any misperception of its role; iii) to be fully accepted and endorsed by the Government.The Consultant&#x2019;s recommendation is to turn PLAMA into an autonomous legal entity with a fully dedicated independent Executive Director with leading capacity and contracted out on the basis of a performance-based contract with support staff. The President of the Board should have the capacity to advocate PLAMA&#x2019;s output and influence the external partners, namely the Government and donor community. Project financing model should be reviewed. Creation of regional branches could also be considered. A new working process should be adopted based on different output serving the immediate interest of a majority of membersThis project is conducted in cooperation with:  Andr&#xE9; Alfredo Zaqueu, Plataforma Mozambicana de &#xC1;gua (PLAMA)</narrative>
