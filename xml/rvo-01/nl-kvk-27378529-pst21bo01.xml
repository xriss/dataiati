   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The government of the Netherlands has prioritized Climate change as main national policy for development and cooperation, in particular in developing countries. The Ministry of Hydrocarbons and Energy of Bolivia (MHE) https://www.mhe.gob.bo/ is planning to develop a biofuel plant for producing annually 450,000 tons of hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO).The project addresses the potential agro-energy trade-offs of the a large biodiesel (HVO: Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil) plant that is being planned in Santa Cruz and the options for setting up a sustainable feedstock supply; focusing on the mitigation of negative impacts on the local agri-food producers. Besides, the project identifies opportunities for bilateral collaboration between Bolivia and the Netherlands for a sustainable development of the biofuels program of Bolivia.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project fits in the priorities of the Dutch embassy in Lima for Bolivia, Climate adaptation and CSR; which are the central themes of the intervention.  

The Netherlands can provide to Bolivia, knowledge transfer, technology an innovative solutions  to tackle the challenges to ensure sustainable biofuel production. The project provides relevant information for bilateral relations and economic diplomacy  between the Netherlands and Bolivia  under the aid and trade policy of the Dutch government, in particular in the Agri&amp; food and energy sectors.

The Dutch embassy is pursuing collaboration with MHE and YPFB on the feasibility of feedstock production in Bolivia (which crop and where it can be best produced). This will involve Dutch knowledge organizations and also private sector partners such as Neste with a stake in HVO production and feedstock supply. 

?	PSD 7e: Increased impact of an existing PSD project. / other RVO programs&#x2026;. 
The project was helpful to strengthen the position of the Netherlands in the field of biofuel production in Bolivia. In doing so, the project complements various EU, BuZa funded and other funded projects that are currently being implemented by WUR in this field.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project identifies concrete opportunities for bilateral cooperation between Bolivia and the Netherlands for the sustainable development of the biofuel chain and for alternative energy solutions involving public and private actors. This includes knowledge, innovation, technology transfer and business opportunities for Dutch private sector. 
- The one page makes concrete recommendations for the Dutch embassy in Lima for engagement with Bolivia on biofuels.
- In addition, a two pager was prepared for MHE with concrete recommendations towards a sustainable feedstock supply. These deliverable provide opportunities for further cooperation between the Dutch embassy in Lima, reposnible for Blolivia, with MHE and YPFB.


The findings of the project were communicated to key local audience in the Biofuel forum that was organized by the Ministry of Hydrocarbons and Energy of Bolivia.  
The final report and complementary materials were delivered and a final presentation was made for the Dutch embassy in Lima. The embassy, at this stage, decided not to have a broader communication to manage expectations of the Bolivian stakeholders, considering that Peru and Bolivia are no longer eligible for the PSD toolkit program.</narrative>
