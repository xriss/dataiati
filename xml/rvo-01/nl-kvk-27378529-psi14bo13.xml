   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Tarwi based products in Bolivia: a market opportunity</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Tarwi is a very nutritious legume produced on altitudes between 2,000 and 4,000 m in Bolivia. Tarwi has specific characteristics like tolerance to low temperatures and dry weather, while it has the capability to contribute nitrogen to the soil and to improve the soil structure. The Tarwi consumption is still limited in Bolivia as the product and its qualities are relatively unknown. The project will improve the production, industrial processing and commercialisation of Tarwi. The production will be improved by giving technical support to 170 small scale farmers in the northern region of La Paz with a total acreage of 85 ha and an expected yield of 77 tons. The remaining 82 tons of Tarwi needed for processing and export in the framework of the project, will be purchased from Tarwi production areas of Carabuco and Lake Titicaca. The processing will be done in Cochabamba. The project will produce 32 tons fresh bitterless Tarwi, 14 tons processed Tarwi and 90 tons dried Tarwi for export to Ecuador. The applicant from Ecuador, Corporaci&#xF3;n CASA - CORPOCAS, is established in 2006 and dedicated to the industrial processing of Tarwi. The local partner, Marconi Industries, is established in 2006 with main activities in the food sector. The third partner, Proinpa Foundation is a Bolivian organisation established in 1990 and dedicated to research and technology transfer in agriculture. The partners will establish a joint venture. The project will enlarge the consumption of the very nutritious Tarwi among the Bolivian population.Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)The farmers will be well informed about the pricing strategy and the market prices so they can make informed choices. During the trainings they will also be informed about the production and processing requirements. It is expected that from the total number of farmers working in the project, at least 30% will be women. CSR will be also present in the shared risk strategy that will define the Tarwi production within the project since the farmers will be trained, helped with the provision of inputs and technical assistance and their harvest will be totally purchased by the project at an mutually agreed price; while the project get in return a good product to attend the demand.Ethical commercial practices will be carried out all the time in order to strengthen the relationship with the clients. Honest and just labour practices will be a characteristic of the business within the reach of all the members of the joint venture. Besides policies regarding gender equality, non-discrimination, non-child labour, equal opportunities, health and environment will be a constant during the execution of the project.Regarding the Tarwi processing, the first local partner count with an environmental functioning record and with the correspondent sanitary certification number for each one of its products. All the social security normative regarding its workers is fulfilled and follows all the IBNORCA (Bolivian Institute of Normalization and Quality) rules regarding industrial safety (facilities design, signalling, working clothes, safety equipments, hygiene, etc). The first local partner has the production policy using clean and environmentally friendly technologies, using recycled materials and the strictly necessary food preservatives in the lower doses allowed by international normative. It still is a small company so all the inputs come from the local market and the used materials are biodegradable, recycled or returnable.Impact&#x2022;	Employment and working conditionsIt is intended to contract 5 full-time strategic employees in specific areas (administration, production and marketing), medium and high skilled level.10 high skilled consultants will be contracted to provide training in specific required topics as basic part-time or eventual workers will be contracted for seasonal peaks of production.2 skilled technicians will be contracted to give technical support at the different regions and training leader producers that could replicate the training in their communities.15 medium skilled leaders will be contracted and trained on different regions about Tarwi ecological production in order to make diffusion and reach producers.The project is meant to reach about 170 direct producers, which will indirectly transfer knowledge to others. Every employee, full or partial time, will always receive some kind of training that will strengthen his/her position on the labour market.The salary for skilled labourers will be at least 25 % above of minimum wages. For basic level the salary will be over the minimum.All the contracts with social benefits. A non-discrimination policy will be applied. The working conditions will be under the CSR policy of the company.&#x2022;	Innovation / Transfer of knowledge- Technological innovations: support production process at farm level.- Commercial innovation: the market is not yet completely developed.- Institutional innovation: To incorporate the importance of Tarwi consumption.&#x2022;	Chain effectsImpact on local suppliersThe project will use local suppliers (when possible), increasing the inputs as much as the sales increase in the market. Quality controls at the plant will demand quality raw materials. The suppliers will improve their logistics since the production plant will have a strict delivery schedule. The project will transmit its commitment for CSR to its suppliers.Farmers will experience improved soil quality, healthy production methods, lower costs on inputs, increased yield and a better market conditions. More yields at righteous prices will generate more income for the farmer families.Impact on local customers or consumersFarmer families and the Bolivian population will be encouraged to include Tarwi in their diet. According to its nutrition values, the whole family can benefit for its high protein content. Consumers of sustainable products will benefit directly from the project by purchasing Tarwi healthy products.&#x2022;	Impact on the sectorThe projects initiative is aiming to involve NGOs, association of producers, local political institutions like municipalities and through them, not only massive diffusion can be reached, but also political incidence and public policies for the sector can be made. As the project aims to penetrate different geographical areas directly and indirectly local job opportunities will be created. The project is meant to outsource in certain levels like diffusion and marketing. The project can also create interest in the private sector encouraging local people to see small business opportunities.As one important part of the project is technical assistance, agreements with medical institutions, gastronomic organisations, and others, will be explored in order to launch Tarwi in the different scenarios, improving the sector altogether.&#x2022;	EnvironmentTarwi ecological production will contribute to lowering contamination factors caused by the use of agrochemicals. Additionally, Tarwi will improve nutrient content of the soil contributing to the conservation of the country&#x2019;s biggest asset: land.&#x2022;	Position of womenThere will be 50% women workforce. The project favours women and men equally in positions within management, administration, production, distribution and marketing. Women will be encouraged to apply for positions within all the above-mentioned areas.&#x2022;	Impact on food safetyThe project will incorporate Tarwi in the diet of the Bolivian population, contributing also to soil conservation, sustainable production systems. Tarwi farmers will experience better soil quality, healthy production methods, lower use of agrochemicals, increased yield and better income. Additionally, consumers will obtain an alternative way to consume proteins with local products. Therefore, the project will contribute to food security.&#x2022;	Impact on waterThe project will contribute to water conservation by reusing it on the Tarwi bitterness elimination process.</narrative>
