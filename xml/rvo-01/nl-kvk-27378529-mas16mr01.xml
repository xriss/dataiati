   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Morocco faces huge challenges in its important horticulture sector (low-investment in greenhouses, unskilled labour, poor reliability and quality of produce, increasing scarcity and price of inputs (water, fertilizers, electricity). Morocco and The Netherlands decided to join forces on making Morocco&#x2019;s horticulture more sustainable and to do through setting up a Centre d&#x2019; Excellence Horticole. The main goal is to strengthen the relationship between Morocco and the Netherlands in the field of research and higher education, as well as to strengthen Moroccan capacity in covered horticulture techniques and technology while in the meantime creating business opportunities for Dutch companies in horticulture technology.The Centre of Excellence for Horticulture will act as main research and education arena and will house research and educational facilities for research and education staff of the Centre, PHD Students doing research, students following education and performing BSC and MSC level research all in sustainable horticulture as well research assistants, greenhouse workers and the Centre&#x2019;s administrative and finance support staff. The Centre of Excellence will have a strong outreach to the private sector. Through demonstrations of new techniques and technology to the private sector (farm managers and workforce) innovation and new knowledge in horticulture will be disseminated and introduced at the level of local growers. Furthermore, the private Moroccan sector will take place in the board of the Centre of Excellence and will have a voice in setting the research project agenda. On the longer term, there is a link with the private sector through students who are acquainted with the latest techniques and technology in horticulture. Through its direct links with the private (production) sector, CEH will add to the improvement of productivity and product quality and will stimulate sustainable production methods in Moroccan greenhouses in order to lessen the pressure on the environment and to meet the needs and requirements of the EU-market. By testing and demonstrating new technologies and transferring the results to different stakeholders, the centre can help the Moroccan growers to strengthen their competitiveness. A centre of excellence for horticulture would furthermore prove to the policy makers the added value of investing in certain new and sustainable technologies in the horticulture sector and the necessity to stimulate investment in such a transition through government funds. After two years, this will have led to the following results:&#x2022;	A greenhouse which has been built in accordance with the jointly developed scientific program for the Centre of Excellence.&#x2022;	A joint Moroccan Dutch 2 year research programme in which CEH is instrumental.&#x2022;	5 joint research projects of which the results have been actively disseminated within the Dutch and Moroccan horticulture sector.&#x2022;	Appr 50 Moroccan students and PhD students will have been educated and done research in the greenhouse through the CEH &#x2022;	Moroccan researchers will have access to CEH and its facilities.&#x2022;	Appr 500 Moroccan farmers and professionals in horticulture will have attended to trainings and demonstrations at the CEH, in which the greenhouse will be instrumental.&#x2022;	Approximately 40 business leads for Dutch companies.</narrative>
