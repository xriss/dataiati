   <narrative xml:lang="EN">&#x2022;	Short general project overviewThe proposed pilot project concerns the first practical application of the Toolset for Rapid Integrated Collaborative Optioneering (TRICO), developed by the partners Haskoning DHV Nederland B.V., Deltares, Nelen &amp; Schuurmans and TU Delft as a &apos;Dutch Approach&apos; for a recent innovation competition. The pilot project concerns the development of water-safe area development options in Wisbech (Cambridgeshire, United Kingdom), as part of the Wisbech 2020 (wisbech2020vision.co.uk initiative).The TRICO approach consists of three components:1. Integral design method;2. Process &amp; tool for stakeholder collaboration (MapTable, maptable.nl/) and;3. Advanced calculation model (3Di, 3di.nu, see brochure in the Annex).The focus is interactive sessions with stakeholders, around a &apos;MapTable&apos; and supported by the advanced water movement model 3Di and other tools, in which stakeholders interactively develop options and test how these options contribute to the ambitions of the various parties.The pilot project concerns the practical elaboration and application of the TRICO approach. In preparation for the integrated design sessions with the MapTable, the local question is first identified with the stakeholders, and what aspects should be shown in the MapTable. On this basis, intervention effect models are developed and a facilitation plan is drawn up. In the MapTable sessions, stakeholders can suggest solution directions on the touch screen, for weir, water drainage and storage and layout of the area. The software calculates and shows on the spot the effect of these solutions for aspects such as individual risk or economic risk, but also for side effects for recreation or nature development.&#x2022;	Initial activities and results of the projectThe results of the project are substantive (calculated options and outcomes), process-based (stakeholder position) but also an evaluation of the innovative TRICO approach. Users see the innovative Dutch approach as an important &apos;selling point&apos; in negotiations with ministries on the plans for Wisbech. With regard to the TRICO approach:- A detailed and tested process plan.- A working Toolset, in which a foundation has been laid for a sustainable technical design and employability for other projects.- A practical test case that can be presented broadly.- An evaluation of the TRICO approach by partners and participants, with concrete recommendations for further application in the United Kingdom.With regard to Wisbech 2020:- Broad-based, integrated and sustainable solutions for the design, water management and flood defences for the master plan of the new housing site in Wisbech.- Coming into view of other solutions that had no chance of success in the &quot;traditional approach&quot;.- Increased chance of a permit for sustainable construction in this flood zone, essential for the development of Wisbech.- Improved collaboration between stakeholders as a result of better understanding of priorities and interests and successful and attractive design sessions&quot;.&#x2022;	What makes the technology, product, method or approach used innovativeThe Netherlands has unique expertise on all three elements of the approach (integral design, tools for stakeholder engagement, advanced modelling), driven by the Dutch need to properly regulate water safety.The MapTable has previously been applied in Mexico and 3DI also as far as applying the model but not previously according to this proposed approach.</narrative>
