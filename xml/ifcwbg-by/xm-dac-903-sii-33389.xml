   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Benefits to consumers: By enhancing its retail chain, the Group will be able to provide access to a more diverse selection of high-quality, affordable products than most Belarusian consumers currently have access to. Stronger bargaining positions vis-a-vis suppliers, economies of scale achieved through geographical expansion, as well as improved inventory management, will allow for cost savings, which eventually can be passed on to the end customer;    Supply chain development: The Group&apos;&apos;s expansion will (i) increase the number of its local suppliers, (ii) provide additional sales channels for local producers and importers, as well as (iii) contribute to improvements in efficiency and operating standards throughout the supply chain.    Employment generation: The Project will provide additional direct employment for approximately 2,500 people 80% of whom are expected to be women. Five of the Project stores will be greenfield construction projects, so temporary jobs will be created during the construction phase. In addition, indirect employment will be created in the retail value chain.    Best practice transfer: The Project is expected to facilitate the transfer of modern retail techniques to Belarusian regions and to enhance the efficiency of the supply chain in the country. The Project will also create a standard for employee training and development across the country.    Demonstration effect: The Project will have a demonstration effect by encouraging other companies in the region, as well as Western investors, to pursue investment opportunities in Belarus as the country tries to improve its business climate and facilitate greater inflows of foreign direct investment. In addition, the Project will have a demonstration effect for private sector activity in general by showing the capacity of a private sector company to meet effectively and professionally the needs of the population in a predominantly state-dominated economy.</narrative>

Stronger bargaining positions vis-a-vis suppliers, economies of scale achieved through geographical expansion, as well as improved inventory management, will allow for cost savings, which eventually can be passed on to the end customer;    Supply chain development: The Group&apos;&apos;s expansion will (i) increase the number of its local suppliers, (ii) provide additional sales channels for local producers and importers, as well as (iii) contribute to improvements in efficiency and operating standards throughout the supply chain.    Employment generation: The Project will provide additional direct employment for approximately 2,500 people 80% of whom are expected to be women. Five of the Project stores will be greenfield construction projects, so temporary jobs will be created during the construction phase. In addition, indirect employment will be created in the retail value chain.    Best practice transfer: The Project is expected to facilitate the transfer of modern retail techniques to Belarusian regions and to enhance the efficiency of the supply chain in the country. The Project will also create a standard for employee training and development across the country.    Demonstration effect: The Project will have a demonstration effect by encouraging other companies in the region, as well as Western investors, to pursue investment opportunities in Belarus as the country tries to improve its business climate and facilitate greater inflows of foreign direct investment. In addition, the Project will have a demonstration effect for private sector activity in general by showing the capacity of a private sector company to meet effectively and professionally the needs of the population in a predominantly state-dominated economy.</narrative>
