   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Overall objective is to facilitate Serbia&#x2019;s justice sector EU integration, establish a justice sector performance framework and strengthen aid coordination in Serbia&#x2019;s justice sector, by providing focused short-term support to the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) to strengthen its capacity and complete key judicial modernization analyses and actions. It supports three key development challenges for Serbia&#x2019;s justice sector: strengthening judicial and prosecutorial independence, accountability and efficiency.
Outcome objective 1: Improved access to justice in Serbia through more concentrated, transparent and effective legal aid programmes available to all citizens, including women, minorities and vulnerable groups in all regions. Outcome objective 2: Decisions on ICT investments in the Serbian judiciary are made strategically to maximise the effectiveness and efficiency gains and reduce the overall investment costs.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Multi-Donor Trust Fund (MDTF) for Justice Sector Support was first established in 2008 to provide support to the justice sector of the Republic of Serbia, in order to assist its EU integration. Originally envisaged as a flexible instrument, MDTF has gone through several changes and reconfigurations, following the changes in the context and the dynamic of the integration process. It has been extended twice, in 2015 and in December 2018.&#xA0;
Sida has been supporting the MDTF since 2009. The main focus of Swedish support was originally on establishing a system for free legal aid. However, circumstances of the reform process dominated by the requirements of the EU accession negotiations and the dynamic between the key stakeholders in the field were not conducive enough to a meaningful effort in this area. Sweden has therefore adopted a flexible approach in the three years preceeding this decision and allowed for a shift into areas where changes can be achieved. The extension was also recommended by a Mid-Term Review of the MDTF that was done in the beginning of 2018, which suggested an increased focus on the separation of powers between the branches of government, the independence and accountability of the judiciary, equality under the law and equal access to justice to all citizens.
The idea with the extension was to focus on aspects related to two prioritized areas:1) quality, integrity and independence of the judicial system and 2) transparency and access to justice. It has been built around citizen-centered approach focusing on both the supply and the demand side of the justice system, in order to bridge the gap between the citizens and the business sector as users of the judicial system and the justice system itself.
2019 was thus a year of transition for the MDTF, a chance for stock-taking and reflecting on the way forward with the key stakeholders. The potential of the MDTF as a powerful instrument possessing the necessary leverage to act in critical areas with a variety of stakeholders has not been fully explored and utilized. Throughout the years, its range of action remained confined to technical assistance without meaningful excursions into policy dialogue, which is rather limiting for a task of such complexity as reforming a justice sector. Therefore, a major change in approach was adopted to combine development assistance with high-level policy dialogue, in order to create a more solid basis for the change process. Dialogue is expected to assist clarity among the key stakeholders and help identify the key issues of focus for technical assistance and reform in general.
The World Bank notes that most of the activities implemented during 2019 come from the results framework established for the period 2016-2018 and not the one developed for the latest extension which covers the period 2019-2022. While this does not seem to be a plausible explanation for the lack of progress against an established results framework for a given period, it is also true that the MDTF has existed for a while with several strands of action, which had to be finalized in one way or another. The key issue would be striking the right balance between the &quot;old&quot; and the &quot;new&quot; activities and this is a challenging dialogue with the World Bank.
Therefore, the Annual Report for 2019 focuses on activities from the 2016-2018 results framework and what follows are the main results that have been reported:
- The World Bank has provided advisory assistance to support the development, implementation and monitoring of national strategies and action plans;
- The first high-level policy dialogue meeting was held between the Minister of Justice and the ambassadors of the three MDTF donors (Sweden, UK, the Netherlands);
- In order to improve the transparency of the prosecutors&apos; offices, the MDTF has supported the development of websites for all 87 basic, appelate and higher court Public Prosecutors&apos; Offices in Serbia and initiated the development of the Multi-Site System for all Public Prosecutors&apos; Offices, to ensure a unified approach and regular content updates;
- Technical assistance has raised awareness about issues and informed policy and decision-making. The MDTF has delivered a range of analyses and comparative studies to provide in-depth knowledge of key challenges and reform opportunities and recommendations for improvement;
- A Functional Review of the Prosecution System in Serbia has been prepared, as the most comprehensive examination to date of the functioning of the Serbian prosecutorial system, including the recommendations for improvement. The purpose of the Functional Review is to present an objective baseline of the prosecution&apos;s current performance, including assessments of progress made towards goals documented in Serbia&#x2019;s Action Plan for the Implementation of the National Judicial Reform Strategy (NJRS) for the period 2013-2018 and Action plan for Chapter 23, which focused on the transfer of competences for the prosecutorial system from the Ministry of Justice to the State Prosecutorial Council (SPC) and the improvement of the capacities of the SPC.&#xA0;The Functional Review of the Prosecution System also provides recommendations for Serbia&apos;s NJRS for the period 2019-2024 and its accompanying Action Plan.&#xA0;The 2019 EU Progress Report and the November 2019 and June 2020 Non-Paper for Chapters 23 and 24 include references to the findings and recommendations of the Functional Review of the Prosecution System;
-&#xA0;The MDTF is working on finalizing the new Judicial Functional Review.&#xA0;The purpose of the updated Judicial Functional Review is to provide a comprehensive assessment of the functioning of the justice system in terms of efficiency of justice, quality of justice and access to justice vis-&#xE0;-vis EU benchmarks as of 2019 and measure progress against the 2014 Judicial Functional Review. The Review will also provide an objective and data rich assessment of the impact of the implementation of the Action Plan for Chapter 23 and provide the basis for amendments to the Action Plan. The data collection has taken longer than anticipated due to the data fragmentation and poor quality of data;
-&#xA0;A significant amount of research and diagnostic work was undertaken in 2019 resulting in a draft report titled &quot;Small Claims: Where Does Serbia Stand? A Comparative Analysis&#x201D;. The findings of the report have been publicized at an event gathering the key stakeholders. This analysis is important from the efficiency perspective. One of the key findings is that small claims fees are high relative to GDP, whereas the range of cases that are affected by the small claims procedure is very broad. The court fee structure is very vague and convoluted. There are ideas to address some of these findings in the coming period following donors&apos; approval;
-&#xA0;The MDTF provided partial financing for the Regional Business Climate Survey of 2800 companies across eight countries in South East Europe, analysing how the justice system impacts the business climate in each country and identifying common justice sector challenges faced by the companies in these countries. Key findings and recommendations were presented in a report which was published by the World Bank;
- Capacity of key personnel has been strengthened through knowledge transfer, most notably through the following activities:
-&#xA0;The MDTF continued to provide support to the Supreme Court of Cassation&apos;s (SCC) annual Courts Rewards Program, the aim of which is to encourage courts to be more efficient, innovative, and creative;
- The Annual Judges Conference has been organized, gathering more than 1,400 judges from all courts in Serbia and independent judicial professionals, such as public notaries, enforcement agents and attorneys. The conference agenda focused on recent developments and issues in court practice, the legal framework and the exchange of best practices;
-&#xA0;The MDTF continued to work closely with the International Finance Corporation (IFC) to support commercial courts, through the implementation of capacity building and awareness raising activities, such as periodic counseling of commercial judges and organizing conferences. In September 2019, the World Bank and IFC teams jointly supported the 27th Commercial Courts&apos; Judges Conference, which was attended by 229 participants. The WB and IFC teams also jointly supported the 9th Annual Conference for the Bankruptcy Supervision Agency, which gathered 219 participants. The conferences gathered relevant stakeholders from the judiciary, state agencies and the private sector and provided a platform to discuss relevant issues, such as the legal effects of a transfer of mortgaged real estate in a bankruptcy procedure and international commercial arbitration.</narrative>
