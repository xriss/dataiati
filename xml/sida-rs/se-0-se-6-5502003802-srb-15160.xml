    <narrative xml:lang="EN">CRD reports success under the three outcomes.
Under Outcome #1&#xA0;CRD reports that&#xA0;the legal&#xA0;aid was predominately provided to members of minority and disadvantaged groups as well as groups facing greater pressure due to their professions (such as journalists at both the local and national levels). Also, the partners were able to inform citizens about highly relevant topics which are not present in mainstream media (such as position of vulnerable groups, high-level corruption of centres of political power, deterioration of human rights and etc.). In Outcome #2 CRD reports that&#xA0;the partners&#xA0;worked for&#xA0;improved&#xA0;legislative framework for the protection of human rights as well as to monitor the implementation of the existing legislation. Finally, under Outcome #3&#xA0;CRD reports empowering human rights defenders in terms of developing their organizational capacities. Results achieved in strengthening local human rights defenders have been particularly visible with regard to improvements to partners&#x2019; skills and their international recognition.
Some reported examples:
In the 2016 and 2017, the Network of Committees for Human Rights in Serbia (CHRIS) provided legal aid to 2180 people. CHRIS&#x2019;s programme has provided free legal aid for residents of smaller municipalities in Serbia, often members of minority or socially disadvantaged groups such as the Roma, people with disabilities, members of other ethnic minorities (Bosniaks, Albanians, and Vlachs), and asylum-seekers. The proportion of men and women to whom the legal aid was provided is almost equal (52.6% men and 47.4% women). Majority of legal aid seekers were unemployed (52.2%). Field presence and devoted work of the CHRIS Network resulted in big number of beneficiaries who have already been in some kind of contact with the CHRIS Network and familiar with their programme (total 1098 beneficiaries).
From the period from January 2016- until May 2018 Local Press monitored the process of implementation of relevant media legislation, related to media funding, on the local level.
Crime and Corruption Reporting Network (KRIK) contributed to raising public awareness on the key high-level corruption cases. For the last three years KRIK has published 25 investigative stories on crime and corruption of centres of political power. These investigative stories have managed to uncover misuse of public institutions, illegal business, hidden property and corruption of Serbian politicians and their connections to criminal groups. In 2018 KRIK investigated and revealed 8 cases of serious misuse of public institutions and crime and corruption deals of Serbian high officials. Because of these stories several state institutions have launched their own actions and investigations. KRIK&#x2019;s readership has increased significantly during our cooperation. In 2018 KRIK website had more than 6.5 million visitors and over 14 million pageviews. Also, in 2018 KRIK investigative stories were republished and mentioned more than 830 times in national and international media.
Moreover,&#xA0;the programme&#xA0;supported KRIK in establishing two databases with information that contributed to the transparency of the activities of politicians, public officials and institutions. Database of Assets of Serbian Politicians contains detailed information on property cards of Serbian politicians and represents a significant contribution to the transparency of their activities and connections to the private capital. KRIK received a Global Data Award for this database. In 2018 KRIK team has done three major updates of online Database of Assets of Serbian politicians &#x2013; exposing assets and business connections of Heads of the Serbian Parliament, the property of candidates at Belgrade&#x2019;s 2018 mayoral elections and starting of investigation of local politicians.
During 2018, Independent Journalists&#x2019; Association of Serbia (IJAS) developed an advocacy strategy that aims to amend the Law on Public Information and the Media and the Rulebook in a way that process of project co-financing of public interest in the media is realized in a clear, responsible, transparent and non-discriminatory manner, with the continued participation of civil society. The proposed changes have already been piloted in 6 local self-government units as a matter of good practice. Until the end of 2018, Novi Pazar and Pirot have announced public calls for proposals according to IJAS proposed Rulebook and strategy.
In the course of programme implementation CRD team has organized annual Rule of Law Forum. The Forum is intended to identify key obstacles in the implementation of jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) and promote regional co-operation in overcoming these issues. The forum brought together legal professionals from Albania, BiH, Croatia, Kosovo, Macedonia, Montenegro, and Serbia, judges of the ECtHR, local human rights organisations and other legal experts. The forum included regionally-focused plenary discussions on the latest developments to ECtHR case law and discussions with national judges about the enforcement of the Court&#x2019;s rulings in each individual country. Moreover, Forum is serving as a unique networking event, where participants, as legal professionals could share and learn from each other&#x2019;s experiences. In, 2018 Forum gathered more than 150 participants.
CRD assesses&#xA0;that the programme implementation was successful, even though in this period, circumstances for the work of CRD and our partners were extremely challenging due to&#xA0;the still problematic&#xA0;human rights situation in the country and at the same time some of the donors are leaving the country therefore affecting the sustainability of human rights organizations. Also, during the programme period some of human rights defenders have left their work or even the country as a result of smear campaigns, threats and physical assaults and complete lacking of reaction from competent authorities.</narrative>
