    <narrative xml:lang="EN">The outbreak of COVID-19, has put challenges in terms of keeping the project follow-up as during rather long period of ime&#xA0;no &apos;in person&apos; meetings&apos; were possible. In addition to this, many project activities were moved to digital platforms - on-line workshops and trainings with beneficiaries where Sida&#xA0;did not participate - compared to the normal period when Sida&#xA0;representatives would&#xA0;take part in selected project events with possibility&#xA0;to have direct contact with beneficiaries, other stakeholders and donors active in the area. These broad contacts and networks&#xA0;were very important for follow-up and monitoring of the project. It is important to note that during 2020, follow-up activities were mostly done through meetings (in person and on-line) with UNDP&apos;s&#xA0;project manager and component managers, review of the documentation (including reports) and information provided on line and in media (related to activities of key project beneficiaries - participating Serbian institutions).&#xA0;
In 2020, the project was progressing in most of the terms in line with the original activity plan. Some delays have occurred in spring 2020 due to the emergence of the COVID 19 crisis which affected mostly events planned to be organised during that time (conferences, workshops). Some of the events were switched to digital platforms (when and where possible), while others were postponed for the period after all restrictions and emergency measures are canceled.
Key achievements&#xA0;of the project could be summarized in the following way (per project components/beneficiary institutions):
Taxation - Tax Administration / Tax Police Capacities
Serbian Tax Police became acquainted with updated IT solutions for data collection, structuring and analytics which were proven beneficial for strong enforcement of tax policies through a newly established cooperation with the Italian Financial Police (Guardia di Finanza). A new analytical software solution for the Serbian Tax Police is currently under preparation, along with the ongoing development of the Smart mobile application &#x201C;Tax Alarm&#x201D; and SMS Notification Service for taxpayers (entrepreneurs).
Serbian Tax Administration (STA) also instigated collaboration with the Swedish Tax Administration (Skatteverket), which is an early stage and currently focused mainly on exchange of best practices. This and other similar activities have set the re-envisioning of the future concept of the STA in motion.&#xA0; Additionally, assistance has been provided to the STA&#x2019;s transformation process and implementation of structural changes through conducting surveys on employee satisfaction and preparing a Gap Analysis with recommendations for further improvements in the aspects required. &#xA0;
Retention of Internal Auditors and Public Procurement Officers
A report on the comparative analysis of retention policies for Certified Internal Auditors in the public sector was developed based on best practice examples provided from Croatia, the Czech Republic and Ireland, and recommendations for the improvement of their status in Serbia were provided on its basis.&#xA0;
Similarly, a comparative analysis report on the professional development, conditions and retention policies for Certified Public Procurement Officers &#xA0;was produced based on the best practices of France, Malta, Italy, Romania, Bulgaria, Germany, Finland /examples of the status of the profession of PPOs;&#xA0; and of Croatia, Hungary, Austria, Ireland /examples of practice of certification schemes for PPOs.&#xA0; This report served as basis for the preparation of adjustments in the relevant legislature related to certification of Public Procurement Officers and their qualifications.
Public Procurement System
Key achievements were noted through the further promotion of the Most Economically Advantageous Tender (MEAT) criteria:&#xA0; A tailored workshop for contracting authorities was held in Vrdnik, and bidding model documents were developed for the procurement of computer equipment, property insurance, and passenger vehicles.&#xA0; An analysis of procurement types that could be centralized was conducted in order to facilitate their centralization in the public sector in Serbia and an additional analysis of factors influencing competition was performed in order to devise a set of measures which would stimulate competition in public procurement procedures. &#xA0;
Collaboration and partnership building is being continuously facilitated at the international level through best practice exchange with the EU (including member states).
Transparency in Management of Public Funds at the Local Level - Local Budget Portals
The project continued to empower local self-governments in increasing transparency of local budget planning and utilization in close cooperation with the Standing Conference of Towns and Municipalities. 21 local self-governments were selected for support in the process of budget portals implementation.
Cooperation of Local Self Governments (LSGs) with Civil Society Organizations (CSOs) in implementing measures and activities to contribute to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) at local level
Successful trainings of 20 representatives from &#xA0;LSGs (Bac, Ra&#x161;ka, Valjevo, Vrnjacka Banja and Ni&#x161;) in four out of five modules were completed, thus building on their knowledge on the importance and benefits of cooperation between LSG and CSOs, methodology of transparent financing of CSOs from local budgets and project writing and evaluation.&#xA0;
Additionally, 65 representatives of CSOs took part in both standard and online training and mentoring sessions, which taught them writing thorough, comprehensive and results-oriented projects proposals that reflect the needs of local communities and priorities defined by LSGs in order to contribute to achieving the following SDGs 1: End poverty in all forms, 5: Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls and 10: Reduce inequality within and among countries.
A public call for CSO project proposals was published in five-partner LSG, compliant with the national Regulation for financing and the methodology for transparent financing of CSOs, which resulted in a total of 51 project proposals received.
External Audit
The project contributed to fostering collaboration at the international level and active participation of the State Audit Institution (SAI) representatives at tailored workshops on best external audit practices (IntoSAINT trainings, SAI SPMR, IT Audit, IDEA software training, Microsoft trainings, GDPR event Cyprus). In furtherance of the Audit Management System development, the technical specification and tender documentation was finalized and accepted by the SAI AMS working group.&#xA0; The tendering process was completed, vendor for software development selected and the contract for software development was signed.&#xA0; &#xA0;
Media and CSOs equipped to monitor and report on corruption and misuse of public funds
Young journalists were invited to take part in the initial training on public finance management through and open call. The training was completed and 21 journalists attained basic knowledge on public finance management.</narrative>
