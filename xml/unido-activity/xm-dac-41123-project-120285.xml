  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">As requested by the Government of Uzbekistan, UNIDO will organize a needs assessment mission to Tashkent to meet with government and research counterpart institutions, and provide substantive contribution (presentation of UNIDO BIT programme and tools) to the workshop entitled &quot;Towards business modernization in Uzbekistan: challenges and opportunities&quot; to be organized on 4-6 April 2012 together with the Ministry for Foreign Economic Relations, Investments and Trade of Uzbekistan (please refer to the enclosed communication with the Ministry and workshop programme)..

The objective and rational of the needs assessment mission is to develop technical cooperation assistance for the country, where UNIDO currently has no ongoing projects, but has to fulfil its commitments to support the Government programmes and contribute to the achievement of national development goals within the UNDAF 2010-2015.

The activity was initiated by the DG during his meeting with the Uzbek Ambassador in April 2011, when the DG committed to support the Government programme in the part of private sector development. The idea was welcomed by the Uzbek Ambassador and the DG was asked by the Uzbek Government to provide his comments on the President&apos;s Address on democratic reforms in the country related to private sector. Europe and NIS Programme prepared the DG&apos;s statement (see enclosed) which says:

&quot;Within this policy framework, UNIDO would be ready to support the Government in the preparation of the long-term action programme on the implementation of economic reforms and business modernization, if such a decision were to be taken. It is envisaged, that UNIDO, will be of assistance to the country under the thematic areas of strengthening national trade capacities and facilitation; improving access to business advisory services; supporting SME development and investment promotion, and promoting industrial energy efficiency and renewable sources of energy. UNIDO will also be of assistance in implementing the harmonization of national legislation and practices with internationally agreed treaties, standards and norms.
UNIDO has already demonstrated its relevance and responsiveness to the Government&#x2019;s priorities through its participation in the preparation of the United Nations Development Assistance Framework (UNDAF) 2010-2015, in cooperation with the Government of Uzbekistan and other United Nations agencies.
Drawing on its rich experience and expertise, UNIDO can work together with the Government in developing a comprehensive and integrated programme of action towards successful market reforms and liberalization of economy.&#x201D;

To follow-up on the given commitment, the Europe and NIS Programme organized a meeting with the Permanent Mission and the BIT branch colleagues to agree on the strategy of UNIDO intervention. It was agreed that the workshop on private sector development would be organized together with the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations, Investments and Trade MFERIT (funding to come from the host institution) in the course of the needs assessment mission. UNIDO has committed to contribute with expertise to the training seminar, focusing on UNIDO Private Sector Development portfolio, which includes industrial clusters, export consortia, enabling business environment issues and other points of interest for the Uzbek side (see attached letters). .</narrative>
