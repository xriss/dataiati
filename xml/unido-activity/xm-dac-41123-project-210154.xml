   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Circular Economy Center of Excellence (CECE) project aims to support the commercialization of circular economy technologies in Ghana. Ghana aims to become a global leader in a just transition to circular economy and has made significant progress in advancing the circular agenda in the area of plastics and plastic waste. To create the necessary legal framework at the national level, the National Plastics Management Policy (NPMP) was developed under the leadership of the Ministry of Environment, Science and Innovation (MESTI). As part of the institutional framework of Ghana&#x2019;s NPMP, a Resource Recovery Secretariat (RRS) will be established under MESTI to support implementation of NPMP, including guidance to the allocation of public resources towards different interventions. The RRS will be responsible and dedicated to the achievement of the Policy&#x2019;s aim and the fulfilment of 17 Strategic Actions to be taken by public entities ranging from Ministries, Agencies to the Parliament, laid down in the Policy&#x2019;s Implementation Plan.

During the PPG phase of the UNIDO GEF-7 project, technologies to dispose of non-recyclable plastics/hard-to recycle plastics/POPs containing plastics in an environmentally sound manner within the country could not be identified. It was proposed in the project that a Center of Excellence be established under the RRS to help identify potential technologies that could be used to address this gap. A list of possible technologies to investigate such as pyrolysis, bacterial decomposition and irradiation were proposed. The Center will receive US $1 million from the GEF TF for its inception activities, however, because the development of the Center is not outlined in the NPMP Implementation Plan, no specific allocation from the Government has yet been set aside to assist with the set-up of the Center.
In consultation with MESTI, the role of the Center also evolved beyond the original intention of addressing hard-to-recycle plastics to include piloting and scaling up technologies for innovation in circular plastics technologies and circular economy in general. Making sure data from these pilots is available would help the Government develop responsive circular economy policies and de-risk paradigm-shifting technology in the circular economy space to crowd in investment in order to bring these technologies to commercialization. The proposed project and the establishment of the CECE with a view of sustainability of its operations would assist the country with capacity building and technical assistance in the area of circular economy technology commercialization.</narrative>
