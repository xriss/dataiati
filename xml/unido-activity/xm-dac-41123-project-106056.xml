   <narrative xml:lang="EN">UNIDO cooperation with ECO commenced with a letter, the Director-General of UNIDO received in January 2007 from H.E. Ambassador Ali Asghar Soltanich, Permanent Mission of the Islamic Republic of Iran to the United Nations and other international Organizations, in Vienna, Austria, informing UNIDO of the decisions of the ECO Ministerial Meeting which took place in Lahore, Pakistan, on 30 November 2006. The ECO ministerial meeting had recommended the strengthening of the SMTQ infrastructure of the ECO Member States in order to enhance trade among them.
As a first step to develop a regional SMTQ-related technical assistance programme for ECO Member States, an Expert Group Meeting was held in Tehran, Islamic Republic of Iran, on 18 &#x2013;19 December 2007 with the aim of assessing the technical assistance needs of the region. A needs survey of ECO Member States was also conducted to provide the material basis for EGM discussions. The EGM was attended to by representatives from National Standardization Bodies and Ministries of Commerce of Member States.
At the end of the EGM, the experts attended urged for initiation of activities relating to strengthening SMTQ infrastructures of Member States, in order to enhance intra-regional trade and to meet the TBT/SPS measures. In so doing, the EGM further proposed UNIDO to conduct a needs assessment study to identify specific needs of individual Member States. At the same time, most of individual Member States emphasized the need for training for upgrading human capacity of testing laboratories.
The ECO is currently preparing for the establishment of a Regional Institute for Standardization, Conformity Assessment, Accreditation and Metrology (RISCAM), in an effort to promote intraregional trade by removing the technical barriers to trade in the region. The major task assigned
to RISCAM is the harmonization of national standards, conformity assessment, and accreditation and metrology practices of ECO Member States. The harmonization requires at least a modest degree of capacity alignment of the SMTQ infrastructure and technical as well as human
resources level. Presently, the capacity gaps among the Member States are not known precisely, as needs assessment study has not been conducted by ECO or any other organisation.
The current project is composed of two activities. First, trainings will be conducted in each Member States (except for Turkey and Pakistan) for three basic areas, as a first step for the alignment of SMTQ-related human capacity of ECO Member States. Second, SMTQ-related needs assessment will be conducted to derive a regional harmonization strategy for ECO. The
project is expected to allow UNIDO to be involved with SMTQ-related activities in ECO region, particularly in establishment of RISCAM, which is to be functional in the near future. For harmonization of SMTQ-related practices under RISCAM, the Member States will need to align their SMTQ capacities at certain level. It is expected that UNIDO will continue to assist and collaborate with ECO/RISCAM in this regard.
The project contributes to the trade-capacity building process of the ECO Member Countries under the regional initiative. Hence, it contributes to Goal 8 of MDG &#x201C;Develop a global partnership for development&#x2019;.</narrative>
