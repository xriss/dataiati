   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Improving industrial capacity for poverty reduction in Chengbu, China</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The representative of the Ministry of Commerce of the People&#x2019;s Republic of China (MOFCOM), Ms. LIANG Hong, DDG of Department of International Economic and Trade Affairs, first proposed this project to the secretariat of UNIDO at the UNIDO IDB in June 2017. In August 2017, Mr. LI Yong, the Director General, further discussed this project with H.E. Mr. ZHONG Shan, minister of MOFCOM at the Trade Minister Meeting of BRICS in Shanghai. Recently, MOFCOM invited UNIDO to join a field trip to Chengbu, the PR China together with UNRC.
1. Poverty reduction status in China
It is one of the basic policies of the Chinese government to innovatively improve its methods in reducing and eradicating poverty, and takes targeted measures to that end. The state has issued a series of development plans and policies regarding industries with local features to provide growth opportunities for impoverished areas. These include the Guiding Opinions on Strengthening Poverty Alleviation Work in the Agricultural Industry and Poverty Alleviation Plan in the Forestry Sector (2013-2020); Poverty Alleviation Through Development Plan of the Agricultural Industry (2011-2020); Measures for Increasing the Income of Industries with Local Features and Development Plan for Economic Forests (2013-2020); and Regional Layout of Agricultural Products with Local Features (2013-2020) .
MOFCOM is determined to make a good example for targeted poverty alleviation. It has actively promoted UN office in China to carry out in-depth study in Ganzhou city, Jiangxi Province and Haidong city, Qinghai Province, designed and carried out poverty alleviation and ability construction projects and provided much support for local poverty alleviation work .
2. General information of Chengbu
Chengbu Miao Autonomous County (Chengbu) is an autonomous county of Miao people in Hunan Province, China. It is under the administration of Shaoyang City. Located on the south western margin of Hunan, Chengbu covers 2,647 km2. Chengbu has 6 towns and 6 townships under its jurisdiction; the county seat is Chengbei Community . As of 2016, Chengbu had a registered population of 267,043 . Approximately 70% of the population of Chengbu is agricultural population . Agriculture is the most important industry in Chengbu. In 2016, agriculture takes approximately 49% of the GDP of Chengbu.
3. Challenges of Chengbu in reducing poverty
Chengbu is a national level poverty-stricken county. As of 2016, there were 34,839 residents in poverty, which takes approximately 13% of the registered population, covering 13 villages and towns under the jurisdiction of Chengbu .
Based on UNIDO&#x2019;s visits to Chengbu from 16 to 18 October, 2017, Chengbu has come a long way in terms of poverty reduction (the incidence of poverty decreased from 20.4% in 2014 to 11.5% in 2016, according to local government statistics). However, what remains to be done to lift the remaining poor out of poverty is to reach the vulnerable groups in particular children and women left behind in the rural villages.
The chanllenges of Chengbu in reducing poverty mainly derives from the following factors :
a. Insufficient agricultural modernization
Chengbu is still in the phase of relying on the traditional agricultural production and selling mode, which cannot adapt to the agricultural development today. For instance, even though Chengbu is close to Hong Kong and Macau, it is highly risky for people in Chengbu to sell the vegetables to Hong Kong and Macau due to the lack of the refrigerated transportation system.
b. Slow industrial development
The enterprises in Chengbu are facing a series of problems including the narrowed developing space, low-level products, poor industrial linkage among the enterprises, the lack of collaboration and slow development of the financing platform. Under such circumstance, although MOFCOM is trying to support the construction of Chengbu Industrial Park, such facilitation is probably not in demand yet.
c. Poor medical and emergency infrastructure
It is common for Chengbu to experience natural disasters including flooding and drought due to its geographical location. When the disasters happen, most of the victims could only wait until the disasters pass rather than to resume the agricultural production because Chengbu does not have a highly-functional emergency system. Further, when a family member is attacked by a disease, it would probably cost the family most of its saving because the medical subsidy in Chengbu is very limited.
d. Poor traffic facilitation
Highway is the only means of transportation in Chengbu. The first expressway of Chengbu was constructed in December 2013, which only passed the villages and towns 30 kilometers away from the county. It takes 5 to 6 hours to arrive at Chengbu from Changsha, the provincial capital of Hunan Province; it takes almost 2 days to arrive at Chengbu from Beijing. As of 2009, 46 villages of Chengbu did not have the highway. Many projects aimed at the poverty alleviation of Chengbu were eventually cancelled because of the poor traffic facilitation.
e. Insufficient education
Most of the residents in poverty in Chengbu did not receive enough education, lacking the ability, the sense of innovation and the confidence to generate much revenue. Due to the poor educational facilities, Chengbu is not able to attract talented teachers, resulting in the lack of teachers.
4. Opportunities of Chengbu in addressing poverty reduction
There is large potential for further industrial development to increase employment opportunities and economic growth. Such potential mainly derives from the following factors:
a. Abundant natural resources of bamboo
Chengbu has abundant natural resources, including land, water, forest, grassland, plants, animals and mineral, which constitute an advantage for Chengbu to develop ecological agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry and dairy industry . Bamboo is one of the most significant natural resources of Chengbu. It is estimated that Chengbu had bamboo forest of over 310,000 mu in 2014 just for the mao bamboo. The local government attached great importance to utilizing the resources of bamboo. In 2010, the head of the Dongtoushan village guided the local farmers to cultivate bamboo fungus .
b. Nanshan Pasture
Nanshan Pasture is 80 kilometers away from the county seat of Chengbu. Its total area is of 152 square kilometers, with an average altitude of 1760 meters . Hunan Nanshan Farming Company Limited, located at Nanshan Pasture, is a modern dairy company with completed manufacturing chain, which allows it to produce liquid milk and powder milk with the raw materials deriving from Nanshan Pasture . Nanshan Pasture has the potential to develop into the biggest production base for the mountain cow&#x2019;s dairy products in South China.
c. Arts and handicrafts with the minority group&#x2019;s culture
The history of Chengbu can be traced back to the Neolithic Age, which was 4000 years ago. Further, there are 24 different ethnic groups living in Chengbu, resulting in multiple ethnic customs in respect of houses, foods, clothes, marriage, funeral, festivals and religion . Such a rich history and diversified ethnic groups structure endow Chengbu with a colourful minority group&#x2019;s culture, which is inherited in Chengbu&#x2019;s unique arts and handicrafts. Among these arts and handicrafts, Miao embroidery is with the most industrialization potential. Miao embroidery is a famous cultural art of the Miao people in Chengbu. The Custom Chart of Chengbu Miao People&#x2019;s Lives, which is a piece of Miao embroidery created by Ms. Wu Qianjin, was even given an offer of RMB1,000,000 .
d. Development of e-commerce
The local government has continuously given great support to local leading e-commerce enterprises. Qing Qian Liu Tea Group, a local company, formulated a completed industrial business mode Company plus Base plus Cooperative plus Peasant, realizing the seasonal monthly income for each farmer from RMB6000 to RMB7500 . As of January 2017, Chengbu has one e-commerce agricultural local products flagship store, 2 local e-commerce platform, 15 e-commerce enterprises, one county-level e-commerce services centre, 3 town-level e-commerce services centres and 155 village-level e-commerce services stations .  It has also established the e-commerce industry business incubator, the e-commerce logistics park and the e-commerce industry base. On 16 August 2017, Chengbu signed five cooperative agreements and multiple mutually beneficial strategic cooperative memorandums with many famous enterprises including Nanjing Yuntian Mall in respect of the e-commerce and industrial development .
