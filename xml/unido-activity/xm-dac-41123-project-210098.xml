   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the critical importance of inclusive and sustainable industrialization in health-related sectors. Health industry development has a key role to play in the global response to the pandemic and its socio-economic repercussions whilst helping to address the persistent burden of insufficient access to essential medicines, vaccines and other medical products including PPEs and diagnostics.

This is well reflected in the expressions of interest and requests that UNIDO has been receiving from an increasing number of Member States, donors and partners with a view to joining forces to strengthen health-related industries.

UNIDO has a long track record of providing advisory and capacity-building services in support of health-related and pharmaceutical industries, including but not limited to the formulation of strategies like the Business Plan for the African Union&#x2019;s Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Plan for Africa (PMPA BP), the development and implementation of tools such as the GMP Roadmap approach or the Pharmaceutical Market Information System, the conduct of country productive capacities&#x2019; assessments, upgrading and operational management support for pharmaceutical companies, strengthening of quality infrastructure systems for health products like PPEs, assistance for treatment and disposal of medical wastes, etc.

In order to address the particular PPE-related challenges arising from the pandemic, UNIDO has in 2020 entered into a collaboration with the WHO. The core objectives of the programme that has been jointly developed by the two agencies are to (1) secure increased availability of quality assured, locally manufactured PPE, hand sanitizers and disinfectants in Africa to reduce the risk of COVID-19 exposure, transmission and infection on an ongoing basis, and (2) through doing so, reduce the negative consequences on the economies of African countries caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent containment measures, through boosting industry, reducing job losses and creating more employment on the continent in line with SDGs 8 and 9.

This collaborative undertaking has a total estimated budget of EUR 49 million, of which Germany has granted UNIDO an initial amount of EUR 1 million aimed at kicking-off or piloting key programme activities at national, regional and/or continental levels as well as coordinating and mobilizing further donor support.

 In order to realize synergies with complementary mandates and competencies, UNIDO has been collaborating with other key players active in the area of health and pharmaceutical sector development, including:
- International agencies and NPOs: WHO, WTO, UNAIDS, UNCTAD, UNICEF, UNTBLDC, The Global Fund, etc.
- (Sub-)Regional development partners: AfDB, AU, AUDA/NEPAD, AVMI, RECs (ECOWAS/WAHO, EAC), etc.
- Private sector partners: IFPMA, IGBA, FAPMA, etc.
- Regulatory bodies at national and (sub-)regional levels
- Etc.

UNIDO has received numerous solicitations for advice on how to overcome existing limitations of manufacturing capacities for health products, as evidenced, for example, by the range of high-level events where the Director General and/or senior management have been invited to reflect on health industry development. Some key events in the more recent past include:
- WTO A4T Stock-taking event: Panel session co-organized with the Zambian Permanent Mission in Geneva on 23 March 2021, bringing together representatives from Member States, development agencies, African continental and regional institutions and the international private sector to discuss the challenges and opportunities related to the theme of &#x201C;Mobilizing resources to build resilient local pharmaceutical manufacturing industries in Developing Countries&#x201D;.
- Geneva Friends of Industry and Innovation Meeting on Access to Medicines: Gathering of 50 representatives from UN Member States under the theme of &#x201C;COVID-19 and the case for innovation and building resilient manufacturing capacity for essential medicines and vaccines in developing countries&#x201D;, featuring key note speeches by Mr. LI and the DG of WIPO, Mr TANG as well as an expert panel providing insights on the current situation regarding access to medicines and possible approaches to deliver greater access whilst nurturing innovation.
- UN LDC5 PrepCom1 side event: Panel session co-organized with UNTBLDC on 27 May 2021 to discuss how to strengthen regional health industries and promote technology transfer for enhanced pandemic resilience and improved health outcomes in LDCs.
- World Local Production Forum on Enhancing Access to Medicines and other Health Technologies hosted by WHO on 21-25 June 2021: Key note speech delivered by UNIDO DG during opening ceremony, and panel discussion on &#x201C;Leveraging innovation, AI and the digital revolution in the health products industry&#x201D; co-chaired as well as concluding remarks in the final session provided by MD DTA.
- WTO Technical Symposium on COVID-19 Vaccine Supply Chain and Regulatory Transparency: UNIDO represented on the panel of Session 4 on &#x201C;Promoting transparency and convergence in the regulatory landscape&#x201D; held on 29 June 2021.

 The envisaged Pandemic Treaty presents a further opportunity to position the development of health industries prominently within the international cooperation debate, highlight its contribution to the SDGs and reinforce UNIDO&#x2019;s leadership in industrial development related to health products and services.

Meanwhile, there is steadily growing demand from Member States for UNIDO services in this substantive area, including expressions of interest received from the highest political levels, requesting the Organization to support the development of capacities in their health and pharmaceutical sectors. Most recently, such assistance has been requested by:
- The President of Burkina Faso to establish a pharmaceutical technology park (&#x201C;pharmap&#xF4;le&#x201D;) in the country;
- Cuba to support the upscaling and expansion of vaccine manufacturing capacities, also with a view to producing vaccines against COVID19;
- Guinea for a feasibility study on building national capacities for pharmaceutical production;
- Tunisia for creating a regional vaccine development and manufacturing hub;
- Zambia for formulating and implementing a national pharmaceutical sector development strategy.

UNIDO has also been approached by a number of key development partners and donors interested in joining forces with the Organization and building on its expertise and achievements to design and implement future interventions in support of the agenda. For example, UNIDO has recently been contacted by the EU, which is currently developing a EUR 1 billion Team Europe initiative on manufacturing and access to vaccines, medicines and health technologies in Africa. Initial consultations have taken place and provide a promising basis to explore potential for collaboration moving forward. B&amp;M Gates Foundation have also reached out to UNIDO, and early discussions have been held about support that could be provided for the implementation of the ECOWAS Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Programme being developed by UNIDO for and together with WAHO. The AfDB is also interested in continuing to work together with UNIDO in support of the pharmaceutical sector on the continent and in West Africa specifically.

UNIDO has therefore decided to launch a Health Industry Initiative rendering targeted support to the post-pandemic recovery of its Member States. The present project will establish a Strategy to guide the organization-wide implementation of this Initiative positioning the Organization as a leader of this important development agenda. The Strategy will be developed through a six-month consultative process with key stakeholders, including governments, regulatory authorities, private sector, development partners and other international actors.

In order to successfully implement a Health Industry Initiative, it will be necessary to establish and operationalize a cross-organizational coordination mechanism comprised of a network of Focal Points from relevant Departments/Divisions to ensure that the expected deliverables are fully reflective of the Organization&#x2019;s priorities.

The Initiative will require the adoption of an integrated, programmatic approach to health industry development. This will be laid out in the Strategy that this project will formulate, taking into account UNIDO&#x2019;s five main Strategic Lines of Action, including actionable solutions such as:

- Agenda Setting and Policy Advice: Positioning of health industry development in the global development debate and related frameworks like the envisioned International Treaty to improve pandemic preparedness and response, etc.;

- Convening Function and Multi-stakeholder Partnerships: Development of new alliances with IFI/DFIs (AfDB, EIB), NGOs, foundations and private sector associations (IFPMA, EDANA);

- Normative Function: Driving harmonization of regulatory policies and standards for essential medicines, vaccines, medical products, etc. at global and (sub-)regional levels, in cooperation with relevant bodies like the upcoming African Medicines Agency (AMA);

- Knowledge Creation, Institutional Strengthening and Skills Development: Promoting technology transfer and access to innovation;

- Technical Cooperation: Enhancing organizational capacity for health sector development services, including policy/strategy formulation, enterprise modernization, technology transfer, access to affordable finance and promotion of investments, quality infrastructure development and conformity assessment services, medical waste disposal and circular economy promotion.

In addition, the development of the Strategy will be accompanied by a number of priority pilot interventions which could include:

- Policy advice in relation to (i) the development of a pharma pole in Burkina Faso, (ii) the validation of a pharmaceutical sector development strategy for Zambia, (iii) assessing the feasibility of building pharmaceutical production capacity in Guinea, (iv) strengthening vaccine manufacturing in Cuba, etc.

- Convening partnerships for health industry development with international agencies, global and regional private sector associations, regulators and development partners including development banks and other donors.</narrative>
