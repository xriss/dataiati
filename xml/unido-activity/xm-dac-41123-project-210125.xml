  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">As the only United Nations specialized agency with a mandate to promote inclusive and sustainable industrial development, UNIDO is uniquely placed to leverage its technical cooperation, policy and convening capacities for assisting its Member States in their transitions to the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR). This mandate has been reinforced by the adoption of Goal 9 of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, &#x201C;build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation&#x201D;.

Under the guidance of its Member States and the leadership of the Directorate of Digitalization, Technology and Agribusiness, UNIDO is developing a 4IR Strategic Framework aimed at mainstreaming a digital, gender-responsive, sustainable transformation and upscaling of digital capabilities in its Member States.

To support the preparation of the strategic framework as well as contribute to the activities of the UNIDO 4IR Task Force, funding from UNIDO&#x2019;s Regular Budget is requested for the following proposed outputs:

1.Organization of an Informal Digital Transformation EGM in October 2021
2.The preparation of background/supplemental research papers for the October 2021 4IR EGM
3.The development of a UNIDO Digitalization Index
4.Organization of an Informal EGM to present UNIDO Digitalization Index

The expected outcome is to facilitate and promote realignment UNIDO&#x2019;s functions and activities with the upcoming MTPF 2022-2025 and increase the organization&#x2019;s capacity to accelerate uptake of 4IR during the times of COVID-19 and beyond, with a focus on specific priority sectors; as well as increased regional cooperation on topics related to 4IR.

The overall objective of this project is to develop and implement targeted outputs that will support UNIDO (more specifically the 4IR Task Force) to develop and validate the UNIDO 4IR Strategic Framework during the 2021 &#x2013; 2022 biennium.</narrative>
