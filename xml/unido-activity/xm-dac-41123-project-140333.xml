   <narrative xml:lang="EN">On 2 May 2014, UNIDO and the Government of Kazakhstan signed a Joint Declaration on Cooperation that aims to contribute to the country&#x2019;s efforts towards industrialization as stipulated in the State Program of Accelerated Industrial-Innovative Development of Kazakhstan for 2015-2019 (SPAIID), through, in particular, adoption and implementation of the UNIDO Country Programme Framework (CPF) for Kazakhstan that prioritizes, inter alia, Industrial Modernization. As part of the CPF, three technical cooperation projects were prioritized by the Government of Kazakhstan with respective allocation of Preparatory Assistance phase funding for development of fully fledged project documents to be submitted for consideration of funding for these projects&#x2019; main phases by the Government of Kazakhstan.

The overall development objective of the current project is to enhance the existing quality infrastructure (standards, metrology and accreditation institutions as well as conformity assessment services such as laboratories, inspection bodies and certification bodies) to support light industry in Kazakhstan, with particular emphasis on the processed food value chain, unlocking its export market potential especially for SMEs. The project will strengthen and support Kazakhstan&#x2019;s capacity for trade along the processed food value chain by enhancing the services offered by the quality infrastructure components and ensuring their international recognition, thereby facilitating exports into existing and new markets as well as providing greater confidence for national consumers.

This objective is to be achieved by implementation of a three-year project with the Ministry for Investment and Development (MID) of Kazakhstan as the main counterpart. The project is aimed at achieving the following two outcomes:
&#x2022; Outcome 1: Technical competence and sustainability of the National Quality Infrastructure System is enhanced.
&#x2022; Outcome 2: Industry/SME quality culture and awareness is promoted, and compliance with international standards and technical regulations is enhanced.

In the conditions of industrialization of production of the economy of Kazakhstan the need to apply modern international and European technical standards and new technologies is increasing. For this it is necessary to calculate the economic benefits from the application of standards on macro and microlevels for the economy of the country, and to develop new approaches to the work of technical committees involving industry and consumers in standards development processes.

In order to comply with the principles of international standardization, to achieve &quot;transparency&quot;, &quot;consensus&quot; and &quot;balance of stakeholders&#x2019; perspectives&#x201D;, and to improve the work within the framework of national standardization, it is necessary to improve the procedure for harmonizing drafts of national and interstate standards through an information technology tool.

To achieve the necessary effect from the introduction of international standards for management systems, including quality, food safety, environmental management, occupational health and safety, energy, anti-bribery and others, there is an urgent need to improve the level of knowledge in the field of risk management, as well as appropriate awareness-building and further training of personnel at all levels in priority industries, including workers in testing and calibration laboratories for working with new equipment and techniques in advanced laboratories of the European countries.

At the same time, Kazakhstan&apos;s laboratories and certification bodies must comply with recognized international standards which is possible through accreditation conducted by the accreditation body recognized by international accreditation organizations ILAC - for accreditation of laboratories and inspection bodies, and IAF - for the accreditation of certification bodies. Confirmation of membership in ILAC, IAF and the status of the signatory of the ILAC MRA and IAF MLA Recognition Arrangements requires an appropriate level of competence of experts in the field of accreditation, primarily appraisers.</narrative>
