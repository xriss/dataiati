  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In early 2019, UNIDO and the Government of Zambia initiated the formulation of the new PCP programme. UNIDO conducted several missions to the country to discuss the PCP with government counterparts and development partners, and facilitate the transition from the ongoing UNIDO Country Programme into a PCP. The main focus areas are identified as (i) Improving the policy environment; (ii) Industrial skills development; and (iii) Fostering manufacturing industries and value addition in primary commodities. This project aims to address supply-side constraints and market access inadequacies focusing on the priorities identified in the DTIS Action Matrix, such as improving competitiveness as well as quality and standards of local agricultural/livestock products both in domestic and international markets resulting in enhanced efficiency and expanded socio-economic impact of the goat processing value chain in Zambia.

UNIDO has developed, tested and refined globally a set of tools that it uses to support its programmes for the promotion of the agro-industrial sector. Specifically, UNIDO&#x2019;s experience in implementing the project &#x201C;Promoting sustainable bush-processing value chains&#x201D; in the region possesses significant technical assistance potential from which goat processing value chains in Zambia could benefit. The UNIDO project in Namibia is being implemented jointly with the providers of advanced agri-food technologies and know how from Finland and academia institutions of both countries, thereby presenting a solid R&amp;D base that has already produced tangible results on the ground and could be transferred to other countries of the region with similar development context. In consultations with the Zambia Goat Task Force (ZGTF), the local Entity Katopolo Livestock Agribusiness Centre, FoodKnow Ltd and technology partners from Finland the idea behind this initiative is to develop a value chain, capable of producing 200 000 goats per year and ensure efficient export promotion channel to Saudi Arabia. Therefore, the project aims to establish and improve the goat processing value chain and related agricultural sub-sectors, strongly supporting the national priorities related to enhancing export capacity and poverty reduction.

The proposed intervention harbours great potential to create new jobs and improve skills and competences of the national agriculture/livestock expertise thereby ensuring value addition and enhancing overall economic performance of Zambian SMEs. Combining cutting-edge digital technologies and innovative production techniques can significantly improve the effectiveness and efficiency of all actors in the targeted value chain. To that end, the project envisages a broad capacity-building programme with training activities designed for farmers, feed makers and food processors to ensure a sustainable impact of the project activities. As another important innovation aspect of the project, activities include an Industry 4.0 dimension which envisages the use of backscattering methods allowing to detect eligible bush species using satellite imaging, drones and mobile smartphones in the field of bush processing for animal feed production. The proposed project aiming at fostering innovation, increasing competitiveness and enhancing market-orientation of goat value chain in the Republic of Zambia could benefit from the PCP network and respective funding opportunities.</narrative>
