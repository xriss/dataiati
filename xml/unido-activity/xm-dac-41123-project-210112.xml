   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The COVID-19 crisis is now shedding light on the harsh consequences of an informal economy with growing reports on the economic losses being faced by the workers in the informal economy. According to the findings of the UN&#x2019;s SEIA, the most vulnerable and affected group in Ethiopia so far includes workers, mainly women members in micro and small enterprises (MSEs), especially in the informal sector, and cooperatives. The second most vulnerable  group of workers will be the 3.1 million self-employed workers that constitute about 41% of the 7.5 million employed people in urban areas of Ethiopia.
Within this broad context, both the UNCT and the relevant Ethiopian government authorities have agreed that there is an urgent and important need to design and implement interventions that are directly aimed at the
informal sector. Consequently, this Concept Note aims for catalytic interventions that are aimed at addressing the gap observed so far in terms of response and recovery initiatives focusing on informal employment and businesses.
In relation to the response period, it aims at catalyzing interventions meant to protect the country&#x2019;s workforce in  the informal sectors (skills, assets, locational deployment/engagement); prevent a large reduction in employment and output in the informal sectors; and to prevent large scale closure/bankruptcy/collapse of informal businesses and MSEs. In the recovery phase, the effort aims to create a conducive environment for prevention, mitigation and reaction to impacts on women and youth entrepreneurs, and other at-risk groups e.g. informal enterprises in slum
or marginalized urban areas.
The interventions proposed in the Concept Note intend to use the limited resources of the programme mainly to quickly assist national authorities and their development partners to better understand the challenge, assist them to design appropriate response and recovery interventions, facilitate resource mobilization, build their capacity to implement and monitor larger interventions.
Overall, this Concept Note based on the findings of the SEIA and a much broader response and recovery plan and can be considered as part of this process of mobilizing attention, action and resources towards implementing the broader response and recovery plan. In addition, key elements of the proposed intervention are to create enabling conditions and mechanisms to catalyze significantly more resource towards response and recovery interventions in the informal sector. In terms of expected results, the interventions are aimed to reduced vulnerability and improved resilience of urban informal sector workers and enterprises, especially women, female youth and persons with disabilities.</narrative>
