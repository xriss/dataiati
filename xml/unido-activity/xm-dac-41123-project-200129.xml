   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In response to the official letter of the Bama County Committee Secretary to the Managing Director of Programme Development and Technical Cooperation at UNIDO, dated 26 April 2020, the project was developed to boost Bama&#x2019;s tourism potential, as well as the job generation through the Health and longevity brands products. The objective of the project is to contribute to the implementation of the national development strategies in regional development and rural revitalization, through supporting innovative, inclusive and sustainable development and world-level branding of health and its combined tourism industry and its related food value chain, which may go beyond the current product portfolio into the provision of branded organic food as well.

The project identifies the major stakeholders in the region and will strengthen the linkages of the main health and longevity products and services with other sectors in the region. With this, the project will combine and harness the potential with an upgrading perspective, exposure to best international practices, and capacity building activities to enhance the job creation potential of Bama&#x2019;s tourist potential. Three outputs will strengthen the region&#x2019;s comparative advantage through an upgrading and modernization strategy for the local health and selected longevity product industries, including Bama drinking water, camellia oil, hemp seed oil and Bama Xiang pig. Further, a comprehensive framework for tourism and service providers to benefit from these products is going to be established. A quality campaign and review of the local tourist offerings could also help explore new market niches and options, appeal to new national and international markets in order to strengthen Bama&#x2019;s socio-economic development. Third, the project will provide several marketing capacity building activities and host Global Forum events. Two major forums will be a part of those outputs.

There are several partners in the region that will be integral to the success of this project, including the Bama regional authority, the China International Center for Economic and Technical Exchanges (CICETE) and in close cooperation with the Ministry of Commerce of the People&#x2019;s Republic of China.

Bama is a picturesque village with great touristic potential. The city and region have gained some status as a health and wellbeing hotspot. In addition, the local spring water offers a great potential for further growth applying developed marketing strategies and procedures. Despite great endowments in natural beauty and resources, Bama tourism lacks international appeal and caters to a limited market only. Among major touristic assets are Bama&#x2019;s longevity branded marketing campaigns addressing multiple given opportunities and regional properties. Spring water companies are another driver for the health and longevity branding in the region, yet their volume output and standing is low when compared against international benchmarks. A holistic tourist approach that captures both the water companies with its improved high-quality packaging (i.e. glass bottles) and tourist related activities including the creation of its required infrastructure could significantly boost local employment and retain more value added in the region. Pathways for tourist activities, quality enhancement of local production and linking those activities will strengthen forward and backward linkages, which sees an impact on employment, quality of life in the region, and contributes to inclusive and sustainable industrial development.</narrative>
