   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Honourable Minister of Trade and Industry, on behalf of the Government of Sierra Leone, requested UNIDO to support the Government on issues related to industry and trade through the formulation and eventual operationalisation of a new Country Programme (CP) in December 2018. In the Medium-Term Development Plan 2018-2023, the Government of Sierra Leone highlighted industrialization as one of its key priorities to address two of the seven pillars to accelerate and diversify the economy as well as supporting infrastructure and economic competitiveness. The Plan also envisions that industrialisation would support exports increase and decrease of import dependency, creation of jobs, and empowerment of women, through enterprise and skills development and generation of wealth. The received letter of request for a CP development also acknowledged the importance of effective partnerships, as well as UNIDO&#x2019;s role in partnership and resource mobilization and its valuable contribution to the country&#x2019;s economic development and inclusive growth through provision of technical assistance and support over the years. It is also important to underline that the UNIDO Country Office in Sierra Leone is an integral part of various pillars set up by the Ministry of Planning and Economic Development, supported and provided inputs to the Medium Term Development Plan, and ensured that the Plan integrates the ISID. UNIDO has also been active in the development of the 2019-2023 Strategic Action Plan of the Ministry of Trade and Industry and the Ministry of Energy. All of the aforementioned plans were also captured in the 2020-2023 United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework (UNSDCF).

The overall strategic goal of the future Country Programme for Sierra Leone will thus be to contribute to a knowledge-driven, sustainable and inclusive economic growth of the country. Specific components and activities will be identified during the CP programming phase, following the approval of the CP Screening Form. The impact of the programming phase will therefore be to develop a Country Programme document with relevant actions contributing to the overall objective and prepare the terrain for its implementation, including promotion of the future CP among relevant stakeholders and mobilization of new partnerships and joint activities.

The Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) will lead the elaboration of the Country Programme, in collaborative dialogue with other Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) as well as the private sector and other key stakeholders. The Government and UNIDO, through joint efforts, will mobilise resources from key development and financial partners to fund the future CP. The ongoing support that has been provided by UNIDO to the MTI will serve as the basis for the formulation of the next technical cooperation program. The new Sierra Leone CP will be aligned with the relevant national development priorities, notably the Sierra Leone Medium Term Development Plan 2018-2023 and 2020-2023 United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework (UNSDCF), among others. It will also take into account regional and international strategic and policy instruments, including the ECOWAS policies, the Africa Union Agenda 2063, the Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development, the New Deal Peacebuilding and Statebuilding Goals as well as UNIDO&#x2019;s mandates on Inclusive and Sustainable Industrial Development (ISID) and the Third Industrial Development Decade for Africa (IDDA III).</narrative>
