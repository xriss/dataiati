  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Origin of the Proposal:
Since 2013, the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) was given a new mandate by its Member States at the fifteenth session of the UNIDO General Conference. This new mandate aims to promote Inclusive and Sustainable Industrial Development (ISID) in all its Member States. This new mandate therefore requires new approaches to support the industrialization of countries. They focus on national ownership and the promotion of partnership around industrial development programs.

In a bid to expeditiously operationalize this new mandate, UNIDO has developed a new technical support approach referred to as the Program for Country Partnership (PCP). It encompasses the economic, social and environmental dimensions of development.

The PCP is a comprehensive mechanism of consultation, sensitization, project formulation and development of an industrialization strategy, implemented by States, using partnerships and funding.

In addition, the United Nations General Assembly, at its 70th session on 26 September 2015, proclaimed the period 2016-2025 as the Third Industrial Development for Africa (IDDA 3). On this occasion, UNIDO was designated as the implementing agency for the IDDA 3. The PCP was seen as an instrument that could expedite its implementation.

To foster this initiative for inclusive and sustainable industrial development in Africa, UNIDO has launched the IDDA 3 Champion Program. Thus, His Excellency Mr. Alassane Ouattara, President of the Republic of C&#xF4;te d&#x2019;Ivoire, has agreed to be an &#xAB;IDDA3 Champion&#xBB;. This was confirmed during a high-level event held on 26 September 2018 in New York on strengthening global partnerships for the successful implementation of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA).

It is in this context that the Prime Minister of C&#xF4;te d&#x2019;Ivoire, Mr. Amadou Gon Coulibaly, requested UNIDO&#x2019;s support, by letter dated 02 October 2018, to develop a Program for Country Partnership (PCP) for C&#xF4;te d&#x2019;Ivoire, in order to promote and expedite the country&#x2019;s inclusive and sustainable industrial development. The Director-General of UNIDO granted an agreement in principle, in a correspondence dated 14 February 2019, to develop a PCP for C&#xF4;te d&#x2019;Ivoire.

In order to better discuss the modalities for the implementation of this Programme, the Director-General of UNIDO, Mr. Li Yong, carried out a mission to C&#xF4;te d&#x2019;Ivoire on 27 and 28 March 2019 to discuss with the highest authorities of the country.

UNIDO contributes to several projects in C&#xF4;te d&#x2019;Ivoire in support of private sector development, youth and women&#x2019;s entrepreneurship and employment, access to energy and the circular economy from an environmental protection standpoint.

The Program for Country Partnership will streamline and boost the impact of such ongoing interventions, help mobilize significant resources for the strengthening and creation of environmentally sustainable and climate-friendly industrial activities that can speed up the country&#x2019;s poverty reduction and inclusive and sustainable industrial development (ISID).

UNIDO history in C&#xF4;te d&#x2019;Ivoire: In 1976, UNIDO joins forces with the authorities of C&#xF4;te d&#x2019;Ivoire to promote and speed up the country&#x2019;s sustainable industrial growth. It also works with the Ivorian Government to improve the living conditions of the Ivorian population by leveraging its international resources and expertise. UNIDO supports the Government of C&#xF4;te d&#x2019;Ivoire in the implementation of its industrial policy.
Since 1996, UNIDO has been stepping up its technical cooperation with C&#xF4;te d&#x2019;Ivoire through the design and implementation of the official launch of the African initiative &#xAB;Alliance for the Industrialization of Africa&#xBB; (AIA). It is also towards the end of 1996 that UNIDO and C&#xF4;te d&#x2019;Ivoire initiated the Industrialization Blueprint (SDI) for C&#xF4;te d&#x2019;Ivoire, which began to be implemented immediately in early 1997. In September 1998, the Government hosted in Abidjan the first meeting of the Steering Committee for the Government&#x2019;s &#xAB;African Elephant&#xBB; programme, with UNIDO, to review strategic options for the country&#x2019;s long-term economic development.

During the protracted period of politico-military crises triggered by the coup d&#x2019;&#xE9;tat of December 1999, UNIDO continued to provide technical assistance to the population. Pending a swift resolution of the crisis and at the request of the Government, UNIDO refocused its interventions towards a Post-Crisis Emergency and Support Programme for the Revitalization of Industrial Productive Sector (PPC) activities. The aim is to provide support for selected productive sector activities in a way that helps to prevent the deterioration of the economy, and to support employment and income-generating opportunities for the most disadvantaged populations, especially women and youth. More specifically, UNIDO&#x2019;s support focused on two areas. The first component consisted in providing direct support to income-generating and employment-generating activities, which in particular contributed to the rehabilitation/reintegration of ex-combatants. The second component involved strengthening institutional capacities for technical support, training and promotion, including decentralized local authorities.

Following the end of the crisis in 2011, the Ministry of Industry approached UNIDO for technical assistance in developing a new industrial policy based on a thorough assessment of the industrial sector and its institutional framework. UNIDO responded through an agreement to finance the diagnostic study and the identification of the main lines of action as well as the implementation plan for the New Industrial Policy for C&#xF4;te d&#x2019;Ivoire. This is a priority policy in the peaceful post-crisis context that should contribute to C&#xF4;te d&#x2019;Ivoire&#x2019;s economic renaissance, as part of the implementation of the country&#x2019;s first National Development Plan (NDP 2012-2015).

Thus, operationally, UNIDO supports the private sector, thus contributing to improving the competitiveness of the Ivorian economy to bolster its integration into regional and global value chains. The Organization is strongly committed to upgrading and supporting the quality approach of Ivorian industries in the cashew nut, cassava-cereals and textile-clothing sectors, in order to foster the export of &#xAB;Made in C&#xF4;te d&#x2019;Ivoire&#xBB; products on a regional and international scale. This includes the establishment of export consortia and the strengthening of quality control institutions. Following UNIDO&#x2019;s assistance, the Ministry of Industry has set up a National Restructuring and Upgrading Programme (PNRMN) and has carried out a start-up phase with 26 companies. This Program, which covers a core portfolio of one hundred and twenty (120) companies, is being implemented through the Agence de D&#xE9;veloppement de la Comp&#xE9;titivit&#xE9; des Industries (ADCI).

A similar upgrading process has been implemented for the pharmaceutical industries in the West African sub-region. The approach mainly consisted in introducing local drug producers to good manufacturing practices through training activities on the development of Corrective Action and Preventive Action Plans (CAPAs) for both manufacturers and regulators in the drug and medicines sector.

Like many African countries, one of the major challenges facing C&#xF4;te d&#x2019;Ivoire is decent employment, especially for the youth and women, and the inclusion of vulnerable populations in the productive system. The repeated crises in C&#xF4;te d&#x2019;Ivoire have made it all the more acute. To this end, UNIDO has designed a support system for the professional integration of young people in C&#xF4;te d&#x2019;Ivoire that combines vocational training, entrepreneurship, self-employment and the creation of income-generating activities. This is done through a mechanism combining internships/training and access to financing for micro-projects with high added value, made possible by the establishment of a fund to support youth entrepreneurship.

UNIDO is also supporting the reform of the national vocational training system to better match training to the private sector&#x2019;s requirements. This support is provided through initiatives to promote the strengthening of participatory management at central level and training centers, and to foster a strong partnership between trainers and economic operators. UNIDO was involved in the short-term skills training of more than 5,600 young people, including 2,832 ex-combatants. This operation made it possible to broaden the impact of the Government&#x2019;s efforts on the socio-economic integration of leavers from the training system. The Organization also contributed to the renovation and equipment of 11 vocational training centers, including the Institut P&#xE9;dagogique National de l&#x2019;Enseignement Technique et Professionnel (IPNETP). This rehabilitation and equipment work makes it possible to improve young people&#x2019;s access to vocational training and promote their social integration.

Controlling energy security is a major challenge for Africa in general, and for C&#xF4;te d&#x2019;Ivoire in particular, by 2030. Thus, UNIDO has committed itself, alongside the Ivorian authorities, to developing new renewable energy sources. UNIDO is therefore working on the development of mini-hydro-electrical, photovoltaic and biomass systems to help meet the ever-increasing needs of people for access to electricity in peri-urban and rural areas.

Additionally, under the Montreal Protocol, UNIDO is contributing its experience in the decontamination of thermal power plants, power generators, refrigeration equipment and chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) pollutants through the setting-up and equipping of a Centre of Excellence on Refrigeration and Air Conditioning.

Moreover, UNIDO is supporting C&#xF4;te d&#x2019;Ivoire in the fight against persistent organic pollutants (POPs), in particular dioxins and furans, which are endocrine disrupters and carcinogens. Under the initiative &#xAB;Abidjan Sustainable City&#xBB;, UNIDO is supporting the assessment and monitoring of industrial pollution in the Abidjan Autonomous District with the aim of reducing global warming.

Finally, through the Network of Climate Technology Centers (CTCN), whose regional coordination unit is based in Abidjan, UNIDO is able to provide its technical expertise to monitor in real time emissions of short-term climate pollutants.

The review of C&#xF4;te d&#x2019;Ivoire&#x2019;s industrial sector clearly points out that the transition from an agriculture-based economy to an industry-based economy before the rise of services has not occurred. Services are emerging without manufacturing industry having allowed real structural change, with upstream leverage effects on agriculture and downstream onto services. Value chains are breaking down and economic activities are not working properly. This, despite the macroeconomic progress achieved by the country, making the economy still vulnerable to internal and external changes, and therefore weak.

The aim of the PCP C&#xF4;te d&#x2019;Ivoire will therefore be to forge strategic partnerships around the industrial sector, particularly with the private sector and certain donors, to better articulate the country&#x2019;s priority value chains, ensure investments with an impact on growth and development and improve access to knowledge, industrial skills, expertise and financial and technological capital. Priority value chains will be selected based on their job creation potential, their ability to access new income-generating markets.

The PCP approach that will serve as a baseline in C&#xF4;te d&#x2019;Ivoire has already been tested in Ethiopia and Senegal. The PCP includes technical support, industrial policy advice, standard setting and investment mobilization. It aims to induce genuine industrial development, by creating synergies at the level of development partners as part of their support for the Ivorian Government&#x2019;s development initiatives, in line with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), in particular Goal N&#xBA; 9.

The PCP is based on seven (7) core principles:
a. The PCP is the exclusive property of the State of C&#xF4;te d&#x2019;Ivoire. The Government, at the highest level, takes the lead in the design, implementation and monitoring of the PCP. It sets up and manages multisectoral monitoring and coordination bodies. It implements the strategy for mobilizing technical and financial resources. UNIDO assists the Government through all these stages;
b. The PCP is the operationalization of the Government&#x2019;s commitment, as part of its Development Plans, to bring about a far-reaching structural change in its economy through inclusive and sustainable industrialization;
c. The PCP is part of a support to the Ivorian Government&#x2019;s efforts to mobilize technical and financial resources from technical and financial partners. In this regard, UNIDO supports the Government in developing a resource mobilization strategy and implementing resource mobilization tools (Partners and Donors Working Group for Industry, use of existing memoranda of understanding between UNIDO and Development Finance Institutions and the private sector, etc.)
d. The PCP aims to facilitate the mobilization and coordination of three flows of financial resources, namely those from development assistance, public finance and private sector investment, under the leadership of the Government. The coordination of these three streams is key to a real impact of the PCP on sustainable development in priority sectors and value chains;
e. The PCP is formulated on the basis of a robust analytical framework using a diagnostic study to identify opportunities and constraints to be taken into account to achieve inclusive and sustainable industrial development;
f. On the basis of the results of this analytical study, the Experts, in liaison with UNIDO and the Ministry of Industry, suggest a coherent set of measures and actions to be implemented in priority sectors and areas with high impact;
g. A solid results-based management system is put in place. The PCP, based on a theory of change analysis, will be monitored daily by the Ministry of Industry, with UNIDO&#x2019;s technical support, through national and international experts.</narrative>
