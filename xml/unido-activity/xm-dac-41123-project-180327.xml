   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Global Impact Program: Biofuel industry and value chain
development for clean cooking (GIP-CC) is designed, to create bioethanol manufacturing and associated value chain for meeting the demand for clean fuels and technologies for household cooking market. This global programme targets 20 High Impact Countries (HICs) and other interested developing countries in Africa and Asia. Building upon UNIDO&#x2019;s core mandate of Inclusive and Sustainable Industrial Development (ISID &#x2013; SDG 9), it is designed with a vision of cross- sectoral collaboration and partnership development through inclusive and sustainable industrialization (ISID). The GIP-CC leverages UNIDO&#x2019;s tested tools and approaches in promoting access to innovative, renewable and environmentally friendly technologies. This intervention supports private sector lead market creation and value chain development, investments promotion and innovations in business models complementing UNIDO&#x2019;s PCP /CP framework for technical cooperation at country level. It will link the agriculture and industry and energy sectors accelerating rural-urban symbiosis and adoption of circularity principles in agro-industries. Through this approach, UNIDO&#x2019;s core technical assistance advantage is complemented by strong financial and social partnerships, especially in driving access to finance to agro-industries, especially SMEs. This innovative partnership approach will be instrumental in building sustainability, scalability and social impact of the Global Program. It is envisaged that, at least 500,000 households will have shifted from using traditional biomass fuels to bioethanol for cooking in each of the participating countries (total 10 million households in 20 countries) creating a market for 10 million ethanol cooking stoves and 2 billion liters of ethanol per year which translate into an investment mobilization of USD 2 billion by private sector.

The Global Impact Program will focus on delivering specific measurable impact by producing quality data for SDG 7 (energy), SDG 8 (employment), SDG 9 (industry), SDG 11 (sustainable cities) and SDG 17 (partnerships) as direct output of the Program and will develop a Monitoring Framework for tracking selected SDG indicators: 3 (health), 4 (education), 5 (gender equality), 6 (water), 12 (consumption), 13 (climate), and 15  (deforestation).</narrative>
