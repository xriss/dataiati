  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Chile&#x2019;s HPMP stage II was approved by the ExCom during its 76th meeting in May 2016 (Decision 76/37) to reduce the HCFC consumption in the period 2016-2021 by 45% from 2020 and 65% from 2021. UNDP participates in its execution as the lead implementing agency (US $ 2,145,047), UN Environment (US $ 218,270) and UNIDO (US $ 1,030,700) as cooperating implementing agencies and the Ministry of the Environment, through its Ozone Unit, as executing agency. All funds were approved in principle by the MLF and ExCom to assist Chile in complying with the 2020 control measures for HCFCs under the Montreal Protocol comprising of annual/biennial HCFC consumption and phase-out targets as: reducing HCFC consumption by 45 per cent of its baseline by 2020, and 65 per cent of its baseline by 2021; by January 2020, a ban on the import and use of HCFC-141b for the polyurethane foam manufacturing sector and on imports and exports of HCFC-141b contained in imported pre-blended polyols. Tranche 1 was approved for UNDP, UNEP and UNIDO agencies in May 2016, by a total amount of US$ 1,075,646 plus support costs. Tranche 2 was approved by the ExCom during its 81st meeting in May 2019 for UNDP, UNIDO and UNEP as Implementing Agencies. Tranche 3 was submitted to ExCom 85 and is scheduled to be implemented during 2020-2021. Chile is in compliance with the Montreal Protocol provisions and the Agreement with the Executive Committee and the country has an enforceable import/export licensing and quota system for HCFCs in place, which is operational, effective and capable of ensuring compliance with the Montreal Protocol phase-out provisions for HCFCs. UNDP as well as UNIDO and UNEP&#x2019;s preparatory funds for HPMP stage II have fully been disbursed. The HPMP-II contains five strategic lines that are implemented by these implementing agencies. The endorsement from the Government requesting UNIDO as lead agency and UNEP as cooperating agency to prepare HPMP stage III has been received. The remaining eligible consumption of HCFCs is of 15.98 ODP according to document ExCom 76/66, Annex VIII.</narrative>
