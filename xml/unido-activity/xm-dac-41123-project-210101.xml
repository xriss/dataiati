  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In collaboration with the Vice President&apos;s Office # Division of Environment, Ministry of Energy, and several other stakeholders, UNIDO is implementing a Global Environment Facility (GEF) project on &quot;Promotion of Bioethanol as a Clean, Alternate Fuel for Cooking in Tanzania&quot;, SAP ID 150208. The project targets the promotion and distribution of ethanol cookstove technology to an estimated 15 per cent of the households in Dar es Salaam as an alternative to charcoal, fuelwood and kerosene. The European Union Delegation to the United Republic of Tanzania (URT) pledged to co-finance the GEF-6 project during the project formulation stage from the 11th European Development Fund (EDF) for URT. A portion of the EDF has been allocated to promote access to clean cooking fuels and technologies in the country. The proposed project accounts for the funding of EUR 3 million received from the Clean Cooking Fund for Tanzania managed by UNCDF through an inter-agency agreement..  The proposed project is designed to scale up the roll-out of ethanol-based cookstoves to an additional 160,000 households in Dar es Salam under component 3 of the above mentioned GEF project.</narrative>
