  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">As per GC.18/Res.8, Member States have requested UNIDO to support the Fifth United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries (LDCs) to adopt the next programme of action 2022-2031 in Doha, Qatar, in January 2022, as per UNGA A/RES/74/232B. Specifically, UNIDO is requested by the Member States &#x201C;to include and integrate the identified best practices and innovative approaches [&#x2026;] and to provide necessary inputs on the role of industrialization in the graduation of LDCs in cooperation with UN-OHRLLS during the preparation of the new programme of action and the eventual inclusion of its programme for LDCs&#x201D; (para. 46, GC.18/Res.8). The UN system is therefore requested &#x201C;to come together for the successful organization of the Fifth UN Conference on LDCs [&#x2026;] and preparation of a strong and action-oriented outcome document and plan of action&#x201D; (para. 49, GC.18/Res.8).

This project&#x2019;s main objective is to increase Inclusive and Sustainable Industrial Development (ISID) transformational impact of UNIDO in LDCs&#x2019; national processes, to achieve lasting industrial and economic development as part of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The eradication of poverty is among the most prominent of the Sustainable Development Goals, and the challenge of poverty eradication is the greatest for the least developed countries, where almost half of the population still lives in extreme poverty. UNIDO pursues ISID to harness industry&#x2019;s full potential to contribute to lasting prosperity for all, based on the recognition (Lima Declaration, 2013) that poverty eradication &#x201C;can only be achieved through strong, inclusive, sustainable and resilient economic and industrial growth, and the effective integration of the economic, social and environmental dimensions of sustainable development.&#x201D;

Designed around one outcome, this project expects to:

Improve awareness, knowledge and readiness of policy makers in LDCs, the international community (including the development agencies and financial institutions), the private sector, academia and civil society to cooperate and build partnerships in the ISID-related priority areas, whilst using demonstrated good practices, and addressing specific needs and priorities of the LDCs, beyond 2021, via three outputs:
a) The organization of the UNIDO 9th Ministerial Conference of the LDCs as the last high-level pre-event leading to the UN LDC5; the UNIDO Ministerial Conferences of the LDCs was first initiated in 2007. Since then, the Conference has been celebrated as a biennial event, preceding the UNIDO General Conference and has reached its ninth edition this year.
b) To support Member States to broadly disseminate UNIDO results and knowledge transfer on ISID through active engagement of UNIDO in the UN LDC5 pre-events as part of the Conference&#x2019;s preparatory process, as per GC.18/Res.8; and
c) For UNIDO to effectively and actively participate at the UN LDC5 Conference to support Member States in the adoption of the next programme of action for the LDCs 2022-2031, in January 2022, as per GC.18/Res.8.</narrative>
