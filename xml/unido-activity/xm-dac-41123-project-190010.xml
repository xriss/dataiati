   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Supporting infant food manufacturing in Zambia</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">A request was received by UNIDO from the Ministry of Industry, Zambia on 19th October 2018 to support the country to develop landrace crops based baby food manufacturing.

Zambia has a abundance of water and fertile land as well as a favourable climate for agricultural production.  However, the country needs significant agricultural transformation to become food secure.

Infants are most vulnerable to any form of food insecurity and it is estimated that 1 in every 22 Zambian children die before reaching their first birthday  and 1 in five do not survive to their fifth birthday (CSO, 2014).  A significnat number of those surviving their fifth birthday suffer stunting.

Presently Zambia does not have infant food manufacturing capacity and all the infant food sold in the country is imported from neighbouring South Africa and China making it unaffordable and out of reach for the majority of the rural folks.

This project thus proposes to partner with the private sector to establish an infant food processing facility that utilizes locally produced raw materials.   The processing unit would provide market linkage for small holder producers.

The project does not only provide convenient and affordable nutrient dense food for infants but creates an opportunity for the emergence of commercially oriented agriculture production in the target areas generating the much need employment and incomes.  The country as whole benefits from forex savings</narrative>
