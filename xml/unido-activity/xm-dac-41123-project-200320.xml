   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The 106th ACP Council of Ministers meeting on December 5th to 6th 2017 took Decision N&#xB0;12/CVI/17 on NON TARRIF MEASURES and instructed the Secretary General and the Committee of Ambassadors to explore the resources available under the 11th EDF to set up a programme of support to ACP States to cope with the myriad of TBT, SPS and other standards, metrology, accreditation and conformity assessment issues that create a challenge for trade so as to enable continued and increased exports to the EU market.

The present project document has been prepared in cooperation between OACPS and UNIDO in consultation with regional stakeholders representing Africa, Caribbean and Pacific regions, as well the EU, to complement and build on the achievements of the overall Programme titled &#x201C;Supporting business-friendly and inclusive national and regional policies, and strengthening productive capabilities and value chains&#x201D; (CRIS ACP/FED/038589).  Specifically, the concept note for this specific intervention was discussed and approved as follows:

&#x2022; Meeting of the ACP Subcommittee on Trade and Commodities held on Monday 12th November 2018
&#x2022; 915th meeting of the Committee of Ambassadors held on Thursday 15 November 2018
&#x2022; Approved by DEVCO Director on 18 August 2020.

Based on the lessons learnt and good practices identified within the previous programme in the field of technical barriers to trade (ACP EU TBT), the present project will seek to consolidate on the gains made and advance the benefits through:

1) Enhancing regional quality and regulatory infrastructure (Q&amp;RI) governance
2) Strengthening the availability of value chain specific QI Services
3) Promoting Quality Culture and Practices.

It will enhance and further contribute to the overall objectives of the &#x201C;ACP business friendly Programme&#x201D; by complementing the meso-level (UNIDO) component (Workstream #3 - &#x201C;Improvement of investment-related business environment/climate through quality systems &amp; conformity assessment&#x201D;). It will materialize by way of an Addendum to the EU Delegation Agreement FED/2018/403-924 signed between the European Union and UNIDO on 20 December 2018</narrative>
