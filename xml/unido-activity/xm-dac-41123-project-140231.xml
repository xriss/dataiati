   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Countering Violence and Extremism through Skills Training and Livelihoods Support for At-Risk Youth in Kismayo (CSR II)</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In southern Somalia, civil war, international isolation, and clan-based violence have had a profound and adverse impact on the productive capacity of all sectors of the economy. These destabilizing forces have significantly impacted income and employment creation in and around Kismayo and which has further hindered socio-economic development. Despite improving security, the Lower Juba Region still remains vulnerable due to natural disasters (such as the recent flooding in Kismayo) with effects compounded by loss of crops and increasing food insecurity. Poor access to decision makers, overwhelmed humanitarian distribution networks, high transaction costs, weak government service delivery, tightly controlled labour and product markets rub up against the legitimate aspirations of youth. As a result, there is a serious risk of at risk youth becoming engaged in violence and conflict as a tool to address youth disenfranchisement. Armed Opposition Groups (AOG) like Al-Shabaab leverage the alienation felt by youth and channel it towards undermining recent gains made by the national government, the international community, and AMISOM peace support operations.
As a result, youth are continually at risk to be induced into armed conflict as the only means for income generation.

Simultaneously, those previously engaged or at risk to engage in armed activity with low skill levels must be given the opportunity to reintegrate into the community. Young women face considerable gender barriers to access the formal labour market and find opportunities for improving the quality of life. Central to these efforts will be providing real world economic and employment/revenue- enhancing  opportunities  to  marginalized  and  at-risk  youth  to  participate  in  the  community

Central to these efforts will be providing real world economic and employment/revenue- enhancing  opportunities  to  marginalized  and  at-risk  youth  to  participate  in  the  community
development  process  through  technical  trainings,  technology  and  knowledge  transfers,  and enhancing public goods, assets, and infrastructure.

Kismayo remains at the crossroads towards stabilization. Since the removal of control of the city from Al Shabaab in 2012 the Jubaland Interim Administration (JIA) continues to make progress towards a more stable security, economic and political environment. Recently, a number of militias have been disarmed, returnees are returning to Kismayo resulting in a surge in reconstruction efforts of key infrastructure and housing. However, the JIA control does not extend past the city limits where Al Shabaab remains in control and continues to carry out attacks against the local population and authorities to disrupt development.

There is a small window of opportunity to provide alternative livelihoods and life skills to empower youth to contribute positively to their community following return of Kismayo to government control. The risk of disenfranchisement of youth.</narrative>
