   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Background
1. At its 81st meeting, the Executive Committee requested the Secretariat to contract an independent consultant to prepare a report for the 82nd meeting, providing information:
(a) On options and all costs and savings related to the control of HFC-23 by-product emissions in Argentina, based on the quantities of HCFC-22 and HFC-23 produced at the plant and information included in relevant past reports to the Executive Committee, including the option of shipping HFC-23 for off-site destruction;
(b) On estimates of fugitive emissions and options for monitoring, leak detection and control of HFC-23 by-product at the plant; and
(c) On the costs, technical feasibility, and logistical, legal and transaction issues associated with shipping HFC-23 for off-site destruction by means of a technology such as the fluor process described in document UNEP/OzL.Pro/ExCom/81/54.
2. The Executive Committee also requested the Government of Argentina to provide, on a voluntary basis, relevant information for the report, and allocated, from existing Secretariat resources, up to US $25,000 for the contract of the independent consultant (decision 81/68(b), (c) and (d)).
Scope of the document
3. In line with decision 81/68(b), the Secretariat contracted an independent consultant to undertake the study. The consultant, together with two staff members from the Secretariat, visited the HCFC-22
production facility Frio Industrias Argentinas (FIASA) located in San Luis, Argentina on 28 to 30 August 2018. The team also met with the representatives of the Government of Argentina and discussed the
options for HFC-23 by-product control, including requirements for off-site destruction of HFC-23 by-product.
4. Based on the data collected from the mission to Argentina and relevant documents that were previously considered, the consultant submitted a report detailing options for HFC-23 by-product control and their costs for the consideration of the Executive Committee. The Secretariat undertook an extensive review of the consultant&#x2019;s report, which is contained in Annex I to the present document. The report consists of an executive summary (including findings); it describes the HCFC-22 production and
generation of HFC-23 at FIASA; it describes the physical and mechanical conditions of the incinerator available at the production facility, and the estimated costs for restoring it; the potential for fugitive emissions of HFC-23; it presents a cost analysis of onsite destruction of HFC-23 and transporting HFC-23 for off-site incineration. The report also includes five annexes, including an analysis of the estimated capital cost to restore the incinerator (Annex II); estimated cost for incinerating HFC-23 at FIASA (Annex III); and the amounts of HCFC-22 production and the estimated HFC-23 by-product generated from 2019 to 2029 (based on three different generations rates), and the costs of destruction at three facilities (in-situ, in a cement kiln in the vicinity of FIASA, and in a plasma arc incinerator in Monterrey,Mexico).</narrative>
