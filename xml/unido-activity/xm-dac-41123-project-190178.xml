   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Options to control and phase out HFC-23 emissions at Quimob&#xE1;sicos</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">At the 83rd Meeting of the Executive Committee of the Multilateral Fund for the Implementation of the Montreal Protocol, UNIDO submitted a funding request to prepare a project for the control of HFC-23 by-product emissions in the HCFC production sector in Mexico.
The project to be developed would enable the Government to comply with the HFC-23 by-product control obligations, including data regarding, costs and benefits and covering technical feasibility, economic viability, relevant credits that might be applicable in the future, and logistical, legal and transactional issues in relation to the following:
(i) resuming operation of both the integrated on-site incinerator and the non-integrated on-site incinerator at the HCFC-22 production swing plant Quimobasicos, on the basis of three independent estimates of the costs/savings of doing so for each, including in relation to operation of the incinerator, compliance with standards for the management of hazardous waste, and monitoring and verifying the destruction of the HFC-23 by-product;
(ii) importing HCFC-22 to meet demand in the domestic market, including a comparison of the price of sourcing it locally and internationally;
(iii) destroying HFC-23 byproduct through irreversible transformation and other new conversion technologies, and storage options for HFC-23 management;
(iv) shipping HFC-23 for off-site destruction by means of a technology approved by the Meeting of the Parties;
(v) optimizing the HCFC-22 production to reduce the generation of the HFC-23 by product; and
(vi) selling the HFC-23 for feedstock use or adapting the plant so that it could use HFC-23 for the production of HCFC-22. UNIDO was requested to include information regarding the relationship between the country&#x2019;s
control of HFC-23 by-product emissions and the nationally determined contributions of the Government under the Paris Agreement.
At its 84th meeting, the Executive Committee had considered document UNEP/OzL.Pro/ExCom/84/70, which comprised policy issues arising in projects in Argentina and Mexico; and document UNEP/OzL.Pro/ExCom/84/72, which presented project proposal options for controlling and phasing out HFC-23 by-product emissions at Quimob&#xE1;sicos, Mexico. Following discussions in plenary, the Executive Committee had agreed to establish a contact group to hold additional discussions on the these documents.
Following the discussions in the contact group, the Executive Committee had decided to defer its consideration of the projects to control HFC-23 by-product emissions in Mexico to the 85th meeting (decisions 84/91). In line with the intersessional approval process established for that meeting, the Executive Committee had decided to consider the project proposal and related policy matters at its 86th meeting; agreed to reconstitute the contact group and hold online meetings to pursue consideration of the project in Mexico; and defer, to the 87th meeting, consideration of the policy matters contained in document UNEP/OzL.Pro/ExCom/86/94.
The Executive Committee decided:
(a) To note the project proposal options to control and phase out HFC-23 by-product emissions at Quimob&#xE1;sicos contained in document UNEP/OzL.Pro/ExCom/86/96, Key aspects related to HFC-23 by-product control technologies: Mexico (decision 84/91);
(b) To approve, in principle, US $3,833,384, plus agency support costs of US $268,337 for UNIDO, to enable the Government of Mexico to comply with the HFC-23 by-product emission control obligations under the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol, on the understanding that:
(i) The Government of Mexico would ensure that, by 1 January 2022 and thereafter, emissions of HFC-23 by-product from HCFC-22 production lines were destroyed in compliance with the Montreal Protocol, such that emissions for both lines were at or below 0.1 kg of HFC-23 per 100 kg of HCFC-22 produced;
(ii) The Government of Mexico had the flexibility to use the funding approved in principle in sub-paragraph (b) above to refurbish either of the two, or both, plasma arc destruction units installed at Quimob&#xE1;sicos, described in document UNEP/OzL.Pro/ExCom/85/65, on the understanding that any additional funding required would be covered by Quimob&#xE1;sicos;
(iii) A maximum amount of US $2,995,047, out of the total funding approved, was associated with incremental operating costs and would be divided into annual tranches to be provided to Mexico upon verification of the quantity of HFC-23 by product destroyed;
(iv) The incremental operating costs in each annual tranche would be calculated by multiplying the number of kilogrammes of HFC-23 destroyed by US $3.28/kg;
(v) The project would be completed by 1 January 2031;
(vi) The Government of Mexico committed to ensuring that there would be no additional funding from other sources, including HFC-23 credits or offsets, for the control of HFC-23 by-product emissions from the production lines concerned, during or after completion of the project;
(c) To note:
(i) The commitment by Quimob&#xE1;sicos to suspend production of HCFC 22 for up to two weeks to allow for the repair of the plasma-arc destruction unit if the Government of Mexico were to choose Option 1A in document UNEP/OzL.Pro/ExCom/85/65;
(ii) The commitment by the Government of Mexico to ensure that emissions of HFC 23 by-product from HCFC-22 production by Quimob&#xE1;sicos would continue to be controlled and verified in the same manner after the completion of the project, including by means of policies and legislation;
(iii) That the funding approved in principle specified in sub-paragraph (b) above was the total funding that would be available to the Government of Mexico from the Multilateral Fund for the control of HFC 23 by-product emissions;
(iv) The funding provided reflected reductions for non-Article 5 ownership and exports to non-Article 5 Parties;
(v) The costs agreed for the project recognized the special circumstances of the project in Mexico and did not set a precedent for any other projects related to the control of HFC-23 by-product emissions;
(d) To request the Secretariat, in cooperation with UNIDO, to prepare a draft Agreement between the Government of Mexico and the Executive Committee for the control of HFC 23 by product emissions for consideration at the 87th meeting, in light of the guidance provided by the Executive Committee at the 86th meeting;
(e) To invite the Government of Mexico, after the completion of the project, to consider requesting additional funding, for independent verification of the HFC-23 by-product generated, destroyed, sold, stored and emitted, under the subsequent stage of its HCFC phase-out management plan, until approval of the HFC phase-down plan for the country, at which time verification would continue under that plan; and
(f) To approve the first tranche of the project to control and phase out HFC-23 by-product emissions at Quimob&#xE1;sicos, Mexico, and the corresponding 2021&#x2013;2022 implementation plan, in the amount of US $483,058, plus agency support costs of US $33,814 for UNIDO.</narrative>
