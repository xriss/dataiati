   <narrative xml:lang="EN">South Africa is particularly affected by climate change hazards such as recurring and extensive heat waves and dry spells, rainfall increase and storm surges. The associated impacts of these extreme weather events have a bearing on economic and social aspects of the country&#x2019;s development. As the country just embarks on a transition to a low-carbon, climate-resilient and environmentally-sustainable economy, a clear window of opportunity exists to accelerate the shift to a domestic green economy.
In order to ease the pressure of climate change-related impacts in South Africa while improving the resilience of its economy, this project aims to reduce South Africa&#x2019;s vulnerability to climate change effects and promote adaptation solutions on energy, water and mobility with particular emphasis on medium to large enterprises. The project will make these critical services more climate resilient through tailored policy support, technology transfer and enhanced cooperation between governments, private sector and academia in South Africa and Flanders. At the national level, the project will strengthen institutional capacity and enhance awareness of the governmental stakeholders. At the local level, the project will involve the public sector (such as municipalities and universities), and the private sector, specifically medium and large enterprises (such as sector organizations, industrial zones, individual enterprises), and provide analytical support, tools, and capacity building to mainstream climate action and strengthen the ability to develop and finance resilient capital investment projects.
The development objective of the project is to establish a climate-resilient industry that supports a vibrant green economy through inclusive and resilient services in South Africa. The project will thus support the country to adapt to climate change by bringing domestic co-benefits for and the society at large. The specific objective is to strengthen institutional capacity on climate proofing of critical services for improved resilience to adaptation of the public, private and academic sectors in South Africa and facilitate transfer of technology and knowhow from Flanders.

In order to adapt to climate change, reduce vulnerability, and allow businesses to grow and participate in the Green Economy, the policy and regulatory framework needs to be conducive and institutions need to be supportive. South Africa considers the adaptation component of its Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) to be an important contributor to the global response to climate change. It also develops various strategic documents to support its vision of a low-emission and climate-resilient development pathway including Disaster Management Frameworks, and a climate change response strategy. The National Climate Change Adaptation Strategy will be integrated into all relevant sector plans, and will be the basis for the UNFCCC National Adaptation Plan (NAP).</narrative>
