   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Pursuant to General Assembly resolution 74/225, the Secretary-General will convene a High-level Dialogue on Energy at the summit level during the 76th session of the UN General Assembly in September 2021, in New York. The High-level Dialogue on Energy in 2021 represents the first global gathering on energy under the auspices of the General Assembly since the UN Conference on New and Renewable Sources of Energy held in Nairobi in 1981. Marking the 40th anniversary of the Nairobi conference, it presents a historic opportunity to provide transformational action in the first years of the SDG Decade of Action and support the implementation of the Paris Agreement.
The dialogue will examine five themes: Energy access, energy transition, just energy transition, innovation technology and data and financing.  Each Theme will be lead by three members of the UN-Energy group and supported by a multi-stakeholder Technical Working Group. These Groups will be an opportunity for technical experts to engage in the substantive preparations for the High-level Dialogue by advancing substantive discussions on the Themes. Each of the groups will produce a thematic report containing substantive recommendations on issues related to their Theme which will contribute towards an action oriented SDG7 roadmap to 2030 in support of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Paris Agreement on Climate Change.
Additional details on the process and the working group can be found under the link below: HLDE 2021 | United Nations
