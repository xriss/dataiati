   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The purpose of the project is to disseminate world class knowledge and the Korean industrial policy (IP) experience to consolidate inclusive and sustainable industrial development in developing countries.

How much impact industry has on poverty eradication, environmental sustainability and food security is ultimately defined by the pattern of industrialization a country chooses to follow. Hence, a long-term IP strategy is required that puts in place a framework of stable economic, legal, and political conditions, and creates policy incentives to invest and generate employment and accelerated economic growth. Concrete action will depend on the country-specific challenges, endowments and levels of integration in the global economic system. Considering what matters most to policymakers today &#x2013; how to sustain growth, to increase their country&#x2019;s participation in international trade and globalization, to create lasting jobs that generate income, and to advance the overall well-being of their people &#x2013; it comes as no surprise that sound industrial policymaking remains a top priority around the globe. At all levels of development, industry can be a primary driver in fighting poverty, ensuring food security, and preventing social polarization and fragmentation.

It is for these reasons that there is a strong call for the integration of the economic dimension, and the role of industry and manufacturing in particular, into the global post-2015 development priorities. Similarly, policymakers and thought leaders from all sides of the political spectrum are promoting inclusive and sustainable industrial development (ISID) as a tool for creating higher-skilled jobs, for building more equitable societies, and for safeguarding the environment, while sustaining economic growth. The implementation of the ISID framework requires developing the capacity for the formulation, and efficient management of industrial processes in response to ongoing changes in global manufacturing.

The programme provides an opportunity to participants to familiarize themselves with the diverse issues pertaining to the conceptual/theoretical and operational/ practical aspects of industrial policy and industrial policy management, in the context of current trends in global manufacturing and reflect on effectiveness and dynamism of such policies.

The project consists in the organization and delivery of a capacity building programme in the year 2015, with possibility of extension for 2 years more. The 21-day programme is designed for middle level professionals working in the government, particularly, in the Ministry of Industry, Economy, Commerce or similar. It will offer a dynamic mix of lecture-based and active learning sessions and include several field trips to research institutions and manufacturing facilities in Korea. The Programme will consist of three consecutive modules, each lasting one week:

Module 1: Industrial Performance Diagnosis
Module 2: Industrial Strategy
Module 3: Industrial Policy Instruments

The first module will help in setting the background and provide participants with some of the key concepts and tools for a comprehensive and integrated industrial performance diagnosis. Participants will learn about core principles of industrial data analysis and get introduced to different tools to evaluate the current situation of their countries&#x2019; manufacturing industry. The module will include sustainability and other environmental indicators, not considered in traditional industrial policy approaches. Presentations will be supported by examples coming from UNIDO experts involved in industrial performance diagnosis worldwide.

The second module will focus on the role of strategy in framing effective industrial policies. Participants will look at various potential pathways for the development of their industries as taken by different countries globally and compare them. The module will display different industrial policy objectives and priorities that can lead countries to a more advance stage of industrial development. The module will further provide a toolbox of industrial policy methods to promote structural change, economic growth and employment as well as approaches for the greening of industries. Special attention will be given to the Korean experience, its policy decisions and subsequent implementation. Presentations will be supported by knowledge products developed by UNIDO.

The third module will round up the programme. In this module, participants will be exposed to a broad set of policy instruments to achieve the objectives and priorities set in the second module. Participants will also learn about the implications of these choices as well as about experiences from developing and developed countries worldwide. In addition, this module will introduce participants to the practicalities of industrial policy making. Policy instruments to achieve green growth and energy sustainability will be addressed in this module. Presentations will be supported by examples coming from UNIDO industrial development projects implemented in developing countries.

The programme pursues the following concrete objectives:

a) To enable participants to improve their skills in the understanding of their countries&#x2019; industrial performance, strategy setting and industrial policy design;
b) To strengthen networking and knowledge exchange between participants&#x2019; countries and Korea;

c) To establish a long-term cooperation model for specialized training programmes between UNIDO and KOICA.

In the long-term, it could be argued that the project expects to cause a positive effect on the welfare of the population in the developing countries, by fostering industrial development and economic growth of the developing countries whose policy makers were trained in this programme. Moreover, the project expects to reinforce the cooperation between UNIDO and KOICA, hopefully as the starting point for a more extended and fruitful cooperation that can also benefit more directly the PTC branches.</narrative>
