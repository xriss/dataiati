  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Madagascar&apos;s economy is unable to integrate the 480,000 young people entering the labor market each year. The situation is particularly worrying in the agricultural sector, which employs nearly 80% of the population and is experiencing a steady decline due to the deterioration of the environment (soil, water, climate change). The country&#x2019;s vast territory is also managed in a very centralized manner and the infrastructureis particularly lacking in the regions.

In this context, after finishing their education , young people try to create their own jobs, but without experience and with few resources, little management capacity and few contacts, they end up often entering the informal sector. To overcome this challenge, initiatives to support entrepreneurship have multiplied in the country over the last ten years. These initiatives, called incubators, offer training and support services ranging from developing a project idea, to the formulation of a business plan to be submitted to financial institutions. However, these initiatives remain limited in scope and diverse in quality, and lack coordination.

Faced with this situation, this project is part of the Action Programme to support incubators for entrepreneurship and the creation of MSMEs in Madagascar, Angola, Ethiopia and Somalia financed by the EU.  In Madagascar, the project intends to support the incubation system so that it can train young entrepreneurs and accompany MSMEs. In order to achieve this outcome, the following outputs will be put in place:

1. A network of incubators in Madagascar is set up and partnerships are established among the different actors of the incubation system.
2. Training courses given by the existing incubators are improved and will be able to incorporate new needs.
3. A support service for MSMEs in selected priority sectors is set up.
Consequently, the project will rely on the already existing network of incubators to improve the complementarity of the incubation system of the &#x201C;Grande Ile&#x201D; and therefore, allow for the capitalization, improvement and dissemination of knowledge and experiences at the national level. The objective of the project is therefore to improve the services offered by incubators in order to strengthen the creation of businesses. To this end, emphasis is placed on the integration of the circular economy and new technologies into training courses. At the same time, the setting up of shared workshops, within incubators selected through a call for tenders, will help support the launch of new MSMEs.</narrative>
