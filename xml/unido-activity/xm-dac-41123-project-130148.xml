   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Pilot project for demonstrative techniques of solar drying.

After getting acquainted to solar plants for processing and drying
fruits, vegetables and medicinal plants in Cuba in 2011, the Government
of Paraguay has decided to replicate this experience in the country. The
project will be financed from outstanding funds (USD 23,001) from a
previous project entitled &#x201C;SF/PAR/96/001 Advisory Servi
ces to the
Establishment of the Fertilizer Plant in Paraguay&#x201D; that was carried out
by UNIDO in 1996/99.

In the planning and installation of solar plants for drying fruits and&#xA0;vegetables, the pilot stage will include the establishment of a solar dryer mini plant including the entire value
chain, from the entrance of fresh products, the respective st
eps of preparation, drying, packaging a
nd quality control until the
final product is packed for sale.

The project will&#xA0;address the&#xA0;agro- value chain through assisting isolated communities in enhancing&#xA0;the value of local production, reducing fruit and&#xA0;vegetable waste and enhancing their conservation times. Through the introduction of&#xA0;a solar dryer mini-plant, this project will permit the advancement of solar technology, the&#xA0;generation of synergies with other value
chains and the increased sale of seasonal
products.


This project will serve as a demonstration/ pilot project that could be used
to gain the support from stakeholders at large for a&#xA0;larger-scale project. with a foreseen the establishment of a number of&#xA0;mini-plants in remote regions cooperating as a cluster.  The demonstration plant will be essential to developing a national programme that&#xA0;will replicate this experience in all Paraguayan provinces and&#xA0;will therefore help&#xA0;to eradicate poverty and hunger, empower women and&#xA0;ensure environmental sustainability. solar plants for processing and drying fruits, vegetables and medicinal plants in Cuba in 2011, the Government of Paraguay has decided to replicate this experience in the country.

- Since 2009 UNIDO, through the Industrial Knowledge Bank (IKB), has
 provided technical assistance in the field of solar drying in several
 Latin-American and Caribbean countries (namely, Cuba, Barbados and
 Dominica);
- The Ministry of Industry and Trade of Paraguay, by letters 8 June 2011
 and 15 April 2013, expressed its interest in implementing in its country
 a pilot preparatory project of solar drying similar to one previously
 undertaken by ONUDI in Cuba. The Ministry stated that the funding for
 this project should come from the remaining balance of project
 SFPAR96001, which amounts to USD 25,000);
- In February 2013, a mission financed through the UNIDO Industrial
 Knowledge Bank was fielded to visit several municipalities in Paraguay
 and assess the feasibility of replicating the project in the country.
 The mission confirmed the suitability of the country to conduct such
 pilot project due to abundant fruits, vegetables and herbs as well as
 good climatic conditions. The locations selected to run the project are
 Carlos Antonio L&#xF3;pez and Tembiapor&#xE1;, where fruits and vegetables are
 currently grown by local farmers. Due to the lack of technical equipment
 and knowledge, part of the production is currently wasted and market
 potential is not fully reached;
- The project aims at reducing the waste of fresh fruits, vegetables and
 herbs in remote rural areas by helping small cooperatives in the
 transformation of raw materials into value-added products by using
 techniques of solar drying. The project will include: a) know-how
 transfer through training workshops; b) pilot project: installation of
 three solar drying plants; c) training on the method and treatment of
 finished products. The experience is based on the successful project
 executed by UNIDO in Cuba in 2010 with the commission of two mini solar
 dryer plants in Boyero and Banao. The national counterpart of Paraguay
 visited the facilities in Cuba;
- The introduction of solar drying techniques will foster the
 development of value-added chains in the agribusiness which, in turn,
 will empower and bring additional income to the recipient communities.
 Further, the outcomes of this initial pilot preparatory study will be
 crucial to develop a future project or program of national scope that
 replicates the experience in all the Paraguayan departments.</narrative>
