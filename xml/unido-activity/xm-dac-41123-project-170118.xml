   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In January of 2016, the PTC Managing Director (PTC-MD) traveled on an official mission to Nigeria. The aim of the mission was to consolidate the partnership/collaboration between Nigeria&#x2019;s focal and counterpart ministry to UNIDO - Federal Ministry of Industry, Trade and Investment (FMITI) and other relevant Ministries, Department and Agencies (MDAs) at the federal and state levels.
The PTC-MD met and presented UNIDO&#x2019;s global programmes and continued commitments to Federal Ministers of responsible for the; Ministry of Industry, Trade and Investment, Ministry of Science and Technology, Ministry of Water Resources and Rural Development, Ministry of Power, Works and Housing, Ministry of  Agriculture, and Ministry of Environment. And the Manufacturers Association of Nigeria
During discussions with the Minister of Environment, Ms. Amina Mohammed, (now UN Deputy Secretary General) took note of the broad cooperation developed between UNIDO and her Ministry when helping Nigeria meet its obligations under various multilateral environment agreements (MP, POPs), but also in areas such a renewable energy, waste management, and resource efficient and cleaner production.
Of special interest to the Minister Ms. Amina are a review of the regulatory environment, its effectiveness and adequacy in modern times. In this regards, UNIDO was asked to propose and present a good and viable strategy/mechanism that will assist the country to achieving better management of scarce natural resources (input material, water) as they will concern the industrial sector and also regarding energy, waste management and reduction of CO2 by industrials. The Hon. Minister finally asked UNIDO to work on how to introduce and mainstream RECP through an NCPC with a good operational business case.
The MD PTC also met with top excutive officials of the Manufactures Association of Nigeria (MAN),which will be one of the main counterparts of this proposed project. MAN has indicated their interests by proposing some companies from various subsectors in which RECP methodology, paractices can be demonstrated.
After the MD PTC&apos;s mission, the Nigerian Government has been engaging UNIDO for its technical assistance in the establishment of a Nigerian National Cleaner Production Centre (Nigeria -NCPC).  On 22 November 2016, UNIDO was invited to a stakeholder meeting on establishment of an NCPC in Nigeria on the request of the Minister of Environment (Ms Amina Mohammed). As an outcome of UNIDO&#x2019;s representation in that meeting, an official request letter has been sent and addressed to the MD PTC in March 2017, seeking UNIDO&#x2019;s assistance for the establishment of a National Cleaner Production Centre in Nigeria.
The Nigeria Country Programme (2013-2016) document supports establishment of a National Cleaner Production Centre in the country.
Outcome 4: Increased access to sustainable energy and promotion of green industry
Output 4.3: National Cleaner Production Centre (NCPC) established.
Indicators: (i) Environmentally friendly technologies (BAT/BEP) introduced, (ii) Water- efficient technologies/ processes introduced; (iii) No of trainings organized for Oganaized Private Sector (OPS)</narrative>
