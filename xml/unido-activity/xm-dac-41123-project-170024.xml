   <narrative xml:lang="EN">(Refer to SAP ID 170125) The Ministry of Industry of Myanmar has expressed a high priority for the proposed OECD-UNIDO project, as it recognizes the unmatched relevance the implementing partners building on their expertise and presence in the country. On the one hand, SME development and entrepreneurship, particularly led by youth and women has been identified as a key driver for socio-economic development in the country, and on the other hand, the project will support Myanmar in its efforts of aligning itself with ASEAN&#x2019;s objectives and policies, and thereby support Myanmar&#x2019;s integration into ASEAN and the ASEAN Economic Community.

The OECD has been supporting Myanmar through a number of initiatives, especially in areas relating to SME policy, particularly with a view to supporting the country&#x2019;s integration into ASEAN through improved policy alignment. Similarly, UNIDO has been supporting Myanmar in achieving higher levels of inclusive and sustainable industrial development through its technical assistance. In particular, it is implementing the final phase of the project on Fostering Pro-poor Growth and Inclusive MSME Development in Myanmar, which places great emphasis on youth and women entrepreneurship, and is acting as Co-Chair of the informal donor working group on private sector development (PSD) in Myanmar.
The proposed joint OECD-UNIDO project can significantly contribute to Myanmar&#x2019;s development objectives based on the following: (1) the project aims to address Myanmar&#x2019;s SME development needs in a comprehensive manner by anchoring its activities in empirical research, while remaining flexible to new challenges and needs, (2) the project builds on extensive experience, including in policy advice, entrepreneurship and SME development, both internationally and first-hand knowledge in Myanmar, (3) policy formulation is done with the involvement of all relevant stakeholders, to avoid any capability gaps, and finally (4) the project is in line with the legal, regulatory and administrative barriers to the implementation of action lines set by the ASEAN Strategic Action Plan for Small and Medium-sized Enterprises Development 2016-2025 (SAP).
The project foresees improved social and economic development in Myanmar through enhanced SME development as well as inclusive and sustainable entrepreneurship, led by youth and women, in selected strategic industrial sectors. This will be achieved by strengthening the ecosystem for sustainable SME development through targeted and inclusive policy formulation and implementation, through capacity building of the institutional and intermediary financial and non-financial support structures, as well as support of youth and women entrepreneurs. This will be complemented by improving integration into local, regional and global markets and supply chains through cluster development and multi-stakeholder partnerships, particularly with OECD counterparts, and through the alignment with the ASEAN SAP for improved integration in the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC). The current project proposal was thus greatly informed by the experience and expertise of the implementing partners, and has been presented at the Initiative for ASEAN Integration (IAI) Task Force.

The project will target a selection of value chains, which have been identified based on their promising growth prospects and their job creation potential for youth and women. The project aims at creating and  supporting 500 youth- and women-led enterprises, and thereby create 1500 direct and 3750 indirect jobs in the selected value chains.</narrative>
