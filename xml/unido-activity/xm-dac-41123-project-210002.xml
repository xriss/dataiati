   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In 2020, UNIDO and the Ministry of the Environment, Japan (MOEJ) has signed a Joint Declaration to facilitate development cooperation to advance progress on The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the commitments under the Paris Agreement. Among the envisioned actions is to support developing countries with their efforts in developing and implementing national climate actions i.e. Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) under the United Nations Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).

This project responds to an expression of interest from MOEJ in the framework of the Joint Declaration   to support, through technical cooperation activities, priority countries in Africa and South East Asia . The overall objective is to contribute to greenhouse gases emission reductions from industrial firms through two prong approach: 1) enhancing capacities for long-term decarbonization modelling and planning at the Macro level and 2) facilitating effective partnerships at the micro level involving firms from Japan and the beneficiary countries for applications of appropriate climate technology and innovation. An emphasis will be made on the inclusive dimension of technology and innovation facilitation through the integration of a gender and youth lens in the process of identifying and selecting of pilot applications.

The project outputs include;
1) Governmental actors in developing countries are supported with capacities and modeling tools to identify pathways and options for industry deep decarbonization, further contribute to better informed planning process in the context of Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and long-term deep decarbonization strategies, as well as identify sectors that can benefit from international technology facilitation and partnership with international firms.
2) Industrial firms in developing countries are supported in building effective climate technology and innovation cooperation and partnerships and demonstrate feasibility and climate impacts from climate technology and innovation cooperation between firms in Japan and in beneficiary countries.

Furthermore, the learning from the project will inform two global public goods. The first is a knowledge contribution towards enhanced modeling tools and reference case studies on pathways for deep decarbonization of society. The learning from output 2 would further inform ongoing negotiations under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement related to voluntary cooperation on transfer of mitigation outcomes , and more specifically scale up of actions under the Joint Crediting Mechanism (JCM) implemented by the Government of Japan with partner countries.

The project implementation and execution architecture builds on and integrates existing capabilities and expertise for maximum synergy and effective delivery. The project will be executed in close coordination with field offices, regional hubs and the Investment and Technology Promotion Office (ITPO) in Tokyo. The project activities will also draw on the expertise and lessons learned from the on-going programs, mainly the Low Carbon Low Emission Clean energy Technology Transfer programme (LCET), the Private Financing Advisory Network (PFAN) and the Global Cleantech Innovation Programme (GCIP).</narrative>
