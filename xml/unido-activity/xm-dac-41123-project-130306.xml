  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia through the Ministry for Industry has requested technical assistance from UNIDO to address the environmental challenges arising from slaughterhouse wastes. The request from the Ethiopian Government outlined a serious environmental &#x2018;problem&#x2019; relating to slaughter house wastes where disposal through open burning, discharge to waterways and informal unsanitary landfill was provoking justifiable environmental and public health concerns. The request for technical assistance arises in the context of the Ethiopian Growth and Transformation Plan [GTP] which looks to agriculture and agri-business as the growth engine to create prosperity and employment opportunity for a population that is growing at a rate of 2 million per annum. Slaughter- house wastes are a by-product of the Ethiopian livestock and meat value chain, which is ranked 10th global meat producer by volume and the largest in Africa but only holds 15% of the African meat market share. World markets are generally closed to Ethiopian meat because of livestock health concerns and the absence of a traceability system.
The GTP includes measures designed to access international meat markets where currently only 3.3% of the Ethiopian annual livestock kill is exported as value added packaged/ frozen meat product.
Moving from the premise that this environmental &#x2018;problem&#x2019; [as defined] is in fact the loss of a valuable economic resource, UNIDO proposes a closed loop eco-effective approach to exploiting this resource in a way that complements Ethiopian development policy. The UNIDO response will complement the GTP by intervening in the currently underdeveloped meat by-products segment to promote the establishment of a rendering industry to generate products and semi-products for downstream industrial manufacture of a spectrum of industrial and food products.
The project will support the creation of a pilot animal by-products value chain, with traceable linkage to the national livestock value chain, to develop products and semi-products as raw material for the industrial manufacture of a spectrum of commercial products from animal feedstuff to industrial fats, oils and greases to soaps, cleaners and detergents to cosmetic products to gelatin for local demand and international markets.
The project will have two key components:
&#x2022; Capacity building and institutional development for key Government institutions and private sector actors in the meat by-products value chain
&#x2022; Investment promotion to establish a pilot rendering plant and market driven manufacturing of commercial products from raw material or semi-products derived directly from animal by-products or from the rendering of such materials promoted and facilitated.
The project activities will range from technical feasibility and design studies, to the integration of policies and management systems and from capacity building through trade, investment and technology promotion throughout the pilot value chain to include investment in rendering and manufacturing of commercial product.
The project will provide a foundation for an industrial sector that will link primary agricultural production to secondary industrial manufacturing, which is one of the keystones of the GTP. The project will benefit from the coordinated and focused expertise and experience of several UNIDO technical branches led by the Environmental Management Branch and will have linkage to an international advisory body of experts.
The manufacture of high quality raw materials from traceable animal by products can be foundation of an internationally competitive industrial sector based on the manufacture of products from rendered animal by-product and through the creation of value added and employment generation the project will play its part in achieving inclusive sustainable industrial development [ISID] in Ethiopia.</narrative>
