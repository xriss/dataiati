   <narrative xml:lang="EN">UNIDO supports the Government of Egypt&#x2019;s (GoE) vision for sustainable development and its pillars of economic development, knowledge and innovation, environment and social justice, as outlined in its Sustainable Development Strategy: Egypt Vision 2030. UNIDO&#x2019;s efforts are also in line with the Ministry of Trade and Industry&#x2019;s Strategy 2016 - 2020 for industrial development and trade enhancement.

In the framework of the Lima Declaration, Member States entrusted the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) with the mandate to promote Inclusive and Sustainable Industrial Development (ISID). Following the 15th General Conference, in line with the new mandate, and to accelerate the ISID, UNIDO has developed an approach for the Programme for Country Partnership (PCP), which aims to offer sustainable solutions for long-term industrial development by leveraging resources through more effective and high-level national partnerships and international commitment.

Following the launch of the PCP programme in six pilot countries: Cambodia, Ethiopia, Kyrgyzstan, Morocco, Peru and Senegal, the Government of Egypt has shown interest in the development of a PCP. The UNIDO Executive Board, following the positive assessment of the criteria for admission to the development of a PCP, approved Egypt&#x2019;s proposal to establish the Programme in the country. Egypt then became the second Arab country to benefit from this large-scale UNIDO programme.

A preparatory phase for the formulation of the PCP was designed and organized in the first quarter 2019 and carried out from April 2019 to March 2020. During this phase, UNIDO, in close collaboration with the Government of Egypt, launched a country diagnostics and a national consultation process to develop the Programme and identify synergies between partner programmes and PCP interventions.
Following the UNIDO country diagnostics, focus areas of intervention have been identified by the Egyptian PCP counterparts in accordance with Egypt Vision 2030, Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and national industry related strategies and plans. The PCP technical cooperation framework resulted in the formulation of six components, namely: Industrial Policy and Governance, Investment Promotion, Green Industry, Smart Cities &amp; Sustainable Industrial Parks, Value Chains and Mainstreaming Industry 4.0. In addition to identifying priority sectors including Chemicals, Electronics, Food, Textiles &amp; Leather, and Furniture &amp; Handicrafts.

The Programme for Country Partnership (PCP) is owned by the Government of Egypt, as set by establishing the PCP National Coordination Body, consisting of representatives from relevant stakeholders, including private sector, to ensure alignment of objectives and synergies with identified, ongoing and future partners&#x2019; interventions.
This PCP document is the result of a systematic and continuous process of consultation of UNIDO with its Egyptian counterparts, IFIs, DFIs, UN agencies and international donors, with a view to defining the required technical cooperation. This support framework of technical assistance will contribute to achieving the industrialization objectives of the Government set in Egypt Vision 2030, as well as the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the 2030 Agenda of the United Nations.

The Programme of technical assistance focuses on sectors with high growth potential and is planned on six components, to synergize with other industrial development programs and pool additional resources and expertise from various public and private actors, as well as international partners and ultimately, to generate the greatest impact on SDGs in Egypt. Synergies and integrated interventions of PCP Egypt will leverage financial and non-financial resources to support the impressive progress of the country&#x2019;s industrial development. It will contribute to the achievement of Egypt&#x2019;s objective to be an active global player responding to international developments, maximizing value added, generating sustainable and productive jobs, and the real GDP per capita reaching high-middle income countries level by 2030.</narrative>
