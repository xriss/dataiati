   <narrative xml:lang="EN">UNIDO and UNDP received a joint Letter of Endorsement, dated 27 February 2019, endorsing the proposal of Government of South Sudan on the formulation and execution support to the project &#x201C;Integrated Watershed approaches for climate resilience in agro-pastoral landscapes&#x201D;. The project aims to address a range of environmental, land degradation and social economic challenges in the targeted agro pastoral landscape areas and associated value chains.

The project objective is to promote climate resilience and adaptation capacity building amongst agricultural and pastoral communities of South Sudan and addresses the LDCF/GEF strategy objective and outcome indicator on technologies and innovative solutions are adapted and deployed to enhance resilience. The envisaged global environmental benefits include 75Hactares of landscapes under improved practices mostly to be achieved with interventions under UNDP coordination. It is also expected that a total number of 10,000 direct and indirectly targeted beneficiaries (60%F and 40%M) will be reached primarily through joint UNIDO and UNDP contributions.

UNIDO interventions will focus on the promotion of small scale agribusinesses, and triggering scaled community centre investments in improved agro and food processing and preservation technology and working facilities. Small scale businesses will also be able to access adapted skill training to increase the value of agricultural products, minimize post harvest losses and increase the supply of quality and safe products to markets.  By building on the past and ongoing development cooperation, the project is expected to promote dissemination of learned lesson and scaling up of existing baseline initiatives through GEF 7 LDCF and co-financing contributions to other areas and value chains, and between the respective project implementation agencies and Government of South Sudan. Tentatively suggested target areas across the green belt of South Sudan include Yei, Maridi, Yanbio and Tombra, which are particularly fruit-rich areas, albeit facing evident capacity challenges in preservation and market access. Direct beneficiaries of UNIDO supported training activities are expected to be organized community groups or clusters of small scale, informal and microenterprises within the targeted geographical areas and value chains; reaching at least 500 youth and women as direct small and micro enterprise level beneficiaries; with production centres operational in at least 5 communities; and 2,000 total direct and indirect beneficiaries in the project targeted areas and at national level.</narrative>
