  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The overall goal of this project is to demonstrate and foster value addition and to diversify sources of incomes for pastoralists communities with special focus on women and youth by commercializing mursik and optimizing the functioning of the dairy value chain in Narok county, Kenya.

Mursik is a traditional curdled milk product produced by the largely pastoralist Kalenjin and Maasai communities in Kenya that has been in existence for the last 300 years.  The pastoralist production system is characterized by seasonal or annual mobility of livestock in search of pasture over large areas of rangelands. The pastoralists production system is increasingly failing to provide sustainable livelihood as droughts are frequent and the rainy seasons are short over which period the pasture land is under water. Overall productivity and incomes in these communities are extremely low.

Commercialization of mursik in Narok county therefore presents opportunities to:
I. Increase incomes earned from dairying for pastoralist producers by establishing backward linkages from processor to producers in view of building the capacity of the producers to increase raw milk production meeting quality and quantity necessary to keep the processing facility operational year round;
II. To promote climate resilient dairy production systems;and
III. Meet the growing demand for traditional African foods.
Rising awareness of the health benefits of fermented foods, urbanization and migration has resulted in marked increase in interest and demand for probiotic fermented foods. Many spontaneously fermented milk and cereal based products are traditionally produced in the country and form an integral part of traditional diet. These foods also play a central role of enhancing food security and income generation. These traditional products are however, mostly processed under unhygienic conditions and from poor quality raw materials and the finished product quality is inconsistent. Consequently, the traditional household level production system cannot support increased mursik production to meet the growing market demand that requisites product standardization, packaging and distribution.</narrative>
