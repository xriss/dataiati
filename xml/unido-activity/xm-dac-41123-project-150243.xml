   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The main goal of the proposed project is to assist the Government of Serbia in its efforts to promote the economic empowerment of women and youth, through the creation of job opportunities in the productive sectors of the economy and by supporting entrepreneurship development. To this end, the project will adopt an integrated approach and address the institutional and enterprise levels to assist the Government of Serbia, local public and private institutions, and other relevant stakeholders to create an enabling environment for the promotion and encouragement of youth and women entrepreneurship as well as skills development.

The project&#x2019;s focus lies on establishing an entrepreneurial ecosystem, which builds on multi-stakeholder partnerships, and which improves the economic and social participation of youth and women by increasing their opportunities for productive activities. This will be achieved by harnessing the potential of youth and women as innovative entrepreneurs, and consequently as agents of change to tackle social and economic challenges in their local communities. To this end, the project will strengthen the skills of entrepreneurs and generally youth and women, as well as reinforce the intermediate financial and non-financial support structures, for these to provide quality services. At the same time, the project will   strengthen the dialogue in the area of entrepreneurship promotion and development and economic empowerment of women and youth, while building business linkages, and engaging national and international investors, including engaging with the diaspora.

The project will thereby support the Government of Serbia in realizing the priorities it has anchored in the National Youth Strategy 2015-2025, the Strategy to Support Development of SMEs and Entrepreneurship 2015-2020, the National Program for Youth Employment, and the national project &#x201C;Year of Entrepreneurship&#x201D;. These priorities include MSME development, the development of small-scale income generating activities particularly for women and youth, and entrepreneurship. The recently agreed Development Partnership Framework (DPF) 2016-2020 reflects these priorities, within which the proposed project will be embedded. Additionally, by strengthening the business environment for entrepreneurship and light manufacturing to drive economic growth in an inclusive and environmentally sustainable manner, the project will also contribute to Serbia&#x2019;s efforts pertaining to EU accession.

Furthermore, the project will contribute to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals and the Agenda 2030, given the focus it places on improving the livelihoods of youth and women through improved employment opportunities, and is in line with UNIDO&#x2019;s strategy of promoting Inclusive and Sustainable Industrial Development. The project will target a selection of value chains, which have been identified based on their promising growth prospects and their job creation potential for youth and women. The project aims at creating 3000 jobs in the selected value chains, support 1000 youth- and women-led enterprises, and develop suitable funding mechanisms for SMEs development.

The project foresees a 6 months inception phase, where details about the supported institutions, funding schemes, and skills required by the industries will be defined and approved by the project steering committee.</narrative>
