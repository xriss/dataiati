   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Severe ecosystem damage is continuously being caused and extended due to unsustainable agriculture practices. The challenge remains lack of awareness amongst the people about the consequences of their agriculture practices and also the profits they can receive if the correct practices are adopted. With agriculture being looked at in a negative view as a profitable sector, the youth does not look at it as a lucrative profession and the entrepreneurial activities attached to this sector also remain minimal. Most line department focus on increasing productivity pertaining to their departments. This has sometimes led to glut in the production, followed by season of scarcity. It has at times led to setting up of large plants to process excess when the production was barely enough for local consumption. There is a need to ensure a holistic, coordinated and sustainable area development strategy for optimal utilization of resources. This needs to take into account the farmers perspectives. The project aims at preserving local biodiversity and indigenous knowledge in Mizoram improving livelihood options for local communities. The project seeks to come up with most viable models/ways of addressing some of the most critical challenges in Mizoram and support the state government, communities and relevant stakeholders to showcase modalities that would: (i) lead to better management of natural resources and address local issues of providing work opportunities to women and youth from natural resource management and biodiversity preservation, (ii) address common trans-boundary threats from tree and plant pests, animal diseases to local vegetation and livestock; (iii) address issues of farm and non-farm employment; (iv) lead to preserving the indigenous knowledge for resource management and increase the yield of crops and other forest produce such as bamboo.The project will work in selected two districts of Mizoram to address some of the issues that were identified by the Joint UN Technical Team that conducted a field visit in May 2014. At the state level, the UN initiative will work with the government to improve planning process for protection of the state&#x2019;s ecosystem, identification of market for local agriculture, horticulture and select non-timber forest produce, and impart training and skills development to explore opportunities for livelihoods. Addressing gender concerns and strengthening livelihood opportunities for rural women is one of the key priorities of the intervention.</narrative>
