  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Colombia &#x2013; an important economy in Latin America has developed its energy sector mainly with hydropower. Colombia depends basically on hydro power, 70 percent of Colombia&apos;s electricity is generated by hydroelectric plants and there is currently a gap in efficiency and greening of SHP sites in the country. Several of them were installed many years back and may need fresh look and also country seems attracted to large size while less attention on high benefits from small scale hydro exploration. Surrounded by many neighboring countries also having high potential of small hydro could be an opportunity for Colombia to take lead in Small Hydro Power (SHP) development in programmatic manner leading to establishing fully functioning manufacturing and business institution dealing SHP in the region.

Small Hydro solutions are especially relevant in the context of peace building efforts in Colombia. Several decades of conflict have deprived many regions of productive and energy investments. Also the so called &#x201C;zonas veredales&#x201D;, where ex-FARC guerillas are settling, require productive and energy infrastructure.</narrative>
