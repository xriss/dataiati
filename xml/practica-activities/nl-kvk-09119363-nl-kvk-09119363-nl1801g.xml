   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Netherlands WASH SDG Programme aims to reach an improved WASH situation for all. This includes the hard to reach households; the poorest of the poor and those living in remote or slum areas, men and women. The Programme will contribute by sustainably improving access to and use of sanitation and improving hygiene behaviours for at least 2 million people, and access to and use of safe drinking water for at least 450,000 people in the coming five years. As sustainability will only be realised when equal access and use for women and men is guaranteed, the programme will mainstream gender equality and social inclusion in the whole programme cycle. Our programme activities will target those households in communities and cities that have insufficient access to WASH facilities and/or practice unhealthy WASH behaviours which results in the entire community living in an unhealthy environment. Consequently women and men of entire communities and neighbourhoods in cities will benefit from programme activities. As a result, the WASH SDG programme is expected the reach over 7.4 million people through project activities.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The WASH SDG Programme aims to sustainably deliver access to, and use of, safe drinking water for at least 450,000 people; and improve access to, and use of, sanitation and improve hygiene behaviours for at least 2 million people. The WASH SDG Consortium is formed by the partners WASH Alliance International (WAI ), SNV and Plan Netherlands. In alliance with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (DGIS / IGG), the Programme responds to the Dutch commitment to contribute to the Sustainable Development Goals, particularly SDG 6, with the aim to reach an improved WASH situation for all. Particularly, to contribute to safe water and clean toilets for respectively 30 million and 50 million people, as communicated by Minister Ploumen during the Global Citizen 2015 Earth Day celebrations in Washington DC on 18 April 2015. The programme will be implemented between July 2017 to December 2022 in Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Indonesia, Nepal, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia, with two or more sub-national level programmes (sub-programmes) developed per country. These countries all have significant numbers of people with poor access to and use of WASH services, either in rural areas or in densely populated areas with uncontrolled urbanisation and deteriorating water security. In all these countries the consortium members have long-term presence and ongoing WASH programmes, as well as established influence at the national level.</narrative>
