   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This activity is ongoing, since the communicators/VC coaches are trained during the missions of the O3 lead expert based on the identified needs and specific situations. In the first project year, 1 VC coach was trained in Ghana, 1 VC coach in Burkina Faso, 2 VC coaches in Togo and 1 VC coach in STP. At end of project year 2, the following VC coaches were trained and employed directly by the project: 2 VC coaches in Ghana, 3 VC coaches in Burkina, 2 VC coaches in Togo and 5 VC coaches in STP. The VC coaches have trained during Project Year 2 a series of 60 VC actors. The value chain coaches together with the lead expert have been organising during the second project year a series of specific workshops on specific value chain developments, where the VC coaches have also contributed to the training of the participants. Thus, around 80 VC actors were additionally trained in the four project countries.</narrative>
