   <narrative xml:lang="FR">OM4D and SNV Burkina Faso signed a memorandum of understanding to continue the joint effort to develop the shea nuts value chain in Burkina Faso, in the areas of intervention of OM4D and SNV-led VC development projects. The agreement includes terms on the training of the shea VC actors that could not take place in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and travel restrictions. This agreement also ensures the sustainability of OM4D as the SNV partner project was launched in 2021 and will be implemented until 2023. The VC development impact of OM4D will last beyond the closure of the project in January 2022.</narrative>
