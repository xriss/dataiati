   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The development of a common strategy has begun in Year 2 of the project, where the stakeholders&apos; meetings are focusing on further developing the National Action Plans based on the needs and priorities identified in the stakeholders&apos; analysis. Of crucial importance is also the establishment of a communication culture that will allow stakeholders&#x2019; exchanges and recognition and integration of various needs coming from various stakeholders&#x2019; groups. This communication culture will ideally outgrow the life duration of our project and will contribute to further developing the organic sectors in the four countries. The stakeholders&apos; meetings are currently being utilised in order to explore the communication strategy and the future development of the NAPs, with Burkina Faso and Togo being already very advanced in the process.</narrative>
