  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This activity focuses on an analysis of the selected value chains in the four project countries by integrating the M4P approach and identifying and addressing key constraints that result in market failures for smallholder farmers. The focus lies on developing market systems by addressing underlying causes, rather than symptoms, of weak performance. In order to ensure the same level of understanding concerning the M4P approach among the project team, and to explore the possible directions of intervention, on 28-29 of May a M4P workshop was organised in Bonn. An external M4P specialist was hired for this occasion &#x2013; Raphael Dischl, Senior Advisor Sustainable Agriculture &amp; Food Security (Helvetas), based on his experience in applying the M4P methodology in African countries. The M4P method is currently being used by the O3 lead expert in the value chain analysis on the 4 selected VCs. The VC analysis will be available in the second project year.</narrative>
