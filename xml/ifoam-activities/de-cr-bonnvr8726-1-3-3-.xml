   <narrative xml:lang="EN">A National Action Plan will be developed with the stakeholders in all four project countries. Currently, different levels of development can be observed: in countries like Ghana and Burkina Faso, where there is already a national organisation in place, the first steps towards the development of a national strategy were already taken. As previously reported, Togo and STP had made less progress than the other two countries, also due to less articulated umbrella organisations that were not fully functional or not in place. Remarkable progress has been undertaken by Togo, where a first workshop took place in December 2019. The workshop reunited representatives of the Ministry of Agriculture, GIZ, and various stakeholders like the OM4D project team and the newly founded ANA-Bio - the Togolese umbrella organisation. The workshop was conducted by IFOAM-Organics International experts and defined the main strategic directions in relation to the development of the organic sector. The workshop has been followed by a series of stakeholders&apos; meetings to further define the activities in the National Action Plan. In Burkina Faso, a working group has already been set and had its first meeting in February 2020.</narrative>
