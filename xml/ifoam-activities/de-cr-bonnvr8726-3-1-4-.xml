   <narrative xml:lang="EN">A first series of workshops was already held in March 2018 in all four project countries in order to explore the needs of the value chain actors and the main intervention priorities. This activity was continued with further workshops in October 2018, with the O3 expert using the framework provided by the quarterly stakeholders&#x2019; meetings in order to investigate potential changes in terms of needs, and to periodically revise the action plans and intervention priorities. The O3 expert has subsequently further continued to use the opportunity of the stakeholder meetings being organised quarterly in the four project countries to further carry on the value chain workshops.</narrative>
