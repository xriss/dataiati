CSHEP is a registered community-based organization that is focused on training small-scale farmers, its major goal is to induce farmers to use sustainable organic and bio-intensive gardening to improve production and earnings, become food secure, and safeguard the environment. The PGS Ghana team again was welcomed by active members of PGS groups in Kenya, also one of the hosts and the CSHEP team. The PGS Ghana team interacted with CSHEP members on their ways of operation and PGS system in their community. This organization has over 3000 organic farmers, out of these trained organic farmers only the loyal, interested, and ready to support organic market farmers are then allowed to join PGS in this community.</narrative>
