  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed project is based on the concept that the people of NWA have seen a protracted state of displacement in the aftermath of military operation. In the year, 2015, the govt. initiated return process and consequently significant number of families returned to their place of origin. These families are facing number of challenges in rehabilitation of infrastructure, education, livelihood and health. Health being one of the SGDs needs special attention to address the PHC needs of the returned families with objective that returned men, women, boys, girls and elderly community members have access to essential lifesaving health services that could significantly contribute to reduction in morbidity and mortality. Before grant request, KAMORE conducted RNA and assessed that the returned families are in dire need of primary health care services because of the reason that the existing health facilities are not in a position to deliver the services due to damages to HFs, non-availability of technical staff, equipments and other basic standards. In order to address the immediate primary health care needs of the returned men, women, boys and girls, children, elderly and disabled persons, KAMORE will provide health services to 35000 returned population in the catchment areas of HF, BHU Haider Kheil, CHC Zakir Kheil and BHU Wariki Sein Tang. Before services delivery, the target HFs will be functionalized by repairing them as the target facilities are partially damaged and are not functional. KAMORE, therefore, proposes the revitalization of the HFs for strengthening the health services during project life and after project on sustainable basis.  At the time of project implementation all stakeholders like FDMA, Pak Army, Agency Health Department and Political administration will be coordinated for smooth implementation and services delivery.
KAMORE will provide PHC services to the returnee men, women, boys and girls, children, elderly and disabled persons through 3 medical teams. 
The 3 health facilities will provide OPD services where patients will be examined, and will be given free medicines on prescription.  Similarly Medicines will be purchased as per WHO guidelines and standard. The proposed 3 medical teams will also provide MNCH services to (CBAs) ANC, PNC, safe delivery, growth monitoring. The reproductive health services will include family planning counseling, methods and delivery contraceptives etc. Referral mechanism will be established and strengthened. The normal cases will be dealt in these health facilities, while complicated cases falling in the domain of secondary health care would be referred to THQ, AHQ Miran Shah or DHQ Bannu by providing ambulance services.
The project will integrate various approaches, Social mobilization (SM) teams would deliver program introductions in the catchment areas to ensure participatory approach by involving the community and strengthen outreach mechanism. SM teams will form 6 LQT Each LQT will have 15 members. Out of the 15 members, 5 will be the executive body. 30 Midwives will be identified and trained and would be provided with TBAs kits. Training module will be developed in Urdu to enhance their skills for further effective services to ensure quality services for safe delivery and reduce MMR and IMR.1000 CDK will be provided to the pregnant women for safe deliveries. Similarly 1000 BK will be given for the newborn babies to save their health and protect from infections and diseases. 
Social Mobilizers will conduct 320 H-Hygiene sessions and will educate the male, female and children with best hygiene practices. KAMORE along with repair of HFs would also provide furniture, medical equipment and solar systems for maintaining cold chain. Keeping in view the sustainability, rehabilitated building, solar system, medical equipment and furniture will be handed over to the target HF after project completion to strengthen and support the provision of improved health services.</narrative>
