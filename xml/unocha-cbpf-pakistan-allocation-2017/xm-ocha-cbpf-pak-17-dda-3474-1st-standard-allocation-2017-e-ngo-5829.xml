   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The summary consists of the following points: the Problem and its background, needs identification and its Solutions. 

1) The ongoing complex emergency including displacement and return processes (2008-2017) have overburdened the already fragile education system in FATA. Most of the tribes living in recently de&#x2010;notified villages of Ghulam Khan and Datta Khel in sub-division Miran Shah and also in subdivision Mir Ali are in desperate condition, as there is no body to support children&#x2019;s education in these areas upon their return to home. The findings of the re-verification mission of OCHA in March 2017 have reconfirmed the challenges and miseries of the returnees across all sectors The literacy ratio of girls is below 2% whilst it is 10 per cent for FATA. Half of the 4-9-years-old children are out of school (EMIS Report 2015-16). It was noted that the lack of education facilities has had a negative impact on girl&#x2019;s education. Therefore, there is a sort of uncertainty in the lives of parents and students regarding education. 

2) In order to discuss the situation in waziristan, Philanthrope had meetings at the Directorate of education in FATA Secretariat regarding innovative solutions to education revival through quick response strategy in the shape of installation of quality standard solarized prefabricated schools installation taking weeks instead of months and years. It is worth mentioning that Philanthrope has completed 2 prefab school structures in the return areas of central Kurram. The DoE FATA has given its consent to issue approval for the installation of new prefab schools particularly in the fully damaged school sites at Mir Ali and Miran Shah sub-division.

3) In such a backdrop, Philanthrope proposes to revive learning opportunities fastly in 12 solarized schools (6 boys and 6 girls). Out of them 8 prefabricated school structures would be installed while 4 non-functional schools would be rehabilitated for a total of 1200 returnee children (50% girls) having an improved, accessible, safe and quality education program for them along with hiring of 5 female para teachers and their capacity building program in order to rationalize students teachers ratio the formation and trainings of 12 TIJs (6 mother groups and 6 father groups). Philanthrope is having all the expertise and technical personnel (males and females) recently trained in 2016/17 in its back to school project at Kurram agency who can be of great help to this project as well. There will be refresher courses on English language skills and teaching methodologies for learners on post displacements needs along with mentoring sessions, psycho-social, lifesaving skills, DRR, child friendly spaces (CFSs), education in emergencies (EiE) how to cope with emergencies, DRR, Peace amp tolerance, conflict resolution, health hygiene and nutrition class planning methodology and how to conduct a class in such a way as to ensure that there is a child-centered, child-friendly approach to learning and one day each for every TIJs strengthening about their roles and responsibilities. Moreover, all girls and boys in the targeted schools will be provided with free books, bags, ECE/ Learning kits, Recreational Kits, School in Box (SIB) Kits etc. All supplies and inventories issued to schools would be recorded in stock register having signatures of head Master to it. Philanthrope would be facilitating the DoE/AEO office to help monitor various phase of the project from launching to completion, spot checks, distribution ceremonies, warehousing materials, supplies, inventories, teachers hiring and trainings. For all these intervention, Philanthrope requires a total budget of about US $500,000/- in order to make learning a fun for all girls and boys students. We know we cannot change the entire complex emergency situation (2008-2017) with tiny funds and in few months&#x2019; time but this can be the very first step towards a higher goal.</narrative>
