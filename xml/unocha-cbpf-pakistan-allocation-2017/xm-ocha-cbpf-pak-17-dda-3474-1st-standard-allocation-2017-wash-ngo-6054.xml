   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project will provide improved WASH services in 23 Govt. Schools (Both Girls and Boys) and 13 Health Facilities through new installation of water supply schemes (Solar Pressure Pumps), construction of latrines and provision of improved hygienic hand washing places. Each school and health facility will be reached respectively for the provision of clean drinking water source, construction of latrines and structure for hand washing. The designed structure for latrines in schools will be 3 stance (1 staff/teachers + 2 students) whereas in health facilities a single structure 2 separate latrines (1 Male+ 1 Female) will be constructed. In girls schools the designed structure for latrines will equip adequate facilities for managing menstrual hygiene. In construction of latrines especially in health facilities accessible toilet along with essential accessories are designed to accommodate people with physical disabilities.
To maintain the hygienic condition of constructed latrine each target school and health facility will be provided latrine cleaning kits which will help with reduction of odor in the latrine and also reduce chances of vector breeding that could lead to fecal oral contamination and related diseases such as diarrhea and malaria. In each constructed latrine in schools and health facilities a separate cleaning kit will be provided. A total 95 latrine cleaning kits (69 schools + 26 health facilities) will be provided.
In addition to provision of clean drinking water and sanitation facilities in schools and health facilities, the project is aiming to organize 10 trainings for teacher and health facilities staff on hygiene promotion. 150 individuals (50 health staff+ 100 teachers) will be trained on improved hygiene practices. To improve the personal hygiene practices of school children the project plans to target 4,680 school children both girls and boys through school specific hygiene campaigns in 23 girls and boys schools by using CHAST and C2C approaches. Sessions will focus on children representing a cluster of households, different social background, economic groups and age.
The project has been introduced with the concerned departments and they endorsed PRDS with a list of Schools and Health facilities for the delivery of proposed WASH service. (Letters of endorsement by the departments along with lists of schools and health facilities are uploaded in document tab of GMS.)
PRDS will technically evaluate the departments endorsed schools and health facilities in line with proposed scope of work. Schools which are operational with greater number of student enrollment and required the proposed project services will be prioritized. Likewise focus will be given to health facilities availing health services to high populous catchment areas without access to improved WASH facilities. 
Though schools and health facilities have been identified. However, it could be replaced with comparatively more alarming and needy schools and health facilities through permission of concerned authorities.
Before to intervene, PRDS will sign MoU with the respective concerned departments and they will be take in loop on the designed project scope of work in schools and health facilities. Upon completion of project work, the schools and health facilities will be handed over to the departments and further they will be responsible for its future maintenance and operation. 
The project will also builds the capacity of the schools and health facilities staff/teachers to manage the water supply schemes and sanitation facilities in place.</narrative>
