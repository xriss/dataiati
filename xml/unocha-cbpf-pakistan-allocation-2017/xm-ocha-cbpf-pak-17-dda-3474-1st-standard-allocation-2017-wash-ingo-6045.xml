   <narrative xml:lang="EN">According to PHPF strategy, the inter cluster mission reports indicates that before displacement IDPs used insecure drinking water sources, and mostly practiced defecation. It was also observed that there were no water supply schemes in the areas with a few exceptions of water pumps in some houses which were not functional. The community indicated that during displacement (due programs of the humanitarian community and government) they have given up the practice of open defecation and also requested support for the provision of clean drinking water in the areas of return. Hence, household-level latrine construction will be an essential area of engagement with returning communities. The WASH cluster findings revealed that 60-70% of returned population in the 09 Tehsils of NWA are relying on unsafe water sources. The current water sources and schemes are overburdened and about 70% adult women have to travel around 1km to 3kms in the mountains and hills for collections, transport and storage of drinking and domestic use water. 
81% population do not have access to latrines. Out of this 40% practicing open defecation which leading to faecal oral contamination whereas the remaining 41% using conventional arrangements at HH level. 45% population practice inadequate solid waste management and the hygiene conditions are very poor which leading to water borne diseases. 99% of the respondents do not treat water at HH level as result 31% instances of diarrhea mainly in children under 5 years of age and 26% instances of Malaria in 0-5 years, 38% in 6-17 Years and 26% instances in 18-55age group.
