  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">UNHCR will provide urgent lifesaving CCCM and Protection support in Bria to those displaced by the large-scale ongoing violence across Haute-Kotto prefecture. UNHCR and its partners will continue to respond to the gaps and needs that persist as a result of the continuing turmoil caused by the violence. Building on the activities and measures that have already been put in place as part of the agency&apos;s existing project in the zone, UNHCR will ramp up its presence to correspond to the vastly increased magnitude of the crisis. Rather than regular missions, the agency will ensure a constant presence in Bria, and will increase the size of the CCCM and protection teams to cover the ever-expanding number of sites. Fixed counselling centres will be developed, complementing and deepening the earlier response, whilst CCCM assistance will be scaled up systematically to meet the needs of sites that are now far larger than had been anticipated at the beginning of the crisis. Protection monitoring activities will cover not only these expanded camps, but also the zones of Bria in which many displaced households are staying with host families. SGBV prevention and response activities will be provided alongside the monitoring activities, with the continuation of Quick Response Teams and the reinforcement of assistance and referral mechanisms for survivors of SGBV.

A key component of the project will be accurate data collection, both for CCCM and Protection activities. This will make use of existing cluster data collection tools to enusre consistency throughout. It is also vital that this is understood in the context of UNHCR and COOPI&apos;s existing collaboration in the zone. The proposed activities a vital expansion of a pre-existing project, equipping it to deal with a vastly expanded population. Activities that were orginally imagined for 8,000 beneficiaries need to be further supported to reach over 38,000 to respond to the increased magnitude of the crisis. The lower-scale basic project that was already in place, and on which the new activities will build, ensures that UNHCR will be able to achieve more within the relatively restrained proposed budget as there are very few administrative and support costs that will be incurred - they have already been met and addressed during the set-up phase of the first wave of the project. With it and its partner&apos;s presence in the zone, and as cluster lead for Protection and CCCM, UNHCR is uniquely placed to provide a rapid, expert response to the needs, making use of its data collection tools, secure databse systems, and comprehensive understanding of coordination structures.</narrative>
