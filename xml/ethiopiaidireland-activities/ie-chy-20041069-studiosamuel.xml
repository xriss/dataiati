   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Studio Samuel&apos;s Menstrual Kit Initiative is a peer-to-peer training +
education workshop that involves the community and is a proven arm
of our curriculum. 100 students&#x2014;girls 9-18 years old&#x2014;learn basic
sewing (an employable skill in our community) while making menstrual
kits that keep their peers in school when they have their periods.
Together, the girls create, sew, package, distribute, and do a formal
presentation on menstrual health for their peers in nearby villages.
Every girl receives a menstrual kit.
At our center&#x2019;s Sewing Lab, the girls organize production of patternmaking,
cutting fabric, sewing, and then packaging the kits, which
include reusable/hand-washable materials:
&#x2022; liners
&#x2022; pads
&#x2022; soap
&#x2022; washcloth
&#x2022; 2 pairs underwear
&#x2022; plastic bags for soiled pads
&#x2022; instructional sheets on menstruation and how to care for kits
&#x2022; drawstring bag to hold supplies
Each kit lasts two to three years.
For the final step, some of the girls travel with our social worker and
our licensed health officer to nearby rural schools, where many of
their peers lack access to proper feminine-hygiene supplies&#x2026;and are
at high-risk of dropping out of school. Before distributing the kits, our
students lead an educational presentation and answer questions
about their menstrual cycles as well as how to properly use and care
for the kits. Because this subject is often considered taboo, the girls
open a dialogue and help others become more comfortable with what
to expect and how to handle their monthly cycles.</narrative>
