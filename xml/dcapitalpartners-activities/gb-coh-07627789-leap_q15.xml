   <narrative xml:lang="EN">LEAP (the &#x2018;Lending for Education in Africa Partnership&#x2019;) is a social lending fund that provides
affordable finance to youth from low and middle-income backgrounds in East Africa who are
pursuing their higher education and cannot fully cover the cost of their higher education
through conventional loans, bursaries, scholarships or other means. In addition to its tailormade
loans, LEAP also offers its LEAP Fellows career readiness and financial literacy training,
and forges partnerships to create pathways to gainful employment for its supported students.
LEAP is managed by a dedicated team at Volta Capital, in partnership with the Mandela
Institute for Development Studies (MINDS), InHive, Equity Group Foundation (EGF), and
Lundin Foundation. LEAP has been active since late 2017 and has over 800 Fellows enrolled in
its programme as of 30 September 2020, across 5 Kenyan universities and 3 TVET institutions .
Central to LEAP&#x2019;s business model is the revolving nature of its social lending fund, whereby
loan repayments from its LEAP Fellows are re-deployed for future cohorts of Fellows over
time. At the same time, the LEAP fund leverages concessionary funding by blending it with
additional private sector impact investments, as it scales and proves the sustainability of its
business model.</narrative>
