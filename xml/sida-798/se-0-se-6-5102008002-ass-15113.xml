An illustrative example of work from Indonesia:
A century ago, the South Sumatra Province was covered in forest. According to the Ministry of Environment and Forestry, over 24 million hectares of tropical forests have been destroyed between 1990 and 2015. The main underlying cause is the distribution of corrupted licenses given to plantation firms. During elections, the number of permits for mining, plantation and forest exploitation concessions increases with 300 %.
The project initiated the use of an inclusive process to work with Corruption Risk Assessment of falsified licenses in the forestry sector in South Sumatra. In this process local authorities, civil society organisations and private sector representatives were gathered to identify the most harmful risks for the environment and develop a mitigation plan. This plan will be used for prevention and investigation of corrupt licenses at the local level. This model to work with an inclusive risk assessment will be replicated in other areas with protected forests in Indonesia.
3. Regional anti-corruption forums, networks and institutions in Southeast Asia supported.
Under the project, 25 technical assistance activities were conducted to support regional anti-corruption fora, networks and institutions in Southeast Asia. These activities reached 2251 beneficiaries in 11 countries over the period of 2014-2018. These activities included supporting South-South learning and regional initiatives with capacity building components. Examples are the Southeast Asia Parties against corruption (SEA-PAC) and the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) and support for the institutionalization of networks, methods of collaboration and sharing of information.
The regional forums and capacity building events have provided platforms for anti-corruption and law enforcement&#xA0;agencies, criminal justice institution, line ministries and civil society organisations. Examples of topics that have been covered&#xA0; are Wildlife and forest crimes, ethics in the judiciary, access to information and participatory decision making, witness and whistle blower protection, innovative tools against corruption, UNCAC implantation: liability of legal persons and business integrity, financial and corruption investigation, cross-border investigation, asset recovery.
UNODC provided a platform for anti-corruption practitioners in the region on the interplay between corruption and gender dynamics.
&#xA0;
4. Private sector, civil society groups and academia supported to promote and implement anti-corruptions strategies.
The project carried out 34 technical assistance activities to support private sector, civil society groups and academia t to promote and implement anti-corruption strategies. They reached 2115 beneficiaries in all 11 target countries over the period of 2014-2018. These included 79 civil society organisations in the region, cooperating with various private sector actors and tech companies. UNODC facilitated and provided platforms for policy dialogue, capacity building and information sharing.
The project has also contributed to the realization of:
Agenda 2030
In relation to the Agenda 2030, the project has contributed to SDG 16 on justice, specifically target 16.5 on reduction of corruption and bribery. The thematic risk assessment and mitigation measures used has supported national institutions to to prevent corruption risks in rural areas, public procurement int eh forestry sector having a positive effect on SDG 6 on clean water, SDG9 on industry and innovation, SDG 15 life on land and SDG 13 Climate action.
Sida makes the assessment that this has been good project which managed to reach results in an effective way.
Human rights
Major human rights violations in the region are linked to corruption. The project has worked on corruption risks related to Indigenous Peoples, forced labor, right to information, whistle blower protection, access to justice, land rights and other treats to livelihoods. The human rights principles of accountability, transparency and rule of law has been included in many of the activities. The inclusion of support to civil society, in the project, has contributed to increase their capacity and knowledge about corruption and lead to a coalition of CSO which decided to report on corruption and human rights. Public trust in anti-corruption agencies has increased and the number of corruption cases reported by the public has increased substantially. &#xA0;
Gender equality&#xA0;
After a slow start on gender equality, the project managed to step up its engagement in the gender equality dimensions of corruption. The organisations of the regional meeting for anti-corruption agencies and enforcement institutions, in collaboration with UNODC HQ, demonstrated that more knowledge and understanding of gender equality and corruption is needed and that gender equality must be mainstreamed into all anti-corruptions activities and they must measure impact for gender equality.
Sida makes the conclusion that the project has reached good results.</narrative>
