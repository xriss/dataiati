    <narrative xml:lang="EN">SANDEE made 52 research grants in three thematic areas between January 2012 and June 2015. About 30% of the grantees were women. The grants were made on multiple topics such as Energy and Climate Change Economics, Pollution and Health, Water and Sustainable Agriculture etc. During the grant period including the no-cost extension (January 2012 &#x2013; June 2017), SANDEE published 60 working papers and 48 policy briefs as direct outputs of research grants. Most of the researchers who completed SANDEE research grants submitted their manuscript for scientific publication for the first time. Publication of SANDEE working paper was a big milestone in their research carrier. Short policy briefings accompanied these working papers for non-technical readers, mostly policy makers from South Asia. As a part of facilitating the growth of homegrown evidence base for linking research to policy in the interlinkage between development and the environment, SANDEE Associates and Staff published 90+ peer reviewed papers in international journals and book chapters since 2012. These publications have been used by many universities as reference materials in the classrooms and as examples of case studies in addition to providing evidence base for informed policymaking. Generally over 50% of the trainees in&#xA0;the environmental economics course are Universities faculty, who use their learning to teach their students.
For example, Bangladeshi SANDEE grantee Dr Ziaul Haider who attended&#xA0;SANDEE Summer School and also completed a research grant, started new courses in environmental economics at both undergraduate and post-graduate levels in Khulna Agricultural University. Another SANDEE grantee, Dr. Prajna Parmita Mishra, who took the SANDEE Summer School and a research grant, has introduced Environmental Economics course at Master&#x2019;s level at Haidarabad University, India. With the support of SANDEE Research Program Manager, Dr. Mani Nepal, who is a regular faculty of the SANDEE Summer School and provides much of the technical support to the SANDEE researchers, Kathmandu University has been offering Environmental Economics in its four-year Bachelors program in economics since 2016.
Further, SANDEE facilitated dissemination of outcomes in 70+ forums (national and international conferences and workshops) by 130+ SANDEE associates during the grant period. The dissemination activities provided young researchers an exposure to the outside world and larger research community for networking and learning. Without SANDEE&#x2019;s deliberate support, most of the researchers would not be traveling to these conferences and workshops, limiting their research exposure and knowledge. Some of the SANDEE trainees and researchers introduced new curriculum in their universities after attending the three-week long SANDEE Summer School in Environmental and Resource Economics. Some of the SANDEE researchers have been involved in advising policy making processes and organization. For example, SANDEE supported research in human wildlife conflict in Bhutan and Nepal was used as a basis of community managed insurance scheme in one of the Districts in Nepal. SANDEE researcher involved in this research has been invited to develop the scheme for the community. Another example of policy influence is consideration of PES scheme in sustainable supply of drinking waters in two towns of Nepal based on SANDEE research.
Other results related to the diverse implementation of environmental regulations are emerging. For instance, findings on why some municipalities are more successful than others in banning plastic bags are going to be presented to local development authorities in Nepal, as they are currently in discussion on a wider ban on plastics.&#xA0;Research in Pakistan is looking at &#x2018;clean production&#x2019; interventions in the tanning industry and whether firms continue to learn and innovate post-interventions. This research complements a research on &#x2018;greening&#x2019; the tourism sector in Sri Lanka, which was very well received at a recent policy workshop on this issue. SANDEE also has some new work that examines the new corporate social responsibility law in India and whether this is contributing to &#x2018;green&#x2019; investments. In India, a study on the impact of a subsidy for solar-powered irrigation pumps is nearing completion.&#xA0;
The researchers also&#xA0;presented papers in a range of countries from USA to Switzerland to Kenya to Philippines and Singapore. The wide dissemination of SANDEE research reflects professional development as well as a wider presence in academic and policy circles. SANDEE is also now periodically invited to present panels at South Asia wide events such as the annual South Asian Economic Summits (SAES) or the Biennial Indian Society for Ecological Economics (INSEE) meetings.
Researchers have learned a great deal from each other on the economics of environmental regulation through their repeated interactions at the biannual Research and Training Workshops with mentors and peers. This allows them to better engage with policy-makers. Researchers who participated in SANDEE trainings are beginning to collaborate in conducting research in multiple countries as research team. This approach will not only increase the scope of the research and also provide needed evidence base for these countries in making informed policies, but also develop leadership who can champion evidence based policy making.&#xA0;In addition,&#xA0;the cross-border cooperation and networks are building trust between actors in a conflict heavy-region.
SANDEE put a top priority in research ethics and privacy of respondents who participated in research as respondents which resulted in higher ethical standard in research.</narrative>
