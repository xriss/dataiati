   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Asia Pacific Forum is a regional network of national human rights institutions from 25 countries in the Asia Pacific region. The Swedish support has been provided as un-earmarked support to the implementation of APF Strategic Plan 2015-2020.&#xA0;
The strategic plan builds on a theory of change:&#xA0;
The APF&#x2019;s theory of change asserts that independent and effective NHRIs, acting individually and collectively to: influence laws, policies, practices and attitudes, will create an improved human rights environment in the Asia Pacific.
The Strategic Plan identified the following strategic human rights priorities:
In pursuing its functions from 2015 to 2020 the APF will foster human rights, peace and security by addressing civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights with priority accorded to the following groups:
Children; Women; People with disabilities; Mass movement of people (including asylum seekers, refugees, migrants, internally and externally displaced persons); and Older persons.
In addition to the above, the APF will also prioritize activities relating to business and human rights.
APF has identified the following outcomes of its support to National Human Rights Institutions:
Outcome 1: Increased number of NHRIs complying with UN and international standards.
Outcome 2: NHRIs are better able to perform their functions in the areas of complaints, education, monitoring, advocacy and reporting.
Outcome 3: A more conducive environment for the recognition of NHRIs at the national, regional and international level.
Outcome 4: APF is well-governed, sustainably resourced, strategically directed and member-owned.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Swedish contribution to Asia Pacific Forum of National Human Rights Organisations (APF) has been provided as core support to the organisation. Sweden together with Australia are the main core donors. APF is a membership based network of National Human Rights Institutions (NHRI&apos;s) in Asia and the Pacific. The purpose of the network is to support its national members to carry out its human rights mandate in accordance with international standards for NHRI&apos;s (Paris principles). APF has a small secretariat with the task of serving the network with expertis, coordination of UN and regional meetings, information sharing and offering capacity development of NHRI&apos;s, governments&#xA0; and civil society
APF&apos;s main purpose is to support the development of strong, efficient and independent NHRI&apos;s in the Asia Pacific Region that can support the respect, protection and fullfillment of human rights. In 2016 APF had 22 members whereof 14 are A-status members and 8 associate members: Afghanistan, Australia, Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Maldives, Myanmar, Mongolisa, Nepal, New Zeeland, Oman, Palestine, Philippines, Qatar, Korea, Samoa, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Timor Leste.
The assessement is that APF has managed to create results in all areas of work and is overall doing a good job. The evaluation from their members is overall positive in relation to how they perceive the role of APF and the support they received. A few examples of concrete results.
Outcome 1. New Members
In the period 2018/2019 the APF membership increased with one new member, the Kyrgyz Ombudsman from Kyrgyzstan. The new member is a B-status member.&#xA0;As at 30 June 2019, of the 25 APF members, 16 are &#x2018;A&#x2019; status and nine are &#x2018;B&#x2019; status (see figure 2), which means that the APF met its 2020 target of 25 member institutions.
Outcome 2: NHRIs are better able to perform their functions in the areas of complaints, education, monitoring, advocacy and reporting.
During the agreement period, APF conducted a range of professional trainings and other types of capacity development events for its member NHRIs&#xA0;
A total of 258 people participated, with 135 identifying as female (52%) and 123 as male (43%). This represents an overall improvement in the gender balance of participants compared to the previous year. The capacity development events reflect the changing priority for the APF towards more targeted, national workshops which have previously been shown to have greater relevance and results for NHRIs.
A few examples:
Thailand NHRI Investigations Training &#x2013; 15-17 August 2018.
The National Human Rights Commission of Thailand (NHRCT) requested the APF to train their staff on human rights investigations. The NHRCT held a certified training programme for their investigative officers in collaboration with the Chulalongkorn University. The APF workshop was included as part of this larger training programme. The aim of the activity was to deepen participants understanding of the investigation function of an NHRI and improve planning, interviewing techniques and reporting of investigations. The NHRCT has reported that the activity has helped to apply new techniques to their staff&#x2019;s investigation practice and that they have translated the investigations manual into Thai for their staff.
Samoa - Monitoring and Evaluation Workshop for the Samoan NHRI &#x2013; 20-21 August 2018. In conjunction with the APF following a CA, the Ombudsman/NHRI of Samoa identified that the monitoring and evaluation of its activities, including its recommendations to government, was an area for development. This activity therefore aimed to support the Ombudsman to progress its efforts toward implementing effective monitoring and evaluation practices. The activity met its outcome to provide &#x2018;an opportunity for the Office and individual staff to scope the current state, and to plan a strategy for,- 18implementing a monitoring and evaluation framework&#x2019;. Through the workshop, the Senior Management Team signed off on a Monitoring and Evaluation plan and identified short, medium, and long-term outcomes.
Afghanistan NHRI Strategic Planning &#x2013; 5-9 September 2018. The strategic plan of the Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission (AIHRC) expired at the end of 2018. The AIHRC sought the assistance of the APF to support its strategic planning consultations for the development of their 2019-22 plan and the APF arranged for a senior consultant to undertake the assignment.
Outcome 3.
In 2018-2019, the APF responded to 57 requests for legal advice and other legal policy support from a broad range of actors including its member NHRIs, APF Forum Councillors, the Forum Council Working Group, GANHRI, the SCA, governments of prospective NHRIs, international organisations, civil society organisations and other stakeholders. This is up from 41 requests in the previous reporting period.
Most of the requests for advice from NHRI concerns the accreditation process.&#xA0;
Examples of interventions.
NHRI in Myanmar.
The APF Legal and Policy Manager, accompanied by a Senior Consultant, led a joint mission to support the Myanmar National Human Rights Commission (MNHRC) in a structured engagement with parliamentarians to provide advice on proposed reforms to the Commission&#x2019;s enabling legislation. This included written legislative drafting instructions, as well as consultations with key political and civil society stakeholders in country, which followed the APF&#x2019;s Capacity Assessment of the MNHRC which took place in 2018. Gender diversity in the Commission was considered and advised on during the mission.
NHRI in Thailand.
The APF also initiated preliminary consultations with the Thai National Human rights Commission to support its planned application for re-accreditation with GANHRI in March 2020. The Thai Commission was downgraded to B Status in 2015 and since that time has undergone an overhaul of its legal mandate, with a new constitution and enabling legislation. The APF provided written advice on this new framework and the requirements of the Paris Principles. The Legal and Policy Manager also conducted a short mission to Bangkok to re-engage with the Commission and provide in-person guidance and advice on the GANHRI accreditation process.
This year has been a period of transition for the APF secretariat&#x2019;s legal and policy advice portfolio.
A new Legal and Policy Manager commenced in March 2019, with the organization also reconfiguring the way it provides advice to members, including the development of a range of practical legal information resources for APF members. This forms part of a multi-year APF Legal and Policy Strategy developed over the past few months.
A challenge continuing to face the APF secretariat is the increasing volume of legal advice work with only one ongoing Legal and Policy member of staff. The volume of work is related to the increasing membership, partly exacerbated by the need for APF to make substantial input to the SCA. This year, the secretariat has supplemented this capacity with a temporary full-time junior lawyer.&#xA0;
Following scoping missions in 2017, a follow-up scoping visit to undertake further consultations with the remaining states of the FSM was undertaken from 20 to 30 May 2019. The objectives of the second visit were three-fold, to: I. Gauge the views of key stakeholders about the establishment of an NHRI in the FSM:II. Increase awareness about human rights and NHRIs; and III: Build in-State support for the preparation for the establishment of an NHRI, should the process progress. The APF has received informal notice from the FSM National government indicating interest in technical support with developing the legislative mandate for an NHRI at some stage in 2019-2020. This support will be considered a priority by the APF in the upcoming year.
Outcome 4. APF is well governed.
This outcome area is the most challenging one. In 2018 two reviews were carried out regarding APF. One review aimed at looking into the implementation of the strategic plan and the results achieved. The second review was the Joint Partner Review aimed at supporting APF in the upcoming strategic planning process.&#xA0;
Both reviews revealed that the APF secretariat is overburdened with work and stretched to its limits and that there is an urgent need to address the and improve the capacity of the secretariat by adding more staff members and developing effective working methodology. The secretariat has limited capacity in areas such as RBM/MEL and use a lot of external consulting services to bridge capacity deficits.</narrative>
