    <narrative xml:lang="EN">SUMERNET III showed good results and reached all its output indicators. Seven research projects were granted and all were successfully completed. The number of young researchers and women exceeded expectations, e.g 57 researchers took part in the granted projects and it was expected that 15 of them would be women but in the end 22 women participated. About 10 young (below 35 years) or early career&#xA0;researchers were anticipated but 22 participated. A few master theses also came out of the projects. The number of contributions made by SUMERNET researchers to relevant events outside SUMERNET and the number of media, NGO:s and think tanks quoting SUMERNET research findings in their knowledge products did also exceeded targets and shows that the relevance of the research to the development in the Mekong Region is high.
On an outcome level several results were achieved.Through conducting collaborative research and capacity building activities under SUMERNET, researchers have increased their ability to deliver and communicate credible research. The results have been communicated through peer-reviewed articles, book-chapters, policy briefs and media products to a highly satisfactory degree. Through engagement opportunities provided by SUMERNET, researchers have been able to build relationships and work closely with so called boundary partners, i.e policy makers and policy influencers, exposing them to the work of SUMERNET. By maintaining the policy relevance of SUMERNET research, researchers have been able to draw interest from policy influencers, especially media, to communicate research activities and results. SUMERNET facilitated engagement with the media, through media workshops. These media partners are now better able to understand and communicate about climate change and environmental issues based on scientific information produced by the researchers.
SUMERNET facilitated relationship-building among partners through capacity building support (on topics such as effective engagement practices and outcome mapping) and providing a platform for networking. Researchers now understand the concept of boundary partners and the importance of including them in all stages of a project, and many have attempted to incorporate these concepts and practices in their work. Policy makers also acknowledged the benefits of access to platforms and increased collaboration, as it allowed them to work with research partners and tap into data and findings to inform their understanding of issues in the region. Through policy engagements, policy makers have taken up the results of research conducted by SUMERNET researchers, and in some cases the research has been influencing national agenda setting processes.&#xA0;
Key research findings 
Some of the key research findings that emerged from individual SUMERNET projects in Phase 3 across research projects, regional assessment, and assessment of gender equality and water security are summarized below.
1)&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; Climate Compatible Development
The rising energy demand and rapid urbanization that have typically accompanied economic growth in Southeast Asia represent significant challenges and opportunities for climate-compatible development. Within this theme, SUMERNET research has endeavored to promote human development while addressing both mitigation of, and adaptation to, climate change. The following are key findings from research implemented under this theme:
&#x2022; The increasing incidence of droughts, floods and storms are the most severe climate risks facing rural farmers whose livelihoods depend primarily on natural resources. Access to small loans has been a common adaptive strategy among farmers to recover agricultural productivity and to address emergency cash needs. For most communities, upon failure of local adaption strategies, migration to other provinces or to neighbouring countries is a key adaptation option.
&#x2022; Rice straw-derived fuel can be used in improved cookstove systems implemented to substitute rice straw open burning which causes environmental and health issues in the Mekong countries. Thailand has drawn up a masterplan to avoid open burning, however, no such masterplan has been developed in Vietnam and Cambodia. This alternative use of rice straw is a potential solution for reducing open burning in the Mekong region, since the proposed cooking and fuel technology is already being widely accepted by farmers in Vietnam and Cambodia.
&#x2022; REDD+ has proven to be a promising mechanism to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation while promoting forest conservation and sustainable management as well as enhancement of forest carbon stocks in the Mekong. However, for enhancing the sustainability of the approach and the benefit for community forestry, internal processes need to be improved such as engagements based on the principle of free, prior and informed consent (FPIC), equal participation in particular participation of women, transparent follow up to address concerns of illegal logging activities, consideration of local customary practices and a grievance mechanism.
2)&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; Ecosystem Services for Local Development
Local development in rural and peri-urban settings is often greatly affected by the condition of ecosystems and the services they provide. Research and policy-oriented assessments are needed to help maintain and improve ecosystem services throughout the Mekong Region to ensure the wellbeing of societies and households who derive their livelihoods from natural resources. The following are key findings from research implemented under this theme:
&#x2022; A contemporary sustainability challenge in Southeast Asia is how to protect wetlands and support associated agroecological farming practices for regional resilience. Small wetlands in the sanctuary such as in Cambodia and Vietnam have high value because of water availability, and the biodiversity and ecotourism potential. These small wetlands are protected and managed by the sanctuary management and the local community. However, there are many pressures on small wetlands, such as agricultural land expansion, deforestation, internal migration, and human settlement in the area. As much as the wildlife sanctuary authorities, the local communities who depend upon the wetland ecosystem services play an equally important role in wetland protection.
3)&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; Sustainable Regional Economic Integration
&#xA0;Greater regional economic integration has been promoted widely in the region, most notably as part of the economic activities leading to increased transborder trade and investment. But poverty and inequality as well as transboundary environmental degradation are continuing concerns. This research theme intended to address these issues for reducing adverse impacts of regional economic integration and move towards environmental sustainability and social equality. The following are key findings from research implemented under this theme:
&#x2022; Due to rapid economic development and at the same time advancing regional economic integration in the last two decades, drastic changes have been observed due to the expansion of rubber production in northern Laos with various impacts on local livelihoods. Specifically, the process of land conversion from traditional farming to rubber plantation has led to increased disparity in the area. Land managed by external investors for rubber and banana plantations has led to a rise in wages among village residents. Nevertheless, intra-household gender discrimination does not change with an increase in income, with girls still given less importance for health and education.
&#x2022; The East-West Economic Corridor (EWEC) is an attempt to promote socio-economic development and the regional integration of Myanmar, Thailand, Laos and Vietnam. The infrastructure development such as roads cut across many forest areas and affect many forest dependent villages. Since it became operational in 2006, EWEC has attracted private investment and contributed to socio-economic development but has also resulted in loss of forest cover and impacts on local livelihoods, particularly that of forest dependent communities. EWEC has provided some improvements in the lives of forest dependent villagers such as access to social welfare and more livelihood options, such as better education, health care, housing and access to finance. However, overall EWEC has had adverse impacts on local livelihoods such as through the decline in social capital among forest dependent villagers and an increase in social violence which are challenging the sustainability of local development efforts.
4)&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; Regional Assessment
SUMERNET, in collaboration with the national, regional and international experts has been conducting a &#x201C;Regional Assessment&#x201D; study focusing on water scarcity management in the Mekong Region involving five case studies at the sub-national level in Thailand, Myanmar, Lao PDR, Cambodia and Vietnam. The following are key findings from the assessment case studies implemented under this theme:
&#x2022; Large infrastructure development, such as dam and reservoir construction in the upstream portion of the river basin, is likely to increase the likelihood of failure (and increase vulnerability) for the required environmental flows (quantity, timing, and quality of water flows) to sustain freshwater ecosystems and local livelihoods, and to achieve the minimum water level required for transportation.
&#x2022; Projected changes in climate will have wide potential impacts on physical and natural sites as well as local people&#x2019;s livelihood. The increased temperatures, and longer and dryer dry periods, will facilitate growth of invasive species and thus accelerate the closing of open wetlands by vegetation cover, making lake and ponds shallower, and reducing their water storage capacity.
&#x2022; In addressing water scarcity issues, discussions on water challenges and potential solutions needs to involve concerned stakeholders, among others local government, affected women, men, and community groups, business sector, and technical experts.
&#x2022; A long-term comprehensive and integrated water resources management strategy is crucial to anticipate water scarcity. There must be a strong policy, and programmatic coherence and coordination among agencies which are tasked with implementing water resource management strategy across the country, on different governance levels: national, regional and local.
5)&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; Gender Equality and Water Security in the Lower Mekong Region
The purpose of this assessment was to demonstrate the gender-related aspects of water insecurity, and the existing challenges around its governance from a gender perspective in national and regional institutions in the Lower Mekong region. Water insecurity in the assessment refers to the displacements experienced by river-dependent communities by hydropower development and other related changes, which have subsequent losses on fisheries and other water-related livelihoods. The conclusions of the assessment are discussed briefly below.
&#x2022; Water insecurity disadvantage women as they shoulder heavier caring obligations. Water insecurity increases women&#x2019;s caring burden as they struggle to ensure the well-being of their families under poor water conditions and the loss of fisheries. In hydropower resettlement schemes, women are more likely to struggle as they continue to enable their families&#x2019; adaptation to new settings. They shoulder more pressures since they lack capital, networks and skills. In addition, women are not a homogeneous group and their access to, and the use of, different resources are determined by their ethnicity, class, and age identities. Therefore, some women may even be more disadvantaged than others.
&#x2022; Women&#x2019;s participation may not be totally beneficial at all times. Women&#x2019;s participation in water governance only count women, ignore gender norms and unequal power relations embedded in local institutions, social contexts and practices that constrain meaningful engagement. Engaging women in water governance without clearly assessing the benefits of their participation also increases their burden. The scale at which women are engaged is often not where crucial and key decisions are being made, but which significantly affect their lives and livelihoods.
&#x2022; The link between gender equality and water governance remains weak. Water governance is traditionally a masculine and technical domain of practice and knowledge. Only few women occupy senior positions, and water professionals are traditionally trained to bracket out social and gender concerns. The review of the national and regional water policies shows that some address water insecurity, although only a few acknowledge gender equality issues. Gender equality issues also diminish at transboundary scales of decision-making, especially as women&#x2019;s engagement and gender advocacy are conventionally confined to the micro, community or household scales, thereby economic and technical issues occupy the analytical center stage at higher, transboundary scales. Simultaneously, regarding civil society actors, water insecurity is not strong in the agenda of gender and women&#x2019;s organizations.
Examples on translation of research findings into changed policy or practices
&#x2022; Assessment results in Thailand contribute to local government&#x2019;s decision in investing on robust adaptation strategies for local farmers. The SUMERNET regional assessment on &#x201C;Adapting to multiple and uncertain changes in the Mekong region: Strategies for today and a +4C world&#x201D; has been undertaken in five countries including Thailand, Lao PDR, Cambodia, Vietnam and Myanmar. All case study teams have closely engaged with the boundary partners, of which many are governmental agencies that need to take decision on strategies and plans to manage water resources in their respective areas. The Khon Kaen Natural Resources and Environmental Office stated that the assessment case study in Huai Sai Bat sub-basin in Thailand has been very useful in practice. Considering the results from this study, Khon Kaen provincial government has allocated more than 80 million baht in 2017 and more than 150 million baht in 2018 for groundwater development to supply water during times of scarcity for local farmers.
&#x2022; Provincial Environment Department in Preah Vihear, Cambodia, has stated they learned how to protect wetland areas for wildlife, and that more than 200 wetland areas have successfully been protected as a result of engaging with SUMERNET researchers on wetland protection. Additionally, SUMERNET&#x2019;s focus on how to effectively engage with policymakers enabled researchers to build relationships with policymakers. When policymakers in the Ministry of Environment in Cambodia began discussions on developing policies on wise use of wetlands the researchers were able to use this timing, and role as knowledge producers on this topic, to directly influence the agenda-setting and policy formulation, which is now underway to become national policy.
&#x2022; The Rural Development Research Centre at the An Giang University, Vietnam worked together with local farmers and the Sub-Department of Agriculture and Rural Development, An Giang province, on expansion of floating rice field as measure for climate change adaptation. Based on the recommendation from the research findings the department has developed a policy to encourage farmers to conserve and expand floating rice in their district. At the provincial level, they have a policy to expand up to 500 hectares in 2030, under which the government selected floating rice as one of the rice varieties to be preserved to adapt to climate change in the future. The government also realised that floating rice enhances the agro-ecological system.</narrative>
