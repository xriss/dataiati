    <narrative xml:lang="EN">General question: Results related to the intended outcome 2016Question: Summarise results related to the intended outcome (this information will be sent to Open Aid)Answer: The intervention, Sida-SEI Strategic Fund 2013-2016, was aimed to enable different stakeholders and groups to discuss and share knowledge, with a regional focus on emerging environmental issues, gender equality and poverty reduction, in the regional forums and other strategic regional events. Intended results from regional forums and meetings in long-term are for policies development and improvement of natural resource management for a more sustainable development in the region. In addition, SEI Asia administers the fund for supporting activities with the aim of seeking to change mindsets and daily practices or actors or organizations to ultimately benefit the citizens of the region.

The intervention supports regional forums and events through three components. Two components comprise of annual activities carried out by the China-ASEAN Environmental Cooperation (CAEC) and the Asia Europe Foundation (ASEF), which are central to the policy dialogue development across the regions, particularly Southeast Asia, China and Europe. The third component is a small grants facility for supporting events (mostly one-shot events) based on open competitive call of concept notes that scheduled on a rolling quarterly basis. For participatory approach, the forums or events funded under this programme brought together representatives from government, the private sector, and civil society together with researchers, and feature active exchanges between participants.

The intervention has fulfilled its specific objective by ensuring that regional conferences and events took place and met the criteria established by the intervention in accordant with the workplan. The intervention has provided financial and technical support to 3 annual forums for CAECF, namely China-ASEAN Environment Cooperation Forum (CAECF), and 3 annual forums for ASEF, namely Asia-Europe Environment Forum (ENVforum), and 14 events under Component 3. 

With coordination and support from SEI Asia to the China-ASEAN Environmental Cooperation Centre (CAEC), there have been improvement on several relevant indicators. The CAEC has adopted ranges of reform in the planning procedure and organization of their annual forum, both in terms of the design and facilitation method, especially in addressing gender inclusiveness. It is observed that topics of the forum have shifted to a more gender and poverty reduction. The facilitation method of event has also been changed from conventional method (only presentation) to a more interaction within the panel and the audience. There was a good improvement in the desired direction of gender aspects, although mainly in terms of gender balance - participants and resource persons. For example, in 2015 and 2016, 28% and 18% were female participants respectively, increased from limited numbers in 2014. However, gender aspect was shortcoming in the implementation, mainly due to limited understanding and recognition from organization to be prioritized as the key focus of the forum. 

The ENVforum, hosted by Asia Europe Foundation (ASEF), bring various stakeholders annually to discuss issues concerning implementation of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) from different perspective. With the support and being Steering Committee Meeting of SEI Asia, it has shown positive change in behavior of ASEF, especially in terms of gender integration in the programme design and agenda of the forum, such as inclusion of gender plenary session that has been recognized as a cross-cutting theme for the implementation of SDG targets.

The support to the Component 3 has been recognized as a key source of funding for supporting regional environmental events in Asia. Since the beginning, the concept note submission rate has experienced exponential growth with a total of 215 concept notes. This indicates that the Sida-SEI strategic fund has been popular among development partners in the region as a potential fund to tap and it can be capitalized for the future. With a small funds from this programme, it has increased leverage by tapping with a larger conference or forum, e.g. organized side-event within a conference.

In accordance with the results framework and the support from SEI in influencing partners design and agenda of the events, the results show an increasing trend of relation to themes of gender equality and poverty reduction from the support to a total of 169 sessions. Sessions which discuss topics relevant to gender equality theme increased from 0% in 2013 to 59% by the end of the programme in 2016. Similar trend has been observed in the poverty reduction theme that by the end of 2016, the percentage of sessions addressing poverty reduction themes had increased significantly to 72% while there were only 18% in 2013.

The programme outcome is measured by the Most Significant Change Stories (MSC), which is an open-end questions were sent out to partners, following the Knowledge, Attitude and Practice framework. The MSC recorded shows that about 70% of the stories claimed knowledge change after participation in supported events, 30% of participants changed their attitude and practice. About the same proportion of stories addressed the benefit of networking during the events and one fifth has built up concrete cooperation after the events. A quarter of these stories are related to gender theme. 

Of 184 MSC collected, one participant indicates that &#x201C;One important knowledge and concept I enhanced from 4th Asia-Pacific Climate Change Adaptation Forum is ecosystem based adaptation. I was working for community based adaptation. Now I have competencies to link between community and ecosystem based climate change adaptation. I have used the skills on research of RECOFTC in Nepal. In addition, I have  also started project evaluation work on the issue.&#x201D; (Mr. Nirmal Kumar BK., Researcher, Forest Action, Nepal, participated in Fourth Asia-Pacific Climate Change Adaptation Forum, 2014).

In addition, the participants attended in this programme said that they have increased their awareness of policy makers, community-based organizations and private sector groups on sustainable development issues in the region and provided space for these stakeholders to share their knowledge and experience. More specifically, the events have enhanced the awareness of stakeholders on social and gender equity issues in development, which is a key goal of the programme.</narrative>
