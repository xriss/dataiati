   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The programme&apos;s development objective was that the SESA countries (Pakistan, Vietnam, Indonesia, Nepal, Bangladesh, Cambodia, Laos, Sri Lanka) are active participants in international standardisation and thereby contribute to their international trade and gained access to international recognized facts and methodologies useful in underpinning legislation and institution building. The programme intended to in the long run contribute to 1) economic development through increased access to markets by local and regional producers, 2) a development of the bioenergy sector in a way that maintains environmental, social and economical sustainability and provides opportunities for poor people to benefit from the development and 3) greenhouse gas mitigation activities within exporting sectors.
There were five short-term outcomes within the areas of standard setting and standard implementation, respectively:
A. Standard setting:
1. Enhanced competence among NSBs in the SESA region in leading and execution of standard setting processes in a participatory cooperation with the private and public sector on a national and international level.2. Enhanced competence among selected SESA region stakeholders in order to participate effectively in national and international standard setting processes.
B. Standard implementation:
3. Strengthened competence among National Standardization Bodies (NSB:s) in standard implementation to be able to use ISO standards.4. Strengthened competence among selected companies in standard implementation to be able to use ISO standards.5. Strengthened competence among programme participants in standard implementation to be able to use ISO standards</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">The SIS-SESA programme was implemented between 2012-2017. Activities and related results on the regional and international levels have been achieved to a satisfactory degree on an output level, however on a national level activities have not been implemented according to workplans. According to the evaluation made 2015, the short term objectives were achieved to a varying degree. By and large, the programme has made a positive contribution to the SESA region in terms of building capacity for national and regional standardisation, however mainly on an individual level. &#xA0; A brief summary of the programme&#x2019;s operations and achieved results, in line with OECD/DAC&#x2019;s evaluation criteria, is spelled out below. Effectiveness &#x2022; 44 regional and international activities delivered between 2012 and 2017.&#x2022; Roughly 1000 individuals have participated in held workshops and trainings, mainly within Carbon footprint, Life cycle assessment, ISO 14001 on environmental management and ISO standards development work.&#x2022; Full ISO membership of national standard bodies increased from five to six (of eight) during the programme period.&#x2022; Increase in number of approved ISO sponsored delegates as well as number of different ISO meetings attended.&#x2022; Larger number of companies and participants trained (and to some extent certified) in Environmental Management Systems (EMS), Quality Management Systems (QMS), Carbon Footprint of Products (CFP) and Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). Efficiency&#x2022; More of the programme governance has been decentralised to the regional level during the course of the programme.&#x2022; Gradual reduction of management fees from 39% to 20% from 2014 to 2016 &#x2013; only years with 12 months of implementation included.&#x2022; Development of a reliable results-based management approach that has strengthened the programme governance and results reporting. Relevance&#x2022; Programme activities have scored high on utility and beneficiary usefulness in conducted evaluations throughout the programme period.&#x2022; The programme has established the regional demand to become standard setters and not standards takers by providing meeting places for the region to prepare and participate in international standardisation processes at ISO. Sustainability&#x2022; Increased participation in ISO work, with attendance at international meetings, in voting procedures, and in technical committee (TC) related work.&#x2022; Training of TC-members to increase participation of regional stakeholders through webinars.&#x2022; Training of trainers (ToT) to increase local expertise; for example, a Sri Lankan expert facilitated two training sessions in Vietnam and on a national level, several training sessions have been held by local experts that got training from the programme.</narrative>
