   <narrative xml:lang="EN">TB Alliance is focused on: 1. Improved TB therapeutic regimens that are developed, registered, and available to those who need them -- making a major impact on the global TB pandemic 2. Progress is made on the development of new compounds that offer promise to hit novel targets and achieve in vivo cure of TB in optimized combinations in 8-12 weeks and the best potential combinations are assessed for clinical regimen development.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Recipient country allocations depict direct program costs spent in the country. TB Alliance leverages a global network of public and private partners to most efficiently advance TB drug development. In line with our virtual model, we work closely with various partners and advisers, including Clinical Research Organizations (CROs) for clinical trial management, monitoring, pharmacovigilance and other various aspects of clinical studies. Many of these CRO are based in the US and the UK, thus we account a significant portion of expenditures in these countries. However, the CROs directly make investigative and site payments for patients enrolled in clinical research where our clinical sites are based -- for example in South Africa, Tanzania, and other countries with high TB burden. As such, TB Alliance has more clinical research operations and sites in high TB burden countries benefiting from bilateral funding such as UKAID. A more detailed analysis on recipients from TB endemic countries is currently being undertaken.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">TB Alliance&apos;s mission is directly aligned with Sustainable Development Goals. We work on discovery and development of better TB drugs, and thus contributing to SDG 3.3 Ensure health lives -- ending the epidemic of HIV, Malaria, and TB by 2030. Our mission also contributes to SDG 3B Research and development of vaccines and medicines for communicable and non-communicable diseases that primarily affect developing countries. Ending the TB pandemic globally will have a significant impact on several development indicators around the world. Given the high rates of HIV/TB co-infection in high burden countries, aggressive TB control via new, effective drugs can dramatically improve the lives and related health outcomes of HIV patients around the world. Ending TB can spur economic gains in low and middle income countries where current loss of lives, reduced quality of life, and loss of labor from severe and prolonged illness impose a heavy cost, stagnating the health and development nations.</narrative>
