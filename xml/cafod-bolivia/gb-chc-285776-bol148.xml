   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Bolivia is experiencing a catastrophic situation, with COVID arriving on the back of violent widespread social upheaval at the end of 2019. The country went into strict quarantine in March, which has not been respected by many due to partisan political interests peddling disinformation. Blockaders protesting the delays to the national elections are hampering the delivery of oxygen and essential medical products.  Many families have been plunged into a food security crisis. They continue to face a scarcity or absence of food and due to the quarantine restrictions, they have been unable to access the state bonds which would have provided desperately needed income. The families in rural areas supported by Fundacion Nuna have been able to survive on existing agricultural products, however they are currently suffering from shortages of seeds, dry food products and other non-food items which if not resolved quickly will exacerbate the food crisis in both rural communities and in the urban areas that rely on locally-produced food. The current social unrest which is likely to continue and worsen during September and October is also their access to markets and options for earning income to buy seeds.  
Fundacion Nuna will provide seeds to indigenous campesino families located in 16 communities across three municipalities, Curva, Mocomoco and Ancoraimes in the La Paz department. Nuna will also carry out much needed awareness raising about COVID 19 and safety practices and provide PPE for families in the target communities. The team will coordinate with community authorities to prioritise support to the most vulnerable community members including elderly men and women who have been abandoned by their families, families led by women, families with large numbers of children.</narrative>
