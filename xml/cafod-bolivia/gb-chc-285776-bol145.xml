  </title>
  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">To date Bolivia has over 500 confirmed cases of COVID19 but is achieving very low levels of testing and the healthcare system is very weak, almost non-existent in rural areas. The government&apos;s strict quarantine response began on 21st March and remains in force to try to stem transmission. The rules allow people to go out to buy food one morning a week and driving is prohibited unless authorised.  These rules are causing extreme hardship for migrants, the prison population, elderly people in care homes, orphanages and communities of indigenous peoples in cities.
Pastoral Social Caritas Bolivia (PSCB) will provide food and hygiene supplies to Bolivian prisoners and migrants (national and international) in La Paz, Oruro and Potosi with within a framework of respect and dignity of people&#x2019;s basic rights during the coronavirus health crisis. 
The resources will support two vulnerable groups: a) people deprived of their liberty (1,696 people) and b) national and international migrants in the cities of La Paz, Oruro and Potosi (300 people) totalling approximately 1996 people. 
Food rations and hygiene essentials will be purchased and delivered by the PSCB diocese teams based in each city. These teams are made up of staff and volunteers.
The food rations will provide one meal per day for five days in the prisons in addition to hygiene products including toilet paper and hand sanitiser. As prisons are closed to visitors, the food will be delivered to the prison kitchens. Monitoring will be done by signoff and photos of all including prison staff, prisoners and the PSCB team.
Migrant families, including Venezuelan refugees, are living in temporary shelters from houses to bus terminals. The food rations will provide one meal per day for 14 days for this vulnerable groups who will also receive hygiene products and essential medicine when possible.  
PSCB is receiving support from other agencies to provide support to other prisons and to support other vulnerable groups</narrative>
