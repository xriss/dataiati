   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Institutional WASH Assistance through access to safe and clean drinking water, improved sanitation and hygiene behavior in newly merged district Kurram</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Institutional WASH assistance project is designed in light of supporting return population&#x2019;s and their children in merged tribal district Kurram, enabling them to meet their immediate  WASH   needs through improved access to WASH facilities at institutional level including public sector schools and civil dispensaries.  It is likely that the provision of improved water, sanitation and hygiene facilities along with increased knowledge and capacity building of target population would reduce target population and school children vulnerability.
In this regards adequate access to safe amp clean drinking water facilities would cater the most vulnerable families in terms of rehabilitation/construction of 2 gravity water supply schemes at community level. Whereas clean and safe drinking water is also the equal right of school&#x2019;s children and would be provided within school premises.Increased access to sanitation facilities within twenty (20) institutions  i.e. schools and health centers would be ensured through rehabilitation and construction of MHM and PWDs focused twin set latrine along with group hand wash facilities at each proposed institution. MHM kits would be provided once at each proposed institution to ensure the proper management of hygienic practices among adult girls studying in these schools. Along with they will be given sessions through their teachers in order to maintain their health hygiene regarding MHM and handling of solid waste etc. Proper facilities will be provided in dedicated toilets for MHM and PWD&apos;s in each institution.
 General awareness sessions in health facilities, particularly school focused health and hygiene sessions would be conducted among school children. The school children including boys and girls would be sensitized about the significance of good hygiene practices. Education for good hygiene practices would make these students agents of change by linking them to their families and community in large. These would be achieved through conducting 75 Hygiene sessions. Added to these 1875 school&#x2019;s kits would be distributed @75/school among the students of 15 schools in both central and lower Kurram. In addition, 1875 IEC material and soap would be provided to school administration for encouraging hand wash practice with soap after toilet attendance.

Overall 9150 beneficiaries i.e. 9150 beneficiaries for water, 7875 for sanitation and 5625 for hygiene promotion through improved access to sanitation facilities and Behavior change campaigns at institutional level. The project interventions within schools would reduce WASH related risks, would increase school attendance, learning environment and indeed contributing factor to gender equality and dignity.
A comprehensive Mamp E work Frame would be developed and practice for quality assurance at field level, whereas regional and country office random visits would be a value added to quality assurance in terms of monitoring and advising on quality assurance.
Throughout the project life cycle closed coordination with local administration, line departments including PDMA, civil/ military administration, and other relevant stakeholders would be maintained at district amp Provincial level.</narrative>
