  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The humanitarian crisis in Taluka Umerkot has been deteriorating as a consequence of the recurrent drought which is in continuation since 2014. Umerkot district has two distinct geographical portions: i.e. the irrigated area in the north and west and the desert in the south and east. 25 sub units of union councils (Dehs) are officially declared as Drought affected area in district of Umerkot. Access to portable water remains of high concern and is intensified by the needs of livestock animals. Moreover, recurring dry spells have forced communities to travel long distances to access water for drinking.

Continuous lowering of water table, non-functionality of dug wells and hand pumps, people&#x2019;s limited capacity of repairing them and absence of any water schemes from Government in these remote and desert area of Umerkot has aggregated humanitarian crisis.

According to the National Disaster Consortium (NDC) assessment 2019, around 3 to 4 million people are affected in Sindh which forms almost 40% of the population in the affected districts. The Humanitarian Country Team through allocated Pakistan Humanitarian Pooled Fund (PHPF) has announced to provide urgent humanitarian assistance for drought affected communities in district of Umerkot and Tharparker in sectors of WASH, Nutrition, Health and Food Security

The proposed project aims to contribute and concentrate on increased access to portable drinking water through installation, rehabilitation and restoration of damaged water sources. The project will increase existing water discharge capacity of the communal dug wells through upgrading them with submersible pumps powered by renewable energy. Communal Shallow dysfunctional hand pumps will be rehabilitated with deep hand pumps to provide three times more water to the affected communities. Most vulnerable families &#x201C;the ultra poor&#x201D; will be provided with water storage containers for safer storage of water at household levels. They will also be provided water treatment options so that they every beneficiary of the project access to quality drinking water.

Community local water reservoirs  will also be repaired for storage of water aimed at both human and livestock animals. At institution level, primary schools will be provided with drinking water and sanitation facilities to build students resilience to recurrent drought shocks. Access to water component will provide a durable water solution for 45,700 individuals in 288 villages affected by drought to sufficient, safe, fresh, potable water. The surplus water will also be available for livestock animals which is the mainstay of economy in targeted desert area. 

Widespread safe hygiene practice education will be provided to women through hygiene promotion session along with sessions on significance of hand washing at Household level. The targeted 3,297 vulnerable ultra poor households (having poverty scores from 0 to 19 Poverty Score Card (PSC) scores) will be provided with hygiene kit with demonstration session to use them. The project also addresses the needs of disabled people and other vulnerable individuals including the elderly, unaccompanied women, and pregnant and lactating women.</narrative>
