   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Last phase of IDP&#x2019;s return to South Waziristan Agency was initiated in 2017, to Tehsil Ladha, Makeen and Shawal. According to the IDP return fact sheet as of 31st December 2017, total 16,998 registered families have been returned to Tehsil Ladha, Makeen and Shawal in 2017, while 4,926 families are still in displacement. Along with the registered caseload, un-registered IDPs families have also been returned to these tehsils.
Recently most of the families have been returned to Tehsil Ladha and Makeen, while on the other hand, due to damaged infrastructure, and non-functional health facilities, the population facing sever anxieties regarding healthcare services, which adversely impact the sustainable return process. According to EHSAR&#x2019;s Assessment, the services delivery in health sector is lacking due to the insufficient resources with the government. The assessment also indicates that there are total 27 government health facilities in Tehsil Ladha and Makeen, but most of them are not functional, either due to damaged infrastructure or lacking in human resources. According to the preliminary findings of Vulnerability Assessment, 67% of the population are facing sever or moderate difficulties in accessing health facilities, while 62% of the population were not satisfied with the available health services. Furthermore, the VA report indicate that 37% of the PLWs never received medical help during their last pregnancy, while 51% of the deliveries have been done at homes. Overall, 88% of PLWs haven&#x2019;t been visited by LHWs in last three months. The report further indicates that 64% of children didn&#x2019;t vaccinated through EPI program. 
Keeping in view the extreme needs and gaps identified, the continuation of PHC services in proposed areas are intensively required. This project will fill the gaps in the delivery of essential primary health care services including reproductive health and mother and child health care services to the recently returned population of South Waziristan District, by targeting 3 government health facilities.
