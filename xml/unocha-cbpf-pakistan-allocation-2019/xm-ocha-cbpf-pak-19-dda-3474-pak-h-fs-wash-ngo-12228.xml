  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">AWARE will provide humanitarian assistance to approximately 6000 families (Approximately 50,000 most vulnerable and drought affected persons) of Taluka Chachro in district Tharparkar of Sindh province for nine month. The main objective of this project is to enhance the resilience of 6000 targeted families by providing WASH, Food Security and Health support in Taluka Chachro District Tharparkar. AWARE team is already working in proposed area since last decade and based on the information collected during field visit, regular meeting minutes of village based organizations, reports of different stakeholders (government, I/NGOs, media etc), generated a Drought Situation Report in November 2018 and shared with different stakeholders. According to this collected information, Tharparkar received first shower in last week of July (Monsoon season 2018) after which growers began cultivating their land but since then the erratic and inadequate rainfall was insufficient to meet the crops&#x2019; needs and sustain the growth of fodder, furthermore the rainwater reservoirs in the proposed area were dried up making people resort to buying extremely expensive drinking water in remote areas. AWARE has conducted a Drought Rapid Need Assessment (DRNA) in proposed areas in February 2019 (attached herewith) and the following needs are priorities from different groups of communities during different FGDs and KIIs
Health:
In FGDs, it is common need of women to provide access for pregnant women for regular checkup and investigation at Taluka head quarter. AWARE did same activity in another project for three year (2016-18) and infant mortality rate has been decreased to 80% and mother mortality rate has been decreased to 95%. Therefore, this project will provide access (referral mechanism) to 600 women of vulnerable households.
Awareness on Health (reproductive, general, mother and children care, Hygiene and DRR) to 10,000 individuals of the proposed drought affected area.
Food Security:
- Livestock support (fodder, vaccination and drench) to 2600 Families
- Seed (millet, sesame, pulses and cluster bean) for next monsoon crops to 2400 families
- Kitchen Gardening Kit (seed, tools, manure and safety nets) to 500 families
WASH: 
WASH services for villages and schools and this will benefit to 1500 families. In this regard, ten submersible solar powered pumps will be installed on dug well in ten villages and a mobile RO plant (on monthly rent basis) will be provided to 30 villages where the water quality in not suitable for drinking purpose. This activity will benefit more than 3000 families in the proposed area. AWARE is already managing a mobile RO plant in same area for 15 villages (1500 HH). According to FGDs there was also a need identified form children for the construction of latrine in girls primary school, therefore, 15 latrines will be constructed in the schools of 15 villages.
During the process of drought rapid need assessment (DRNA), all vulnerable groups (persons with disabilities, pregnant and lactating mothers, chronically ill, elders, minorities, etc) were equally participated in the FGDs. Total 30 FGDs were conducted with 346 persons and the details are mentioned below
