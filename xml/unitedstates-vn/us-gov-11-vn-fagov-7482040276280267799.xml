    <narrative xml:lang="EN">U.S. assistance will support governance reforms that broaden economic participation, make growth more sustainable, improve labor conditions, facilitate engagement by the private sector and civil society, promote respect for human rights and the rule of law, and expand accountability and transparency. U.S. assistance will help the government address climate change and remediation of contaminated sites, promote biodiversity conservation, combat HIV/AIDS, and make significant investments in higher education and health to improve the livelihoods and well-being of vulnerable groups, particularly persons with disabilities (PWDs). U.S. assistance will also promote regional stability and security by increasing bilateral military cooperation on maritime security, maritime law enforcement, border security, and counter-terrorism; addressing unexploded ordnance; and building capacity in the justice sector, law enforcement, counternarcotics, and nonproliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD).</narrative>
