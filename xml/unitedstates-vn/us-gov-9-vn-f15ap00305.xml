  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This grant provides funding for the Humane Society of the United States / Humane Society International (HSUS/HSI) to plan, organize, and manage a workshop in collaboration with the Government of Vietnam in order to facilitate international cooperation on pangolin conservation. This workshop will provide a venue for pangolin range countries and governmental wildlife and enforcement agencies, non-governmental organizations and pangolin experts to present and discuss the latest pangolin population and international trade information in order to respond to CITES-prescribed calls for information and action. In addition, the workshop will provide an opportunity for participants to develop a unified action plan to protect pangolin species against over-exploitation as a result of international trade. The Government of Vietnam has offered to collaborate on organization of the workshop, and therefore the workshop will be held in Vietnam. Participation of the Asian and African Range countries&#x2019; and species experts is critically needed to meet the workshop objectives to ensure international cooperation from all stakeholders working for pangolin conservation. This project will be conducted as described in the HSUS/HSI grant proposal. The project consists of a series of activities that will occur over the course of approximately 3.5 months and that can be divided into three periods: pre-meeting, during the meeting, and post-meeting. Pre-meeting: During the nine-week period before the meeting HSUS/HSI will: facilitate regular meetings between the governments of Viet Nam and the United States of America, act as a liaison between the two countries on all matters related to the workshop, prepare materials for consideration and approval by both governments, launch and maintain an online registration site for participants, arrange for French and Vietnamese translation of relevant materials, receive and evaluate information and materials from the conference organizing company appointed by the government of Viet Nam and liaise with this company on meeting arrangements, prepare and facilitate preparation of discussion documents for the meeting, arrange for flights for sponsored participants, reimburse approved travel costs for sponsored delegates, arrange payment of all vendors, provide accounting services, and provide assistance to registered delegates, as described in the table in the grant proposal. During the meeting: During the three day meeting, HSI will: facilitate communication and coordination between the two host countries, ensure the smooth operation of the meeting, oversee on-site registration and material distribution, provide assistance to registered delegates, provide rapporteur services, assist in the development of the Action Plan, provide assistance to working groups if these are established, and present information as needed or as requested. Post-meeting: During the five weeks after the meeting, HSI will assist the two host countries to prepare a report of the meeting, arrange for translation of the report into French and Vietnamese, and provide assistance to the host governments in transmitting the report to participants and others if requested to do so.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">U.S. assistance will support governance reforms that broaden economic participation, make growth more sustainable, improve labor conditions, facilitate engagement by the private sector and civil society, promote respect for human rights and the rule of law, and expand accountability and transparency. U.S. assistance will help the government address climate change and remediation of contaminated sites, promote biodiversity conservation, combat HIV/AIDS, and make significant investments in higher education and health to improve the livelihoods and well-being of vulnerable groups, particularly persons with disabilities (PWDs). U.S. assistance will also promote regional stability and security by increasing bilateral military cooperation on maritime security, maritime law enforcement, border security, and counter-terrorism; addressing unexploded ordnance; and building capacity in the justice sector, law enforcement, counternarcotics, and nonproliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD).</narrative>
