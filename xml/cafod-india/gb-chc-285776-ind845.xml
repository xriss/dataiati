   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Cyclone YAAS Emergency Response in West Bengal- START project</narrative>
  </title>
  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">According to ACAPs: Cyclone &#x2018;YAAS&#x2019;, (pronounced as &#x201C;Yass&#x201D;), made landfall at 8.30am on 26th May 2021 40km south west of Balasore and was categorized as a Very Severe Cyclonic Storm (VCSC). Over 2.2 million people were evacuated to relief camps in both states. In West Bengal, the post cyclone floods have breached mud embankments in 134 places leading to extensive flooding. Communication networks were disrupted for 4 to 5 days and the already restricted movements due to Covid19 lockdown have made transportation even more difficult.

The proposed project will target 2400 households/ 12,000 individuals from South 24 Parganas District of West Bengal State (Block: Namkhana and Gosaba, GP: Rangabalia and Mousuni). 

The response will target the most excluded and vulnerable individuals from the tribal, Dalit and other marginalized groups (i.e. Muslim communities), who fall under one or more of the following criteria: 
1. Populations who are excluded from support provided by the government.
2. Severely affected villages on the isolated islands of Mousuni and Rangabelia.
3. Underprivileged young girls and women (rescued and rehabilitated post trafficking).
4. Widows and female headed households.
5. Climate IDPs living along river-banks 
6. People who do not have any identity papers.
The response will consist of the following activities: 
1. Distribution of Hygiene / NFI kit (one combined kit) for 1250 HHs, which will include: Bucket with lid, mug, soap (body and laundry), masks, sanitary napkin, tarpaulin , ground sheet, sleeping mat, mosquito net. 
2. Multi-purpose cash transfer for 1050 HHs of 3500 INR. Cash transfers will be made through the local banking system, a system which Caritas India and their partners have used effectively in this area before. 
3. Awareness raising activity for 2400 HHs focused on providing information on healthy/life-saving hygiene and sanitation practices including Covid19 prevention.</narrative>
