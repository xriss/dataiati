  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">According to the Ministry of Health and Welfare of India, as of May 16th 2021, there have been at least 24,684,000 confirmed cases of the coronavirus in India, according to the Ministry of Health and Welfare and 270,284 people had died. Experts say that the death count far exceeds official figures. In Kerala State the number of confirmed cases as of 16 May is 2,118,263 with a daily average of 30,805 in the last 7 days. In West Bengal State there is a total of 1,114,313 cases with a daily average of 17,308 cases. Both these States have been severely affected by the second wave of Covid-19, with a total number of deaths for both states of 19,476.    

The second wave of Covid-19 reflected the highest ever single-day spike in Covid-19 cases per day in the world since the pandemic begun (more than 4 hundred thousand new cases per day). The impact of this second wave has been devastating: hospitals have been overwhelmed and unable to meet demand; there is a severe lack of ICU beds, ventilators, oxygen and beds, which is preventing affected individuals from receiving essential life-saving care and many people are unable or unaware of how to care or prevent Covid-19 cases. As a result, many people are losing their lives and a high number of Covid-19 deaths are underreported. Additionally, India&#x2019;s Covid vaccine campaign is struggling: Less than 10 % of Indians have received the first dose, despite India being the world&#x2019;s leading vaccine manufacturer.

Caritas India&apos;s response will provide food, treatment for people affected by Covid-19, medical kits for frontline health workers and awareness raising activities.</narrative>
