  <description type="4">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">After a year of preparation, the foundation opened the free clinic in March this year, with six departments &#x2013; family, dental, eye, internal and pediatric medicine and gynecology. Since then, the clinic has received more than 10,000 patients.
In the free clinic, the Syrian doctors, who also are refugees, are able to work as doctors again and help their fellow countrymen.
Now several hundred Syrian refugees are coming to the clinic every day. This center in Turkey has become a place both to protect their health and also to put their hearts at ease.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Taiwan Buddhist Tzu Chi Foundation has established a free clinic for Syrian refugees in the Turkish city of Istanbul. It has received more than 10,000 patients in its first three months of operations.

Turkey has accepted over 2.7 million refugees from Syria, the largest of any country in the world. They have access free of charge to public hospitals but cannot speak Turkish, making it impossible for the staff to treat them. Because many refugees had asked Tzu Chi for help, in response, the foundation started last year to plan a clinic in the Sultangazi district of Istanbul, which is home to 36,000 Syrian refugees.</narrative>
