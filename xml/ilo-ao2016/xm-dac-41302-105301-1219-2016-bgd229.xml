   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The absence of accurate data and information interrupts the holistic development of ITPs in Bangladesh. So the proposed study will provide concrete household information and status of ITPs through which their socio-economic conditions including skills development initiatives will be taken and linked with the job market. In addition to knowledge development to inform policy debates, there is a need to build the capacity of, and promote dialogue and partnerships among key stakeholders on Conventions Nos. 107, 111, 122, 142 and 169 on ITPs&#x2019; issues in the country, including ILO constituents and indigenous peoples&#x2019; institutions. In August 2013, the first ever high-level tripartite workshop on indigenous peoples&#x2019; employment situation in the country took place, with participation from the government, employers and workers&#x2019; organizations. On that occasion, the social partners highlighted their limited capacity in understanding indigenous peoples&#x2019; issues and requested the ILO to continue working with them on this issue. Gender and diversity mainstreaming will be one of the core strategies of implementing this project. This action will feature the involvement of indigenous women and indigenous persons with disabilities. The representation of indigenous women and indigenous persons with disabilities will be ensured in household interviews, focus group discussions and during key informant interviews throughout the project tenure. The collected data will be synthesized through a gender lens. As a part of its strategy, the project will ensure participation of indigenous and tribal peoples in the project design and implementation stages so that they can take ownership of this project and are able to incorporate their voices and concerns at the final outcome of this study. Local government officials and representatives of the ITPs will be consulted at the national level through appropriate institutional mechanism. This will facilitate smooth data collection process and will enable the study team to gain valuable access to the private and public institutions.</narrative>
