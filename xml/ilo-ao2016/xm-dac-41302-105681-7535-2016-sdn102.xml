   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The ILO has more than 40 years of experience in mainstreaming Employment intensive investments (EIIP) which links infrastructure development with employment creation, poverty reduction and local economic and social development. In using local labour and resources they create much needed employment and income, reduce costs, save foreign currency, and support local industry while increasing the capacity of local institutions. The combination of local participation in planning with the utilization of locally available skills, appropriate technology, materials and work methods has proven to be an effective and economically viable approach to infrastructure works and jobs creation in many countries. The ILO plans to build on its long history and experience to mainstream EIIP methodologies in national and local institutaions in Sudan. The project will contribute to improved infrastructure and connectivity in the areas, which in turn will bring considerable benefits to women, children and other vulnerable groups, such as elderly and disabled people. Improved transport services contribute to enhance other services, such as quality rural health and education. Girls will have a better chance of attending secondary school and farmers will reach markets more easily. Other business opportunities will be generated, in particular for women and youth. Better roads will bring more customers/buyers to the area, improving the opportunities to expand women&#x2019;s small enterprises. The maintenance and rehabilitation of roads through labour-intensive methods of work can generate jobs and create business opportunities for the most disadvantaged individuals. For instance, people who have been displaced by conflict and return to their farms and villages (returnees) can be employed and have immediate access to a form of cash income. This would enable them to purchase the basic items for their re-establishment as farmers, traders or in other livelihoods. They would dispose of an income during the recovery period, while villages are rebuilt and the production cycle can be restarted on the farms. It is estimated that a total of 507,000 civilians (the majority being female heads of household) within the five States would benefit directly from the rehabilitation of the choke points. The ILO will ensure adequate coordination and facilitation of all project activities with the five States. This will be achieved through partnership with local authorities, NGOs, social partners, private and public sector, and all other stakeholders involved in the project.</narrative>
