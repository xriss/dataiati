  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Skills that workers and enterprise require will depend on the evolving nature of work and types of new jobs created. Technology is driving up skill needs and greater automation is putting low-skilled workers at risk while demands for high-skilled workers are increasing. Further, climate change and environmental degradation will require a just and inclusive transition to a greener economy where skills will be needed for newly emerging and adjusted &#x201C;greened&#x201D; existing jobs. What is the prospect for the future of work in the region and how and to what extent are the Member States responding or prepared to respond? While there has been much debate and work on this theme in other regions, mostly among developed countries, the perspectives and experiences of the Asia and Pacific region need to be further developed. As the region accounts for 60 per cent of the global labour force, the theme is relevant and requires urgent attention. Further, ASEAN is committed to promoting economic integration and sustainable growth so that both women and men benefit from the creation of the ASEAN Economic Community. The goal is that vulnerable groups are not left behind. This runs in parallel with the 2030 agenda for Sustainable Development which pledges that &#x201C;no one will be left behind&#x201D; and resolves to build just and inclusive societies and shared prosperity. To meet these objectives, it is critical that the debate on the future of work and skills give special attention to low and middle skilled workers, women and other vulnerable groups. Objectives &#xBF; The forum will bring the perspective and experience from the Asia and Pacific to the current global debate (and ILO&#x2019;s global work) on jobs and skills mismatch. It will share new analyses and recent ILO studies to deepen our understanding on the issue. &#xBF; The forum will highlight main initiatives by the Member States and development partners in the 5-6 main areas of reform to make skills systems ready to meet future demands of skills. This will facilitate knowledge and experience sharing among the Member States and development partners. It may also highlight the areas of overlaps in terms of development assistance. &#xBF; The discussion will highlight the areas or types of initiatives that further work is required and indicate the areas of future development assistance.</narrative>
