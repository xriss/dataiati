  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Children will be referred to ILO from UNICEF and its partners, and after an initial assessment of basic needs and interests, the ILO will undertake an in-depth and more technical needs assessment which will serve as a baseline for interventions. The needs assessment will review individual needs of children, the socio-economic status of the families; and the community-based requirements. This will be undertaken through a participatory process where the aspirations of children will be balanced with realities on the ground through a process of robust dialogue with all concerned parties. This thorough assessment will ensure that children are placed in the most suitable economic empowerment service for them. It is emphasized that girls and boys below the national minimum age of employment (14 years) will be not be referred to ILO programs but to educational programs by UNICEF and its partners. The project will undertake a comprehensive exploration of the economic opportunities and the training facilities available in the local communities identified as most vulnerable and where children and youth affected by armed conflicts need to be reintegrated. Given the poor state of formal labour markets in post-conflict situations and the low educational and skills level of most of the children and youth affected by armed conflicts, &#x201C;job&#x201D; and training opportunities will also be oriented towards opportunities to make a living within the &#x201C;informal&#x201D; economy. As in the past, the project will thus identify activities for which there is a demand in the local market, for example as there is a demand for shelter, all construction related skills are in demand. However, it will also try to identify specific, innovative &#x201C;niches&#x201D; which are expected to be profitable, for example food processing.</narrative>
