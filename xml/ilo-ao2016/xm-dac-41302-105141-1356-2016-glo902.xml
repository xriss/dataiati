   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The funds of the European Commission (EC) will be used to build further on the on-going Canadian/Swiss project&#x2019;s overall objectives of contributing to a better application of labour provisions of international trade and investment arrangements. This will be achieved mainly through two specific and identifiable objectives that will deepen and broaden the activities in the on-going project with regard to knowledge building and knowledge sharing activities (see logical framework in Annex B). The additional knowledge building activities aim at aiding in developing policy initiatives to improve the overall design of labour provisions that impact on their effectiveness in improving labour standards. Results will be peer reviewed by other international organizations working on key macroeconomic issues, particularly with respect to trade and labour market issues, as well as the regional academic and policy community. This will ensure better policy coherence, and that key policy messages are mainstreamed into country strategies developed by international organizations. The project will enhance and develop knowledge sharing activities at the national/regional levels through expert workshops and policy dialogue activities. This aims at improving the dialogue between and monitoring capacity of the relevant actors when dealing with labour provisions in trade and investment agreements. One aspect of this includes the already established tripartite advisory committee with members from other donor countries, as well academics and experts in the field of trade and labour from non-donor countries who will attend the regional events (see Annex C. for list of members of the Advisory Committee). The EC trade and labour representative will be able to participate directly in the tri-partite committee and dialogue with actors at the national and regional level. The project will also benefit from an internal network of ILO experts in Geneva and field offices in the area of labour standards, compliance, trade, social dialogue, training, multinational enterprises and global value chains who act as consultants and research advisors on the background papers and field activities. The overall objective of this network will be to validate research findings, create an opportunity for dialogue on key research issues, and strengthen the dissemination of the project results.</narrative>
