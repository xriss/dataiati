   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project will aim at strengthening the efforts of workers&#x2019; and employers&#x2019; organizations in contributing to policies to fight against child labour, including its worst forms, in Chile, Fiji, Ghana Benin and Zambia, and at strengthening social dialogue as an effective tool to eradicate the worst forms of child labour through the implementation of such policies in order to achieve Outcome 16 on the Elimination of child labour, with priority given to the worst forms through capacity building. The project will build on the new tool and material produced in the context of the previous Irish Aid Partnership and of the effective collaboration between ACT/EMP and ACTRAV entitled &#x201C;Employers&#x2019; and Workers&#x2019; Handbook on hazardous child labour, through capacity building for workers&#x2019; and employers&#x2019; organisations&#x201D; (HHCLWE) and the video on good practices involving social partners. The Handbook was produced in an effort to kick-start a campaign against hazardous child labour, which was the theme of the World Day against Child Labour in 2011. It provides an overview of child labour as defined by ILO Conventions, and it describes how employers and workers are working jointly to combat hazardous child labour in key sectors, such as agriculture, construction, mining and manufacturing, and makes suggestions on how this cooperation could be strengthened in the future. The contents of the handbook are connected to country&#x2019;s Decent Work Programme Outcomes. The application and dissemination of the Handbook will be the main tool, while complementary activities may reflect national approaches and regional strategies identified by the workers&#x2019; and employers&#x2019; organisations in the field. They will be the ultimate and direct beneficiaries of this Project. Depending on the national profile, attention will be paid in particular to supporting the capacity of the social partners to reach out to employers and workers in the informal economy and in agriculture, where most child labour is to be found. The Project Development Objective is to contribute to the elimination of the Worst Forms of Child Labour (WFCL) through social dialogue and focusing on the enhancement of the capacity of social partners. The Immediate Objectives of this Project are: &#x2022; Employers&#x2019; and Workers&#x2019; organizations are better prepared to participate in national tripartite coordination mechanisms on child labour policies; &#x2022; Social partners have improved their role in the implementation of National policies/programmes on child labour with special focus on the worst form.</narrative>
