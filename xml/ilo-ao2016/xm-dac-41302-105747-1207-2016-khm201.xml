   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Development Objective: To create enabling conditions for decent and productive employment and to prepare young people for the world of work. Immediate objective 1: Strengthening institutional mechanisms for leadership, coordination and implementation of policies This objective aims to support setting up of an inter-ministerial coordination mechanism including social partners, to strengthen the organizational and technical capacity of the members of such inter-ministerial committee, to strengthen the capacity of the MoLVT to act as a secretariat of such committee, and to support implementation of NEP. The time-bound implementation plan will need to contain monitoring indicators and targets that will also contribute to monitoring progress on SDGs related to decent work. Immediate objective 2: Supporting young women and men with access to quality education and technical/vocational skills training This objective is geared towards offering the quality and relevant education and formal technical/vocational skills programmes, including through workplace-based training programmes such as apprenticeships and internships, entrepreneurship as well as training on core/soft skills, life skills and employment and vocational counselling and guidance. This will be accomplished in partnering with the relevant ministries such as the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sport (MoEYS), the Ministry of Labour and Vocational Training (MoLVT). The project will ensure a gender focus with strengthened partnerships with the industry sector and skills standards development. Immediate objective 3: Protecting young women and men from the risk of abuse and discrimination at work Securing decent jobs entails securing young people&#x2019;s participation at the policy level, including at the local level, where rights at work are observed and understood by both workers and employers; and promoting a working environment whereby young people are free to organize, are listened to and are valued equally. This component will seek to re-enforce the rights of young people at work while protecting them from abuse, discrimination and other risks.</narrative>
