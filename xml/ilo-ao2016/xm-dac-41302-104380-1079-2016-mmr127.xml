   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Executive Summary The Programme for Responsible Business (PRB) in Myanmar aims to make use of responsible business as a concept integrated in a growth and employment programme, combining the responsibility dimension to the economic development dimension from the outset. It is planned to run from 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2015 (2 years) and has a budget of 25 million DKK. The development objective of the programme is: &#x201C;Inclusive economic growth to be accompanied by responsible business practices in Myanmar&#x201D; and will be measured through three indicators, namely: &#x2022; The supported sectors&#x2019; contribution to GDP &#x2022; Number of companies (and size) within each industry supported, actively applying responsible business standards in their business operations and &#x2022; Number of decent jobs created in the sectors supported (by gender, social group and location). The PRB contains three components, namely: 1) Component 1: The Regulatory Framework Component 2) Component 2: The Responsible Industry Development Component with a focus on the garment and fisheries sectors 3) Component 3: The Private Sector Component on Responsible Business. The main themes of the three PRB components directly relate to human rights, good governance, democratisation and environment and climate change issues. When dealing with the private sector the UN Global Compact 10 principles will play an important basis for all three components. In terms of management and organisation, at the programme level, a PRB Coordination Committee (PCC) will be established. The major role of the PCC will be to ensure that the activities of the three components are well coordinated so no overlap will occur and synergy will be tapped where possible. The PRB monitoring and results measurement system will build on the system developed by the Donor Committee for Enterprise Development Standard for Measuring Achievements in Private Sector Development (DCED RM Standard). Progress reports will be submitted to the PCC and Danida according to the following schedule: &#x2022; April 2014 an inception report covering the first 3 months. &#x2022; February 2015 an annual report covering year 2014 &#x2022; August 2015 a semi annual report covering the first half year of 2015 &#x2022; End 2016 a completion report covering the entire programme period (emphasis on impact and lessons learnt).</narrative>
