   <narrative xml:lang="EN">People with disabilities in Egypt tend to be economically excluded and are non-active in the labor market. Moreover, many disabled people in Egypt lack the needed ICT, soft and entrepreneurial skills to start their own businesses. This project aims to empower persons with disabilities through the use of ICT solutions, with a specific focus on the ICT and tourism sector. Capacity building of training and employment service providers will facilitate persons with disabilities&#x2019; employment opportunities in the labor market. The project will be implemented by three partners: UNDP in Egypt, International Labor Organization in Egypt and the Egypt-ICT Trust Fund. The estimated timeline is 18 months, with a budget of 349,997 USD. The project aims to target 6 governorates, 600 young persons with disabilities out of which 300 will successfully integrate in the labour market, 6 NGOs serving persons with disabilities, 200 Design-athon participants (including computer Science/engineering students, young entrepreneurs, NGOs, persons with disabilities, innovators, designers and tech-oriented companies), 25 institutions offering improved training and employment services for persons with disabilities, 30 employers engaged in hiring persons with disabilities or offering internships for persons with disabilities, and 60 trainers of public and private training providers. The project&#x2019;s objectives will be fulfilled by 1) providing baseline needs assessment study in the selected governorates 2) promoting the concept of entrepreneurship 3) empowering persons with disabilities through face to face training and e-learning solutions, 4) raising awareness among employers of the benefits of hiring persons with disabilities, 5) capacity building for NGOs, training and employment service providers and 6) encouraging social innovation for enhancing the daily lives of persons with disabilities.</narrative>
