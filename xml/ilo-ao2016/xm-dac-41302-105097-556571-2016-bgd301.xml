  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project is established to support the political willingness of the Bangladesh government and social partners to adopt a national employment injury insurance scheme and to set up the public institution required for its implementation. It is closely linked to the Sustainability Compact for Continuous Improvements in Labour Rights and Factory Safety in the Ready-Made Garment and Knitwear Industry in Bangladesh (8 July 2013 ), namely the commitment of the Bangladesh counterparts to implement the National Tripartite Plan of Action on Fire Safety and Structural Integrity in the RMG Industry in Bangladesh with the support of the ILO which was adopted in March 2013. The project builds on the lessons from the Rana Plaza Compensation Arrangement which had to be organised on an ad hoc basis to look after the dire needs for income support and access to medical and rehabilitation services for the victims while this had a high cost for the parties involved in the financing. The national EII scheme will contribute directly to the National Development Plan of Bangladesh, namely the vision of the Perspective Plan 2010-21 &#x2018;to build Bangladesh into a resilient, productive, innovative and prosperous nation with a caring society consisting of healthy, happy, and well-educated people.&#x2019; This project intends to support the adoption of a national and institutional legal framework and to support the establishment of the new public administration capacity that will extend coverage gradually to wage earners in Bangladesh, starting with workers at least of the ready-made-garments sector and the supply chain and extending to all workers. From ILO vast pool of experiences in assisting governments with the establishment of social security institutions, it is crucial the provision of ILO expertise be secured to assist the national dialogue with social partners and other key parties so to arrive at an acceptable policy design and an administration capable of delivering on its promises and that ILO support continue until the stabilization period which normally comes after the third year of operations.</narrative>
