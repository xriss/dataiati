   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The overall objective of this Project is to contribute to the recovery, reconstruction and development of areas struck by natural disasters in disaster-prone countries in Asia and the Pacific including the Philippines. The project will support ILO to strengthen, promote and disseminate its overall approach which entails immediate employment support during the emergency phase that transitions into medium-term livelihood recovery during the recovery phase. To achieve this objective, the Project takes a three-pronged strategy. The first component of the strategy is to learn from recent disaster response in the Region and in particular from the integration of employment promotion strategies in disaster response programmes and the impact of such strategies in a number of selected countries including the Philippines. It will support knowledge sharing of employment-focused disaster risk reduction and recovery throughout the Asia and Pacific region based on lessons learned from selected countries and through the development of knowledge products. The second component will support the ILO at regional level to formulate a natural disaster response strategy with employment creation at its core. The project will allow the ILO to engage with other stakeholders in the Region and promote its employment creation strategies with the objective to mainstream employment creation and livelihood recovery in crisis response. The third component will support selected countries in the Region, including the Philippines, to plan, mainstream and implement employment creation strategies in crisis response programmes and projects. The Project will allow the ILO to take on a pro-active role in coordinating and promoting employment creation in case a natural disaster occurs in the region during the project period and international support is requested.</narrative>
