   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Mobilizing the private sector to deliver HIV prevention, treatment, and care in high prevalence areas of Papua and West Papua.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The primary objective of the project is to develop a low cost model to deliver effective HIV prevention, counselling and testing and treatment support services through the private sector. Focus will be on workers in ports, transport and natural resource sectors in Papua and West Papua, and the project will partner with 3 to 5 large scale employers, including state owned oil company Pertamina. Activities to deliver prevention and HIV Counselling and Testing(HCT) services to workers in the informal sector will also be carried out in two selected port areas and in Pertamina owned fuel stations working with trade union and industry associations. The programme will deliver HIV prevention to a targeted 30,000 workers and HIV counselling and testing to 10,000 workers as well as treatment care and support to workers in need. Drawing on 2014 Integrated Biological and Behavioral Surveillance (IBBS) data and addressing priorities in the provincial AIDS strategy, particular emphasis will be placed on mobile male workers who live and work apart from their regular partners. Emphasis will also be placed on indigenous Papuan workers who show significantly higher HIV and syphilis prevalence rates compared to non-Papuans. A rapid assessment will be carried out at the beginning of the project to identify specific geographic locations and identify required linkages between ILO labour and enterprise partners and existing NGOs and public health service providers. The private sector engagement proposed here will be directly linked to existing HIV services including HIV Cooperation Program Indonesia (HCPI)behaviour change interventions and REACH clinical services as well as other provincial health programmes. Key activities to be carried out include: Needs assessment- will be conducted to identify priority districts, sub populations, and service delivery patterns. It is assumed at this stage that the focus will be on major port areas, mining, oil, and gas industries in locations with higher HIV prevalence. Workplace Programmes in large scale enterprises- programmes will focus on prevention and the delivery of HCT services in collaboration with NGO and health service partners. Informal sector programmes in ports and transport industries - the programme will partner industry associations and trade unions to facilitate worker uptake of available public and NGO services for HCT and HIV treatment and support. The project will also work with Pertamina to deliver HIV prevention information, condoms and mobile HCT through it networks of gasoline stations in the province. Operational research- will be carried out focusing on at least one private sector partnership to measure the costs and benefits of such an effort as well as to inform future programmes on ways to work effectively with the private sector on HIV/STI issues. Report on effective approaches for the private sector-based on the lesson learnt of the project and the results of the operational research, the ILO will prepare a report on effective approaches for working with the private sector in concentrated and low level generalized epidemics to inform future DFAT strategic planning.</narrative>
