   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Sustaining GSP-Plus Status by strengthened national capacities to improve ILS compliance and reporting - Mongolia project is part of a global project funded by the European Commission to enhance the capacity of GSP+ beneficiary country to improve its capacity to report on progress made to the application of the fundamental labour standards and other relevant human rights instrument. The project is for a duration of 24 months with a budget of EUR 200,000. Since 2006, Mongolia benefits from the new Generalised Scheme of Preferences (GSP+), which is in force until the 31st of December 2015. This grants Mongolia a full removal of tariffs on over 66% of tariff lines additional trade preferences as an incentive to ratify and effectively implement 27 international conventions on human and labour rights, environmental protection and good governance. This new GSP+ regulation has introduced a strengthened monitoring mechanism &#x2013; in the form of a scorecard - to ensure beneficiary countries comply with their commitments under the 27 key conventions on ratification, effective implementation, compliance with reporting requirements and cooperation. The monitoring process for Mongolia includes eight ILO fundamental Conventions. As part of this the Government of Mongolia has to report to the EU on the progress made in the effective implementation of these conventions. The EU in its GSP+ dialogue The GSP+ scorecard highlighted several areas in need of improvement: inter-institutional coordination; institutional capacity strengthening and technical support for reporting requirements; and dialogue facilitation between stakeholders (trade unionists, the private sector, Congress and the Government). To support Mongolian export industries and all other stakeholders, the EC has funded a number of awareness and capacity building projects under the GSP+ scheme implemented through the Asia Trust Fund in cooperation with the International Trade Centre (ITC) with a focus on the development of Geographical Indications for Mongolian products as a way to increase the products value on world markets.</narrative>
