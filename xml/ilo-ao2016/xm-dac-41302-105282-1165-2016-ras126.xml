   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project proposal is developed based on on-going discussions with tripartite constituents as to the development aspirations and the needs in terms of OSH in Myanmar and employment promotion in Viet Nam, respectively. As noted above, the project builds on both bilateral and multilateral assistance in the area of labour law reform which requires regional coordination both in terms of provision of technical expertise and regional knowledge and feedback from the country level for wider policy and methodological discussions and strategy development. Moreover the project requires coordination with other regional initiatives, such as technical and policy support work of the ILO to the ASEAN integration process, thus ensuring cross-country policy coherence. The project is therefore situated above a country level approach and while the country-level interventions are in different technical areas, the synergetic effects of a regional combined approach need to be harnessed via a regional management structure linking back into the Decent Work Team resources and expertise. A similar regional approach has been successfully applied to other technical areas such as ILO work on social protection. Part 1: Supporting the improvement of the legal and institutional framework on occupational safety and health in Myanmar This project aims to contribute to better, safer and healthier working conditions in Myanmar through a three-tiered approach that will support an enabling institutional and legal framework, which is in line with international standards, strengthen the capacity of institutions to promote OSH and conduct OSH/labour inspection and improve the data collection and analysis of occupational accidents and diseases. Part 2: Support to VIET NAM&#x2019;s Public Employment Policy (from Policy to Implementation) The proposed project will focus on helping the country to further develop and implement its public employment policy. It is understood however that a PEP will be more effective if it is part of a policy mix. Vocational training and public employment services for example are supported under other regional ILO partnerships (Korea and Japan). The project will contribute to a process of consultation with Vietnamese experts working in these areas to ensure synergy and complementarity of interventions.</narrative>
