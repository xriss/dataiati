  </title>
  <description type="4">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">An elevated concrete water tower that can carry a 20m3 tank will be erected in Buramino to serve the refugees and local residents. A reservoir has been imported that has the capacity of storing 100 cubic meters of water and will serve as the main booster tank for the whole water supply in the camp. Income generation activities are also occurring that cover food production and craft making. A poultry production project is also underway to supplement nutritional intake through eggs. Eggs collected can also be marketed so that participants can by other necessities with their money. Each family gets four hens and one rooster to take care of with the necessary materials to house the animals. Training is being given to participants on poultry diseases and prevention techniques. Another small project is Multi-Storey Gardening (MSG). Its aim is to encourage the growth of fruits and vegetables to ensure diet diversity and some income generation. The project is allowing households to produce a variety of vegetables in a large bag by structuring it in a way that the vegetables have space to grow not only from the top but also from two or three punctured slits in the sides of the bag. Lastly, refugees will work towards improving environmental protection through protection trainings and awareness raising sessions.</narrative>

  </description>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project is working to fulfill the basic needs of Somali refugees in Buramino camp and the host community through initiatives in WASH, livelihood and environmental protection and natural resource management activities. Somalia is still in the grip of a drought and food crisis combined with insecurity within the country. This has caused unprecedented numbers of its citizens to flee the country and seek safety in Ethiopia, Kenya and Djibouti. Refugee camps in Ethiopia are reaching their expanded capacities, making the establishment of a 6th camp an urgent priority. By the end of the project, refugees and host community members will have better access to fundamental basic needs and have increased their capacity for better livelihoods.</narrative>
