   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Fuel Efficiency in Tea Estates of Assam</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="4">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Main activities:
? Train twelve local potters in manufacturing two-pot mud rocket stoves (with chimney) that fulfil the emerging international standards for fuel-efficiency and emission reduction (as per Lima Accord) while also meeting the cooking needs of local populations.
? Mentor local potters in setting up small businesses and provide training in book-keeping, marketing and quality control.
? Build on Mercy Corps&#x2019; work with financial services on tea estates to encourage management to create a subsidy fund whereby fuel-efficient stoves would be available at a 50% subsidised rate with repayment embedded into salary disbursements.
? Develop marketing and awareness material to increase uptake of fuel-efficient stoves.
? Work with Mercy Corps&#x2019; existing four partner tea companies to enhance technology adoption, fuel-efficient stove businesses and marketing models on all tea estates.
Expected impacts
Immediate impact:
? 1,000 households use fuel-efficient stoves in their homes and save an estimated 750 MT of firewood annually.
? Reductions in rates of local deforestation.
4
? At least 2,000 women and children will spend less time collecting firewood and have increased time for productive activities or schooling.
? At least 6,000 people will be less exposed to health risks from smoke inhalation.
? Annual reductions in CO2 emissions of an estimated 1,216 MT.
Post project impact:
? Four tea companies, who together own more than 90 tea estates in Assam, promote adoption of fuel-efficient technologies via local micro and small enterprises (MSEs), and replicate this model on other estates covering at least 50,000 workers.
Long term:
? Increased awareness of the economic and health benefits of fuel efficient stoves will encourage the replication of this approach throughout the industry, while additionally acting as a catalyst for the adoption of fuel efficient technologies in the tea drying process.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project will promote the adoption of fuel-efficient stoves for tea estate workers in Northeast India. More than 500,000 labourers work on the tea estates, earning daily wages of US$1.5 or less. They live in small mud houses provided by the plantation. A typical household requires 1.9 tonnes of firewood annually to cook their daily meals. 60% of the wood is supplied by the estate management, as per the 1951 Plantation Labour Act, but compliance is threatened by declines in wood availability. The remaining 40% is bought, collected or stolen by households, with children and women spending a disproportionate amount of their productive time sourcing this. The use of fuel-efficient stoves would decrease wood fuel consumption by 40% - saving 1,140 tonnes each year for the target 1,500 households. Fuel-efficient stoves would also reduce the incidences of smoke-related respiratory and eye problems, particularly for women and children.
Mercy Corps and the Indian Tea Association will ensure Tea Estate Managements adopt fuel efficient stoves for workers through access to appropriate technology, sustainable business models and finance. The project will build upon Mercy Corps&#x2019; other energy poverty work and will be integrated into current programmes helping tea estate workers to improve livelihoods through access to financial services.</narrative>
