   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Expansion of the current Alliances- SJ project in Georgia.

Purpose: to enable the livestock market system to function more inclusively of small-scale livestock producers in Samtskhe-Javakheti resulting in improved productivity, incomes and resilience to livelihood shocks.

The outcomes of Alliances-SJ are the result of market-system changes brought about through systemic interventions. The proposed opening interventions for each outcome, listed below the outputs, have been identified through engagement with current and potential stakeholders who could be partners of Alliances-SJ (see Stakeholder Analysis) and market research and analysis (see market analysis, focus group, gender, and DRR research) and are at various stages of negotiation and development.  There will be a staggered approach to their implementation influenced by conditions in the market and the development of the relationships with the key players involved.  In some cases the potential of these on-going and proposed opening interventions may not be realized or the intervention redesigned according to the on-going relationship with the stakeholder and market conditions.  It is predicted that those involving the changing legislative environment and the interface with government, for example, will entail longer lead times and preparation.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Goal: To contribute to poverty alleviation and the transition to a durable market economy for the livestock sector in the Samtskhe-Javakheti region of Georgia.

Alliances-SJ aims to reduce income poverty of 20% of small-scale livestock producers (9,000 households) in Samtskhe-Javakheti through a 10% increase in incomes    arising from livestock production.   This will be achieved by engaging market players in addressing systemic market constraints that currently prevent them from participating in markets fully and on favorable terms and providing information and market-driven incentives for them to invest in improving productivity in a way that also benefits these market players.

This target is an estimate of what the program believes is achievable based on the market analysis conducted as part of the preparation for Phase 2.  We estimate that a total of 9,000 households will access at least one improved service (and will endeavor to avoid double-counting where possible).  Income from livestock enterprises will be elevated as a result of:

Improved production:  an attributable increase in the volume of output of products from the farm.  
Improved productivity: an attributable increase in quality and or quantity of production relative to the inputs.  In the case of Alliances-SJ, this will relate mainly to improving time efficiency as well as reducing production and transaction costs. 
Increased productive asset value (net worth):  an attributable increase in the value of productive assets; for example, cattle through improved breeding.</narrative>
