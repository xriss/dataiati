   <narrative xml:lang="EN">MC and Ensibuuko partnered to roll out the organisation&apos;s MOBIS platform. Ensibuuko is an early start-up technology enterprise that facilitates development solutions geared to increasing access to finance and information services to smallholder farmers. Demonstrating its success, Ensibuuko won the &#x2018;Hackathon,&#x2019; organised by CTA during the ICT4Ag Conference 2013. The product developed was mainly focused on linking buyers to sellers through rural financial institutions. Currently their new product offering, &#x201C;Mobile Banking Information Systems&#x201D; (MOBIS), a core banking and information platform, seeks increased access and efficiency to financial services and information to both the rural financial institutions and farmers. This product is particularly targeting Savings and Credit Cooperatives (SACCOs).

A key alignment of this proposal with CTAs Apps4Ag Learning Opportunities call is the delivery of training required for its user&#x2019;s to adopt the mobile application. MOBIS offers a unique opportunity to increase efficiency operations and information for and to its end-user clients. With a robust information system, a track record of transaction history for the farmers can be enhanced. Increasing access to information to the farmers through a mobile platform will be a vital tool in creating more trust and confidence with the SACCOs. Being a core banking software and customized to the needs of the SACCOs, its product is integrated to mobile features such as SMS and &#x2018;mobile money&#x2019; to allow SACCOs&#x2019; clients to access financial services at low transactional cost.</narrative>
