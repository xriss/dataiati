   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Mercy Corps&apos; Food for Progress program in Liberia is engaging in market-driven activities that will re-establish and improve productive agricultural capacity and livelihoods, availability of and access to food in rural areas, and income generation. The Food for Progress program uses proceeds from monetization of 2360 metric tons (MT) of soybean oil to work with communities in the four central Liberian counties of Bong, Grand Bassa, Margibi, and Montserrado. Through the program, Mercy Corps is increasing agricultural productivity through targeted training and technical assistance on market-driven agricultural practices to 60 farmer groups in 60 communities (1,500 farmers). Additionally, the program is improving functioning of markets through development of sub-sector and market linkages by supporting agribusinesses and micro-enterprises and increasing access to information through market-based radio news. Mercy Corps is working with the 60 supported communities to provide access to appropriate palm oil presses promoted through a USAID project implemented by Winrock International. Any farmer who has participated in the USDA-supported producer groups has access to purchase the Freedom Mill through a cost share process. Mercy Corps is also creating access through promotional events and local input suppliers at market days in the areas of the supported communities.  The program also provide access to loan through community microfinance associations/village savings and loan assocations (VSLAs).</narrative>
