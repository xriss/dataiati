   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This is an initial planning phase where Mercy Corps will work closely with Nike to develop and finalize the strategy for community development and worker empowerment for Indonesian factory workers at two contract factories that produce Nike branded products in Tangerang and Karawang.

The FLY program seeks to engage TMs in the process of creating a financial literacy program that specifically identifies and addresses the unique financial behaviors of TMs. Mercy Corps will accomplish this goal through using the positive deviance methodology whereby Mercy Corps will identify TMs with positive financial behaviors, learn how they developed such behaviors, and design a program that scales these behaviors across the TM population.</narrative>
