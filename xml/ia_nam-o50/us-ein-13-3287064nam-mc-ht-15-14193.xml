   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Over the next 12 months, Mercy Corps&#x2019; goal is to solidify the Credit for Conservation methodology. CFC is successfully meeting VTE&#x2019;s ultimate goal of increasing the resiliency, incomes and productivity of communities in rural Haiti through locally-led natural resource management and sustainable agricultural initiatives. Mercy Corps is requesting $500,000 from the Barr Foundation to achieve four outcomes that protect and maximize the investments of the VTE program to date:
Outcome 1: The local partners  are sustainably and profitably managing the credit portfolio and land management aspects of the CFC methodology.
Outcome 2:  Two new local organizations (IGPDM and IGPDL) have the capacity to manage sustainable community development initiatives, and one organization (OPD8) has the capacity to professionalize their management capacity.
Outcome 3: Groups in Haiti are able to replicate the CFC methodology. 
Outcome 4: In partnership, Mercy Corps and Barr Foundation will work to identify funding opportunities to improve 18 kilometers of road from Montrouis to Fond Baptiste.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Since 2011, Mercy Corps has been responding to environmental degradation in the 6th and 4th Sections  of the upper mountain regions of Commune Arcahaie through the Vie, T&#xE8; &amp;amp; Eneji (VTE) program. In November 2013, building on the key successes and lessons learned during VTE Phase I, Mercy Corps and the Barr Foundation launched the innovative Credit for Conservation (CFC) program. Eighteen months after the launch of the pilot, quantitative data, results of the external evaluation and partner feedback show that the CFC methodology is successfully incentivizing farmers to adopt more resilient and productive agricultural practices and demonstrating that the program can be locally-led, scalable, sustainable, and cost-effective.  

We are achieving VTE&#x2019;s goal of breaking the reinforcing cycle of poverty and improving rural livelihoods by increasing incomes, improving crop yields, and building resilience. VTE beneficiaries, who started implementing improved land management practices in 2012 and participated in the CFC program in 2014, have increased their incomes by 123% and their staple crop yields have increased by an average of 24%. The 2014 CFC pilot farmers are projected to increase their revenue by 113% in two years and by 273% in five years. 

The conservation techniques promoted by VTE are improving farm resilience. In April 2014, the rainy season began as expected in the 4th Section of Montrouis, but in May the rain stopped, producing major losses for the 2014 bean harvest. In the face of this drought, VTE farmers fared much better than farmers who do not implement improved land management practices in their gardens. This season the farmers who began implementing VTE-developed improved land management practices in 2012 had a 50% higher bean yield than the farmers who just started using conservation methods in 2014 and a 71% higher bean yield than farmers who do not yet practice any improved land management practices in their gardens.</narrative>
