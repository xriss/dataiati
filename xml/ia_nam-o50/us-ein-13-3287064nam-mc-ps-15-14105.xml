   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed program will increase appropriate employment and self-employment opportunities for youth in the West Bank by ensuring access to quality TVET institutions and utilizing relevant technology and ICT-based interventions. Mercy Corps will work with existing TVET institutions to ensure market-based courses and curricula, quality instruction and teaching methodologies, necessary infrastructure support, as well as links to local labor market opportunities post-graduation. Building on Mercy Corps&#x2019; experience in the region, the program will have a unique focus on the use of technology in the classroom and in the workforce and will also equip youth with relevant skills needed for labor participation in the ICT sector. Through a youth-led, market-driven approach, the program will promote youth development in the West Bank through the provision of transferable and technical skills and accessible, quality educational and employment opportunities rooted in local labor market demand. The program will also make an important contribution to strengthening and diversifying the skills of the rapidly growing Palestinian workforce.</narrative>
