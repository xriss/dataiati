   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Passing the Torch will take an integrated approach to youth sport and leadership by cultivating young people&#x2019;s skills and confidence to serve as coaches, mentors, and community leaders. During the initial one-year pilot phase, the program will work in Iraq and Pakistan&#x2014;both countries in which Coca-Cola has a strong presence and where Mercy Corps has a long history and significant on-the-ground capacity.

 
 Passing the Torch will draw heavily on the methodologies, activities, and lessons learned from Mercy Corps&#x2019; Sport for Change programs, which harness the power of sports and games to teach resilience, teamwork, self-esteem and constructive communication to youth affected by crisis and poverty. 

 
 Iraq will implement the project in the Karbala and Hilla areas through public Ministry of Education schools to reach 5,000 low-income students ages 10-14 years old. Twenty schools will be selected based on criteria established by Coca-Cola Iraq, Mercy Corps and a local partner. Primary among those criteria will be the presence of a reputable and qualified sports coach who is committed to be trained on, and implement, the Passing the Torch methodology. This coach will then co-train and manage a group of five youth leaders at the school. Each youth leader will be responsible for working with fifty youth divided into two groups of twenty-five. Coaches will be present during all sessions and youth participants will engage in a minimum of two sessions per week with each session having a 1 &#xBD; - 2 hours duration.</narrative>
