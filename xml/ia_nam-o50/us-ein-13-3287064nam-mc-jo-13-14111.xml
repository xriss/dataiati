   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Syrians began fleeing the insecurity in their country and entering Jordan as early as March 2011. While host communities are trying to meet the needs of Syrians, they are struggling as their scarce resources continue to be stretched to the limit and frictions between Syrians and Jordanian have emerged. Cultural similarities have hitherto helped to manage differences; however, increasing competition over scarce resources and a perception of inequitable resource distribution are manifesting in violence.

By providing respected members of the Jordanian host and the Syrian refugee communities with constructive ways to identify sources of instability between their communities and negotiate common solutions to these problems, then they will be more likely to view each other as partners and seek joint solutions to current and emerging problems.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The overarching goal of this program is to enable Jordanian host communities and Syrian refugees to manage current and emerging tensions between their communities and develop common solutions to immediate problems that threaten to destabilize relations between these two groups. To achieve this goal, legitimate representatives of the Syrian refugee and Jordanian host populations in 10 high-need areas will be selected to work together to manage inter-communal tensions and develop projects to address needs.

Cost extension: The overarching goal of this program is to provide assistance in crisis prevention and response through management and mitigation of outbreaks of civil conflict in Jordan as a consequence of the Syrian refugee crisis.

This goal will be achieved through the following outcomes:
1. To enable Jordanian hosts and Syrian refugees to manage current and emerging tensions between their communities and develop common solutions to immediate problems that threaten to destabilize relations between these two groups.  
2. To enable Jordanian local governance institutions to better address the needs of both Jordanians and Syrians and to manage emerging tensions between Jordanian citizens and the local governance institutions.</narrative>
