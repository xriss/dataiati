   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Program&#x2019;s Overall Objective is to &#x201C;Increase Rural Incomes through Strategic Investments in the Sesame Value Chain&#x201D;. 

 
 The Specific Objective is to &#x201C;Support the Development of Nutritiously Sensitive and Economically Viable Sesame Value Chain in Lahj, Taiz and Abyan Governorates&#x201D; 

 
 RESULTS at Dec 14:
 Project beneficiaries have been identified in Lahj, Abyan, and Taiz governorates in Yemen (1,325 small-scale asset-poor farmers, 50 community private seed producers, and 83 small processors). An additional 94 oil processors were identified in Hodeidah and in Aden governorates. The baseline and gender assessment survey was conducted in March 2014 in selected villages in the programme target areas. 
 Implementation of Result 1 has been the focus this year and significant overall progress was made. For the establishment of private seed production farms, 50 farmers were identified in the three target governorates. These farmers received technical training on seeds production and seed technology and were provided with high quality sesame seeds and ongoing technical support. Under the subcomponent &#x201C;Train agricultural producers on improved agricultural practices&#x201D;, achievements include the development of an environmentally and culturally sensitive training programme for farmers and the recruitment and training of 30 Community Extension Agents (CEAs), who in turn trained 843 small holder farmers on best agronomic practices for improving sesame production and productivity. In order to promote the use of high yielding varieties, an electronic seed voucher system was designed and is ready to be rolled out. All the selected farmers will receive vouchers to purchase adequate quantity of high-quality sesame seeds at subsidized price. Additionally, a total of 25 kilometers of irrigation canals were rehabilitated in 6 villages in Abyan Delta in order to help farmers to access increased amounts of flood water to irrigate their crops. Significant progress was also made towards the achievement of the &#x201C;Disseminating best practices through the use of multiple media sources&#x201D; subcomponent as best practices extension messages were prepared and delivered to rural farmers through printed training materials (leaflets/posters) and radio programmes through Abyan, Lahj and Taiz rural radios. 

 
 Significant progress was also made in all of the planned activities under Result 2 and 3. Major achievements include the identification of oil processors in the target governorates, introduction of the MORE Programme to Microfinance Institutions (MFIs) and the implementation of the sesame value chain and market study.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed program will contribute to EC&#x2019;s Global Objective of &#x201C;Improving resilience of targeted rural and urban communities, and contribute to poverty reduction through sustainable agriculture&#x201D;, and will prioritize &#x201C;Improving availability and access to food for the most vulnerable communities through value chain development and community based approaches&#x201D;. Mercy Corps will work closely with 3000 small, asset poor and unorganized farmers and 500 small processors, and a wide range of other actors including wholesalers, traders, bakers, retailers, and food processors, in the densely populated areas in Taiz, Lahj and Abyan governorates, where almost 70% of the total population and 66% of the food insecure live.</narrative>
