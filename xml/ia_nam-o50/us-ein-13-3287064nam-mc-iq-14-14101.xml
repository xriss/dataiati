   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Mercy Corps will work closely with vulnerable male and female youth from IDP and host communities to support them to access MoE educational programs or to re-enter formal education. MC will do this by providing several critically needed services that will be tailored to the needs of each particular individual. MC provides information on the various MoE programs, and helps guide youth to appropriate programs based on their educational background, age and goals. If female youth want to study but are prevented by their fathers or other relatives, MC refers the case to one of the trained negotiators who will start the negotiation process with the family. MC will provide advanced negotiation training to 6 male and 6 female negotiators to improve their ability to handle complex cases especially surrounding women who face family obstacles to returning to education. MC will also provide additional training to 6 male and 6 female MoE counselors to improve their ability to support youth. MC will also continue to promote systemic reform to encourage the Iraqi government to take concrete measures to make MoE programs more accessible to marginalized children and youth.</narrative>
