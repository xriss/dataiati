  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Characterized by two distinctive morphological features of floodplain in the northern coastal and southern hilly areas, Semarang has a long experience with flooding. Tidal flood has constantly been a natural hazard for some coastal communities. The areas inundated have increased over time. 

This project will better prepare the community and local government in mitigating and adapting to flood impacts so that socio economic losses can be minimized. In addition, BPBD Semarang&#x2019;s city is established to reduce disaster risk and increase the city resilience. This project will produce material and system for flood disaster response and preparedness that can be used by the BPBD of Semarang. This would allow them to disseminate the achievement of Semarang&#x2019;s Early Warning System to other Indonesian cities.

The project will be based on the set of assumptions that there are three important components to increase community&#x2019;s preparedness to flood risk. The first component is the understanding on flood behavior and pattern. As mentioned in the background section, there is a significant change in the city&#x2019;s flood pattern, especially in coastal areas. Understanding the behavior and pattern of the flood will increase the awareness and preparedness of community towards urban flooding. The second component is the availability and accessibility of flood shelters, public spaces used so affected community can continue their daily activities while waiting for normal conditions to be restituted. The third component is related to stakeholders; the community and other parties that may be involved such as local government, non-government organizations, and other groups/institutions.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The main objective of this program is to reduce vulnerability, injury and casualties caused by flood disaster by strengthening community and local government&#x2019;s response to and preparedness through the development of a flood information system, early warning systems, and evacuation strategies, and also the identification of temporary shelter for those most affected (poor and vulnerable).
This project aims to create a resilient and prepared community to disaster and future climate scenario. The result of this project can be potentially used by BPBD for their disaster preparedness program in the city and to be replicated in other cities in Indonesia.</narrative>
