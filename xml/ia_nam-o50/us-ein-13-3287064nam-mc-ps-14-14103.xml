   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Funds will support the operations of Gaza Sky Geeks. Gaza Sky Geeks (GSG)&#x2019;s mission is to spark awareness of startups in Gaza, create a vibrant community that nurtures talented individuals and innovative ideas, and connect top teams to investment and global resources to launch their enterprises.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In 2015 with pooled funds from multiple donors, GSG plans to: 

 
 1) Continue our three-step approach: Build a community with a vibrant space, conduct intense outreach,
 work closely with top talent in the pipeline and invest in and accelerate the best startups.
 2) Systemize our model: We learned a lot during our first round of acceleration, and we know we have more
 to learn &#x2013; we are the first group in the world running a startup accelerator in an environment like ours. As we
 run our second round of acceleration we aim to systemize our approach, building our learning into a
 streamlined, well-designed and effective program.
 3) Empower women leaders: We have had huge success in this area and will maintain a focus on engaging and
 supporting women&#x2019;s leadership and participation in startups. This may be a benefit of working in an
 environment that is so isolated: from the beginning, we can create a startup environment that engages all
 parts of the broader community equally.
 4) Extend outreach to the high school level: The top Gazan University is cutting its computer science
 program in half due to under enrollment. Our top potential startup CEO in our pipeline is a 16-year-old girl.
 We hope to extend outreach to the high school level this year to help meet the current growing needs of
 youth and young women in particular.
 5) Measure, evaluate, learn and adapt: As with all of Mercy Corps&#x2019; programs, Gaza Sky Geeks is committed
 to measurement and learning. This year, following our established monitoring and evaluation plan, we will
 work to assess our progress against outcomes and key indicators and adapt our work as needed for maximum
 impact and scale.
 6) Share our impact: The most scalable aspect of Gaza Sky Geeks is the inspiration and expertise we can
 provide on stimulating innovation in frontier markets. We are at the forefront of a field that is seeing
 increased interest around the world. We will share our learning and experience with the global</narrative>
