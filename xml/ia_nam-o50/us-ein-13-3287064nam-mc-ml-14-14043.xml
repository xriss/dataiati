   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Irtoun programprovides timely relief to the region&#x2019;s most vulnerable households while supporting the recovery of local market systems and rebuilding significant agricultural livelihoods. Immediate food security needs are addressed through food vouchers-for-work (VfW) as well as animal feed vouchers, acknowledging the importance of livestock as a food resource among agro-pastoral households in the region. Through a market-based approach, Irtoun focuses on the recovery of market gardening activities, including the most important cash crops of the region, and on addressing the needs of pastoralists for improved fodder and health care services for their livestock. VfW projects  further support the recovery of livelihoods by helping communities to rehabilitate lands, irrigation schemes and agricultural infrastructure degraded during the conflict. Additionally, Irtoun supports micro-entrepreneurs affected by insecurity through business training and a small cash injection to re-start their businesses. Finally, all Irtoun beneficiaries are encouraged to join community based village savings and loan associations (VSLA), which act as a form of safety net to strengthen recovery efforts, allowing participants to benefit from improved financial management and credit opportunities for community driven economic growth. By intervening and supporting in key areas of agricultural and economic livelihood development, the Irtoun program provides essential ingredients for communities to solidify a peaceful and productive future.</narrative>
