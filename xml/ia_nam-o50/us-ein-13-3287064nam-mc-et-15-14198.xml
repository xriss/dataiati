   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Taking Risk out of Agricultural Trade for Better Relief and Development with Resilience (TRADER)</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="4">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The main objectives of our team are to more deeply understand, quantify, test (Stage 2) and ultimately pilot (Stage 3) scaleable solutions that address the following two questions:
&#x2022; What would it take for livestock traders to pay cash on delivery (COD) to pastoralists?

&#x2022; Would more pastoralists use the livestock market system to manage their risks if they received COD?

Addressing the barriers preventing pastoralists from receiving a better offer for their livestock would take away one of the more substantial impediments to millions of pastoralists engaging the LMS earlier and more often. Such a shift would enable pastoralists to better manage their livelihoods&#x2019; exposure and sensitivity to shocks and stresses and leverage their assets to generate wealth on a continual basis.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Through the Mercy Corps led TRADER project and with funding through the Global Resilience Challenge (USAID/ Rockefeller), we aim to more deeply understand, test and ultimately pilot scaleable, replicable solutions that will build capacities for resilience at multiple levels across the Horn of Africa livestock market system (HOA LMS). These innovative solutions will be informed by the multi-sectoral and multi-tiered partners, processes and policies this project will engage (Stage 2). However, the solutions themselves will be designed and delivered by the private sector with partial risk buy-down from the project (Stage 3). Ultimately, the solutions will enable critical HOA LMS actors &#x2013; namely those engaged in the trade of livestock &#x2013; to mitigate and transfer away specific, catastrophic risks affecting the resilience of millions of pastoralists, their communities and their livelihoods. The project will also identify, benchmark and measure the resilience impacts anticipated to result at the individual, community and systems levels (Stage 2+3).

In particular, this project will seek to address the barriers preventing pastoralists from receiving a better offer for their livestock as this would take away one of the more substantial impediments to millions of pastoralists engaging the LMS earlier and more often. Such a shift would enable pastoralists to better manage their livelihoods&#x2019; exposure and sensitivity to shocks and stresses and leverage their assets to generate wealth on a continual basis. Mercy Corps approach will take the whole system into view, choosing a few, strategic leverage points, prioritizing customization and testing solutions that evidence has proven effective in the context or in addressing similar risks in comparative sectors or contexts.</narrative>
