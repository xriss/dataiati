   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Based on its global experience, Mercy Corps will demonstrate that it is possible to cost-effectively and sustainably empower smallholder farmers to improve their food security and economic situations by developing a suite of financial and farm management products and services offered as commercially-viable, embedded services of financial services providers via mobile channels.  

The unique Agri-Fin Mobile programme approach will &quot;bundle&quot; affordable, fee-for-service, farm and crop management tools and financial services using mobile phones to build financial and technological capacity at agent network and farmer levels to promote mass uptake in a commercially sustainable manner.  This is a model that has wide opportunity for applicability throughout Asia and Africa and can be used as a learning platform across financial products, poverty issues and agribusiness models for smallholder farmers.  Mercy Corps will kick off programming in Indonesia and the Philippines, with fast expansion to Zimbabwe and Uganda, where the enabling environment for full mobile service delivery is well established and Mercy Corps has strong partnerships with financial institutions, mobile network operators and research and extension providers which can support, promote and deliver the suite of agricultural products for millions for farmers. The approach will combine the qualities of best practice agricultural production technologies with tailor-made financial services delivered via mobile channels while offering a scalable model for propagation globally.  Target crops will start with rice, cassava, and horticultural crops but will be expand to others including cotton, maize, cacao, and coffee.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Expected Results
The Agri-Fin Mobile programme will achieve two primary results:
1) 182,000 smallholder farmers will increase farm productivity and food security through improved productivity and financial management practices accessed via mobile based technologies.
2) A commercially viable business model which &#x201C;bundles&#x201D; key services from agriculture industry stakeholders, research and extension institutions, financial service providers, and telecommunications companies, will be developed in four high-profile locations (Philippines, Indonesia, Uganda, Zimbabwe) offering detailed examples for replication and scalability.

Major activities will include the following: 
? Conduct market research in respective countries to understand all aspects of small holder farmer needs and market systems, as well as to evaluate product uptake and issues to drive product development and delivery for small scale farmers.
? Assist financial institutions, insurers and other players to tailor financial services to small holder farmer groups and reduce risks associated with financial services
? Assist agricultural research and extension institutions and services to adapt relevant services to the mobile, bundled with financial services, such as the International Rice Research Institute&#x2019;s (IRRI) SMS and Android-enabled &#x201C;Nutrient Manager&#x201D; solution, which assists farmers with real-time fertilization recommendations to improve productivity. 
? Develop specific interfaces and applications for and between partners to support the effective bundling and rollout of the suite of financial services.
? Work with all partners to crystallize innovative models, while studying the impacts of products and services, and communicating learnings to support cross-fertilization of ideas across partners as well as to the broader public.</narrative>
