  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project aims at alleviating the psychological distresses among women, girls, men and boys who are affected in the context of demonstrations at the perimeter fence of Gaza Strip through providing the following interventions:
1. Provision of specialized mental health services for vulnerable children (boys and girls) and adults/parents (women and men) and affected by the event of demonstrations, and have displayed symptoms of severe psychological distress. By using the existing referral system, those cases will be detected and referred by the case managers and psycho-social support staff working in family centers, Child Protection and MHPSS networks and workers in the health facilities. Other cases will also be self or family-referred. The clinical services will be provided by specialized multi-disciplinary team at GCMHP three community centers located in Gaza city, Deir El Balah and Khanyounis. Therapy plans include psychotherapy, play therapy, medication, individual counseling, family counseling and home visits. 
4. Provision of psychotherapy and counseling sessions to injured persons and their family members affected by the GMR demonstrations including children subjected to trauma. 5 Psychologists will provide psychotherapy and counseling sessions at 5 mobile stations that will be hosted at community-based organizations CBOs covering all Gaza Strip governorates. The cases will be referred to mobile stations by case managers and professionals who are working in the member organizations in Health and Protection clusters as well as CPWG and child protection members. Some cases will also be self or family-referred. The psychologists at mobile stations will provide psychotherapy and counseling sessions to cases with mild and moderate symptoms who do not need medications. Severe cases and other cases in need for medications will be referred to GCMHP community centers by mobile stations. The psychologists will conduct follow-up home visits to injured persons that received therapeutic mental health services from GCMHP and whose cases were closed in 2018.
3. Provision of free telephone counseling service for girls, boys, women and men, who couldn&#x2019;t reach mental health centers due to economic or social barriers. Through this service, the telephone counselors will provide psycho education, individual and family counseling, and also detect and refer children and adults with severe symptoms to GCMHP community centers to receive specialized mental health services including medications if necessary.   
4. In coordination with Health Cluster and Protection Cluster, GCMHP will provide PFA training courses entitled &#x201C;Psychological First Aid (PFA), detection and referral skills, the training will be provided to staff of TSP (Trauma Stabilization Points) and Ambulance service workers, child protection workers and case managers, in order to enhance their skills in the detection of mental disorders and to improve the referral mechanisms.
5. Produce one fact sheet, including gender and age dis-aggregated data, to document trends/patterns of psychological disorders among those assisted.
Moreover, GCMHP will work on strengthening coordination mechanisms with Protection Cluster by updating the 4ws on-line system with Child Protection AoR and MHPSS WG including gender disaggregated information. Also, GCMHP has already a referral mechanism in which all referrals and needed information are followed up and traced. It is worth mentioning that GCMHP is already a part of the SOPs&apos; manual which includes all referral pathways.</narrative>
