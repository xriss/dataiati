   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Urgent support to vulnerable poor farmers in the ARA and poor vulnerable households in the Gaza Strip.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Deterioration in the humanitarian context continues to impact the lives of 2 million people in the Gaza strip due to the eleven-year Israeli blockade and restrictions, the Palestinian internal divide, the USA fund withdrawal and continuing PA salary cuts. According to the PCBS, unemployment in the Gaza Strip is around 46%, of which youth between the age of 15-19 and 20-24 unemployment rates are 64.6% and 69.6% respectively (PCBS Labor Force Survey, Q1, 2019). On the other hand, OCHA oPt stated in the Monthly Humanitarian Bulletin, May 2018, that poverty among Gaza citizens is estimated to 53% despite humanitarian assistance. Moreover, the WFP stated in the oPt country briefing on August 2019, that 68.5% suffer from food insecurity, which represents other core drivers of humanitarian need. The socioeconomic situation in Gaza threatens to increase in humanitarian needs in the future. 
The project is designed to target two vulnerable target groups under the Humanitarian fund, the (1) vulnerable poor households laying under Social Safety Nets (SSN), across the five governorates, (2) and the vulnerable poor farmers not affected by the GMR demonstrations in ARA. The project will provide the first category with in-kind food packages while providing the later with agricultural inputs. 
Activities concerning the first category come as a continuation of PARC&#x2019;s efforts to support poor families through the &#x201C;Urgent support of in-kind food assistance to the affected poor households in the ARA - Gaza Strip&#x201D;, which was funded through the Humanitarian Pooled Fund. A new list of 200 poor and vulnerable families will be provided with food parcels, both fresh and canned food the contents of the fresh food parcels will include tomatoes, cucumber, eggplant, potatoes, green pepper, zucchini, onion, mallow, cabbage, lemon, cauliflower, and okra. It should be noted that fresh food items will be included in the parcels based on prices, availability and agricultural seasons. Additionally, the canned food will include lentil (whole and peeled), tomato sauce, tahini (sesame paste), corn oil, thyme, rice, tea, pasta, white kidney beans, canned meat, cheese, mashed wheat, chickpeas, and sugar. Those items were chosen due to the nutrition value it has, along with PARC&apos;s prior experience and BNF feedback from the most recent project. The food parcels will be distributed on 10 rounds on the span of 7 months so the poor HHs can prepare various nutritious meals that will positively affect the household members, especially kids and the elderly, both physically and mentally. 
Concerning the second component, a scoping was conducted in May 2019, it was found that a sample of 90 farmers located inside the ARA (1000 meters from the 1950 armistice line) and in dire need for agricultural inputs to cultivate their farms and increase their resilience. Based on the scoping, most of the farmers demanded the provision of irrigation networks and low farming tunnels to enhance the productivity of their farms and cultivate it all-year-round. Moreover, the farmers stated that the deteriorating socioeconomic situation for ARA farmers hindered them from purchasing numbers of essential agricultural inputs. Therefore, PARC is planning to target 200 poor vulnerable farmers, through a CFA in targeted localities, will be provided with low agricultural tunnels and irrigation networks, taking into consideration providing inputs for 1 dunum/BNF. The participation of poor vulnerable rural women will be prioritized and encourage assuming compliance with the project selection criteria. Farmers will be provided with specific extension services to guarantee effective and profitable agricultural seasons. low farming tunnels will encourage farmers to continue farming activities and gain income. this technique is effective to use in the ARA since farmers are only able to cultivate short seasonal crops and vegetables. Low farming tunnels are light and easy to work with, store and replaced.</narrative>
