   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Emergency Shelter response for the Most Vulnerable Households in Area C of the Jordan Valley</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed emergency response aims to provide vulnerable Palestinian Households , mainly herding and Bedouin communities in Area C of the Jordan Valley, with timely and adequate shelter and NFI solutions through a comprehensive integrated approach that supports building resilience, reinforcing protection, reducing seasonal amp forced displacement, and supporting the steadfastness of the most poor and vulnerable households at risk of displacement or exposed to harsh weather and protection concerns. Further the response will ensure equal access to housing by taking into consideration specific needs based on gender, age and disability. 
The intervention addresses immediate needs, as well as the underlying conditions that give rise to those needs through a multi- pronged approach including (i) Provision of tailored capacity building to empower affected people and increase their capacity to cope with sudden and protracted shocks. Community-based protection committees (CBPCs) will be established and trained to increase accountability, information dissemination and transparency, in particular to report/refer protection concerns within the community through adequate channels. Training will include disaster risk preparedness, SPHERE standards, monitoring of the intervention, protection mainstreaming and safe referral mechanisms of protection cases.. (ii-a) Prioritized rehabilitation of 60 shelters  with full technical support and oversight for Persons with disabilities and widowed, separated or abandoned female headed households through MA&#x2019;ANs local technical team. (ii-ba) provision of durable climate protection shelter materials and technical rehabilitation support and oversight to the 65 of most vulnerable households whom are exposed to harsh weather or protection concerns or at risk of displacement.  (iii)Provision of shelter/NFIs stocks for 100 HHs under risk of displacement and/ or at risk of exposure to natural or manmade hazards or settler violence and increase the capacity to respond to natural and manmade hazards in a timely, efficient and effective manner.
The intervention is built on MA&#x2019;AN and ACTEDs Community Protection and emergency response approaches, amp previous shelter rehabilitation experience in the area, placing emphasis on the themes of (1) Engagement at the community level with a focus on community ownership and responsiveness (2) Community Driven Resilience focusing on Protection mechanisms for vulnerable groups in communities.  
Both MA&apos;AN and ACTED have extensive prior experience working in the target area, and a strong understanding of the current legal situation for construction in Area C, thus employing low-profile strategies such as: Rehabilitating structures from the inside of shacks and tents, Carrying out work at night, Staggering assistance over a prolonged period of time, coordinating with households and key community members to stay updated with IOF activity in the area,etc
To ensure effectiveness of intervention, targeted communities and neighborhoods have been coordinated with the shelter cluster, other partner organizations and actors working in the area to avoid overlap of assistance and ensure best reach in emergencies. Moreover, As the communities are subject to ongoing threats, and harassment, Project Management will also supervise the promotion and public announcement of the project among the inhabitants of the targeted communities to ensure an update of priority households in the database at the project start. Women in these communities will play an integral part in the selection of beneficiaries as part of the established CBPC , other members include village council heads and representatives, Mokhtar(village head), and community members. Project Management unit will ensure that CBPCs and selected households are well informed about their rights, obligations and potential risks involved regarding housing, land and property issues and provide their consent to all proposed project activities</narrative>
