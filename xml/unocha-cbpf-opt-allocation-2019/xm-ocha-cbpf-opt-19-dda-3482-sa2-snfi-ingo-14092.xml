   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Upgrading of substandard shelters and provision of protective materials to vulnerable Bedouin and herding households located in Area C in the Northern governorates of the West Bank</narrative>

  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project will contribute to the HRP strategic objectives 2 and 3, the HPF allocation strategy objective 2 and the Shelter cluster strategic objective 2. It will do so by improving the living conditions and increase the protection of acutely vulnerable Bedouin and herding households located in Area C in the North of the West Bank through upgrading substandard shelters and the provision of protective materials/tools (general objective). 

The project is based on several needs assessment conducted by PUI in 2018 and 2019 that identified the most pressing shelter needs of vulnerable households living in substandard houses in the targeted communities by this project (see needs assessment section). The communities identified are herding and Bedouin communities mostly living in shacks and tents. The types of shelter and their specific setting increase household&#x2019;s exposure to potential consequences of adverse weather conditions such as: flooding, winter storms, extreme heat in the summer as well as access to basic services and geographical isolation. Furthermore, isolated vulnerable households are more likely to be attacked by settlers and most often in times where only a few people are around, in many cases only lonely women, elderly people and children. At the same time, demolition procedures is a common practice by IDCL for herding and Bedouin communities which adds another burden of an ongoing vulnerability. In order to respond to the identified needs and to contribute to the HRP, HPF and cluster objectives of this second allocation, PUI and its partner will provide two type of assistance.

First, the project will upgrade 60 substandard shelters in order to reduce the exposure of vulnerable households to man-made and natural disasters, harsh weather conditions, risk of water borne diseases and health complications, by enabling them to live with adequate standards which respect their dignity and wellbeing. The scope of the upgrading will have a maximum value of 3500 USD per household. We will use a mixed approach of cash and material supply, when appropriate. 

Second, the project will provide protective materials and tools to 60 households who are most at risk of settler violence and/or demolition. The selection of protection material and tools will be tailored to the needs of each family, with a maximum value of 500 USD per household. This may include fencing, first aid kit, fire extinguishers etc.

Both activities will be implemented in 12 communities living in Area C: Tell al Khashaba, Khirbet Tana, Khirbet al Marajim, Yanun, Ein Shibli, Arab al Ka&apos;abneh, Al Ja&apos;waneh in Nablus governorate and Umm al Hamam, Jbour and &apos;Anani, Arab Al Khouli/Wadi Kana, Muhaajir, and Iraq al Sakhra in Salift governorate.

PUI will partner with PARC the activities will be divided geographically according to the knowledge of and experience with the communities by each partner. PARC has previous experience in similar actions including the rehabilitation of inadequate shelters in the Jordan Valley in herding and farming communities. PUI will build on its extensive experience working with communities through a &#x201C;Community Protection Approach&#x201D; (CPA) to identify vulnerabilities and capacities, and providing emergency responses and protective measures to vulnerable families affected by settler violence, demolitions and/or military operations. Therefore, this project complements the work done by PUI under the West Bank Protection Consortium (WBPC), which include providing emergency response to victims of settler violence and protective measures at community level. The planned Action will avoid any duplication of activity by providing protective assets at household level only. PUI also used the findings of the CPA done under the Consortium to identify some of the communities targeted by this project. 

PUI will coordinate its intervention with key actors working under the Shelter Cluster and within the area of in</narrative>
