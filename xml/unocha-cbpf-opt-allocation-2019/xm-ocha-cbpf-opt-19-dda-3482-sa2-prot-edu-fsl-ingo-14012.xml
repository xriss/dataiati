   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Provision of integrated multi-sectoral protection services to vulnerable children and their families in the Gaza Strip</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The ever-deepening crises resulting from the ongoing blockade, occupation, and political lift have led to a progressive deterioration in the political, social and security conditions of the Gaza Strip. If the current trends are not reversed, Gaza could soon become unfit for humans to live in. Currently, the unemployment rate in the Gaza Strip is 52%, more than half of Gaza&apos;s population live in poverty, and 68% of households are experiencing severe or moderate levels of food insecurity. Currently, about 3,000 female headed households out of 10,800 poor and food insecure households in the waiting list of the Social Safety Net of the MoSD  are in dire need for food and cash assistance to cover their daily food basic needs. To cope with the high level of poverty, such families reduce the quantity of consumed food and consume food of less quality (OCHA, 2019: FFS). The deteriorating political and socio-economic conditions in Gaza have negative consequences on children&#x2019;s rights and ability to access education, protection services, and access sufficient food. The negative consequences include an increase in child labour rates, higher rates of GBV against children, higher rates of school dropout, child marriage, high prevalence of food insecurity, and increase in the number of children participating in GMR (OCHA, 2019 UNCEF 2018) as of today, the number of children injured since March 2018 has reached 7500. With such a context, it is undoubtedly that the need for multisectoral interventions: protection, education, and food security is highly needed.  This project will meet the protection needs of 4294 vulnerable children and in particular of the following categories: children injured during GMR out of school children and those at high risk of drop out children engaged in child labour, and those being food insecure, through ensuring their access to timely and quality integrated multisectoral services. Main activities under the Protection Cluster will include (1) provision of individual case management to children who have child protection concerns such as being injured during GMR, child labourers, and GBV survivors , (2) provision of structured and non-structured PSS to children affected by conflict or who have protection concerns, (3) referral to specialized services, and (4) conducting joint-child parent activities for children who have protection concerns. The main activities under the Education Cluster will include: (1) re-integration of out of school children in the official education and vocational education, (2) provision of PSS to school dropout children, (3) provision of school stationery, uniforms, and transportation to children who have accessibility and affordability issues, (4) provision of catch up classes to out of school children, and (5) conducting training sessions to school staff focusing on different issues such as dealing with children with low academic achievement and how to discipline a child for misbehaving at school. The main activities under the Food Security Sector are: (1) provision of direct access to food to 40 households for 6 months through paper food vouchers, and (2) provision of cash-based support to 40 households-224 persons. The cash-based support will be conditional to reintegrating out of school children into schools or vocational training centers and not to engage children in any form of child labour. The cash-based support will be restricted to establish a micro project. Beneficiaries will be encouraged to select projects that have short-life cycles such as mini-markets in order to quickly generate income. At least 10 female-headed households will be targeted. The project interventions will be carried out by Tdh and 4 partners, along with Islamic Relief-UK that will provide technical support on the food security component. Tdh will liaise with MoSD, Protection and Education Clusters amp FSS to provide inclusive quality protection services.</narrative>
