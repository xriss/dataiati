   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Emergency response to improve access to safe, sufficient and affordable water for the vulnerable population in area C, West Bank</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project will &#x200E;aim to make available adequate and &#x200E;safe drinking water for 1,145 families (5,500 individuals) of &#x200E;the targeted communities and families living in Area &#x201C;C&#x201D; for household &#x200E;purposes. Southern parts of Hebron Governorate, mainly southeast Yatta, are facing severe water stress due &#x200E;to geopolitical factors. With the majority of its land classified as Area C, residents of the southern part of Hebron Governorate face difficult &#x200E;living conditions including limited access to water resources. Based on the results of the Population, Housing and &#x200E;Establishments Census 2017 conducted by PCBS, approximately, 15.5% of Hebron governorate drinking water is unsafe and unimproved. &#x200E;Roughly, 20% of families are unserved and not connected to public water networks.
PARC conducted a thorough needs assessment covering the vulnerable communities in Areas C. Field visits, interviews and &#x200E;questionnaires with local councils, municipalities, potential beneficiaries and community based &#x200E;organizations were conducted. The assessment was completed in coordination with the PWA, private water providers and other water &#x200E;related parties. The assessment revealed a high need of the communities in reducing distance to access to safe water and better access &#x200E;to basic water services in order to increase the community resilience and to reduce their probability to be forcible displaced. These needs &#x200E;are even more urgent for women and children, who are the most affected by water related issues within the household. Selection of &#x200E;targeted communities, therefore, took into consideration of people who are highly affected by water access (under-served and/or un-&#x200E;served communities) and affected by forcible transfer. They are also those more severely affected by the impact of drought events, the &#x200E;increase of water costs during the dry period and the lack of access to water.&#x200E;
In addition, PARC made a review of Area C&apos;s strategic Framework 2018 &#x2013; 2019 and the water master plan for Area C &#x200E;developed by PWA, GVC and AAH. The review informed the suggested activities for the project to be in line with the strategy&apos;s priorities, &#x200E;which discuss the inclusion of the so-called &apos;Area C&apos; in sustainable development.
The proposed activities will target vulnerable communities lacking sufficient access to water, and are dependent on purchasing trucked water to meet their water needs, through the construction/rehabilitation of water pipes. The targeted areas were identified as a priority for the 2nd standard allocation of 2019 HPF. 

Around 5310 M.L of water pipes will be constructed/rehabilitated in (Shkara, Biet Amra and Jourt Al-Jamal) communities in south of Yatta district , the implementation of the new pipelines will be in close coordination with the Palestinian Water authority (PWA),related local bodies and stakeholders.in specific: 
Shkara community: install an internal water network and link up the community with main source of water. The activity is to provide and install 300 M diameter 3 inch, 550 M diameter 2 inch and 600 M diameter 1 inch. 
Jourt Al-Jamal: install an internal water network and link up the community with main source of water. The activity is to provide and install 1650 M 4 inch, 600 M diameter 3 inch, 450 M diameter 2 inch and 500 M diameter 1 inch.
Biet Amra: link up the with main source of water, as the internal water network is available, the activity is to install 600 M diameter 6 inch only.</narrative>
