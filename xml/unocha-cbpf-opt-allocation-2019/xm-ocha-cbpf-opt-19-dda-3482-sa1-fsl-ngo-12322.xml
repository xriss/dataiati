   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Enhance the resilience and food security of vulnerable farmers in area c (North-West  Jerusalem and Ramallah   through land and Road rehabilitation.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The critical situation that people are living under in West Bank including area C, and the inability of the Palestinian Authority to work in the mentioned location has put the Palestinian people under difficult life situation due to their lack of adequate standards of living. Continues cracking down by Israeli occupation practices against Palestinian people living in Jerusalem such as preventing people from accessing their lands through closing check points, destroying agricultural lands and uprooting planted trees, destroying agricultural roads, and confiscation of lands. All these aggression and violation deteriorate life in Jerusalem and the surrounded villages. 
The project aims at enhancing the resilience of 160 vulnerable families (790 capita) including 222 women, 225 men, 167 girls and 176 boys through improving the food security of vulnerable farmers through land rehabilitation in 9 locations (8-at Jerusalem and one- Ramallah)  governorates in area C. 
The project activities will also respond to the different humanitarian needs of the most vulnerable farmers (women and men), to improve their living conditions by increasing the productivity of their agriculture lands. Women HH will be the first priority when targeting the families, because they work a lot in agriculture, and second, they help to improve the living conditions of their families, taking into consideration that more than half of the population in Jerusalem and Ramallah are females. 
The main activities of the project will focus on:
Activity 1: Rehabilitation of 400 Dunums of agricultural land ( 8 communities in North &#x2013;West Jerusalem  ). This Intervention will benefit 100 families. Different sub activities will be implemented for each beneficiary depending on the needs: Light machinery work for leveling and rock removal, Rehabilitation of the stony retaining walls to protect from  soil  degradation and to increase  water retention capacity,  Fencing to protect them from wild animals and livestock animals. PARC will provide farmers with Seedlings through its  annual campaign.
Activity 2: Rehabilitation of 2Km in Ramallah  Al-Mughayyir . This intervention will protect and improve accessibility and utilization of the served agricultural lands. Agricultural Roads rehabilitation includes several sub activities, including: machinery work , basecours,  culvert, and construction of stony retaining walls 
Once the project is approved, there will be inception  phase where a series of actions will be done. Firstly, PARC will announce the project to the community and will establish local committee (one committee per location -9). These committees will consist from representative from village/municipality council CBOs/cooperatives, and related ministries (MoA) . Each of them will choose their own representatives with a fair representation of women and men inside these committees. These Committees will participate and steer the project in order to ensure: Formalize the participation of representatives of the Local Council and local community organizations &#x2013;social accountability and strengthening relations with the community and the target population. Secondly, announcement and selection of end beneficiaries, where open competition for men and women based on vulnerability criteria (close to settlement, wall, and subjected to violation by settlers, poor families...etc)  approved by the committees.  Thirdly, tendering and contracting, where PARC and the local committees will ensure the best value of money for different services and quality.  Fourth, complaint mechanism (HAP) will be elaborated from day number one where rights holder (beneficiaries)   and duty bearers (PARC and Local Committee) will agree on conflict resolution approach and ensuring access to information, experience exchange and dissemination. Fifth, handing over and exit strategy, PARC, MoA and the local committees will design an exit strategy per location and included in the final report.</narrative>
