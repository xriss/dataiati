  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The idea of the project came as a response to the deteriorated humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip especially in the health sector, in connection with the continuation of the Great Return of Marches event. The project will target the trauma cases from the women, men, girls, boys, elderly and people with disabilities, who are at high risk of morbidity and mortality. This intervention will support UHWC to expand the provision of emergency health services to trauma cases through the following trauma pathway that includes: (i) providing pre-TSP first aid services and contributing to the provision of emergency services at the TSP, (ii) transportation of patients from TSPs to Al Awda Hospital which is located in the Northern area of Gaza Strip, (iii) Provision of hospital care including emergency services, surgical operations and hospitalization, (iv) post-injury wound care such as dressing will be provided to trauma cases either in the hospital or at home to cases who are facing difficulties to access the hospital, (v) providing psychological support. 
From 30/3/2018 to 8/3/2019, Al-Awda Hospital provided emergency services at the emergency dept. to 1337 trauma cases (186 out of them underwent surgical operations). This intervention will support the treatment of 2,000 trauma cases (5 % female and 17% children) during 2019, in addition to 3000 trauma cases will receive first aid emergency services in the field, and the project will enable Al-Awda Hospital to perform new trauma health services that weren&#x2019;t previously provided, and this includes conducting vascular surgical operations to trauma cases, by contracting a consultant specialized in vascular surgery. These cases were previously referred to MoH hospitals, which are already overloaded. Since 30/3/2018, 120 vascular injured has been referred by Al Awda Hospital to MoH Hospitals. Here lies the importance of this project that it will reduce the number of cases referred to the MoH through conducting 200 vascular operations to trauma cases at Al Awda Hospital. 
In order to provide comprehensive health services, psychological support will also be provided to 800 injuries and their families inside the hospital or at their houses. 
All the project cases will be documented and desegregated by gender and age through providing the emergency dept. with HIS system, and information will be shared with MoH and the Health Cluster. 
Moreover, the project will upgrade the emergency and ambulance communication system due to the weakness of the existing system, especially in areas closed to the border.
In order to ensure the continuation of the provision of the lifesaving health services to the trauma cases through Al Awda Hospital essential lists of medication, medical disposable, lab reagents in addition to fuel should be guaranteed. 
All the above mentioned services will be provided to the affected people in a safety and dignity manner, and without any discrimination. 
Protection mainstreaming will be taken into account, as the services will be available to all beneficiaries who needs them, trauma services will be provided totally free of charge. Female and pediatric staff will be available as a response to gender and age needs, privacy and confidentiality will be respected. 
In order to better deal with causalities, 20 of UHWC health workers and volunteers will receive training in pre-TSP first Aid (30% female) as well as other 10 health workers will received training in management of emergency cases, lifesaving interventions and psychological first aid (60% female). 
Community engagement and accountability will be ensured through active participation of the affected population in all the project stages through focus groups, sharing information, measuring patients&#x2019; satisfaction and receiving feedback through accountability sessions.</narrative>
