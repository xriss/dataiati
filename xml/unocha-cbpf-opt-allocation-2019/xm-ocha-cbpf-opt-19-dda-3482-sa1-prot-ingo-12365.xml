   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Responding to the Needs of Vulnerable Children in the Gaza Strip through Integrated Child Protection Services</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">2020 is less than a year away, the year in which United Nations warned Gaza would become &#x201C;unliveable&#x201D;, pointing to ever-deepening crises resulting from the blockade. Gaza&apos;s continued isolation has devastated its economy, impoverished its population and trapped them into poverty and vulnerabilities. The prolonged strain and economic isolation of the Gaza Strip have pushed vulnerable families deeper into poverty. Vulnerable families have resorted to different negative coping mechanisms to deal with the high level of poverty and vulnerabilities. Child labour, withdrawal from schools, and engaging children in risky occupations were amongst the commonly used distress mechanisms to alleviate poverty (Tdh 2019). According to a study conducted by Tdh in 2018, psychosocial distress, violence against children, and injuries and safety are common child protection concerns in the Gaza Strip. GBV is also a common across the Gaza Strip, mainly against girls and women. Furthermore, Since March 2018, Gaza has been witnessing a progressive deterioration of the political, social and security environments as result of the Great March of Return (GMR) Demonstrations. The GMR Demonstrations have further compound to already fragile situation of the impoverished families making them unable to provide their children with basic life necessities. Up to March 14, a total of 41 children were killed by Israeli forces since the beginning of GMR Demonstrations, along with 11 children who were killed in other circumstances. Along with a total of 5854 injuries among boys and 495 among girls (OCHA 2019). With such context, it is undoubtedly that the need for provision of responsive and remedial protection responses for affected children and their families, such as case management and PSS are highly demanded. This Action is a response to such need. The overall objective of this Project is to meet the protection needs of 5040 children who have protection concerns such as being injured during GMR Demonstrations, being dropped out of school, and being engaged in child labour, through increasing their access to timely and quality integrated protection responses that are tailored according to their needs and their best interest.  Under this Action, Tdh and its partners will provide integrated child protection services to vulnerable children who have protection concerns, including working children, school dropped out, injured children, and survivors of GBV. In total, the project will target 11340 beneficiaries, including 3180 men and 3120 women, 2370 girls and 2670 boys. The proposed responsive activities include child protection case management to 350 children, to children who have protection concerns, and to injured children, provision of structured and non-structured psychosocial support to 2150 children and their families. While, remedial protection activities included, but not limited to awareness raising for persons at risk to GBV and distribution of dignity kits to GBV survivors. Project interventions are a continuation on the ongoing project funded by oPt Humanitarian Fund, however, under the Action, the scope of activities has expanded to geographically cover the entire Strip. The project interventions will be carried out by Tdh and its 4 partner organizations, namely Beit-Lahiya Development Association, Bayt Al Mustaqbal Society, Near East Council of Churches, and Al Tawasol Forum Society. Tdh and its partners will guarantee inclusive access to child protection services through implementing different measures including :(1). Conducting outreach programmes in remote and vulnerable areas, including ARA, (2). Coordinating with others child protection service providers, including UNICEF-funded family centers, and (3). Coordinating with organizations that target disabled children such as Jabalia Rehabilitation Society. Tdh will liaise with the Ministry of Social Development and Protection Cluster Members to provide needed protection services.</narrative>
