   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Emergency Response to Promote Access to Adequate Sanitation, Safe Water and Best Knowledge on Hygiene Practices</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project will provide adequate safe water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) facilities and services to 5,348 vulnerable Palestinians in the West Bank living in Abdullah Younis and Barta&#x2019;a villages, thereby reducing the vulnerability of these two communities located in Area C and behind the Wall who do not have access to adequate WASH services. Even these two localities appear as one community on the map, but they are two localities with two different village councils 
This project is designed to provide comprehensive intervention to improve the quality and access of WASH services in the targeted communities. This will be done through the construction of water transmission and distribution of water lines to replace the old and worn-out plastic lines that carry only half the water needed to the households. So that, more than 50% of the population is without a sufficient quantity of water, and the worn-out lines supply water that is polluted with microbes. This project will also solve the issue of pollution of the village spring by establishing a chlorination system. This spring is considered the second source of water for the villages, but the Israeli settlers intentionally throw their wastewater into the springs, which adversely affects the lives of the people. Moreover, this intervention will minimize the cost of water for families who are overburdened and forced to buy water at the very high cost of 50 NIS per cup during the summer. It will also minimize the efforts of women and girls who are forced to fetch water and carry buckets of it on their heads. In short, this project will ensure equitable, affordable, and sustainable access to safe and sufficient WASH services with dignity for the most vulnerable Palestinians in the West Bank. 
Since this project is comprehensive, it gives special attention to hygiene education and institutional WASH facilities in schools. This project will adopt a participatory approach by giving school students important roles in disseminating hygiene messages and by providing a training of trainer course (TOT) to 100 students from five schools (20 students from each school). The students who receive the training will be responsible for spreading hygiene knowledge to their other 640 school mates. The trained students will be accompanied by the distribution of hygiene kits to all school students to maintain and reinforce the knowledge they gained. The project also pays special attention to children&#x2019;s public health by rehabilitating the drinking facilities in the five schools. To that end, the project will ensure comprehensive intervention in schools that will protect children&#x2019;s health and provide them with safe water and adequate sanitation. 
At the community level, this project will promote hygiene education through the establishment of a community-based hygiene hub. The hub will consist of 40 individuals (20 from each village, 10 of which will be female) who will be responsible for spreading hygiene messages to their communities. Like the students, they will receive a training of trainers course on hygiene practices and on taking on the role of community leaders to create transformative change on hygiene practices in their own communities. In cooperation with this community hub, the project will distribute 50 hygiene kits to the poorest households in the two villages to ensure better access to hygiene. 
This project will be implemented by both the Union of Agricultural Work Committees (UAWC) as the lead applicant, in partnership with the Applied Research Institute, Jerusalem (Arij), and in coordination with the local village councils, local municipality, and Agriculture Directorate and Ministry of Agriculture, to reap the benefits of their input and experience in the field. 
This project is considered an urgent humanitarian project and part of the UAWC&#x2019;s Humanitarian Response Plan, (HRP) approved by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) as urgent</narrative>
