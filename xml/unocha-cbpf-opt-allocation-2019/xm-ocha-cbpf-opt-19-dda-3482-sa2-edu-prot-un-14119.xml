   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Back to school: reintegration into the education system of Palestine refugee children through the provision of tailored support across the Gaza Strip</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The continued worsening of the humanitarian situation in Gaza taking the shape of increased poverty levels and increased levels of violence whether conflict or GMR related, is severely affecting child well-being. As part of UNRWA&#x2019;s Inclusive Education policy, UNRWA MHPSS Framework, ongoing Relief and Social Services (RSS) reform and Child Protection Framework, and as indicated in the published UNRWA Emergency Appeal 2019 for oPt where UNRWA identified Priority 2 focus on maintaining the access of Palestine refugees to critical services and assistance, such as education and protect them from the most severe impacts of hostilities and violence, UNRWA has identified an increasing need to assist vulnerable children affected by protection threats out of school children be integrated in UNRWA schools. Out of school children are exposed to danger of several threats, lack of protection and violation of their rights under international human rights law. This project aims to provide tailored and direct support to out of school Palestine Refugee Children to ensure that they are well-equipped and sustainably reintegrated into the UNRWA education system. 
The project will support the reintegration of Palestine refugee children into UNRWA schools. The project will target out of school children who are affected by specific protection challenges such as child labour, disabilities or impairments, injuries sustained during GMR or other conflict-related incidents. Targeted children will be receiving tailored support to their needs such as psycho-social support (PSS) and/or individual case management, as well as tailored material assistance depending on their needs (assistive devices, recovery classes, vocational training, transportation fees, etc.) In addition to the child-centred approach, the project builds around a family approach, where the whole family, including siblings, will benefit from its result. Previous projects by UNRWA targeting different categories of out of school and at-risk children such as child labour have shown that this tailored approach combining a focus on child and the whole family produces the most sustainable results with a high success rate. 
As the largest service provider in Gaza, UNRWA is particularly well-placed to achieve the education cluster objective #1 to &#x201C;increase equitable and safe access to inclusive, quality educational services for vulnerable children&#x201D;. This project was designed based on consultations with UNRWA school principals and social workers performing home visits and based on the experience developed by previously implemented projects in 2017/18 targeting children out of school as a result of child labour and one small ongoing initiative targeting GMR affected UNRWA students. 
The number of identified direct beneficiaries are at least 300 Out of School refugee children, 100 of them girls, including specifically about 50 UNRWA students affected by GMR and 50 children with disabilities and/or chronical diseases.</narrative>
