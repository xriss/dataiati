&quot;Improve Classroom Learning Environment for Reading

A classroom learning environment led by a strong, nurturing teacher, with appropriate learning and teaching materials readily available, is crucial to improving reading outcomes among children. PRP is leveraging its global and regional expertise in early grade reading to strengthen opportunities for 1,300,000 grades 1 and 2 children to better navigate the complex process for learning to read. Applying an evidence-based and evidence-generating approach to teaching reading, PRP is:

Offering training and continuous support to primary school teachers to enable them to teach and assess component skills of reading.
Developing and providing teacher and student learning material specially designed to focus on reading.
Working with the Higher Education Commission (HEC) and provincial/regional teacher training institutes (TTIs) to enrich current ADE and B.Ed. (Hons.) curricula with reading specific courses.

Improve Policies &amp;amp; Systems for Reading

Teachers alone cannot be responsible for meeting national goals and expectations for improving reading skills among children. Improving policies and systems at the provincial and district levels to better enable teachers and students to succeed are also critical to reading achievement outcomes. PRP is working at multiple levels within the education sector to address key policy issues which parallel and support PRP&#x2019;s in-service intervention priorities, including the development of a reading improvement strategy that will encompass standards and benchmarks, assessment protocol and systems, and reading curricular reform. PRP is also advocating, alongside other partners, for the establishment of a coherent CPD policy to support the motivation and professional growth of the teacher workforce. By focusing PRP policy work in two broad areas &#x2013; what to teach and how it is taught (by whom) &#x2013; PRP is guiding provinces through the planning of reading policy reform in a manner that addresses both the content and the delivery mechanism. When these sides converge, student learning outcomes are likely to improve; without policy support to both sides, reform efforts are likely to stall.

Community-Based Support for Reading

USAID-funded Pakistan Reading Project has divided the Community-Based Support for Reading program under three main areas which are as below:

1. Small Grants Program
1a. Complementary Reading Project (CRP) Grants
1b. Community Managed Reading (CMR) Grants
2. Mobile Bus Library (MBL) Program
