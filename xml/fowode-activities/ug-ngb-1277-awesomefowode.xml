   <narrative xml:lang="EN">A 5-year advocacy programme to support women&#x2019;s movements in Ethiopia, Kenya and Uganda to be strengthened, less fragmented and more representative of diverse groups of women, including women with disabilities. These stronger women&#x2019;s movements will contribute to strong women leaders at all levels, and the prevention and elimination of sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV) against women and girls.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">20 media campaigns inclusive of women&apos;s voices (16 Days, and other moments and media, petitions). The campaigns are characterised by women setting the agenda, influencing the debate, and/or movement building, shining a light on the SGBV and women&apos;s leadership stories for visibility and increased awareness.

These will run across national and subnational levels for a wider audience but change will be measured at subnational level.

When we say that we want to amplify the voices of &#x2018;diverse women&#x2019; we refer to the women that Womankind and partners are working with, including (and recognising that many women involved cross intersections of these groups) women with disabilities, internally displaced women, young women, aspiring and newly elected women leaders, women in rural areas, women industrial workers, women affected by conflict, survivors of SGBV, community leaders (not necessarily elected or aspirants but functioning in different spaces), informal workers (working on the fringes of the industrial zones and reached through the programme in Ethiopia for example), and WHRDs (includes women working within partner organisations).</narrative>

      <narrative xml:lang="EN">Women leaders generate issues and table them in meetings, district councils and other forums for discussion. A major challenge is the lack of adequate statistics and information to present such issues in a more compelling manner to trigger policy actions by the local leaders. 

Much as FOWODE had had interventions in these two districts, efforts were geared towards gender responsive service delivery through monitoring of public service points. This approach is new and therefore baseline is 0</narrative>
