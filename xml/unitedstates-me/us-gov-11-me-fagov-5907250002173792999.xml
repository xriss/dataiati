    <narrative xml:lang="EN">U.S.~assistance to Montenegro aims to advance the goal of fully integrating Montenegro into Euro-Atlantic institutions. Since its independence in 2006, Montenegro has made rapid progress toward North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and European Union (EU) membership and serves as a positive example in a region that still struggles with stalled reform, ethnic intolerance, and political and economic inertia. In December 2015, NATO Allies announced their decision to issue Montenegro an invitation to join NATO. While a newly operational independent Special Prosecutor&apos;s Office has begun to make strides, Montenegro&apos;s justice sector and democratic institutions are not yet sufficiently strong to meet EU standards, as the European Commission noted again in its November 2015 Progress Report. U.S.~assistance can play a critical catalytic role in achieving progress toward these standards. In FY~2016 and FY~2017, the United~States will continue to focus on its core remaining development assistance objectives in Montenegro: reforming the country&apos;s justice and security sectors, strengthening the rule of law, and reducing Montenegro&apos;s vulnerability to corruption, organized crime, and external pressure.In July 2013, the Government of Montenegro adopted a revised Strategic Defense Review (SDR) to improve the organizational structure of the Ministry of Defense and armed forces. The SDR also better defined Montenegro&apos;s national defense priorities, which include: defense of Montenegro through active cooperation with allies and partners; contributions to peacekeeping missions in the region and the world; and support to civilian institutions during emergency situations. Implementing its NATO accession plan is now the next step in Montenegro&apos;s military transformation, which requires additional progress toward the level of a fully-integrated member of the Alliance. U.S.~military assistance and training play a critical role in Montenegro and its Armed Forces realizing the vision outlined in the 2013 SDR, and in achieving the status of full NATO membership. U.S. assistance will build resilience and reduce vulnerability to Russian aggression, increase European integration, and provide continued support for enduring programs.</narrative>
