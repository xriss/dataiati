   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In Ethiopia, EWLA will target individuals as well as groups of disadvantaged or poor women and girls 
of all ages ranging from secondary school to university, government officials (both men and women), 
members of the parliament (both men and women), and women politicians. These target individuals 
and groups will be approached at the national, regional and community levels urban and rural areas 
as per EWLA&#x2019;s structure. These stakeholders will be approached based on EWLA&#x2019;s record of work 
and previous and ongoing assessments. Stakeholders also may lack awareness on gender equality, 
have negligence on promoting and realisation of women rights and be constrained by budgetary 
needs.</narrative>

The consortium works in the following countries: Somalia, Uganda, Sudan, South Sudan, and Ethiopia.

The project aims at strengthening women&#x2019;s leadership and participation in (political) decision-making and strengthening women&#x2019;s economic empowerment and improving the economic climate for women&apos;s participation. The project is targeted at women&apos;s rights activists and organizations. Project strategies include capacity building for effective advocacy, linking women&apos;s rights activists and organizations for a common agenda and action, and improving their access to advocacy platforms are among the project&apos;s tactics.</narrative>
