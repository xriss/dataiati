  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The TAF2+ programme provides a demand-led call down facility that provides highly technical trade and investment services to increase the technical skills and coordination of trade and investment ministries in developing countries. TAF2+ aims to help developing countries effectively participate in trade and investment negotiations and harness the benefits of those outcomes through the provision of: 
&#x2022;	Highly technical advice;
&#x2022;	Capacity building; 
&#x2022;	Logistical support; and 
&#x2022;	Access to other relevant trade and investment organisations. 

Through TAF2+, beneficiaries will have access to on demand support through the facility, which is divided into four windows of support: 
&#x2022;	Negotiation Window: targeted short- to medium-support support during negotiations. Funding is targeted towards countries where negotiations have the potential to yield the highest returns on economic growth and poverty reduction. Under this window, TA will include technical advice, skills training and logistical support;  
&#x2022;	Strategic Window, enhanced support for DFID priority countries before a trade and/or investment negotiation and initially after an agreement is reached &#x2013; with an emphasis on sustainability. This Window of support allows government ministries to prepare the groundwork for potential future negotiations and consider wider strategies to take advantage of the benefits secured through various trade and investment agreements;  
&#x2022;	DFID Country Office Window, providing highly technical trade advice to DFID country offices to inform future trade programming and policy; and
&#x2022;	Institutional Support Window: financial support to trade and investment-related organisations, which is managed directly by DFID.</narrative>
