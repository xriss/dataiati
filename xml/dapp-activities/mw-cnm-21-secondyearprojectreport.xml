   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Chikhwawa district is one of the poorest districts in Malawi (76% of its population living below a dollar a day). The district recieves less rainfall but also is prone to floods during the rainy season hence the area is characterized among others by food insecurity, environmental degradation, and low household income. Women in the district are often marginalized in social and economic spheres despite that they play a key role in securing food and are in general the backbone of socio-economic activities. 

The project is addressing challenges of food insecurity, high illiteracy rates, environmental degradation, low household income levels to reduce vulnerability of people. 

For example Mrs Donata Jenifa Light of Mtondo club in Mwasiya II Village from Traditional Authority Maseya in Chikhwawa District said the project has brought viable solutions to their socio-economic problems .&quot; &quot;We were experiencing a lot of problems before the project including poor harvest, but now we have learnt conservation farming which has improved the crop production. We have learnt conservation agriculture, construction of firewood stoves, group management and dynamics and business management.&quot; The training has also improved the self-esteem among the women farmers who have acquired knowledge in how to increase their production and income.

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project main target are 5250 women in Chikhwawa district, Malawi. The project is promoting equity and empowerment because they underpin poverty reduction and are also important in creating enabling environments for poverty reduction among female farmers to increase their access to opportunities for sustainable livelihood. The project has established women farmers clubs through which necessary skills are being imparted to women in leadership and agriculture production to empower them to take leading role in their households as well as community level. There also interaction activities between direct and indirect beneficiaries so that community members should visualize the potentials of women in leading development at household level which has enabled community members to appreciate the need to involve women in various activities at household and community level in order to improve their livelihoods.

Women are also participating in agriculture marketing and income generation activities to foster pro-poor growth because economic empowerment of women is critical in empowerment of marginalized groups in the district as women are often denied opportunities  due to social and cultural norms. The project also continued providing production resources to women to increase productivity and profitability of farm business.

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project is fundamentally about capacity building and empowerment. The project is building capacity of women farmers which is  contributing to the achievement of purpose and outputs in the following ways: 1) The women groups will be trained in improved agriculture techniques. This will be conducted by the Farming Instructors through out the project period. The Farming Instructors have all been part of similar program and are well trained in the subject matter. The training will both give the women farmers solid back ground knowledge and hands on training in the demonstration gardens . Included in the training will be courses in basic business management. Each beneficiary will be encouraged to start a small business to supplement family income. 2) The women farmers will also be trained in what it means to be food secured and the concept of a balanced diet. 3) The capacity to work together as a group to achieve one goal will also be built among the target beneficiaries via organizational structure, In the 2nd project year min 2 cooperatives will be established and run by the women farmers them selves. Around 50% of the women farmers will be in each. In each cooperative processing plants for soy beans, ground nuts and pulses, vegetables and fruits will be established to increase the value for crops they will be growing. 4)  The women farmers will be in installing sealed rope and washer pumps to increase access to drinking water and water for irrigation. The women farmers will also be trained in irrigation and they will establish each an irrigated garden for vegetable production not depending on the rains. This production will both increase the cash income and the nutrition level of the household .5) the participating women farmers will furthermore advocate for the applicability of other project activities to other members who are their neighbours. For example the use of potholing method for planting maize which is more essential in areas with low rainfall which will advocated for in the target area. Campaigns on healing the environment will be introduced in the entire community and programs will be ongoing to ensure that everyone take part and contribute.  ;</narrative>
