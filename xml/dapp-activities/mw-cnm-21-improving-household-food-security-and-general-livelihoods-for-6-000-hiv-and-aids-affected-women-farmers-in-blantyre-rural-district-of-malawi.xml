   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The anticipated real and practical impact of the project in terms of poverty reduction will be on three livelihood areas: (i) Increased agricultural productivity which will result into increased food security, (ii) increased nutritional status and (iii) increased household income. DAPP is convinced that agriculture, being the mainstay of Malawi&#x2019;s economy, is well placed to offer opportunities to women to unlock their poverty traps. This project will ensure a deliberate effort in ensuring a package of resources with specific deliverables by way of increased food production, nutrition status and economic empowerment targeting 6,000 women in Blantyre Rural District. The envisioned impact is evidence based through the implementation of similar projects since 2006 involving +50,000 small holder farmers who have significantly improved income and reduced poverty level. What also makes this project even more worthwhile is the fact that among those that will be targeted are HIV positive and HIV affected women known from the previous DAPP TCE programme.;The anticipated real and practical impact of the project in terms of poverty reduction will be on three livelihood areas: (i) Increased agricultural productivity which will result into increased food security, (ii) increased nutritional status and (iii) increased household income.

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project aims to increase household food, nutrition and income among 6,000 female farmers affected by HIV and AIDS in Blantyre Rural District and their families. DAPP&#x2019;s Farmers&#x2019; Club approach - endorsed by MoAFS as a strategy under ASWAp - will be the overarching strategy tailored to address the needs and challenges of the targeted farmers. The major interventions aim at increasing productivity of crops and livestock; improving diet and nutrition status and income.;</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project is specifically targeting HIV positive and/or affected women in Blantyre Rural District where DAPP recently implemented a 3-year HIV and AIDS programme known as Total Control of the Epidemic (TCE). The areas face chronic poverty and acute food challenges among others, as noted by DAPP during the implementation of TCE project. The situation is attributed to inadequate access to agricultural resources and technologies by women who are engaged in agriculture. The impacts of HIV/AIDS further exacerbate the poor economic status  of the households. Although HIV/AIDS has a significant impact upon all households, the effects of the epidemic are more on impoverished families and women. The epidemic not only reduces households&#x2019; assets but also lead to  families instability (dissolution).;</narrative>

Although HIV/AIDS has a significant impact upon all households, the effects of the epidemic are more on impoverished families and women.

This project&#x2019;s direct impact will be on 6,000 women farmers and their household members estimated to be about 33,000 in total (average household size is about 5.5 members). (the 6000 female farmers would be those  who were already identified as being HIV positive and participated in a previous DAPP TCE  Project) 

The indirect beneficiaries of this project are estimated to be above 99,000 farmers (approx. 50,000 female  and 49,000 male farmers). ;</narrative>
