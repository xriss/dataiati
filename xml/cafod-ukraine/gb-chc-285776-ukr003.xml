   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Contribution to CI Appeal: EA03/2022 Ukraine
Partners: Caritas Ukraine (CUA)

24 Feb 2022, Russia announced invasion of Ukraine. Military invasion will have dire consequences for Ukraine; threatening civilian lives, livelihood and infrastructure; and has already caused food shortages and early displacement. Already people evacuating and in need of information and assistance; transportation; food, water; items to protect from harsh winter environment; medical support&apos; assistance with legal documents; psychosocial support and assistance to children. Children in Ukrainian residential institutions, particularly those close to front line are at risk or harm and trauma. Ukraine has one of largest caseloads of children in institutions in the world. 

April 2022 EA03/2022 was revised. The CUA elements of the project were scaled and the Caritas Spes elements were removed (now a standalone EA11/2022 which we are also contributing to). 
CUA will continue to work with 28 of its local Caritas across the country and communicate with all &quot;green&quot; humanitarian corridors, all public services, the government of Ukraine and international partners that are represented in Ukraine. The programme will cover the following: 
delivery of humanitarian 
organization of infrastructure for places of temporary residence of people;
protection of vulnerable population;
restoration of destruction of civilian facilities;
receiving and registering families; 
transportation to friends, family, or collective centres for shelter and support; 
operation of collective centres for sleeping, eating, caring for children;
light case management to support stabilization and planning.  

Each centre in Caritas&#x2019; network will implement a location-specific plan based on what is feasible and  a good fit based on the needs of the people and the possibilities of the Caritas network of organizations.

Total number of direct beneficiaries (individuals): 246,400 (88,000 HH)</narrative>
