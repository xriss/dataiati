The 2013 Awards were provided across two regions: Africa-Middle East and Asia-Pacific. The Awards are open to organisations based in countries with the highest rates of under-five mortality. More information on eligibility can be accessed through: http://www.starsfoundation.org.uk/impact-awards/how-to-apply
In total, 15 Awards were provided in 2013 split across the two regions and four thematic categories: Health, Education, Protection and WASH (water, sanitation and hygiene).
