Description of Company and Purpose of Project    The project involves the expansion of the Torwood Hospital and the Redcliff Medical Center in Kwekwe, in the midlands province of Zimbabwe. The two centers are owned by Bell Medical Centers, whose main office is in Harare. Until recently, the Zimbabwe Iron and Steel Company (ZISCO), a parastatal, owned both medical facilities through its in-house medical benefits scheme, Zisco Medical Benefits Society (ZMBS). To enable the centers to provide more services and handle the anticipated increase in the number of patients, there is need to expand the centers by adding outpatient departments and upgrading facilities. There will be a requirement to install new and up to date equipment, an in-house pharmacy, a laboratory, a radiology department, upgrading operating theatres and the kitchens    Environmental Category and Issues    	This is a Category B project according to IFC&apos;&apos;s environmental review procedure because specific impacts may result which can be avoided or mitigated by adhering to generally recognized performance standards, guidelines, or design criteria.  Key environmental health and safety issues that were analyzed are as follows:    		handling and disposal of medical materials;   		disposal of medical and bio-hazardous wastes;   		disposal of solid and liquid wastes including sewage;   		power and water supply including fuel storage if applicable;   		hygiene and implementation of good hospital management practices;   	CFC-free air conditioning and cold storage equipment;	   		employee health and safety training and medical monitoring; and   		fire protection and safety in both the existing facilities and expansion phases.    	To mitigate impacts associated with the project the sponsor will follow US standards with respect to waste handling and disposal procedures; a high temperature incinerator will be installed to handle hazardous waste; general waste will go to the municipality; staff will receive appropriate safety training and undergo regular medial check ups; and an independent fire safety audit of the structure and/or design plans will be completed.
