   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Following the occurrence of Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines, the Bailiff&#x2019;s Disaster Relief
Fund was opened to enable Bailiwick residents to make donations for the relief effort in a
collective manner.

The Commission approved a proposal by the Trustees of the Bailiff&#x2019;s Disaster Relief Fund that
&#xA3;10,000 be allocated from that Fund to Bridge2Philippines who were sending a team of relief
workers, including a doctor and a nurse, to the Philippines at their own expense. Those funds
were spent to purchase 22 tons of rice; food and household items including 5 gallon water
carriers, plates, cutlery, cups, cooking pots, plastic containers, washing bowls, soap powder,
soap, toothpaste, toothbrushes, shampoo, oil, spaghetti, pasta sauce, sardines, biscuits and
powdered milk; tools to enable fishermen to repair their boats including hammers, nails,
handsaws, Stanley knives, cable ties and shovels to help people clear their land.

The Commission is advised that at the time of writing this report &#xA3;75,000 has been sent by
the Bailiff&#x2019;s Disaster Relief Fund to the central Disasters Emergency Committee, in addition to
the &#xA3;10,000 allocated to Bridge2Philippines.</narrative>
