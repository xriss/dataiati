   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In December 2013, UNICEF requested &#xA3;25,000 for the Commission towards is emergency
response appeal to provide emergency medicines, food, shelter and sanitation kits for the
poorest and most vulnerable people in the Central African Republic. The application stated:
As a result of the escalating conflict: sanitation is limited in the camps sheltering
those fleeing violence in their villages and the risk of diseases/epidemics is high. There
is a shortage of food; and the most basic medical care as health facilities have been
destroyed, looted or are currently operating with a very limited number of staff.
There are also gaps in the supply of essential medicines including vaccines, antibiotics
and malaria treatments, and there is a crucial need for child protection, food,
sanitation, and water. There is a very real risk that polio and measles epidemics will be
take hold in the camps as so many of the refugees have not been vaccinated against
these potentially life-threatening diseases.

In considering the request, the Commissioners were mindful that the Central African Republic
is one of the world&#x2019;s poorest countries and is ranked 180th out of the 186 countries on the
UN&#x2019;s Development Index. It has also noted the UN&#x2019;s view that in light of the resent escalation
of civil conflict there is a real risk of genocide in Central African Republic without a massive
scaling up in the international response to the crisis.

The Commissioners noted that the UN had indicated that nearly 1 million people have fled
their homes and sought safety in camps provided by UNICEF and other aid agencies. They also
noted that the UN is calling for a massive scaling up of the international response to the
growing crisis in the Central African Republic if the risk of genocide is to be overcome.</narrative>
