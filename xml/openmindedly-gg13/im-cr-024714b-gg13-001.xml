  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The civil conflict in Syria has been ongoing since 2011 and, as is inevitably the case in such
situations, the impact is felt most by the ordinary people of Syria. Since the outbreak of
hostilities it is estimated that over two million Syrians have fled their homes and sought
refuge in the neighbouring countries of Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey and Iraq. This mass
movement of people has meant that the camps established by the various aid agencies and
the UN working in the region are stretched to capacity. The pressures placed on the aid
agencies have meant that many families have had little option but to live in crude shelters
they have built themselves, with host families in overcrowded conditions or in partially
finished buildings.

Within Syria itself, the health system has effectively collapsed as hospitals and clinics have
been damaged by the fighting and the facilities still able to operate have struggled to secure
even the most basic of essential medical supplies and equipment. In many areas there is no
access to clean water, electricity or sanitation and food supplies are at best limited and
intermittent.

The DEC provided the following update in September 2013, six months after launching its
appeal and sadly the situation is Syrian and the surrounding countries hosting the many
refugee camps has only worsened since this update:

Funds donated to the DEC paid for aid to be delivered to 129,000 people in the first
three months after the Syria Crisis Appeal was opened on 20 March 2013. Over 80% of
the people helped were inside Syria, with aid being provided mainly by DEC member
agencies working through partner organisations. Those helped have come from all
affected communities and across Syria.

Inside Syria more than 42,000 people have received food and over 28,000 have
received hygiene kits, with some receiving both as part of the same distribution
supported by a DEC agency. Save the Children has used DEC funds to support a partner
organisation to improve sanitation for people worst affected by the conflict. They are
cleaning the streets of debris and maintaining a hospital sewage system in an area
which undergoes heavy shelling and is often sealed off due to fighting.

Within the last three months, an additional 25,750 people inside Syria received family
food parcels from the Syrian Arab Red Crescent with support from the Red Cross using
DEC funds. The delivery of these parcels is ongoing and a total of 72,500 people are
expected to have received help by the end of September 2013. CAFOD is working with
church partners to deliver food parcels to help a further 5,000 people.
Other aid delivered inside Syria and paid for with DEC funds during the first three
months of the response has included:
(i)    Clean water and latrines for displaced people
(ii)   Emergency surgery for people injured in the fighting
(iii)  Money to help displaced people pay for temporary accommodation
(iv)  Support for children traumatised by the fighting
(v)   Blankets, clothing and cooking sets for people who have fled their homes</narrative>
