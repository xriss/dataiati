   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In early August 2014, Christian Aid contacted the Commission to request a donation to its disaster relief appeal for Gaza. The request stated that since July 2014, at least 852 Palestinian civilians, including 249 children, had been killed. More than 245,000 people had been forced from their homes, fleeing in desperation from one place to another in one of the most densely populated spaces in the world. This violence was compounding an already dire humanitarian situation in Gaza as the number of casualties mounted. Our partners on the ground have described the destruction of agricultural land and homes, as well as severe shortage of medical supplies in hospitals treating the injured. There are reports that the health system is close to collapse.</narrative>
