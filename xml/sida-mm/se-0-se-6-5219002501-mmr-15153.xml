    <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Irrawaddy saw that the environment in which it operates had continued to become more hostile in 2017. The deterioration related to safety of journalists, the increased use of legal action against journalists and the increased propaganda in relation to the many of the conflicts affecting Myanmar. During 2017 Irrawaddy continued to produce news in both Burmese and English languages. In total, 4461 articles were produced on the Burmese site, and 1018 articles on the English site, during 2017. The Burmese website received about 32,4 million unique visitors and the English website received about 2,2 million unique visitors.&#xA0; Irrawaddy had turned 100% digital and during 2017 there was a growth from 8,3 million followers on the Burmese Facebook page in January to 11,3 million followers in December 2017. The Irrawaddy also continued to use other social media like Twitter, Viber and YouTube.&#xA0; Following the events in Rakhine in August 2017 and the development thereafter with a very challenging media reporting environment with lack of reliable sources and a lot of desinformation, Irrawaddy was sometimes critizised (along with a number of other local media) for publishing unbalanced reporting that was supporting the government narrative about the development in Rakhine. On the other hand Irrawaddy has been one of few media actors that has been brave in its reporting and highlighted human rights violations in conflict affected areas, as well as sometimes been critical against the government and the military.&#xA0; Regarding the objective to expand revenue growth opportunities the Irrawaddy managed to gradually increase its self-income generation during 2017 via use of digital platforms, products and services available via website, FB, YouTube, Viber, Line, SMS, Twitter and news Syndication. In 2017, 24,2% of Irrawaddy&apos;s income was from advertisments.&#xA0; During 2017 Irrawaddy participated in the Swedish supported program by Media Development Investment Fund (MDIF), including capacity development training activities for sales and marketing. MDIF also provided a small grant for Irrawaddy to employ a Digital Marketing Officer during a limited time, with the aim for the position to become self-sustainable in the long run. Irrawaddy found the support from MDIF to be helpful. As part of the program, MDIF also commissioned a coach to support Irrawaddy to increase the capacity on revenue growth. The designated coach who was a very experienced e-media manager from Singapore, found that Irrawaddy&apos;s editorial management was quite reluctant to make the radical changes that were suggested. Irrawaddy was not content with the coach and requested somebody else. However, the Irrawaddy and MDIF could not agree on a suitable coach, and a person that matched Irrawaddy&apos;s requirements could not be found. After several attempts from MDIF to meet Irrawaddy&apos;s expectations, it was decided in 2018 that Irrawaddy would leave the MDIF capacity development program.</narrative>
