    <narrative xml:lang="EN">&#xD6;vergripande fr&#xE5;ga: Resultat kopplat till avsedd effekt 2014Fr&#xE5;ga: Sammanfatta resultat relaterade till avsedd effekt (denna information kommer att skickas till Open Aid).Svar: The capacity of Lead and Seed organisations as well as child-led groups has been strengthened  2013 and  the role of civil society organisations in realisation of child rights has become increasingly recognised by the government in Myanmar. Lead organisations, especially operating in Mandalay and Magway were able to further strengthen their relationships with State/Regional/Township Committee on the Rights of the Child and officials of Department of Social Welfare in their project areas and increase the collaboration. Also at the Township level, Seed organisations were able to facilitate a stronger engagement of Departments of Social Welfare (DSW) and Township Child Rights Committees (TCRC) in promoting the rights of children. The diversity among NGO Child Rights Working Group (NCRWG)&#xB4;s members have increased in the last year and through their engagement with the ASEAN Peoples Forum and in other CRC events, they have been recognised by the public at large and by the regional authorities who offered to work together on child rights related issues.   Children&#xB4;s Groups have also become stronger over the project period with the support of Lead and Seed organisation. A National Children&#x2019;s Forum was held with the participation of 70 children across the country. It was the first time an event of this kind was held with such quality interaction between children as the right holders, and policy makers and the duty bearers as accountable persons to the fulfilment of Child Rights. The Children&#xB4;s Groups also engaged in advocacy at community, township, and regional levels and produced note books with messages of General Measures of Implementation on UNCRC to be able to do so. The children also presented the results and identified violated rights from their Child Led Participatory Action Research to the regional level government authorities where they led the open discussions with confidence.  Furthermore, children groups led fund raising activities to enable to sustain their activities. They initiated to form the regional / state children networks in order to continue the child rights activities especially for the post project period.   At the regional level, public awareness of child rights increased due to highly publicised event such as CRC Day event in Yangon Region by the NCRWG where 1,450 children, 500 adults including Regional authorities participated and the event was broadcasted on TV programme and mentioned in newspapers and journals. As part of their advocacy efforts, NCRWG participated in the Myanmar People Forum which was organised in the last week of December 2013 with 650 participants from 165 organisations including INGOs, NGOs, CSOs and CBOs and government authorities in Yangon.  During the forum, topics such as peace, justice, human rights and child rights, democracy and development were discussed.   The engagement with media has been strengthened by providing training on child rights, child law and child rights governance including the role of media in promoting child rights awareness. As a result, the child rights issues and child rights related articles were frequently mentioned in Journals and Newspapers.  During 2013, Save the Children and its partners have gained increased access to the Members of Parliament (MPs). For the first time, SC has conducted workshops on Child Rights Governance and Child Protection to MPs and after participating in CP and CRG workshop, one of MPs proposed at the parliament session to take serious action against child sexual abuse cases, to increase social protection system, and to extend the structure of DSW in every township and district level across Myanmar. The MPs also requested the DSW to increase its budget and submit to the cabinet and parliaments, promising to support it at the Parliament Session for approval.</narrative>
