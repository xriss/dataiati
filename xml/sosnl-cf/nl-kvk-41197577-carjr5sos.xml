   <narrative xml:lang="EN">SOS Children&apos;s Villages in CAR conducted a multi-sectoral evaluation in September 2018 in the Ouham prefecture, specifically in the sub-prefecture of Bossangoa. 291 household surveys and 21 focus groups were conducted to map priority needs, with a particular focus on protection aspects (please find the needs assessment attached). Following this assessment, the DRA guidelines and based on the learnings from JR 2018, SOS CV decided to focus on the following sectors: Protection The results of the needs assessment carried out by SOS RCA show that the presence of armed groups, security incidents and new sources of possible tension represent a major risk of protection for the population, primarily children. Armed attacks, sexual violence, recruitment by armed groups, family separation, socio-economic stigmatization due to accusations of witchcraft and early marriages are protection risks to which the populations are particularly vulnerable. Most unaccompanied children are orphans or children whose parents are accused of witchcraft. They find themselves stigmatized and rejected by their extended family / community and are often left to abuse and other forms of exploitation. These children reside themselves into a household that is most often lead by a teenager. Humanitarian coverage is very low in the sub-prefecture of Bossangoa, SOS RCA being the only actor in the humanitarian sector. The needs assessment revealed that education is a high need in Ouham. 28% of the respondents say that schools have been destroyed. This again, leads to high protection needs. Following the RTF guidelines, it is not possible to work in the education sector. Therefore, SOS Children&#x2019;s Villages will use a &#x2018;safe school approach&#x2019; (harmonized with Plan) in the protection and multi purpose cash activities we plan to implement. Food security and livelihoods Food insecurity is widespread around Bossangoa. According to the focus groups, it is difficult to have two meals a day. 100% of households reported having used negative coping strategies in the three days preceding the survey. For example, buying food of lower quality (such as plain cassava and cassave leaves without oil and other ingredients) or depending on neighbors or friends for food. Almost all households (94.6%) have an average daily income of less than CFAF 3,000, of which a majority (55.1%) has an income of less than CFAF 500. This is related to a lack of employment, cash to invest / buy stock and lack or loss of means of production. The main sources of income are agriculture and small livestock and are earned by men and women. Men are often the main decision makers in the management of the household income. ICCO/FLM will cover WASH in those areas where Plan and SOS CV are working. Health and Nutrition 50% of the respondents report not having access to any health facility. 67% of households say their children have not been screened for malnutrition. There is no malnutrition management service in the localities except at the Bossangoa Center District Hospital. The deterioration of road infrastructure and the lack of family income, limit the ability of households with children who suffer from acute malnutrition, to access the Nutritional Stabilization Center. In addition, the low the health system coverage does not allow for mass screening campaigns. This lack of functional health facilities and the distance to the nearest health center has forced communities to resort to self-medication and traditional practices.</narrative>
