   <narrative xml:lang="EN">As we draw closer to the end of fifth year in the Syrian crisis, the situation remains unstable and lacks the vision for peace. The complexity of the situation and the absence of safety led to an increase in the number of people in need (PiN). Many displaced and affected people fled from Syria in search for peace, but the majority remains in Syria, most of them lack the basic needs for living and are in constant need for support to overcome the difficult conditions they are facing.
Estimates from the HNO 2016 report, shows that the number of people in need are increasing in Syria, even though the overall population is decreasing. Estimates show that 13.5 million people are in need, 8.7 million of them are in need for multi-sector approach, making the Severity Scale for 2016 around 3.52 compared to 3.19 out of 6.00 last year.
Several factors including international sanctions and massive inflation worsened the economy and public services and left industries and livelihoods paralyzed leaving millions of people completely aid dependent. Over three of four Syrians are now living in poverty, unable to afford basic food needed for survival, in addition to the fact that Urban markets are increasingly cut off from rural supply and food prices are driven upward by lack of access to supplies and transport costs. There is a growing dependency on imported food due to the decline of agro-industry. Access to bread and cooking gas is often better in government controlled areas, where prices are monitored. Besieged urban areas are most critically in need of food.
With the delivery of basic goods and services severely affected, water and sanitation are urgent needs for over 12 million while close to 8.7 million are severely food insecure, including over 2 million children that are malnourished.
In central and south Syria, despite these areas hosting a significant majority of the displaced population, in part due to their relative stability, GOPA-DERD is one of few national NGOs, with longstanding contextual expertise currently engaged in relief efforts. We are working closely with different UN agencies through different cluster working groups to coordinate our response and efforts and to maximize the effectiveness of our work.
Through our distribution of 15000 food parcels, 8000 items of clothes and 12000 hygiene kits for families composed of at least 4 to 5 persons and distribution of 12000 Jerry cans, in Hard-to-reach areas like: (Aleppo city, Nebol, Zahraa, Jafr, Areesheh, Ghoueran, Hole, Halfaya, Bloudan and Yabroud) which are not regularly accessible for sustained humanitarian programming due to denial of access, active conflict, multiple security checkpoints, or failure of the authorities to provide timely approval. An estimated 4.5 million people in need of protection and humanitarian assistance live in these areas and since access to such locations is very limited, by reaching out to those very vulnerable families we will address some of the most pressing elements of this humanitarian crisis. 
This project is therefore essential, to help alleviate the burden of the crisis and improve the humanitarian situation for IDPs as well as for affected host populations in hard to reach areas as mentioned above.
As for the selection criteria of beneficiaries, priority will be given to families who haven&#x2019;t received any food, hygiene, or clothes items from GOPA-DERD before and we will focus on families who were displaced recently due to the current conflicts.</narrative>
