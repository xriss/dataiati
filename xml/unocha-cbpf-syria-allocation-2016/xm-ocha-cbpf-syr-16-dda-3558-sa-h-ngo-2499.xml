Al-Waleed hospital is the only public hospital in the area, but it is 80% ruined. Since Al-Birr association has its own hospital &quot;Al-Birr Hospital&quot;, which is considered one of the largest hospitals in Syria. The hospital combines eleven floors and 150 beds in different medical specialties, provided with all services for free or semi-free, but it needs a rehabilitation and maintenance for its various medical departments, in addition to many new equipment that have been destroyed due to war. The hospital currently operates 25% of its total ability.

Therefore, the association thinks that it is essential to insure a rehabilitation to that clinic, and provide it with all the medical equipment that are needed such as: X-ray equipment, a laboratory, various clinics equipment, ECG, Echograph, a dental clinic and an ambulance to provide night services.
