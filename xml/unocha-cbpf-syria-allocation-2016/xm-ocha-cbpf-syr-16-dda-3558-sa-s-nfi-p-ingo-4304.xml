  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Millions of Syrians are displaced inside Syria as war continues. It led to massive displacement of people across and within the borders of the country whereby a large number of persons experienced multiple displacement patterns. It resulted in over 6 Million internally displaced persons, a number of which 2.8 million children (HRP2016). In Homs governorate, the total number of displaced people is 526,510 and the total number of people in need of urgent protection and humanitarian assistance is 1,023,033 as reported in the HRP 2016. The massive displacement of people has not only affected the situation of the displaced ones, but also of those living in the host communities. In Homs Governorate, hundreds of families fled from Palmyra, Rural Homs and from unstable areas in Homs City such as Old Homs, Al-Wa&#x2019;ar, Al-Khaldiyah, Bab Al-Siba&#x2019;a and other unstable areas of Homs City. 
More than five thousands of IDPs have been displaced in Al-Inshaat and Al-Dablan neighborhoods. Many displaced families are occupying half of the schools in those two areas. The remaining schools as a result have become overstretched and overcrowded, meaning that the quality of education provided is significantly reduced. The Ministry of Education has set plans to put the schools, which are currently occupied by IDPs to function back as schools when possible to reduce the impact on the overstretched schools and consequently on the host communities. As the situation in Homs City is normalizing and many of the unrest locations have become stable and open for IDPs to move to, there are plans to relocate the displaced families currently sheltering in schools in Al-Inshaat and Al-Dablan areas to the newly stabilized areas such as Baba Amr and Al-Qusour and the City Business Center.
This project aims to provide secure and structurally appropriate living space, alongside the objective to improve protection from the weather conditions and enhancing privacy and dignity to 245 families which have to evacuate their current collective Shelters in Al-Inshaa&#x2019;t neighborhood and Al-Dablan. Women and children are in particular need of shelter support as traditionally they will spend more time in the home and are thus more affected by inappropriate shelter options. Through this project, SIF will make available 7 collective and private shelters in three areas: BaBa Amr, Al-Qusourand Homs City Center.  The planned rehabilitation activities will consist of implementing temporary measures of light rehabilitation and improvement of the living and health conditions in the target collective and private shelters in accordance to the standards and guidelines that were adopted by the shelter sector and endorsed by MoLA as per a standardized BoQ.
On the other hand, the project aims to provide help and support to the children and adolescents who are physically, psychologically, and socially affected by the crisis. Children are being subjected to gross violations of their basic children rights and are facing specific protection risks. Through this project, SIF will allocate one room in each collective shelter to be used as a Child Friendly Space. The Child Friendly Spaces (CFS) will act as safe environments for children to play, learn and interact with their peers. The activities organized in a CFS will be designed to identify children with specific protection concerns, refer them to relevant services to meet children&#x2019;s specific needs by trained staff members. Children with special needs and disabilities will be assisted through case management and referral to specialized services. CFS in each collective shelter will support the resilience and well&#x2010;being of children and young people through organized and structured activities conducted in a safe, child friendly and stimulating environment. 40 recreational activities per month per CFS will be delivered maximum of 20 children in each session will be present and 2 volunteers will be running the session.</narrative>
