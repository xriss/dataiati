   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Enhanced Safe Water supply to suffering population in Al-Diabieh and Jdeidet Artouz  through wells rehabilitation and re-equipping</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The ongoing conflict in Syria forces large numbers of families to leave their homes and take refuge in more protected areas. Many of these families arrive from the major urban areas and overpopulate suburban townships that house already hundreds of thousands refugees from Iraq, Palestine as well as IPDs from the Golan Heights. Seen the brutal armed conflict that hits particularly, but not exclusively most of the sub-urban neighborhoods of Damascus and Rural Damascus, hundreds of thousands residents flee the fighting and seek safer havens in close semi-urban or rural areas ,where most of them remain condemned to squat in unoccupied public or private buildings, open buildings sites. 
The most basic requirements besides (shelter, food, health care) concerning the present emergency situation is clean water. 
Water supply constitutes a major obstacle mainly for the mentioned locations, as the number of the returnees is exceeding 95,000 in the 2 selected locations as lower real figures of today may increase due to the evolution of the conflict and post- conflict periods. Only selected families are permitted to re-settle, as the majority left their homes without any of their belongings, in all cases their homes are damaged or looted, they return to reside in locations where services like clean water supply and sewage evacuation are not available leaving them at risk of health hazards.

Currently water supply infrastructure damaged or out of service due to the existing situation and due to the incapability of the Water Department to supply the needy population with the required water quantities or quality.
 Due to the above mentioned factors failing to provide adequate clean water supply will lead to increasing the severity of the current situation and stretching the returnees&apos; coping mechanism to deal with the water shortage eventually leading to increased cases of water born diseases.  
HELP plans its contribution to safe water supply production and well rehabilitation, water conveyance, water treatment O3 and water storage to the most needy of the most vulnerable populations in  the 3 locations : Jdeidet Artouz , Jdeidet Artouz Al fadel and Al Diabieh / Municipality Bab Beela &#x2013; Governorate Al Qunaitrah.
The planned activities will include the following :
1-Al &#x2013; Diabieh:  located Southern of Damascus inhabited by 50,000 returnees, IDP s administratively part of Rif Damascus and Qunaitrah. Shelter conditions inhabited by the returnees varying between partly  damaged and hardly  habitable and without inadequate facilities , water supply constitutes one of the most basic needs for the simple survival of the population in need of daily minimum rates of fresh and safe water supply. Water supply in the frame of WASH obliges the humanitarian actors to support the needy population with the basic human needs, failing to provide clean water will lead to health hazarders and force the target population to seek other locations with basic services.
The works will include: rehabilitation of 5 non- functional wells.
-Cleaning and maintenance of the 5 wells 
- Mechanical and electrical re-equipping 
-Rehabilitation of the pumping stations
-Connecting the water lines with the main water network.
Wells capacity as follows  :
Well No 1 = 12m3/ h
Well No 2= 20m3/h
Well No 3= 20m3/h
Well No 4= 20m3/h
Well No 5=20m3/h

2- Jdeidet Artouz Yusuf Al &#x2013;Athmeh water line: located north west of Jdeidet Artouz &#x2013;Al Fadel (Rif Damascus). The area is inhabited by 45.000 returnees and IDP s. it is imperative to enhance the quality of water supplied to the population in need to avoid health risks and water borne diseases. Various forms of waterborne diarrheal disease are the most prominent examples, and affect mainly children.  
Jdeidet Artouz Yusuf Al &#x2013;Athmeh water line consist of 5 existing wells supplying Rif Damascus with water .Though the water quality pumped into the main water network is not safe due to leakages in the main water network</narrative>
