  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Because of the effects of the crisis in Syria in general and in Homs in particular, many hospitals have been out of service which led to a decrease in medical services in the city. Having medical service needs long time, and in some cases it requires moving into another city which affect negatively on the people.  

Due to this situation, Al-Birr Association has invested many hospitals that out of service in order to provide medical services with high quality. Al-Birr Association has invested Farkoh Hospital, Al Shawi Hospital, and Al-Mahatah Hospital to cover the medical needs required by the population of Homs. Despite this, the medical service was not enough to cover the city needs that led the Association to contract with Al-Kindi Hospital to do an entire rehabilitation to the building and operate it. The hospital is located in the city center of Homs (50 &#x2013; bed capacity) covers almost all medical specialties, but it has been stolen which has made the hospital again out of service in a previous period.
The project aims at rehabilitate the hospital and provide it with the basics equipment in addition to enhancing the medical services that will be offered for free during the project&apos;s period such as surgeries, Incubations, Dialysis, Intensive care units, and the Installation of artificial limbs. Because the association wants what is best for people, it requires a high &#x2013; quality MRI to offer the required service. Note that, there is a low quality MRI that does not serve the purpose very well, which forces people to move to another city to have the medical care that they need Note that this service will provide for free during the project&apos;s period.
Al- Birr association has an eligible staff of doctors, nurses and an administrative staff, which has high experience in providing health services Al-Hamideya Clinic, which has been established since 1994, has never stopped working since 1994 except during the crisis, the clinics that operate in Wa&#x2019;er area as well. The association also has the ability to transport patients to and from hard-to-reach areas through ceoordination with government and obtaining the necessary approvals.
The project aims to strengthen the health services with the aim of life sustaining through the provision of medical assistance and surgical aids in  ICU and other departments for people in need.</narrative>
