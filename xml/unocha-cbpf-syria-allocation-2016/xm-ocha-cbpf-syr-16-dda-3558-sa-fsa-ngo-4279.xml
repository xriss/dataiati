  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">As a result of the Syria crisis, the overall Al-Hasakah governorate suffered extensive damages, especially in the western and southern regions where they have become a battle field.  These regions have been freed lately and been fairly stable and safe.  That in turn, encouraged thousands of families to stay in or return to these areas.  However, the catastrophic events that happened in these country-side regions during the crisis have a negative and a life threatening impact on these communities.  

Some of these main negative impacts are:
	Loss of source of income, such as livestock and agricultural assets, properties, and equipment.
	People in these areas spread over a large geographical area width more than 100 km. Public transportation is not available anymore to reach the nearby towns and cities, which prevents from acquiring their basic needs of the daily bread.
	Most people in these areas are displaced and returnees.

The culture in these local communities, is that the women bake homemade bread as needed and use the cattle and agricultural remnants like animal dung, firewood, and straw as domestic fuel for baking and cooking.  To allow these communities to strive, it will require a serious and emergency intervention to provide them with these basic needs.

The Al-Wasel project, &quot;Flour Against Hunger&quot;,  is designed to provide baking flour to the distal countryside communities of Al-Hasakah, which are too far from the public bakeries and other necessary needs.  In addition, the project is also designed to train housewives to bake bread by themselves, because of the difficult access to those town and city centers due to the security and transportation restrictions.

This project, naturally, will target women and children as they are the vital members of any family. 

The Al-Wasel Charity over the last year has provided various  possible aids for these areas and for their displaced and returning people.  The aid services provided were in various forms such as food distribution, medical assistance, and WASH. In addition, carrying the successful campaigns, such as the Protection of children and the &quot;Back to School&quot;, The Al-Wasel Charity had gained rich insight and a full perception of the situation, the needs, and the living conditions of this suffering area.  

All determined areas will be thoroughly researched and surveyed.   Al-Wasel Charity will be focused on the highest priority livelihood according to the criteria of selection. The baking flour, and iron sheets will be provided monthly for each family for 5 consecutive months starting in Febriuary.  Because these essential materials are not available for them at the present time due to loss of their agricultural crops, especially wheat crop, which they used to use it for their daily required nutrition.  The intervention of the Al-Wasel Charity will be considered a life-saving and a life-sustaining effort until the harvest season in the Sixth month (Feb) of this year comes.</narrative>
