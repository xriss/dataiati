   <narrative xml:lang="EN">As Lamset Shifa is well known among the communities and people in need to be a medical service provider, it became the main distention to those people in need of medical treatment and cannot afford it. Thus, we witness a massive continuous influx of applicants each month, estimated at 1100 patients per month. Prior to the crisis, Lamset Shifa was able to respond to all people who seek the association&#x2019;s support. Currently, due to financial barriers, Lamset Shifa can&#x2019;t meet the needs of people who ask the association support and only provide services to 56% of them. Taking into consideration that these needs are increasingly raising as people fail to meet their basic needs. Those people varies between host communities and internally displaced people, in addition to residents of hard to reach areas who obtain a facilitation letter to visit Damascus governorate to receive the treatments that shall save their lives. 


This project aims to cover all lifesaving surgeries for people in need, including internal displaced people in all governorates and population in hard to reach areas. In order to ensure that the services provided is lifesaving and appropriate to the patients&#x2019; medical status Lamset Shifa will refer all applicants to doctors who will diagnose the patients&#x2019; medical situation and recommend the needed treatment. Then the patients are referred to a laboratories that will provide all needed diagnosis tests. Based on doctor recommendation and diagnosis tests results, the patients are referred to hospitals to conduct the surgeries or any other treatment recommended by the doctors, and Lamset Shifa will ensure to provide them with all medicines or supplements to ensure achieving the best medical results.
