   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Since crisis in Syria are entering its 5th year, and because of war in different areas of Syria, especially in old city of Homs, and Wa&#x2019;er district, many people especially children are suffering from various injuries and disabilities. They have lost one of their extremities, the problem which will affect all their lives.
	Al-Birr association received many of these conditions through its own hospitals in Wa&#x2019;er and Mahattah, and through its health centers for women and children in rural area of Homs (northern, eastern, western rural area). Because of these ongoing circumstances in Syria, those people do not have enough financial resources for operations that replaces their lost extremities or joints. About 70% of beneficiaries are IDPs, and about 50% of them are people from hard-reach areas.
	On the other hand, many hospitals in Homs became out of service, especially governmental hospital which was providing services for people for free. Now, there is some private hospitals in Homs with a few ICU beds. Al-Birr Association is the only private hospital in Homs owned to an NGO. Although its hospital in Wa&#x2019;er is well equipped, Wa&#x2019;er is now a hard-reach area, and there is no enough doctors in it. Al-Birr association can receive patients from Wa&#x2019;er in its new hospital (Mahattah hospital), and provide its services for them for free, or almost free, but it needs baby incubators with oxygen tent, and some equipment for 4 beds in ICU including (monitors, ECG with 12 electrodes, artificial pacemaker, electrical ICU beds with its accessories, automatic injectors, nebulizers, secretion suckers, ABGs and electrolytes device)
This project is to enhance the provision of life-sustaining health services by providing surgical aid for people in need for it. This surgical aid is containing 500 natural birth, 400 Caesarian birth, 100 baby incubation, providing 40 extremities and joints (20 of them are children), 200 general surgery, 150 orthopedics and nervous operations and 300 emergency operations (including burns, fractures, etc.), in addition to rehabilitation by physiotherapy after that.
	Al-Birr association has its own staff of doctors and nurses through its long-term experience in health sector since it has a dispensary since 1955 and a private hospital, which is one of the largest special hospitals in Syria since 1991. It also has the ability to transfer people from and to hard-reach and besieged areas by coordinating with governmental departments and obtaining governmental approvals.</narrative>
