   <narrative xml:lang="EN">IFC is launching an Azerbaijan Housing Finance Program, designed to facilitate the development of Azerbaijans mortgage sector and to increase access to funding. The program would include providing long-term mortgage facilities to selected commercial banks as well as advisory services to the participating banks and other key market players.

The proposed transaction with Unibank Commercial Bank Open Joint-Stock Company (the Bank or Unibank) is the first investment under the program and consists of a seven-year senior loan for up to $15.0 million for the purpose of originating mortgages.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">IFCs investment is expected to have a high developmental impact in the following areas:

- Development of Azerbaijans housing finance sector: 

Consistent with the IFCs strategy, the project presents the opportunity to promote the development of the primary mortgage market in Azerbaijan by: 

- providing the much needed long-term funding to the banking system;
- raising the mortgage underwriting standards in accordance with the best industry practices; 
- increasing standardization of mortgage files, documentation, and quality.

Furthermore, the project would enable the Bank (and potentially other players) to build a pool of suitable assets for securitization, which would create conditions for the development of secondary mortgage market and potential refinancing mechanisms.

- Increased Access to Funding: 

By providing long term funding, the project will also increase the affordability of home purchase, thus promoting home ownership in the country, as well as providing financing for houses renovation. Furthermore, by developing the mortgage market in Azerbaijan, the project is expected to lower the cost of mortgage loans over the short to medium term.

- Strengthening of the Financial Sector: 

The successful implementation of this project will develop financial intermediation by increasing the range of products and services available in the market.

- Demonstration Effect: 

IFCs involvement will help bring credibility to the countrys growing mortgage finance sector and will facilitate attracting long-term funding from other sources.</narrative>
