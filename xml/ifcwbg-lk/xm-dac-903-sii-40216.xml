   <narrative xml:lang="EN">0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0.0000       &#xA0;  The proposed project is a 13.2 MW, 615 tons per day (tpd) waste to energy (WtE) plant to be implemented by Fairways Waste Management Pvt. Ltd. (the Company), a subsidiary of Fairways Holding Private Ltd. at Karadiyana, Colombo in Sri Lankas Western Province (the Project). Following a competitive public bidding process, the Ministry of Megapolis and Western Development, Colombo, Sri Lanka awarded a concession for 22.5 years to the Company in 2017. The Project will include a mass incineration facility with capacity of 500 tpd of Municipal Solid Waste (MSW), an anaerobic digestion (AD) facility for segregated organic waste of up to 115 tpd and a 1 km transmission line for evacuation of power. It is anticipated that the Project will produce 80 GWh of electricity annually, which will be supplied to the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) as well as solid and liquid digestate.     &#xA0;    Currently 500 tpd of MSW from 8 local authorities from the suburbs of Colombo is dumped at the Karadiyana dump site. These 8 local authorities are: Dehiwala-Mount Lavinia, Moratuwa, Maharagama, Boralesgamuwa,   Kesbewa, Piliyandala and Homagama. After the Project becomes operational, WMA will permanently stop dumping waste at the Karadiyana dump site, and all MSW will be diverted to the Project for incineration.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Sri Lanka as one of the countries disproportionately affected by climate change has signed a declaration in 2016 UNFCCC Conference of Parties to achieve 100% of electricity generation through renewable energy sources by 2050 at the latest. This is an ambitious target as the country currently has 52% of electricity generated through fossil fuels (mainly imported). Municipal solid waste is regarded a renewable energy source that can be converted to electricity generation through waste-to-energy incineration plants. Sri Lanka, is currently facing a severe municipal waste management issue with the prevalence of open dumpling which is hazardous and causes significant negative externalities to society and the economy. 
Within this context, the proposed project&apos;s market level development impact is likely to arise from improved sustainability by supporting the development of the first sizable WTE plant in the country. The successful implementation of the Project is expected to have demonstration effects on waste-to-energy as a solution for scalable waste treatment while also contributing to the country&apos;s renewable energy generation capacity that can be replicated by other developers. The project-level impact is likely to arise from stakeholder impacts by reducing public health risks created by open dumping and environmental effects realized through avoiding waste and associated methane from the reduction in waste from the sourced dumpsite.</narrative>
