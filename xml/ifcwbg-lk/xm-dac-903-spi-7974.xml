Location of project and Description of site    	The project is located in the Port of Colombo.  The Port of Colombo has two major container terminals: Jaya Container Terminal and the Queen Elizabeth Quay (&quot;QEQ&quot;). The SAGT terminal at QEQ will be formed by increasing the width of the present quay by 100 m. into the harbor basin over a 940 m. long stretch and constructing a new container quay, with 15 m. water depth, prolonged in the southern end by a 180 m. passenger quay. The storage area behind the quay will be extended by approximately 180 m. to the North.     Description of Company and Purpose of Project    	The project is being developed as a 30-year build-operate-transfer (BOT) project granted by the Sri Lanka Ports Authority, to South Asia Gateway Terminals (Private) Limited. The Project is intended to increase the capacity of the Terminal from 260,000 Teu to about 1.1 million Teu. This is a joint venture project with the Asian Development Bank and the Commonwealth Development Corporation.  This will be the first privately operated terminal in Sri Lanka.  Accordingly, IFC&apos;&apos;s support is expected to have an important demonstration impact on the restructuring of the port sector in the region, an objective supported by the World Bank.    Environmental Category and Issues    	This is a category B project according to IFC&apos;&apos;s environmental review procedure, because specific impacts may result which can be avoided or mitigated by adhering to generally recognized performance standards, guidelines or design criteria.
