   <narrative xml:lang="EN">0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0.0000       &#xA0;  The proposed project is a 5-year, local currency, senior loan of up to US$  5  0     m  illio  n equivalent, to   National Development Bank   PLC (    NDB    ), a mid-sized licensed   commercial bank   (    LC  B    ) in Sri Lanka (    the     Project    ).   As at December 31, 2017, SME and Retail segments accounted for 40% of the Banks portfolio, followed by Corporates (33%) and Project Finance (22%).   T  he   Project   will support the expansion of   NDB  s MSME portfolio related to the agriculture sector, with an emphasis on financing climate-smart agriculture solutions and women-owned enterprises  . The Banks current exposure to agriculture represents 10% of its portfolio  .     The Project will be supported by the IFC-Canada Climate Blended Finance Program and the WEOF facilities, with a focus on promoting respectively Climate Smart Agri (    CSA    ) practices and Women owned SME financing in   the   agribusiness space. Out of the up to US$     50     mi  l  lion financing for this project, up to US$10     million will be carve  d   out for CSA and funded by the IFC-Canada Climate Blended Finance Program. The WEOF will provide pricing incentives based on   targets re  ached by the project.    The agriculture sector employs 26% of Sri Lankas work force, represents 24% of exports and accounted for a third of poverty reduction over the past 15 years. However, its contribution to GDP fell from 20.5% to 6.9% in the same period. Further, inclement weather conditions have led to a 1% reduction in GDP growth in recent years. Moreover, lack of investments in technology, value additions, efficient and climate smart practices are obstacles in realising its true potential. This has made the sector less competitive in the global market, severing it from global agri-value chains.     The proposed project is part of IFCs Sri Lanka Agriculture Finance Program, which aims to provide a holistic solution to bridge an estimated agriculture financing gap of US$ 2     b  illio  n. The Program would consist of the following components:    1. Capacity development of Participating Financial Institutions (PFIs): on agri value chain financing and development of related products    2. Awareness creation: modern, efficient practices to enhance quality and productivity among agri-value chain players    3. Risk mitigation: introduction of agri insurance products and climate smart agricultural practices    4. Improve enabling environment: working on policy measures to improve the enabling environment in line with Governments Vision 2025    5. Funding: provide funding to chosen PFIs to lend to agri value chain players    To achieve this IFC will work closely with the World Bank, government stake holders and private sector partners.</narrative>
