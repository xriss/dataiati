The overall goal of the project is to development community stewardship for human-elephant coexistence (HECx) by diversifying livelihood opportunities, strengthening use of HEC mitigation tools such as electric fences and street lights, establishing a value chain approach for unpalatable cash crops, and launching community outreach programs in the eastern sector of the park to increase the tolerance of local communities for wild elephants. Specific project activities include: 1) tourism homestay workshop, training, and promotion in HEC-prone areas; 2) electric fencing and street light provisioning; 3) procurement and training of elephant immobilization equipment to wildlife technicians and mobility support to HEC rapid response teams; 4) scoping study of fire wood species and production of seedlings and plantations; 5) provision of seed money for two agricultural cooperatives in unpalatable crops and business training for farmers; 6) agricultural extension for unpalatable essential oil crops such as mentha, chamomile, and lemongrass; 7) conservation education classes at community schools; and 8) workshop with journalists to broadcast elephant conservation stories.

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">U.S. assistance to Nepal is focused on achieving a more democratic, prosperous, and resilient country that respects the rule of law. Investment in Nepal&apos;s peace process, accountability in democratic institutions, civic participation, and improved policy and performance will result in more effective governance and increased political inclusion. Following the devastating April 2015 earthquake, the United States committed to supporting Nepal&apos;s longer-term recovery. FY 2017 resources will be used in the following six key areas prioritized by the Government of Nepal (GON) and other donors through the June 2015 Post Disaster Needs Assessment (PDNA): (1) housing and infrastructure; (2) livelihoods and food security; (3) re-establishing health and education services; (4) protecting vulnerable populations; (5) local governance; and (6) disaster risk management. In September 2015, Nepal promulgated a new constitution-a key step in finalizing the peace process that began in 2006 after a decade-long conflict. Political developments in Nepal offer new opportunities for U.S. democracy and governance programs, which focus on building government capacity to deliver services and strengthening civil society, local governance, and public financial management. U.S. assistance also seeks to improve the inclusion of women and historically marginalized groups in government, civil society, and the economy. Additionally, U.S. assistance facilitates the country&apos;s &apos;relief to development&apos; transition from a post-disaster environment to a stable democracy. U.S. assistance will help address key development challenges through programs that include: strengthening and expanding the public health system through the President&apos;s Global Health Initiative (GHI); improving nutrition and raising incomes of the rural poor through the President&apos;s Global Hunger and Food Security Initiative, Feed the Future (FTF); building resilience to changing climate conditions through the President&apos;s Global Climate Change Initiative (GCCI); safeguarding the country&apos;s rich biodiversity; building the foundation for education by improving early grade reading skills; strengthening the rule of law; preventing trafficking in persons; strengthening border security; and building the capacity of law enforcement officers. These combined efforts promote resilience and reduce Nepal&apos;s susceptibility to environmental shocks and societal stressors.</narrative>
