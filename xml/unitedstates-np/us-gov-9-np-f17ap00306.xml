   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This award strives to conserve biodiversity and manage natural resources in ways that maintain their long-term viability and preserve their potential to meet the needs of present and future generations. Activities include combating illegal and corrupt exploitation of natural resources and the control of invasive species. This includes This project, developed in collaboration with local communities and the Koshi Tappu Wildlife Reserve (KTWR) located in the eastern Terai landscape of Nepal, aims to initiate conservation activities to ensure the long-term survival of wild Asian elephants and their coexistence with humans in this region. Project objectives include monitoring of Asian elephants, reduction of human-elephant conflict (HEC), outreach and education centered on elephant conservation and HEC, and promotion of alternative livelihoods in HEC-prone areas. Specific project activities include: 1) collection and analysis of dung DNA to estimate the elephant population size in KTWR; 2) formation and training of a community-based HEC response team (CBHEC) including two members from each of 14 Buffer Zone Community Forest (BZCF) groups; 3) CBHEC team monitoring wild elephants and collection of HEC data; 4) promotion of alternative livelihoods such as fish farming to HEC-affected and marginalized groups; 5) development of awareness and education materials and conducting an awareness program via local media including FM radio, street dramas, and sign boards; and 6) human-elephant coexistence (HECx) training delivery to 14 BZCF groups with 35 participants per training; 7) HECx training for 10 local journalists, 40 army personnel, local grade 9-10 school students; and 8) an exposure visit for the CBHEC response team and KTWR staff to Chitwan and Bardia National Parks to observe successful HEC mitigation measures employed in these parks. This project will contribute to the long-term survival and conservation of wild Asian elephants in Nepal by addressing the relatively new and increasing problem of HEC in the Eastern Nepal landscape. This award is provisionally approved for two phases or years of funding, with each phase or year&#x2019;s funding dependent upon performance and financial management of the previous phase or year, meeting technical and financial reporting requirements, and availability of ASECF funds..</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">U.S. assistance to Nepal is focused on achieving a more democratic, prosperous, and resilient country that respects the rule of law. Investment in Nepal&apos;s peace process, accountability in democratic institutions, civic participation, and improved policy and performance will result in more effective governance and increased political inclusion. Following the devastating April 2015 earthquake, the United States committed to supporting Nepal&apos;s longer-term recovery. FY 2017 resources will be used in the following six key areas prioritized by the Government of Nepal (GON) and other donors through the June 2015 Post Disaster Needs Assessment (PDNA): (1) housing and infrastructure; (2) livelihoods and food security; (3) re-establishing health and education services; (4) protecting vulnerable populations; (5) local governance; and (6) disaster risk management. In September 2015, Nepal promulgated a new constitution-a key step in finalizing the peace process that began in 2006 after a decade-long conflict. Political developments in Nepal offer new opportunities for U.S. democracy and governance programs, which focus on building government capacity to deliver services and strengthening civil society, local governance, and public financial management. U.S. assistance also seeks to improve the inclusion of women and historically marginalized groups in government, civil society, and the economy. Additionally, U.S. assistance facilitates the country&apos;s &apos;relief to development&apos; transition from a post-disaster environment to a stable democracy. U.S. assistance will help address key development challenges through programs that include: strengthening and expanding the public health system through the President&apos;s Global Health Initiative (GHI); improving nutrition and raising incomes of the rural poor through the President&apos;s Global Hunger and Food Security Initiative, Feed the Future (FTF); building resilience to changing climate conditions through the President&apos;s Global Climate Change Initiative (GCCI); safeguarding the country&apos;s rich biodiversity; building the foundation for education by improving early grade reading skills; strengthening the rule of law; preventing trafficking in persons; strengthening border security; and building the capacity of law enforcement officers. These combined efforts promote resilience and reduce Nepal&apos;s susceptibility to environmental shocks and societal stressors.</narrative>
