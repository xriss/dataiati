  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The purpose of this project is to conduct capacity building programs within local communities in the Chitwan-Parsa protected area complex of the Terai Landscape, Nepal. Project activities will include: 1) implement a community-based elephant monitoring system, which will include an inception workshop, formation and training of rapid response teams in four buffer zone user groups, data collection and management of the data in a database maintained at NTNC&#x2019;s Biodiversity Conservation Center at Chitwan National Park; 2) establish a community-based early warning system using elephant data collected by the rapid response teams which will be disseminated to communities via loudspeakers, a mobile phone/group SMS alert, and an FM-radio program; 3) conduct awareness campaigns, which will include local-language poster and brochure development and distribution, a short documentary film on human-elephant co-existence, awareness camps in communities with high risks of HEC, school elephant conservation education programs, and weekly FM-radio elephant conservation programs; 4) increase tolerance of local residents for elephants by the creation of an emergency relief fund to provide financial relief to victims of death, injury, property, crop, or livestock loss caused by wild elephants, and by the provision of a crop insurance scheme. This project, to be implemented jointly by NTNC and the Department of National Parks and Wildlife Conservation along with the local buffer zone management committees, will benefit both local communities as well as wild elephants by informing locals of elephant movement, status, and causes of conflict, encouraging communities to take responsibility for HEC-mitigation measures and reduce animosity towards wild elephants by providing emergency relief funds in the event of crop loss and property damage.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">U.S. assistance to Nepal is focused on achieving a more democratic, prosperous, and resilient country that respects the rule of law. Investment in Nepal&apos;s peace process, accountability in democratic institutions, civic participation, and improved policy and performance will result in more effective governance and increased political inclusion. Following the devastating April 2015 earthquake, the United States committed to supporting Nepal&apos;s longer-term recovery. FY 2017 resources will be used in the following six key areas prioritized by the Government of Nepal (GON) and other donors through the June 2015 Post Disaster Needs Assessment (PDNA): (1) housing and infrastructure; (2) livelihoods and food security; (3) re-establishing health and education services; (4) protecting vulnerable populations; (5) local governance; and (6) disaster risk management. In September 2015, Nepal promulgated a new constitution-a key step in finalizing the peace process that began in 2006 after a decade-long conflict. Political developments in Nepal offer new opportunities for U.S. democracy and governance programs, which focus on building government capacity to deliver services and strengthening civil society, local governance, and public financial management. U.S. assistance also seeks to improve the inclusion of women and historically marginalized groups in government, civil society, and the economy. Additionally, U.S. assistance facilitates the country&apos;s &apos;relief to development&apos; transition from a post-disaster environment to a stable democracy. U.S. assistance will help address key development challenges through programs that include: strengthening and expanding the public health system through the President&apos;s Global Health Initiative (GHI); improving nutrition and raising incomes of the rural poor through the President&apos;s Global Hunger and Food Security Initiative, Feed the Future (FTF); building resilience to changing climate conditions through the President&apos;s Global Climate Change Initiative (GCCI); safeguarding the country&apos;s rich biodiversity; building the foundation for education by improving early grade reading skills; strengthening the rule of law; preventing trafficking in persons; strengthening border security; and building the capacity of law enforcement officers. These combined efforts promote resilience and reduce Nepal&apos;s susceptibility to environmental shocks and societal stressors.</narrative>
