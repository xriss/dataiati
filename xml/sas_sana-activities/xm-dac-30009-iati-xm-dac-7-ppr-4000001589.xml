   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Small Arms Survey&#x2019;s Security Assessment in North Africa (SANA) is a multi-year project that began in 2012 following the Arab uprisings and the spread of armed conflicts and civil wars in North Africa. It aims to support actors engaged in building a more secure environment in North Africa and the neighbouring Sahel-Sahara region. The project produces timely, evidence-based research and analysis on the availability and circulation of small arms, the dynamics of armed groups, the trajectories of conflicts, and related insecurity. It aims to enhance knowledge on small arms trafficking, armed violence, armed actors, and related measures and programmes. The project&#x2019;s main beneficiaries are policy-makers in both the region and the international community, practitioners, researchers, and journalists engaged in the region. The first phase of the SANA project (from November 2012 to June 2015) established SANA as a primary source of reliable information, analysis, and training on small arms and armed violence issues in North Africa and the Sahel. Following the positive external evaluation of Phase 1, the Netherlands decided to fund about 60 per cent of the budget for SANA Phase 2, which was implemented from July 2015 to December 2018. During this period, SANA published, translated, and disseminated 20 outputs and publications (Other donors have provided supplementary funding, including the governments of Canada, Switzerland, and the United States.) An external evaluator produced a positive assessment of SANA Phase 2 in July 2018, concluding that &#x2018;stakeholders highly value SANA&#x2019;s research for the contributions it has made to their understanding of security issues in North Africa, and in some cases say SANA&#x2019;s work has changed their policies and behaviors.&#x2019; These results led the Netherlands Ministry of Foreign Affairs to decide to fund a Phase 3 of the SANA project from July 2018 to June 2021. The purpose of this Narrative Report is to summarise and report on the activities and research of the first year of SANA III, funded by the Netherlands Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Project No. 4000001589), covering the period 1 July 2018 until 30 June 2019.</narrative>
