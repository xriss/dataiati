   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In virtually all countries, people increasingly rely on and expect a diverse range of digital services (e.g., through their mobile devices) to interact with local governments, companies, and community organizations and services. As noted in Strategy 2030, this change is also happening in humanitarian assistance. Yet, the Digital Divide remains a persistent and significant challenge at both national and local levels. 
 The need for a successful and large-scale Digital Transformation is urgent. In fact, digital transformation is prioritized as one of seven transformations identified by the IFRC as required to confront the next decade&#x2019;s main challenges. The IFRC&#x2019;s Strategy 2030 highlights that effective integration of data analytics and digital technology, skills, and digital culture enables the network to harness its collective intelligence, multiply its impact, and democratize access to information. It goes accompanied with a competitive advantage &#x2013; with better information, we are able to more accurately and more timely present the needs of the most vulnerable to donors, governments and the private sector, providing them with the assurance that their resources when partnering with RCRC are well spent. The Covid-19 crisis in particular has emphasized the importance of building data and digital capacity to enable us to keep track of the rapidly shifting vulnerabilities within the population. 
Digital Transformation is not only highlighted in the IFRC Strategy 2030, but also in the IFRC COVID Emergency appeal (latest revision, No3). The global pandemic has accelerated the need to scale-up data and digital transformation under the &#x2018;new normal&#x2019;. The IFRC COVID emergency appeal therefore mentions digital transformation as one of the three enabling actions.</narrative>
