   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Almost the whole population of the Gaza Strip, two million people, are negatively affected by ongoing deficits and needs in the WASH sector. This includes 983.623 women and 991.428 children, who are exposed to public health risks associated to poor water quality (97% of water from Gaza&#x2019;s sole aquifer is unfit for human consumption), poor wastewater collection and treatment, lack of stormwater infrastructure and lack of proper hygiene practices. This is compounded by the lack of electricity. Today Gaza&#x2019;s residents receive eight hours of electricity at a time, followed by an eight-hour power cut. As a direct consequence of the shortage in electricity, the operational capacity to run Gaza&#x2019;s public services dropped dramatically at the municipal level, especially across crucial sectors, such as water and sanitation. 

Water and sanitation infrastructure in health facilities has deteriorated to the point that clinics have frequently had to shut down. The added pressure on the healthcare system from the spread of COVID-19 heightens healthcare facilities&#x2019; need for continuous and safe water, sanitation and hygiene materials. Without proper access to water, sanitation and hygiene, the ability of health care workers to carry out proper infection prevention and control measures, and provide even basic, routine services, is greatly compromised.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The operational strategy is articulated through the following outcomes:
Outcome 1: Improved access to safe water through new construction or rehabilitation of the current water infrastructure within PRCS Health Care Facilities (HCFs).
Outcome 2: Access to sanitation infrastructure is provided for patients and staff in PRCS HCFs, including waste water networks and stormwater drainage systems.
Outcome 3: Solid waste infrastructure in PRCS HCFs is rehabilitated and upgraded, including collection, treatment and disposal.
Outcome 4: PRCS Health Care Facilities have increased capacities to manage their WASH infrastructure, including WASH in Emergency preparedness and response.
Outcome 5: PRCS health staff is enabled to implement infection prevention and control (IPC) measures and facilities are provided with essential IPC supplies and equipment.
Outcome 6: Solar panels are installed to ensure continuous renewable energy supply in Al-Quds Hospital.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project will contribute to PRCS&#x2019;s and NLRC&#x2019;s strategy by enhancing the provision of quality basic WASH services in health care institutions. This project will work on mitigating threats and improving preparedness for potential outbreaks. The project envisages rehabilitation of the WASH facilities and instalment of solar panels in the four primary health care clinics (PHCC) and two hospitals of PRCS in Gaza. The project will improve the access and sustainability of quality WASH and Health services for an average of 300.000 people served annually by the four PHCC and two hospitals.</narrative>
