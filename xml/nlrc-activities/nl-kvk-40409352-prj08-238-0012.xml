   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Since 16 September 2015, after the Hungarian authorities closed the border with Serbia, people on the move started arriving in Croatia. The total arrivals until January 2016 is 623,068. Due to the high influx of people into Croatia, the Croatian Ministry of Interior set up a temporary reception centre in Opatovac on 21 September 2015. With the weather conditions deteriorating, a decision was made by the Croatian authorities to set up a new winter reception camp on 3 November in Slavonski Brod while the one in Opatovac was put on stand-by.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Croatian Red Cross teams were providing assistance to the migrants in the Reception Camp by distributing food and water, non-food and hygiene items 24 hours a day, seven days a week, including provision of protection activities, screening and referrals of the migrants and refugees immediately upon their arrival into the camp, referrals to the Government-managed medical clinic, provision of basic psycho-social support as well as restoring of family links services (RFL).</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The beneficiaries were refugees and migrants from Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq as well as from other countries in transit through Croatia on the Balkans migratory trail with an emphasis on women, children, disabled persons and unaccompanied minors. As most of the target population were in transit at that time rather than staying in the camp, the Croatian Red Cross focused its assistance on the most vulnerable migrants, especially pregnant women, families with babies, small children and unaccompanied minors including a small portion of vulnerable men. During the operation the total arrivals in Croatia amounted to 623,068 people.</narrative>
