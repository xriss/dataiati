   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Activities under Result 1: 
A 1.1.1 Conduct a natural resource mapping and feasibility studies for better land use planning and
implementation (as a baseline).
A 1.1.2 Set up and train community based natural resources management (CBNRM) groups to develop and follow up on CBNRM plans based on participatory assessments.
A 1.1.3 Conduct awareness campaigns to all stakeholders on implications of climate change and
climate variability as well as the available of early warning information sources and relevant early action
A 1.1.4 Facilitate exchange of knowledge and good practices (Case studies) on natural resource
management and CCA between communities.
A 1.1.5 Carry out capacity building of local partner (SRCS) on climate change adaptation (CCA), NRM and project management.

Activities under Result 2: 
A1.2.1 Support the establishment/improvement (esp. targeting women), of nurseries to support rehabilitation of communal farmland, forests and home gardens as IGA.
A 1.2.2 Rehabilitate/expand/establish community forest and/or shelterbelts and windbreaks (depending on relevance and feasibility).
A 1.2.3 Construct/rehabilitate water harvesting structures for reforestation, water conservation and
other water provision facilities for subsistence/communal /small-scale farmers and
farmland to adapt to the variation in climate change.
A 1.2.4 Provide training to community water committees on operation and maintenance of water
structures and energy facilities.
A 1.2.5 Enhance the household flexibility and resilience to handle climate change and external stresses and shocks by a range of gender-sensitive enhancement initiatives, e.g. access to credit/loan as IGA (VSLA), as identified in the NRM assessments
A 1.2.6 To cope with climate changes and combat desertification, provide support to local government agriculture, forestry and veterinary extension services and research centers to reach out to the target communities for training on agriculture techniques, applying smart agricultural approach principles adapted to climate change and the sustainable management of
natural resources through field schools /demonstration plots.

Activities under Result 3: 
A 1.3.1 Increase available irrigation water through the maintenance of existing boreholes and improving equipment and installations using solar power energy.
A 1.3.2 Promote the use of improved/alternative solutions for cooking, such as fuel-efficient stoves or biogas, making use of revolving fund or IGA development for sustainability.
A 1.3.3 Conduct community awareness campaign and facilitate exchange of knowledge and good practices on the use of renewable energy between communities through exchange visits.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Co-funding PMF EUR 480,000.

To contribute to the strengthening of local communities&apos; resilience and sustainable livelihoods&apos; to better respond to and cope with climate change: 
The overall objective of the proposed action is in line with the objective of the European Union (EU) GCCA+ programme, aiming at reducing communities&#x2019; vulnerability to climate change. The action will contribute to an increase of income at household level in targeted communities, gained from sustainable, adapted farming and pastoralism and/or alternative Income Generating Activities (IGA)s. This increase of income is used as a proxy indicator for resilience.

NLRC lead in partnership with SRCS, Danish RC, Swedish RC and Spanish RC</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The population of rural areas in Sudan largely relies on livelihoods that are directly depending on natural resources, the main ones being agriculture (mainly rain-fed but also small-scale and mechanized irrigated farming), agro-pastoralism and pastoralism. The already fragile conditions posed by the geographic location of the country within the Sudano-Sahelian and sub-Saharan African zone (such as short variable erratic rainy seasons, arid lands and sparse vegetative cover), are further challenged by changing climatic conditions and degradation of natural resources. In combination with low adaptive capacity these developments negatively affect the productivity of the key livelihoods, thus directly impacting people&#x2019;s food security and financial capacity. Within Sudan, the arid and semi-arid States of Northern, River Nile and Kassala are amongst the most vulnerable States to the impact of climate change.</narrative>

  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">To avoid a dispersion of resources and maximize impact, in each of the three States one target locality has been selected: El Golid locality in Northern; Shendi locality in River Nile; Telkouk locality in Kassala State. Selection criteria included the current level of degradation of natural resources (e.g. of forest, farm and rangeland; sand dune development), market accessibility (as a factor that influences opportunities for IGAs), presences of other programmes and initiatives (seeking complementarity, avoiding duplication) and accessibility (avoiding too remote locations to facilitate project implementation and monitoring).</narrative>
