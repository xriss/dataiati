   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Now that the renovation of the top floor has been completed, there is more space to organize activities. To support these activities, PRCS has a great need for all kinds of new materials with which the children can play when they visit the center, both indoors and outdoors. This includes table tennis tables, outdoor toys, a bouncy castle and dressing up clothes.</narrative>

Furthermore to provide a safe place for the community members that they can use and where they can benefit from multiple activities for all ages and gender.

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The center is situated in the Old City nearby Al-Ibrahimi Mosque. It serves different people in direct contact areas with settlers in order to support them psychologically, improve their personal qualifications, minimize the possibility of any suspected crisis, help the targeted group to be happy, and encourage the children to enjoy their childhood by providing a safe space for playing at the center. This space gives the children the chance to speak about their emotions and thoughts, helping them to minimize negative coping strategies by raising their self-confidence, and through strengthening the relationship between children and their parents. 

The upper floor of the community center was rehabilitated with support from the Netherlands Red Cross. A library and training rooms are now available for the community in general and the Old City residents in specific, in order to provide many extracurricular activities for the children and to provide books and games with the possibility of borrowing them.</narrative>
