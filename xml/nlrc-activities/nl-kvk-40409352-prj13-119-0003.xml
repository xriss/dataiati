  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Contribution of the 3FM SR 2020 and 2021 COVID Campaign to ZRCS for COVID-19 intervention, and to the health care system in Zambia. Under the main focus of &#x201C;Help the Helpers&#x201D;,  the main strategy will be to support health care workers, Red Cross volunteers/staff, within the COVID-19 response under the protection, care and support e.g. IPC knowledge, PPEs; but also, PSS. Necessary tools will be provided to ensure good care and support such as medical Supplies &amp; equipment, IPC and related training.
Besides prevention work will be built in to support the overall aim of decreasing morbidity and mortality due to COVID-19. This includes more prevention at a community level, better access to care and higher healthcare-seeking behavior (e.g. reducing barriers such as stigma, fears addressing PSS and RCCE); and better care at Health facilities. 
Overall support to National Society Development (NSD) is important for continuity/sustainability.  The National Society will implement the project around three (3) pillars, building on what has been set up and areas that capacity and expertise exists already;</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The 4 target districts Solwezi, Kitwe, Livingstone and Chirundu are at-risk districts because of the geographical location and the state of infrastructure, the recent health update showed that the cases of covid-19 in the four districts were steadily rising, posing a huge risk of affecting many people</narrative>
  </description>
  <description type="3">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project target will include; heath staff, volunteers, covid patients and families, people with chronic diseases and the general public. The project will target the 4 districts which have the following population
1.	Kitwe 517543
2.	Livingstone 139509
3.	Chirundu 47 344
4.	Solwezi 254 470
Total  958,866  people
Based on resources available and capacity ZRCS will target 40% as direct beneficiaries = 383.546 people, whereas the remaining 60% will be targeted as the indirect population of 575,320 people. Of those, the project will target 50% females and 50%, males. 
The project will target at least 80 volunteers, 20 from each district.
Beneficiaries will be selected in line with set criteria including age brackets. The beneficiary&#x2019;s selection will include health staff, community leaders, branches and CBOs. Gender mainstreaming and consideration will be included at all levels of the project implementation. A needs assessment with a gender and inclusion lens is the first step in providing humanitarian assistance that is effective, safe and restores dignity</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project will be implemented within the communities of Solwezi district (North-western province), Kitwe district  (Copperbelt), Chirundu district  (Lusaka province) and Livingstone (Southern province). Solwezi and Kitwe are more mining and en route border towns linking Zambia to the DRC with the heavy traffic flow of goods (imports and exports) while Chirundu and Livingstone are more on crop agriculture, tourism, fishing and are also border towns with heavy traffic flows to neighbouring Zimbabwe.  The location of the target districts possesses a huge risk of covid-19 transmission.</narrative>
