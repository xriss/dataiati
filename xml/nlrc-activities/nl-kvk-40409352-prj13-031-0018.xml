   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Although all IDPs are in need of immediate assistance, priority shall be given to 13,000 people or 2,600 displaced households (25% of total caseload) who lost their entire belongings and livelihoods and remain in Jigjiga, as well as to the most affected households in Kebri Beyahe, Deghabur and Gode as detailed in Table 1 below. Special attention will also be given to women headed households with many children, the elderly, the disabled and critically sick and the injured people. In addition, those who have not received any support from ERCS, the government, UN agencies or any humanitarian agencies so far will be targeted by the intended Movement partner&#x2019;s humanitarian assistance.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Currently, the critical needs identified are emergency food, water, shelter, non-food items as well as emergency health and care including psychosocial support. Out of the estimated 52,000 affected people, 50% are still living in temporary shelters in churches and around military camp in Jijiga, Degehabour, Kebri Dahar and Gode.

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Since September 2017, over 1.2 million people have been internally displaced mainly along the Somali-Oromia borders, due to conflict. These people are still suffering due to a lack of basic services and facilities such as shelter, water and health care. In addition, localized inter-communal conflict has also been claiming lives of many people, damaging property, belongings and livelihoods in Moyale Somali and other parts of the country. Since 18th April 2018, there has been growing tension and conflict in the region following a significant political, social and economic reform the Federal government is implementing all over the country.
Since 4th August 2018, there have been ethnic clashes between Somali and non-Somali ethnic groups in the Somali region of Ethiopia. The clashes have turned into widespread violence causing at least 52,000 people being internally displaced in Jijiga, Kebri Dehar, Degehabur and Gode towns.
These clashes have disrupted the local markets with business centres shutting down and traders closing their businesses due to the insecurity. The closure of market and economic activities will, as such, result in further deterioration of food insecurity in affected communities. According to Voice of America; Amharic service dated 7th August 2018, the Somali Jijiga University with 9,000 students has also been affected by the market disruptions, as students are now unable to access food and other basic services.
In Jigjiga, one of the most affected towns of these inter-communal tensions, at least 10,000 internally displaced people (IDPs) are reported to have gone back to their partially damaged houses not because they are safe but to escape extreme cold and heat weather -- temperature ranges between 18 degrees centigrade to 45 degrees centigrade in the</narrative>
