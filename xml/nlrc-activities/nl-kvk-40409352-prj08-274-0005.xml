   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In January 2016, a yellow fever outbreak was detected and confirmed in Angola, Southern Africa. Yellow fever is an acute viral haemorrhagic disease transmitted by infected mosquitoes. There are an estimated 130,000 cases of yellow fever reported yearly, causing 44,000 deaths worldwide each year, with 90 percent occurring in Africa. Following cross-border population movement from Angola into neighbouring countries, exported cases were reported in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). On 23 March 2016, the DRC Ministry of Health (MoH) declared an official yellow fever outbreak, with a total of 39 imported cases from Angola reported in Kongo Central and Kinshasa provinces.</narrative>
