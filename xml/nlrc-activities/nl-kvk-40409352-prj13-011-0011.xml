   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Vanuatu - Tropical Storm Donna</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">On 2 May 2017, the Fiji Meteorological Service provided an early alert for a tropical disturbance (TD21F) forming to the north of Vanuatu. Over the ensuing 24 hours TD21F continued to strengthen and by midnight on 3 May 2017 had developed into Tropical Cyclone Donna (TC Donna), a Category 1 system. Moving in a westerly direction, TC Donna passed north of the Vanuatu group as a Category 3 cyclone within 50-100km of the Torres Islands in Torba Province.
The system continued west before turning south and passing to the west of Sanma, Malampa and Shefa Provinces. TC Donna was later classified as a Category 5 cyclone by the Vanuatu Meterology and Geohazards Department as it tracked southwards towards New Caledonia sustaining wind speeds of over 215km/hr. The NDMO issued an all clear on 9 May 2017. TC Donna continued towards New Caledonia and was downgraded to a Tropical Low on 11 May 2017.
The main impact of TC Donna has been felt in the Torba Province, especially the Torres Island group which has an estimated population of 1,022 and comprises the islands of Hiu, Metoma (an uninhabited islet), Tegua, Ngwel (an uninhabited islet), Linua, Loh and Toga. In Situation Report 02 issued on 5 May 2017, the Government of the Republic of Vanuatu NDMO reported a Red Alert in place for Torba province with destructive winds and flash flooding. The cyclone knocked out the Torres island group&#x2019;s only cellphone tower and caused widespread damage. On 6 May 2017, the NDMO contacted the islands, using the Torres Islands Red Cross VHF radio, and established that while there were no reported injuries, there had been widespread destruction of buildings and crops.
Situation Report 03 of the Government of the Republic of Vanuatu NDMO issued on 6 May 2017 reported a significant number of houses destroyed and the majority of houses damaged across the islands of Torres. There has also been damage to schools, churches, water tanks and water sources. Most toilets have been destroyed and crops have been damaged. Authorities in the Torres Islands reported that there was enough food to last for approximately two weeks, however water sources were contaminated.
The cyclone has also caused damage in the more populated Banks group of islands (also within the Torba Province), with strong winds and localised flooding reported, causing destruction of crops.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The objective of the DREF operation is two-fold:
1. To assist the most affected population of the Northern Islands of Vanuatu with:
&#xF0B7; a blanket distribution of basic shelter and WASH NFIs;
&#xF0B7; the provision of clean, safe water.
2. To replenish NFIs distributed in the response in preparation for any future disaster response</narrative>
