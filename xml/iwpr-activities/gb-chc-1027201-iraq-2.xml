   <narrative xml:lang="EN">&apos;Women on the Frontline&apos; programme - IWPR worked to strengthen women-led civil society groups in multiple countries in the MENA region. Additionally, we were able to provide support and training for 21 groups across the region. In-person training included psychosocial and advocacy support for a group of 14 Yazidi female ISIS survivors. Online training and mentoring also supported two social media campaigns in Arabic, Kurdish and English on the safe return of Yezidi women and UN commitments on women, peace and security.</narrative>
