   <narrative xml:lang="EN">UNHCRs priorities for the CERF allocation in support to persons with disabilities are to provide life-saving and life-sustaining protection engagements and basic infrastructure upgrades to specifically address the needs of vulnerable displaced people with disabilities in Syria. To complement activities in Al-Hol camp funded through the CERF Underfunded allocation, UNHCR implement engagements in camp and non-camp locations in all CERF prioritised governorates in Syria with a focus on north-east Syria, an area with heightened needs. The continuous multi-sector support including improving access for persons with disabilities, particularly for those residing in north-east camps is crucial to maintain the safety, health, and dignity of those displaced to last resort sites.  

The proposed protection engagements under this allocation focus on providing integrated services and support to people with disabilities and their care givers either at community centres, or through outreach volunteers who are trained to provide caregivers information on home-based care techniques and counselling. In addition, and where assessed to be necessary, medical in-kind assistance including assistive devices and other medical in-kind items will be provided to persons with disabilities to enable them to lead dignified lives. 

Complementary to this, UNHCR are improving access for people with disabilities to community and communal facilities such as community centres, PHCs, and public spaces etc., to enhance safety, security and improve the protection environment in Syria. The infrastructure upgrades are planned to take place in camp- and non-camp locations in all CERF prioritized governorates. However, the north-east is prioritized as an area with particularly high needs and lacking some of the most basic infrastructure. 

Through these protection and shelter/infrastructure upgrades engagements, UNHCR aims to target around 50,000 people with disabilities with inclusive response taking into account their specific needs.</narrative>
