  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Multi-sectoral approaches reflect the interconnected needs of children and emphasize all humanitarian actors&#x2019; collective responsibility to protect children and their families. Focused, specialized child protection interventions are critical for protecting children. However, no single sector that operates in a crisis has the knowledge, skills, and resources to fully prevent risks, respond to children&#x2019;s protection needs and promote. GSF shall provide community-based comprehensive child protection services for 16,200 (Men: 190, women: 260, boys: 6,520 and girls: 9,230) conflict-affected women and children and 800 (men: 73, women: 182, boys: 257 and Girls: 288) people living with disability in Borno, Adamawa, and Yobe (BAY) states, across 5 LGAs. GSF project team will reach these direct project beneficiaries with comprehensive case management and MHPSS intervention by coordinating for referral to WASH, Education, and Health Services. The overall target shall benefit from campaigns to prevent sexual exploitation amp abuse and GBV prevention.  We shall work closely with WaSH and health partners on the ground to provide children with access to WASH and health facilities during CFS and in schools. 

The five  LGAs targeted for this project include MMC, Jere, Mubi North, Mubi South, Damaturu, in BAY state respectively which are priority sector areas for the allocations. 

The promotion of the well-being of the children, women, and people living with disabilities will be at the heart of this intervention.  GSF will use its safeguarding policies, procedures, and practices to ensure that the intervention is safe for the inclusive participation of these targets beneficiaries.  Protecting the children and adolescents from harm by creating awareness on PSEA and mitigating the risks of harm during the process of planning, implementing and monitoring will be imperative. GSF will ensure compliance with the code of conduct for its own staff and other partners to ensure the safety of the participating children and adolescents.  

The caseload will be documented and updated using the IA forms and CPIMS primero for the data storage by a dedicated CPIMS officer assisted by caseworkers and designated gadgets such as laptop, tablet, and external hard drive with an iCloud backup storage facility.

GSF will promote gender equality and equity in the design, implementation, and monitoring of this project. The specific needs and priorities of children based on age and gender will be identified through focused group discussions during the identification and profiling of the children. This project will be implemented by community actors who may be both beneficiaries as well as stakeholders. GSF will take steps to work with the community in order to build in activities that will contribute to the sustainability of some aspects of the project. Throughout the project, GSF will be working to continuously build a strong partnership and collaboration with the MWASD welfare officers and other local actors such as religious and traditional leaders at the community and camp level.

GSF also has a strong institutional capacity with internal controls systems which will ensure program quality assurance and efficiency to manage this partnership. GSF has benefitted from a series of training that supports strengthening it is financial management system as well as the governance structure. This has helped GSF to greatly improve its financial reporting using Quickbook, monitoring of the project as well as risk management. 

GSF has a strong field presence in Borno, Adamawa state of northeast Nigeria. GSF is also associated with a wide network of local women groups and youth in the host communities and IDP camps. GSF has strong connections among traditional, religious community leaders and key government institutions which it uses for advocacy to enhance the service promotion and accountability to the affected population.</narrative>
