   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Within Nigeria, the continuing conflict still severely affects millions of people, subjecting them to displacement, impoverishment and threat of violence. According to Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP- 2021), 8.7 million people are in need. More than 1.9 million  Internal Displaced Persons (IDPs) are victims of this severe humanitarian crisis in Borno State. IDPs are  refugees in Host Communities, informal settlements and in camps where populations are sharing basic services and resources already restricted.

WASH needs have increased in Nigeria, linked mainly to a large-scale influx of displacement and in a more complex way, to COVID-19 Outbreak. 2.8 million people in North-East Nigeria need equitable, safe and secured access to water supply, sanitation facilities and dignified hygiene. Due to various factors, high pressure has been observed in already limited water points and sanitation facilities, creating a favorable context for waterborne diseases. The current situation indicates that basic WASH SHPERE Standard cannot be respected, with 1.02 million people receiving less than 15 L of water per day.

As one of the major WASH implementing partners, SI will complement its ongoing multi-sectoral activities with additional WASH activities to address the most critical life-saving needs by providing sustainable and resilient comprehensive WASH services in Ngala Local Governmental Areas (LGA). SI built the proposed project on four (4) main outputs:

-	Access to safe, dignify and clean water, sanitation and hygiene services for IDPs and Host Communities in Ngala LGA is improved &#x2013; through the rehabilitation of water points and the training/support of Water Management Committees. 

-	Access to sanitation facilities and to a healthy environment in conflict- and epidemic-affected areas &#x2013; Ngala LGA &#x2013; is improved. SI plans the construction, rehabilitation and desludgment of sanitation facilities. 
-	Target population is aware of key Public Health risks and able to apply adapted hygiene practices in Ngala LGA. SI proposes to disseminate hygiene messages focused on COVID-19 and Menstrual Hygiene Management (MHM). 

-	Emergency water, sanitation and cholera prevention interventions are provided to people in high-risk disaster prone areas to mitigate flooding and spread of outbreaks during rainy seasons. Finally, to mitigate Cholera Outbreak, SI will be able to deploy its preparedness and response capacity in the BAY States based on the need and in coordination with WASH cluster. In parallel, SI will have the capacity to provide emergency access to safe water and to dignified sanitation facilities. 

A total of 81,742 beneficiaries (22,070 men, 26,975 women, 15,531 boys and 17,166 girls) will be reached through the proposed program in the BAY states. 

Project Specific locations: 
In Ngala project will be implemented in Arabic, ISS and Kaigama IDP Camps and Gamboru Host Community. While emergency response will be extended to BAY state based on the needs and gaps identified by WASH clusters.</narrative>
