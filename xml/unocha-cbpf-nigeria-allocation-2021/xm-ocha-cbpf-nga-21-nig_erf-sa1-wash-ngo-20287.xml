   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Continuing Emergency WASH Assistance to Affected People in Damboa, Borno State</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">As foretold in the 2021 Humanitarian Needs Overview, the humanitarian crisis in the north-eastern Nigeria states of Borno, Adamawa and Yobe, has persisted in 2021 as one of the largest and most severe in the world. The present project aims to provide emergency WASH assistance to IDPs, returnees and host communities in Borno State, Northeast Nigeria, given special consideration to the plans of Borno State Government to close camps in MMC by December 31st 2021 and open the road linking MMC with Damboa. 

The COVID-19 pandemic has had severe effects on livelihoods and employment, especially in post-fragile, crisis and post-crisis environments. Millions have lost incomes, fail to access resources needed for day-to-day well-being, and require new skills/training or new ways of supporting their livelihoods. Communities in Borno, Adamawa, and Yobe (BAY) States in northeastern Nigeria are hit. As of 20 August, a total of 2,979 confirmed COVID-19 cases have been reported in the Bay States. In Borno 1,344 cases have been reported, 1,134 in Adamawa and 501 in Yobe, with a total of 2,900 confirmed cases discharged, and 79 reported deaths. In addition to losing livelihoods, people have had to cope with decimation of their incomes and increased food prices. For many people across the BAY States, they can no longer afford to buy food, nor have extras for lifesaving hygiene. 

Already, the Boko Haram conflict which has caused tremendous devastation across the region is now in its twelfth year. Displacement has continued to occur since. The need for sensitization of beneficiaries on Covid-19 and cholera prevention modalities is pertinent. There is a strong need for ensuring that water is continually available to the most vulnerable returnees towards meeting the minimum of 15l/p/d as is the standard. Likewise the quantity of soaps for families, as well as hand washing facilities at strategic spots within camps require being augmented to help prevent further spread of the deadly virus. Cholera cases continue to rise across the BAY states, with 95 cases including 13 deaths reported in Damboa by the Borno State Ministry of Health as at 20th September.

The project targets approximately 12000 people in communities that have not attained the minimum WaSH standards through, including children, adolescents, women, men and other vulnerable members in Damboa LGA. 

Project targets: Construction of household latrines across Damboa host community with strong community participation to support cash-for-work hence direct labour in digging, masonry work, mud-bricks making etc Intensive and sustained sensitization of beneficiaries on Covid-19 and cholera prevention in Damboa host community Observance of 3 WASH days as on calendar in Damboa mainly TFD focusing on Covid-19 awareness and cholera prevention, handwashing, etc being World Water Day (March 22nd), World Humanitarian Day (August 19th), and International Day of Handwashing (October 15th) Provision of intensive solid waste collection, transportation amp disposal mechanism across Damboa community, Operation and Maintenance of 20 hand pumps in Damboa Constitution, training and motivation of WASHCOMs, VLOMs  and Hygiene Promoters in target communities Training and support for  Women Beneficiary group of 30 on local production of MHM kits Training and support for Women Beneficiary group of 50 on soap making Provision of communal structures to mitigate flooding in informal camps Create and support children&#x2019;s hygiene promotion groups in host community with mass campaigns to boost sustainable KAP change create monthly Community-led total sanitation (CLTS) activities across Damboa host community with sanitation ambassadors.</narrative>
