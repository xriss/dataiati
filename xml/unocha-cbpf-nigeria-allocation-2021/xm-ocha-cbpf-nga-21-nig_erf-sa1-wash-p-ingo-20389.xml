   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Multi- Sectoral WASH and GBV integrated emergency response in Pulka,Borno state, LGAs NE Nigeria</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Norwegian Church Aid (NCA) has been operating in northeast Nigeria since 2017, delivering integrated humanitarian assistance in WASH, Sexual and Gender Based Violence (SGBV), and Adolescent Sexual and Reproductive Health (ASRH) in conflict-affected areas in Borno LGAs. The proposed project is a multi-sectoral WASH/GBV response that aims to meet existing gaps in the IDP camps in Gwoza/Pulka.  The proposed project is expected to reach 19,860 direct beneficiaries among which 5,784 women, 3,276 men, 6,405 girls, and 4,395 boys. The WASH project will support the decongestion process initiated by humanitarian actors in the new proposed IDP camps in Pulka by providing safe water through water trucking, latrines and showers construction, and enhanced hygiene practices among groups most at risks. NCA will ensure WASH facilities are accessible to persons with disabilities (PWD) and promote meaningful participation of women and people living with disabilities in SGBV skills acquisition and WASH Committees. In Pulka, NCA&#x2019;s Wash intervention will support GBV activities by providing drinking water and WASH facilities at safe spaces, and training of women and girls attending Women and Girls Friendly Spaces (WGFS) on hygiene promotion. As part of the GBV activities through skills acquisition, women and girls will produce bar/liquid soap to be used by WASH for hand washing and promoting hygiene. NCA will conduct integrated assessments to identify risks for women, girls and PWD to ensure they access WASH facilities and ensure WASH facilities are established in locations that promotes safety, dignity and wellbeing of women and girls. The GBV intervention will work in existing WGFS in Pulka, (Damara Camp) to increase timely access to lifesaving services. NCA will provide holistic and survivor centred GBV case management and psychosocial support services to respond to survivors needs. Clinical Management of Rape (CMR) and the provision of care kits will be strengthened along with awareness on reporting of rape cases within 72hrs. NCA has adapted and will utilize the new WHO CMR/IPV care guidelines. As the only organization that provides focused ASRH activities, NCA sees the need to strengthen adolescents programming to address the needs of adolescents in and out of school. Adolescent girls will be supported with menstrual hygiene management (MHM) kits to ensure dignified menstruation. Pregnant and lactating adolescents will be facilitated to access safe maternal health care services. The project seeks to continue the first of its kind GBV toll free line Call Centre NCA established in Maiduguri in 2020 during COVID-19, through NHF funding. This will allow NCA to provide timely remote case management, remove barriers for survivors to access safe and confidential services and increase reach. The system includes a central Call Centre, in addition to strategically placed community booths. The Call Centre currently leverages 15% contribution from NCA&#x2019;s Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs (NMFA) funding. Prevention of GBV and promotion of safe ASRH services will also be implemented under this project, in addition to awareness raising, empowerment activities and skills acquisition. Men will be engaged in a 12-week programme for at least 2 hours per week, to reduce the risk of and to mitigate consequences of GBV. The sessions will focus on sexual violence, intimate partner violence (IPV) and Child, Early and Forced Marriages (CEFM). Adolescents will be given age and gender appropriate education about SRH to capacitate them with the knowledge to improve their health and foster help-seeking behaviors. The Girl Shine program will seek to support, protect, and empower adolescent girls, by engaging vulnerable and isolated girls between the age of 12-17 years, in at least 48 sessions at WGFSs. Adolescent boys will be targeted and provided with sessions in community centres.</narrative>
