   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Reducing the widespread of diseases and building the resilience of affected population in Simari  community of Mafa Local government area of Borno state for improved health and livelihood through sustainable access to safe water, sanitation and hygiene practices</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">On the 31st of August 2021, the Borno State Ministry of Health declared a cholera outbreak in the state with 559 reported suspected cases and 43 associated deaths. As at 31st October 2021, about 60days after the declaration by the State Government, the caseload increased to 3,683 suspected cases and 145 associated deaths as contained in Borno State Ministry of health cholera outbreak situation report No.10 with the high suspected number of cases recorded by Mafa-124 and neighboring local government areas of Jere-867 and MMC-434 with 22 and 5 associated deaths respectively. 

In Simari community of Mafa local government area, there were two reported cholera-associated deaths in weeks 41 and 43, although many deaths linked with acute watery diarrhea may have occurred without documentation in the location.
Through this response, JDF will contribute to mitigating the risk of a potential cholera outbreak and also ensure capacity to respond if an outbreak was to occur. The response will improve and sustain access to WASH services in the target location prioritizing improved access to safe water through rehabilitation of two strategic broken-down water facilities. The rehabilitation will include installation of new solar pumps, repairs and or replacement of water storage facilities, replacement of tap heads at fetching points, reticulation or pipeline extension into Simari where possible, replacement of damaged solar panels and accessories, installation of lightning protection for existing and rehabilitated water facilities, water chlorination and monitoring of free residual chlorine at the facilities and household levels. Community structures like the water management committee, chlorinators will be strengthened or established to ensure the operation and maintenance of WASH infrastructures

New household latrines and bathing shelters will be constructed and existing ones rehabilitated where permissible. Handwashing stations will be installed at constructed and rehabilitated facilities and in strategic places within the community including the primary school in the location. Sanitation kits will be provided to ensure sanitation facilities are always kept clean. Waste bins will be installed and shared by household clusters. The waste bins will be maintained by an established and trained community waste management committee to promote the safe disposal of household waste.

 Door to door hygiene awareness sessions will be conducted in line with WASH Sector&#x2019;s developed hygiene promotion approaches by recruited and trained community hygiene promoters supported by the use of information, education, and communication-IEC materials as well as the provision of hygiene items including menstrual hygiene management items accessed from the WASH sector core pipeline to promote handwashing and good hygiene practices to reduce the outbreaks and widespread of acute watery diarrhea/Cholera, Malnutrition, and COVID-19. 

 Hygiene and menstrual hygiene kits will be accessed from the WASH sector Core pipeline.
The project will target 7500 men, women, boys, and girls including persons with disabilities with WASH services on a need basis prioritizing the most vulnerable based on transparent and accountable established selection criteria.
While the security situation in Borno remains fluid, it is anticipated that the relatively stable situation been experienced in Mafa LGA will allow for a smooth implementation of activities within the project time frame</narrative>
