  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In continuation of the sector support to humanitarian responses in the northeast following the UN-led coordinated response plan in BAY States, LESGO Is proposing a Nine months project to address life-threatening gaps and needs of the conflict-affected population and underserved communities in primary health care services in Madagali (Sukur Settlement, Wula and Gulak Gari) and Michika (Yaskule, Chesdewol amp Anguwan Layi) Local Government Areas (LGAs), Adamawa state, Nigeria. The design of this project is to strengthen the provision of health care services that is currently available in the selected locations, provide mobile healthcare services via teams to locations without services but accessible and making sure underserved are reached with adequate PHC services. The project will also empower local communities and service providers by working through existing structures where available, adhering to Nigerian guidelines and protocols, and empowering community stakeholders and other project&#x2019;s beneficiaries in direct service delivery. Women and children will be focused on due to the fact that they contributed to huge percentage of the People in Need from the HNO/HRP 2021. LESGO will target communities where Primary Health Care services are hampered and not fully running and also with a focus on Reproductive Health Service (SRH). Location with providers of health services not currently available in terms of numbers to cater for the overwhelming needs of target beneficiaries. 
In locations with functional health facilities but operating at limited capacity, LESGO will train staff, equip and supervise them to provide quality lifesaving reproductive health care services. LESGO will work through mobile teams by targeting areas where there is no - or limited - access to health facilities or areas hosting new arrivals. The mobile outreach team will comprise of nurses and CHEW supervised by a medical doctor, auxiliary staffs and CHVs for community mobilization, hygiene and health promotion, providing care for active patient findings and referrals to outreach sites for SRH cases (ANC and PNC clients).
Activities will focus both on the IDP camp settlement, temporary health facilities and mobile teams serving available sites. Two set of mobile teams will be set up composing of six community volunteers (CHVs) and TBAs. LESGO will provide services to areas not targeted by MoH and UNICEF activities as well as WHO hard-to-Reach teams. 
As part of a community-based and integrated approach, LESGO through community Health committee will train community health volunteers to strengthen referral networks, monitor health and nutrition, and conduct awareness raising on available services
Before actual implementation, key and critical stakeholders would be advocated to and these will include relevant government as ministries and Agencies, target LGAs as well as the traditional/community leaders of the concern communities to ensure ownership and buy in.
  Also, separate training/orientation packages for 12 CHEWs and 28TBAs including staff in BEmONC and SRH to ensure relevant approach and strategies aiming to deliver quality Integrated Management of Childhood Illnesses, Ante-Natal Care and Postnatal Care which will include Basic Emergency Obstetric and Newborn Care (BEmONC) with the support of health facilities. Community sensitization on prevention of communicable diseases (e.g. diarrhea, measles, cholera and Malaria) and GBV. These teams will work on weekly basis with an option for follow ups on patient with acute cases. These services will encompasses first line care and referrals. Complaints will be discussed during monthly meetings and reports shared with partners for effective coordination and feedbacks by the MEAL Officer in conjunction with the project consultant and Manager. This partnership will ensure mentorship of volunteers so as to sustain these services beyond the project timeline.</narrative>
