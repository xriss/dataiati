   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The situation in Northern Borno has been deteriorating for the last three years, it does not seem likely that IDPs are going to return soon to their village of origin. July 2021, IOM Displacement Tracking matrix data indicates a total of 2.191 million internally displaced people (IDPs) in North-East Nigeria of which about 74.5% are displaced in Borno State, most of them living in and around the urban area of Maiduguri, the State&#x2019;s Capital. The total number of IDPs fluctuates. While in southern Borno and in Adamawa State people are returning to their village of origin, in the rest of Borno people continue to flee from insecurity, created by attacks from BH and battles between Government Forces and BH fighters. These movements present a major humanitarian challenge as resources are often already overstretched in the locations in which these civilians arrive.

The proposed integrated project addresses the urgent WASH and Food security needs of 27,500 vulnerable IDPs and host communities in Jere and Monguno. The project will be implemented in Jere(Gongulong and 5 satellite villages (Bulamari, Gabdori, Gumsuri, Ngonari and Yerimari) and 3 camps Monguno (Fulatari, GGSS and Waterboard) are designed to address the critical unmet humanitarian needs of displaced people. The project is well-aligned with the cluster strategic response plans and the priorities of the call by strengthening the resilience of communities and contributing to efforts to address vulnerabilities and underlying structural issues. 

The project is designed with a conflict-sensitive approach concerning IDPs and host populations Specific vulnerable groups, such as female-headed households, landless people, and people with special needs will be prioritized. The project will contribute significantly to gender equality, protection concerns, and women and girls&apos; specific needs will be addressed to ensure equitable access to essential humanitarian services. Gender-balanced staff will be recruited, and women will be engaged in all consultations and distributions. Gender and disability disaggregated MampE data will be collected for implementing barrier-removing interventions. Duty of Care, Safeguarding, conflict sensitivity, Do No Harm are crosscutting elements throughout all activities of the proposed intervention. For instance, latrines are designed to include a ramp, a handrail and a raised seat for people living with disabilities and the aged. Wet feeding activities will be designed taking into consideration access risks which limit the elderly, people with chronic illness, and PWD by ensuring there are priority areas set up specifically for these groups. 

ZOA will also conduct rapid IYCF sessions with the beneficiaries on household dietary diversity and good feeding practices. The project will also set up a CRM to ensure the beneficiaries have a platform to share information on project inputs and also challenges and opportunities experienced during wet feeding.ZOA  will also set up a CRM committee where male and female representation will be 50:50 to ensure both their views are taken into consideration during the implementation process.</narrative>
