   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Strengthening Protection  Emergency Response, and Promotion of Sustainable Durable Solutions in NE Nigeria through CCCM in Selected Locations in Adamawa and Borno State.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project seeks to strengthen protection and emergency intervention and promote durable solutions through a coordinated multi-sectoral response by reinforcing CCCM activities. The intervention will be multi-sectoral, focusing on the Out of Camp Area Based Approach (ABA) approach and in prioritized camps/camp-like settings in Borno and Adamawa states. The proposed CCCM strategies have been successfully implemented in NE Nigeria. With ABA recently piloted by UNHCR and partners in Borno State (Damasak and components of interventions in Ngala and Monguno host communities), and currently rolled out to Adamawa (Yola North, Yola South, Mubi North, and Michika. On this project, CCCM activities will focus on Michika, Madagali in Adamawa and Monguno, Bama (Banki), and Mobbar in Borno. Through other sources, UNHCR will cover CCCM needs in Yola North, Mubi North, and Ngala (Gamburo host community, Kaigama camp, and Zulum camp)
 
 The authorities will be empowered to oversee the coordination of the multi-sectoral response within the designated areas under ABA. The adoption of the Out of Camp Area Based Approach has also been informed by feedback on the implementation of CCCM activities by UNHCR and partners and through input from the Protection, Shelter, NFI, and CCCM, including WASH, Health, Education and Food Security Sectors. The implementation strategy will be by establishing static CCCM teams and Roving Area Mobile (RAM) teams that will carry out monitoring and conduct community outreaches within the designated area/geographical location. 
 
 Variations in gender, ethnic origin, diversity, and age that may be wrongly applied to eliminate specific persons from accessing services and lead to vulnerability and risky coping strategies will be considered during every stage of the project life cycle.
 
 Overall, the response will focus on enhancing multi-sectoral coordination of humanitarian response, monitoring of protection and assistance, promotion of participatory approach, community organizing, promoting, and strengthening of accountability to the affected population, ensuring infrastructure improvement and to mainstream protection, Child Protection, GBV, Prevention from Sexual Exploitation and Abuse (PSEA) and other cross-cutting issues like COVID 19 into CCCM for improved living conditions, and durable solutions of the affected populations. Below are some of the proposed activities that UNHCR and partners will implement.
