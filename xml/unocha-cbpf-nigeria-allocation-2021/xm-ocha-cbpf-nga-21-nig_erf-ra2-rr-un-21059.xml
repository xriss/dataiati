  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project will pilot new approach to seek for durable solutions of 1,000 IDPs and returnees households (5,000 persons) in Adamawa State, living mainly in Yola Axis (Girei LGA), in line with the IASC guidance on durable solutions. The project will encompass the area-based approach and deploy the five steps approach on durable solutions with affected communities being in the centre of planning, implementation, and monitoring of activities. This project is not standalone but complements to the CERF project proposals awarded to UNHCR in 2021 on protection and durable solutions for IDPs in NE Nigeria (21-UF-HCR-020 and 21-UF-HCR-027) that target 520 households (2,600 individuals) with shelters, NFIs and livelihood activities. Additional 125 households will be targeted with shelters under this project proposal while the remaining 355 households will be supported with shelter from other sources. Additional 5,000 persons from the host community will benefit from the project in the area of improved access to basic services.

The project is seeking to contribute to holistic durable solutions approach led by the Government, mainly to enable local integration of IDPs relocated from Borno State to Adamawa, reintegration of refugee returnees of Adamawa origin and support the host community in building resilience and ease the pressure. As part of the other projects for shelter construction, UNHCR will advocate for allocation of land for settlement based approach to achieve self-reliance of the targeted population. This project complements to the settlement plan by addressing the corresponding factors of coordination, involvement of the affected communities in the design of their solutions and address other gaps in services.

More specifically, this project will:
 Support the Government to establish coordination mechanisms on durable solutions among government, humanitarian and development actors
 Provide technical and capacity building support to Government staff and community representatives on the durable solutions process 
 Work with affected communities to identify their gaps and problems and involve them in designing proposed solutions 
 Develop area-based local action plan on durable solutions based on needs of affected communities, 
 Enable access to durable solutions and services (health, education, documentation) by implementation the Local Action Plan through Quick Impact Projects for 1,000 households. 
 Provide livelihoods opportunities through trainings and start-up businesses for 280 households.
 Provide shelter support to 125 households (625 individuals).


This project proposal is pioneering an approach for sustainable durable solutions within the framework of: a) sustainable reintegration at the place of origin, b) sustainable local integration in areas of displacement, and c) sustainable integration in another part of the country. Peacebuilding efforts will be overarching and inclusion of displaced population in the development of the planned interventions.

The project proposal will focus on finding solutions for 1,000 IDP or returnees households (5,000 persons) in Adamawa State, Giere LGA, who are either returning and reintegrating in their places of origin or wishing to settle in Adamawa due to unfavorable security situation and inability to return in their ancestors homes. The project will include the host community as well to ensure that peacebuilding activities are taking place right from the onset of the intervention. UNHCR will ensure to emphasize the centrality of protection in the humanitarian actions and also implement the five steps on achieving durable solutions as per the IASC framework. 

The selection of beneficiaries will be based on needs assessment, vulnerability screening and community-based targeting at the time of implementation. Identification and verification of beneficiaries are guided by UNHCR&#x2019;s Protection principles</narrative>
