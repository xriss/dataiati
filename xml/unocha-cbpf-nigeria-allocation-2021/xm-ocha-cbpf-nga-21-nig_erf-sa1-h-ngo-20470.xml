However, special efforts undertaken to address the early recovery and development needs of the health system within the framework of the Humanitarian Development Nexus that will enhance its responsiveness to the needs of the communities as they transition to full recovery.

Establishing strong referrals system and network between mobile outreach locations and contiguous health facilities for Clinical Management of Rape (CMR), Syndrome STI Management, HIV/AIDS prevention care and treatment, emergency obstetric services and prevention of Mother to Child Transmission of HIV (PMTCT) strengthened because of the demand created from previous SRH/MH outreaches.

FSACI will work closely with the State Ministry of Health, Supporting the SRH sub sector to ensure no duplication of services. The project will focus on the LGAs of Mubi North and Lamurde where needs for IDPs, refugees and host populations continue to be high. IDP camp based facilities in these locations will be the prioritized as per recommendations of the SRH sub working group. FSACI will work closely with partners on ground in these locations.
The trained community volunteers, hygiene promoters, community-based workers and the collaboration between the FSACI and the State Ministry will help in sensitizing and awareness creation in all the communities and settlements within the selected LGAs on COVID-19. Since there are still positive cases of COVID-19 in Adamawa state as of 4th of October, 2021 and yet many do not believe in it, it is part of the responsibility of FSACI to make sure quality awareness is done to effect a positive impact for the responding organization.</narrative>
