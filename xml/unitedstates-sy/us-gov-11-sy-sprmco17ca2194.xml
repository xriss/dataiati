    <narrative xml:lang="EN">The United States supports the aspirations of the Syrian people for a democratic, inclusive, and unified Syria free of terrorism and violence. The June 2012 Geneva Communiquestablished a way towards resolving the Syrian crisis. Since then, the United States has supported this path by pursuing a political transition and ceasefire through the International Syria Support Group (ISSG) and UN Security Council Resolution 2254. Assistance is a vital tool in the U.S. strategy to defeat Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) and other extremists, promote a political transition in Syria, and stabilize the country after nearly five years of civil war. The United States coordinates closely with partner states in the Global Coalition to Counter ISIL and with other allies to fight ISIL and other extremists as well as to support the moderate political and armed Syrian opposition, isolate the Syrian regime politically and economically, and advance Syrians&apos; vision of a democratic and inclusive political transition. The United States is intensifying support to moderates throughout Syria to defend the Syrian people from threats posed by the Syrian regime and its allies, as well as ISIL and other extremists, and to enhance the capacity of the moderate opposition to contribute to a political solution to the conflict. Despite the challenges of implementing assistance in this difficult and unstable conflict environment, the necessity of bolstering civil society and local governance to serve the people and act as a bulwark against extremists outweighs these risks. U.S. assistance helps enhance stability in liberated areas of Syria by helping local civilian entities provide essential services, establish basic community security, enhance dialogue among diverse groups, and provide community-based conflict-mitigation and reconciliation processes. By bolstering the opposition&apos;s ability to provide basic services to their communities, U.S assistance enables them to serve as a model of inclusive governance in a political transition, and to provide a counterweight to extremists on the local level. The FY 2017 request will continue to support these efforts, provide assistance to support a political transition process, and begin the work of post-conflict stabilization. Stabilizing, and eventually reconstructing, Syria is a long-term task greater than any one nation can take on alone. The United States will continue to closely coordinate with other donors and international partners to ensure Syria stabilization and reconstruction efforts represent the Syrian population&apos;s aspirations for the future of their country. The Syrian crisis has displaced more than one-half of Syria&apos;s population, including creating more than 4 million refugees and 6.5 million internally displaced persons. The United States remains the single-largest global donor of humanitarian assistance to help those affected by the conflict, both inside Syria and in neighboring countries. In addition to the bilateral request outlined below, the President&apos;s global FY 2017 request includes funding within the humanitarian assistance accounts to enable the United States to continue to respond to critical and ongoing humanitarian needs in Syria and neighboring countries (see narratives for the humanitarian assistance accounts for additional details) as well as support to host communities in neighboring countries.</narrative>
