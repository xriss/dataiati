Additionally, International Military Education and Training (IMET) and Foreign Military Financing (FMF) assistance halted and remaining funds were reallocated when the Ecuadorian government terminated bilateral military cooperation and asked the U.S. Embassy to end military cooperation operations by April 30, 2014. The United States will continue to promote the development of sustainable institutions and processes in Ecuador for democracy, human rights, and the rule of law. U.S. assistance will support civil society and freedom of expression in Ecuador.</narrative>
