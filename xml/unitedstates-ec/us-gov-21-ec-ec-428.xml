   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Assist special populations which may be vulnerable or at-risk on a temporary or chronic basis whose needs are not addressed under emergency humanitarian assistance or other programs. These include groups such as the disabled; orphans, children and at-risk youth; victims of trafficking; victims of gender-based violence; refugees, returnees, ethnic minorities, internally displaced or other socially excluded groups; the elderly; and female heads of household.

Components may include measures to increase the capacity of local service and advocacy NGOs and/or professional social workers; to establish public/private service delivery partnerships as well as family and community focused service models; to establish effective referral networks; to develop appropriate service protocols and methods for screening prospective recipients; or to improve public understanding and sensitivity to the needs of the vulnerable.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">In response to restrictions imposed by the Ecuadorian government, USAID closed its mission on September 30, 2014. Additionally, International Military Education and Training (IMET) and Foreign Military Financing (FMF) assistance halted and remaining funds were reallocated when the Ecuadorian government terminated bilateral military cooperation and asked the U.S. Embassy to end military cooperation operations by April 30, 2014. The United States will continue to promote the development of sustainable institutions and processes in Ecuador for democracy, human rights, and the rule of law. U.S. assistance will support civil society and freedom of expression in Ecuador.</narrative>
