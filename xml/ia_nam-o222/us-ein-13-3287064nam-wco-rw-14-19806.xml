  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Banda is a remote and isolated community, made up of five villages, located on the edge of Nyungwe Rainforest in Southwest Rwanda. Banda has impressive natural beauty, but a major development challenge in Banda is the lack of water access, particularly in two of Banda&#x2019;s five villages. While water is plentiful due to the rainforest, Banda lacks the infrastructure to harvest it in the villages of Bururi and Gasumo. Bururi has two public taps for 159 households, leaving most families to fetch water in nearby, contaminated streams. For Gasumo&#x2019;s 114 families, the entire village has a single remote water tap; so remote it is only used by seven households. The burden of water collection activities typically falls on women and children in Banda. 

This project aims also to improve household and public sanitation in Banda by providing 20 families with latrines and building two public latrines in Banda center. The sanitation component of the project will include a two-day training for beneficiaries families on hygiene and sanitation, which will cover the prevention of parasites, hand-washing, latrine care and maintenance, and the spread of hygiene-related diseases. In addition, two public access water taps will be installed in the town center, allowing community members to wash their hands more frequently.

In 2008 Kageno Rwanda, World Connect&#x2019;s local, grassroots partner on this project, implemented a clean water project to bring purified water from a mountain spring source to two of Banda&#x2019;s five villages through a gravity flow pipe system. This project will build upon these efforts by connecting two additional villages, Gasumo and Bururi, to the water source, improving water access and cleanliness for 179 families.</narrative>
