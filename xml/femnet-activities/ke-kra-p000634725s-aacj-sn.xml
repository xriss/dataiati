   <narrative xml:lang="EN">FEMNET is represented by the Development and Communication Network for Senegalese Women, and will involve others such as UFDEK, WILPF Senegal Groupe, UNAFRES, N&#xE9;nuphar, the Women&apos;s Network of Taiba Ndiaye, Kabonk&#xE9;toor and AFAO. We will work with women, youth and local communities &#x2013; as well as other traditionally sidelined groups, such as people with disabilities</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The AACJ programme will be implemented in eight African countries: Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Kenya, Nigeria, Mozambique, Senegal, Somalia and South Africa. The AACJ consortium believes that building strong and inclusive movements for climate justice in these countries can be the engine for a powerful pan-African movement for climate justice. For the AACJ consortium, climate justice means all people have the right to live a decent and dignified life in a healthy environment. We believe that curbing climate change and enabling all people to build resilience and recover from climate-related shocks is key to break the vicious cycle of inequality and vulnerability. The impacts of climate change are not being borne equally or fairly, between rich and poor, women and men, and older and younger generations. The voices of frontline communities who both offer solutions to protect our climate and face the harshest consequences of the immediate impacts of climate change, are excluded from the policy debates shaping their futures. Their voices are often also isolated as opposed to aligned and lack the capacity to come together in unified front calling for action. The goal of our programme is to amplify and unite the voices in Africa demanding that women, youth and local and indigenous communities in the 8 target countries can defend and realize their human rights and live a decent and dignified life in a healthy and sustainable environment, within the context of the climate emergency. We will not only respond to power asymmetries within countries, but also challenge asymmetries of power between countries. 

We will connect with movements outside Africa, such as Climate Action Network Europe, jointly challenging unaccountable governments and unsustainable production and consumption patterns. Making these connections will help increase solidarity across communities and make the global climate movement more inclusive and legitimate. We will work from local to regional to global level, and vice versa. We will amplify local voices &#x2013; communicating both struggles and positive experiences &#x2013; to advocate for strong climate policies and national laws, and demand and monitor their implementation. We will use progressive frameworks, such as the Paris Agreement, the Africa 2063 Agenda and the SDGs to influence national governments and companies for positive changes in people&#x2019;s lives The AACJ consortium believes that clear and compelling narratives play a crucial to increase the engagement of youth, women and local and indigenous communities in the debate and policy processes on climate justice. Taking people&#x2019;s lived experience as a starting point, these narratives will play a key role in raising awareness, unveiling prejudices and stereotypes, debunking lies and rebalancing relations of power. 

The AACJ consortium will amplify African voices, encouraging environmental activists, indigenous leaders, women, youth, religious leaders, artists and opinion makers to share their personal experiences and contribution to addressing climate change. We will create safe spaces for traditionally sidelined groups to develop their own narratives which demonstrate their strength, resilience, innovative capacities and contributions to the climate crisis. We will ensure that these new narratives are shared and spread through climate debates and policy processes, connecting policy makers with people on the frontline of the climate crisis. With will connect activists, movements and communities with popular media (TV talk shows, radio call-ins and other interactive platforms) to enable exchange of ideas and information, foster understanding and increase public awareness on how women, youth and local and indigenous communities are experiencing and coping with climate change. The role of FEMNET will be indispensable to implementing Pathway 2 by creating counter narratives to help shift the discourse on changing the discourse on climate change</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The programme will contribute to the following impact areas: Impact outcome 1: 
More effective involvement of communities affected by climate change and environmental injustice, including young people and women, and a better informed and stronger civil society contribute to democratization of the climate change debate and recognition for local groups as providers of solutions.
Consortium partners in Senegal will focus on building transversal movements by bringing different organizations and constituencies together to share experiences and knowledge (Pathway 1). This will also involve establishing and strengthening links between community-based organizations and national platforms, facilitating their involvement to promote inclusive policies. 
The consortium will strive to raise awareness and build the capacity of youth groups, women&apos;s groups and community organizations on climate change and climate justice, through public awareness and advocacy campaigns, and through trainings and dialogues that promote civic actions by young people (Pathway 2). 
In addition, the AACJ programme in Senegal will support the valorisation, sharing and dissemination of existing community good practices for climate adaptation and mitigation through publications, video, events and fairs (Pathway 4)

Impact outcome 2: 
Relevant policies, programmes and institutions at all levels (national to local) integrate the concerns of local communities including women and youth, protect their rights, allow for meaningful participation, and support the increased resilience and adaptation of climate affected communities, and a just transition to more sustainable production.

Addressing gaps in policies and legal frameworks are the focus of the second impact outcome, mainly related to environmental rights, climate resilience and biodiversity 
The consortium strengthens capacities of impacted communities to denounce violations, initiate strategic climate justice litigation and challenge actions that violate their environmental and social rights (Pathway 3). 
The Programme will promote corporate accountability and policy changes for just transition policies on renewable energies and a reduction of fossil fuel dependence (Pathway 5). The programme will also promote and support the representation and inclusion of community voices in policy spaces at national, regional and global level, and lobbying and advocating.</narrative>
