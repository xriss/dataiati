   <narrative xml:lang="EN">STRATEGIC COUNTRY OBJECTIVE: Groups that are most affected by the climate crisis &#x2013; including rural pastoralists and farmers, young unemployed, and disadvantaged women &#x2013; understand its effect on their situation and rally together to demand investments and policy changes from governments, companies and the aid system. The Somali government is able to pass environmental protection laws, make strong climate action plans and access global finance to fund them.
The programme will contribute to the following impact Impact areas: Impact Outcome 1: 
Existing civil society actors, such as women&#x2019;s rights organizations, youth movements, environmental organizations, humanitarian actors and communities, work together in a climate justice movement, co-creating Somali narratives on climate justice, to be better able to defend the interests of people most affected by the climate crisis: (agro) pastoralists, urban unemployed youth and disadvantaged women.
The AACJ consortium in Somalia will work from a movement building perspective and focus on increasing the knowledge of existing CSOs around climate change and the prospect of climate justice policies. Broadening the partner base and effectively linking local organizations in Somaliland is fundamental to movement building (Pathway 1). Activities related to this objective include developing online and offline platforms to share knowledge between humanitarian organizations, women, youth and minority groups. 
Another priority is to raise awareness of CSOs and citizens on climate justice rights, including facilitating the participation of climate activists in media discussions and policy debates about climate justice in the regional and national context (Pathway 2).
Impact Outcome 2: Somalia implements climate justice policies with a focus on: 1) strong climate action plans that increase resilience and adaptive capacities of women and youth and can be used to seek global climate finance and 2) environmental protection laws.
For CSOs and grassroots movements to influence public policy around climate change effectively, the consortium recognizes the need to establish permanent and active engagement with the Somali government and public officials. As grassroots organizations need to be recognized as credible actors before they can be included in policy discussions, the project&#x2019;s activities include publishing policy papers on climate change, supporting the inclusion of local voices in policy spaces, and engagement with key ministries and parliamentarians (Pathway 5). 
With the support of Natural Justice, the consortium will look for opportunities to develop legal empowerment approaches for communities (for example a paralegal programme and community audits) to defend their rights (Pathway 3).</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The AACJ programme will be implemented in eight African countries: Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Kenya, Nigeria, Mozambique, Senegal, Somalia and South Africa. The AACJ consortium believes that building strong and inclusive movements for climate justice in these countries can be the engine for a powerful pan-African movement for climate justice. For the AACJ consortium, climate justice means all people have the right to live a decent and dignified life in a healthy environment. We believe that curbing climate change and enabling all people to build resilience and recover from climate-related shocks is key to break the vicious cycle of inequality and vulnerability. The impacts of climate change are not being borne equally or fairly, between rich and poor, women and men, and older and younger generations. The voices of frontline communities who both offer solutions to protect our climate and face the harshest consequences of the immediate impacts of climate change, are excluded from the policy debates shaping their futures. Their voices are often also isolated as opposed to aligned and lack the capacity to come together in unified front calling for action. The goal of our programme is to amplify and unite the voices in Africa demanding that women, youth and local and indigenous communities in the 8 target countries can defend and realize their human rights and live a decent and dignified life in a healthy and sustainable environment, within the context of the climate emergency. We will not only respond to power asymmetries within countries, but also challenge asymmetries of power between countries. 

We will connect with movements outside Africa, such as Climate Action Network Europe, jointly challenging unaccountable governments and unsustainable production and consumption patterns. Making these connections will help increase solidarity across communities and make the global climate movement more inclusive and legitimate. We will work from local to regional to global level, and vice versa. We will amplify local voices &#x2013; communicating both struggles and positive experiences &#x2013; to advocate for strong climate policies and national laws, and demand and monitor their implementation. We will use progressive frameworks, such as the Paris Agreement, the Africa 2063 Agenda and the SDGs to influence national governments and companies for positive changes in people&#x2019;s lives The AACJ consortium believes that clear and compelling narratives play a crucial to increase the engagement of youth, women and local and indigenous communities in the debate and policy processes on climate justice. Taking people&#x2019;s lived experience as a starting point, these narratives will play a key role in raising awareness, unveiling prejudices and stereotypes, debunking lies and rebalancing relations of power. 

The AACJ consortium will amplify African voices, encouraging environmental activists, indigenous leaders, women, youth, religious leaders, artists and opinion makers to share their personal experiences and contribution to addressing climate change. We will create safe spaces for traditionally sidelined groups to develop their own narratives which demonstrate their strength, resilience, innovative capacities and contributions to the climate crisis. We will ensure that these new narratives are shared and spread through climate debates and policy processes, connecting policy makers with people on the frontline of the climate crisis. With will connect activists, movements and communities with popular media (TV talk shows, radio call-ins and other interactive platforms) to enable exchange of ideas and information, foster understanding and increase public awareness on how women, youth and local and indigenous communities are experiencing and coping with climate change. The role of FEMNET will be indispensable to implementing Pathway 2 by creating counter narratives to help shift the discourse on changing the discourse on climate change</narrative>
