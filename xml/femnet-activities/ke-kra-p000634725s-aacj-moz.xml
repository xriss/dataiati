   <narrative xml:lang="EN">FEMNET is working with MULEIDE and Livaningo organizations which bring together several women&#x2019;s rights associations, activists on climate justice and individual members with expertise in climate advocacy. They focus on the gender dimension of climate justice. We will work with women, youth and local communities &#x2013; as well as other traditionally sidelined groups, such as people with disabilities</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">STRATEGIC COUNTRY OBJECTIVE: 
Key climate actors working with marginalized groups and local communities, particularly women and youth, who are at the frontline of the climate crisis, are strengthened to claim their rights for climate justice and climate resilience.
The programme will contribute to the following impact Impact areas Impact Outcome 1: 
Strong, inclusive, and effective civil society promotes climate justice and climate movements, driven by women and youth, are connected with global movements.
Movement building will prioritize amplifying the voices of women and girls on climate justice through sensitization and lobby and advocacy with local and national CSOs, international non-governmental organizations and international institutions (Pathway 1). 
The programme will map and document traditional knowledge of indigenous communities on resilience to climate-related challenges, also supporting women and youth, tell their stories through social and mainstream media and awareness campaigns (Pathway 2).
Impact Outcome 2: Public policies and frameworks advancing climate justice are adopted, funded, and implemented.
The consortium will work with local organizations and indigenous communities towards community-driven solutions that particularly strengthen resilience and adaptation capacities of women and youth, and use them for evidence-based advocacy (Pathway 4). 
The programme will provide legal support to local communities to know, claim and defend their environmental and social rights which are at risk due to extractive industries (Pathway 3). 
Recognizing the value of bottom-up policy development for climate justice, the consortium will promote the leadership and participation of women, youth and indigenous communities in submitting proposals for national, regional and international reform. 
As Mozambique already has progressive legislation on climate change, the focus will also be on effective implementation. AACJ will promote the participation of women, youth and indigenous communities in climate change fora to ensure that government is held accountable for the funding and implementation of climate change-related legislation (Pathway 5).</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The AACJ programme will be implemented in eight African countries: Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Kenya, Nigeria, Mozambique, Senegal, Somalia and South Africa. The AACJ consortium believes that building strong and inclusive movements for climate justice in these countries can be the engine for a powerful pan-African movement for climate justice. For the AACJ consortium, climate justice means all people have the right to live a decent and dignified life in a healthy environment. We believe that curbing climate change and enabling all people to build resilience and recover from climate-related shocks is key to break the vicious cycle of inequality and vulnerability. The impacts of climate change are not being borne equally or fairly, between rich and poor, women and men, and older and younger generations. The voices of frontline communities who both offer solutions to protect our climate and face the harshest consequences of the immediate impacts of climate change, are excluded from the policy debates shaping their futures. Their voices are often also isolated as opposed to aligned and lack the capacity to come together in unified front calling for action. The goal of our programme is to amplify and unite the voices in Africa demanding that women, youth and local and indigenous communities in the 8 target countries can defend and realize their human rights and live a decent and dignified life in a healthy and sustainable environment, within the context of the climate emergency. We will not only respond to power asymmetries within countries, but also challenge asymmetries of power between countries. 

We will connect with movements outside Africa, such as Climate Action Network Europe, jointly challenging unaccountable governments and unsustainable production and consumption patterns. Making these connections will help increase solidarity across communities and make the global climate movement more inclusive and legitimate. We will work from local to regional to global level, and vice versa. We will amplify local voices &#x2013; communicating both struggles and positive experiences &#x2013; to advocate for strong climate policies and national laws, and demand and monitor their implementation. We will use progressive frameworks, such as the Paris Agreement, the Africa 2063 Agenda and the SDGs to influence national governments and companies for positive changes in people&#x2019;s lives The AACJ consortium believes that clear and compelling narratives play a crucial to increase the engagement of youth, women and local and indigenous communities in the debate and policy processes on climate justice. Taking people&#x2019;s lived experience as a starting point, these narratives will play a key role in raising awareness, unveiling prejudices and stereotypes, debunking lies and rebalancing relations of power. 

The AACJ consortium will amplify African voices, encouraging environmental activists, indigenous leaders, women, youth, religious leaders, artists and opinion makers to share their personal experiences and contribution to addressing climate change. We will create safe spaces for traditionally sidelined groups to develop their own narratives which demonstrate their strength, resilience, innovative capacities and contributions to the climate crisis. We will ensure that these new narratives are shared and spread through climate debates and policy processes, connecting policy makers with people on the frontline of the climate crisis. With will connect activists, movements and communities with popular media (TV talk shows, radio call-ins and other interactive platforms) to enable exchange of ideas and information, foster understanding and increase public awareness on how women, youth and local and indigenous communities are experiencing and coping with climate change. The role of FEMNET will be indispensable to implementing Pathway 2 by creating counter narratives to help shift the discourse on changing the discourse on climate change</narrative>
