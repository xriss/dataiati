   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The issue of technology transfer has been a cornerstone of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) since it was established. As a major step forward, the Technology Mechanism was established by the 16th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP) in Cancun in December 2010. The Technology Mechanism consists of a Technology Executive Committee and a Climate Technology Centre and Network.The mission of the Climate Technology Centre and Network (CTCN) is to stimulate technology cooperation and to enhance the development and transfer of technologies and to assist developing country Parties at their request, consistent with their respective capabilities and national circumstances and priorities, &amp;ldquo;to build or strengthen their capacity to identify technology needs, to facilitate the preparation and implementation of technology projects and strategies taking into account gender considerations to support action on mitigation and adaptation and enhance low emissions and climate-resilient development&amp;rdquo;. The Climate Technology Centre and NetworkManaging requests from Nationally Designated Entities (NDE) and providing highly qualified support to countries along all stages of the technology cycle, from identification of technology needs, through assessment, selection and piloting of technological solutions, to their customization and widespread deployment represent the core mandate of the CTCN. Consistent with COP decisions, the CTCN is to serve three main functions, namely:1)Managing requests and responses in the technology cycle;2)Fostering collaboration to accelerate technology transfer;3)Strengthening networks, partnerships and capacity building for technology development and transfer, and fostering collaboration to accelerate technology transfer.These core functions of the CTCN will be supported by broader outreach and awareness activities and a knowledge management system that enables learning and enhanced response quality over the life of the CTCN, reflecting the two other functions.Scope of the Programme and expected outcomesUNEP and UNIDO established this joint programme to host the CTCN with a view to contributing to the development objective of reducing both the carbon intensity and the climate vulnerability of development and growth in developing countries. The CTCN will reduce the risks and costs of technology transfer and widespread deployment throughout relevant sectors of developing countries by supporting them to make informed choices about mitigation and adaptation technologies. UNEP and UNIDO joined to form a consortium consisting of leading institutions located in both developing and developed countries. At the 18th session of the COP in Doha in December 2012, this consortium was selected as host of the CTCN and at the 27th session of UNEP&amp;rsquo;s Governing Council in February 2013, a host agreement was signed in the form of a Memorandum of Understanding between the UNFCCC and UNEP as lead partner of the consortium.  The organisational setup includes a lean Core Centre managed by UNEP and UNIDO responsible for overall coordination, Network development, and liaison with NDEs. The Consortium Partners, who constitute a Technical Resource Pool that could be tapped quickly in response to country needs, are supporting the Core Centre in preparing country response plans and providing a strong technical link to the Network.Considering the wide range of adaptation and mitigation expertise required across sectors, regions and sub-regions and technologies, a wide and diverse Network of regional and national institutions will be required as a delivery mechanism that can respond effectively and efficiently to requests from developing countries. As per COP decisions, it is through the Network that the bulk of the technical assistance on climate technologies will be executed. Through this Programme, the CTCN will assist countries in advancing priority technologies through the life cycle of technology development, demonstration, deployment, and diffusion including accessing necessary know-how, information, capacity building and finance for meeting local development needs. This will include a specific focus on facilitating uptake and adoption of technologies suitable for local conditions. The expected outcome of the CTCN is to have accelerated, diversified and scaled-up, including through increased investment, the transfer of ESTs for climate change mitigation and adaptation, consistent with their national socio-economic and sustainable development priorities. This requires the building and strengthening of developing countries&amp;rsquo; capacity to identify technology needs to facilitate the preparation and implementation of technology projects and strategies, taking into account gender considerations to support action on adaptation and mitigation and enhance low emissions and climate-resilient development.</narrative>
