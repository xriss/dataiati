   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Operationalizing Green Economy Transition in Africa</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">A number of African countries have recognized the potential contribution that Green Economy could make to their development and have started taking strategic measures at national level. This ranges from the development of a comprehensive national Green Economy and climate resilient strategies, as in the case of Ethiopia and Rwanda, to undertaking of a Green Economy Scoping study and development of a Roadmap, as in the case of Ghana, Kenya and Mozambique. A number of development partners have started providing technical support to countries on Green Economy. Notable among this is the Green Economy Advisory Service that is being provided by UNEP. Almost all of these support programmes are primarily focussing on reviewing and introducing the required policy and institutional measures that need to be undertaken by countries at the Macro level. Hence, programmes that support practical applications of the Green Economy transition at the local level are practically non-existent although there are a number of initiatives that cover the different elements of Green Economy at subnational level. The objective of this project is to complement the on-going national efforts on the transition to Green Economy in the selected pilot countries by developing key planning and management tools for Green Economy at the local level, building the capacity of local governments and other relevant stakeholders from the public and private sector and providing technical back-up support to pilot demonstrations in five countries. It also assists in developing the framework for further replication of the pilot lessons and experiences at the national level.  The project is expected to lead to an enhanced integrated planning as well as changes in local policies that lead to pro-poor and financially viable resource efficient ecosystem restoring, low carbon or climate resilient projects implemented within the pilot communities. The project builds upon the on-going Green Economy works at the macro level and links with the possible supports that could be provided through the Partnership for Action on Green Economy (PAGE) to increase its strategic impact and programmatic coherence. The project is to be implemented in coordination with the German International Development Agency (GIZ) which will be responsible for the operationalization of the piloting at the countries level.</narrative>
