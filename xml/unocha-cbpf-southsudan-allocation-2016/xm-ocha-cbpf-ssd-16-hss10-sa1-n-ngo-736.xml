   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Recent years have seen UNIDO continuously operate 12 OTP centers and 8 TSFP centers with coverage in all 12 Payam in Mayendit County. However, sporadic conflicts witnessed in these areas continued to uproot and displace households, preventing many from planting as it&#x2019;s their main source of Food and forcing them to sell off assets and livestock for food. Renewed fighting which began in April 2015 worsened the situation by destroying available systems for addressing causes of malnutrition. UNIDO being the Health and Nutrition lead agency in Mayendit County together with other Humanitarian actors had as a result found it difficult to operate in the area due to insecurity. This is evidenced by an attempt by UNICEF to conduct an RRM in Dablual payam , Northern Mayendit which was unsuccessful in July amp December 2015 . Health and nutrition service coverage is further hindered by geographical constraints and poor infrastructure affecting transportation of supplies. The internal and external conflicts resulted to displacement of people as most of the community members sought refuge in the neighboring Panyijar county .The influx of IDPs in Panyijar increased tensions and raised the level of vulnerability among county residents in competition for scarce resources. This is why UNIDO through the Nutrition cluster followed beneficiaries and we continue giving them the Nutrition services while in Greater Nyal .This proposed 2016 project will continue to address, respond and scale up nutrition needs by targeting IDPs   (Children U5 boys and Girls, PLW above 18years and Men) and host communities of Kertith, Nyadong and Duong PHCUs in Nyal amp Host community in Mayendit County . The project is designed to provide both preventive (In Nyal ) and curative services( In mayendit and nyal locations). Treatment of severe acute malnutrition (SAM) will be provided by UNIDO to prevent children under five from malnutrition related death. Treatment of moderate acute malnutrition (MAM) will be done in Nyal with the aim of  improving the health of children under 5 Boys amp Girls ,and pregnant and lactating women (PLWs), thereby reducing the prevalence of severe acute malnutrition. UNIDO is grateful to the support by nutrition Cluster lead to ensure we treat MAM cases in locations where IRC is not reaching out around Nyal. A mobile Clinic has already been set up by UNIDO in Kertith .We are operational in the 3 PHCUs previously under SOH and once funded we are planning to expand to unreached payams (Yuk and Majak Payams) where the community is cut off from humanitarian services .Awareness campaigns on topics including IYCF, HIV awareness and hygiene promotion will be provided to Nyal and Mayendit communities. UNIDO which has presence in both Nyal ampMayendit under Education, Child Protection and FSL sectors will work closely with CHDs to ensure that the community of Nyal and Mayendit receive the needed services. UNICEF and WFP will provide food rations towards treatment of SAM and MAM in children and PLW in Panyijar and Mayendit county of Unity State. Children under 5 boys and Girls, and PLWs, as well as other vulnerable groups, will be screened in the community and referred accordingly. To avoid duplication of activities with already existing IPs in Panyijar County ,this project is specifically meant to scale up the delivery of the nutrition care services in Mer Islands Kertith, Nyadong and Duong PHCUs which have been hugely affected by the increasing case load caused by the continuous influx of the IDPs from Mayendit, Koch and leer counties into the area. The reserve fund received continues to support UNIDO in re establishment of services in the greater mayendit county and this fund will complement the ongoing project well.</narrative>
