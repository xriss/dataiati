   <narrative xml:lang="EN">International Medical Corps UK, through CHF funds, will continue to provide lifesaving nutrition services, to the most affected Internally displaced populations in Lakes state, Awerial county, Upper Nile (Malakal PoC, and Malakal Town. However in Mingkaman, the host communities surrounding this area will be considered as well. International Medical Corps UK is proposing CHF funding for six months period from September 01, 2016 to February 28, 2017. This is to ensure continuity of the nutrition program in the proposed areas that have a high burden of acute malnutrition.
	
In Mingkaman, Awerial county International Medical Corps UK is providing both treatment and prevention nutrition services prevention  (BSFP and IYCF) and treatment (OTP, TSFP) in 5 nutrition sites, but with CHF funds, more three (3) outreach sites will be reopened that were closed due to reduced funding to this location in February, 2016.

International medical Corps UK received 5 months funds from UNICEF, that started in March to July 2016, with this support a total of 1,131children aged 6-59 months with SAM and 1983 with MAM, and 770 PLW with MAM were admitted into the program. Twenty-five mother support groups actively participated in dissemination and discussions on IYCF and hygiene. Early this year funding to Mingkaman IDPs reduced drastically, this forced implementing partners to scale down or completely to phase out humanitarian services, due to that International Medical Corps UK nutrition sites faced increased caseload. More pressure to provide for humanitarian needs also increased with a new influx of 29,656 IDPs in Mingkaman from Twic East and Bor County who arrived between November 29th and early December 2015. Initial screening indicated that 157 children were identified with MAM and 47 with SAM among 868 newly arrived children. A SMART Survey conducted in May 2016, by International Medical Corps UK, indicated the prevalence of Global Acute Malnutrition (GAM) in Mingkaman IDP camps, Awerial County based on weight for height z scores /and or oedema was 25.0% [20.9&#x2194;29.7,95% CI) and the prevalence of Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM) was 7.6% [5.6&#x2194;10.2,95% C.I.]. The overall GAM prevalence is indicative of critical nutritional situation based on the WHO IMC UK propose to continue providing treatment to SAM cases and strengthen IYCF plus micronutrient in this area.

Malakal PoC and Malakal town The intercommunal conflict within the Malakal Protection of Civilians (PoC) site on 17th and 18th February resulted in mass casualties with at least 25 people killed, of whom three were aid workers, and more than 120 were wounded. About 3,700 homes were destroyed or damaged during the fighting and fires, along with multiple humanitarian facilities, including clinics, water tanks, nutrition centers and schools. Prior to the violence, there were around 47,000 internally displaced people (IDP) seeking shelter in Malakal PoC. During the fighting, about 26,000 of the IDPs fled inside the UNMISS base, while approximately 4,000 IDPs fled from the PoC to Malakal town, where they are staying in public buildings and abandoned houses. International Medical Corps UK provides emergency nutrition support to the population in Malakal PoC and Malakal town, by establishing nutrition sites, which are now functional. Populations in the proposed sites continue to have high cases of acute malnutrition with GAM rates above 15%, which is considered as a critical nutrition situation as per WHO classification. International Medical Corps UK conducted anthropometric and mortality surveys in Malakal PoC from June 24 to July 3, 2016 that showed a GAM rate of 18.6% (14.8&#x2194;23.0 95% CI) and SAM rate 3.4% (2.2&#x2194;5.4 95% CI)

. 
Therapeutic nutrition interventions will include treatment for children 0-59 months and pregnant and lactating women with acute malnutrition. International Medical Corps UK will also implement preventive measures to alleviate suffering caused by acute malnutri</narrative>
