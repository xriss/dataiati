   <narrative xml:lang="EN">&quot;A. Provision of basic emergency health services in  line with the BPHSS: 
Mayendit, Leer and Panyijiar counties are located in the southern part of Unity state where the conflict inflicted an enormous destruction on both the health care services and the general livelihood of the population. Population have continuously been displaced from their homes, humanitarian access has been impossible especially from May 2015 and hence exposed the most vulnerable people such as children, women and the elderly into uncountable sufferings from the lack of basic primary health care services. The three counties have total of 272,350 host communities (Source NBS mid-September 2015 population projection) and 171,307 IDPs (Source IOM, October 2015) where Panyijiar county hosted over 60% of the IDPs. The health facilities encountered a lot of destruction on the physical infrastructures and drugs, medical and laboratory equipments and furnitures were looted. Cattle raided and houses set ablaze, no/little harvest for the last two years of the conflicts and thus communities subjected to shocks as a result of missing their dear ones and the belongings.
Up to September 2015 Leer county was estimated to have 67,000 IDPs (Source: IOM/DTM Oct 2015) who were mostly in the highlands and swamps. Moreover, the movement of the population increased southwards from Mayendit, Koch and Leer to panyijiar county. And until October 2015 Greater Nyal in Panyijiar county was hosting over 35,000 IDPs and around 60 to 70 people crossing into Nyal using canoes on daily base. An inter-agency assessment conducted in Mayendit town in September 2015 reported proxy GAM rate at 23% and SAM rate at 6% for the 6-59months children while GAM rate at 21% for the Pregnant amp Lactating Women. People were reported to be feeding on water lilies amp other wild fruits and drink directly from river which will subsequently lead to a deteriorating health situation in the area by increasing the number of diarrheal cases and water borne diseases if there will be no humanitarian intervention. The whole building of the PHCC in Mayendit town was also in that same assessment reportedly been grounded. 
IPC reports in September 2015 indicated 30,000 populations are over the catastrophe phase in the southern Unity. GAM rate in the Bentiu POC is more than 30% and more likely to worsen in the origin counties mainly the Southern Unity. Morbidities and the constrained health amp nutrition services delivery will in the other end worsen the humanitarian situation in the Southern part of Unity which is mainly comprised of the above mentioned counties plus Koch.
The same IPC reports indicated that 355,000 of the population in Unity state will be at the crisis phase while 195,000 will be at the emergency phase from January to March 2016. 
There is also a great need to strengthen and improve the psycho-social supports and mental health services at the facilities and the communities&#x2019; levels in addition to intensive focus on GBV issues and HIV/AIDs since much of the population was subjected to numerous atrocities which include rape, torture, killings and many others.
B. STRATEGIC RESPONSE PLAN
This project will maintain and improve the existing emergency PHC services by providing BPHSS and emergency referral services in the supported facilities and at the communities levels through focus on maternal and child health (MCH) especially BEmONC, usage of the IMCI and support the routine EPI. Special focus will be in place to boost the coverage for all the routine immunization activities through enhanced outreaches and regular cyclic vaccination campaigns (NID). UNIDO will also establish mobile clinics to reach the beneficiaries far from the facilities and those cut from the services by floods during rainy season. UNIDO will also take the services to the IDPs sites which do not have facilities. Support community participation through VHCs/BHCs to give feedbacks on the services delivery.&quot;</narrative>
