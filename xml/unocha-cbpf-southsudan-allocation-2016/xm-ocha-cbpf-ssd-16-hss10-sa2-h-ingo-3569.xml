  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">There is immediate need for additional humanitarian assistance for health in Maban County, Upper Nile, South Sudan. High levels of morbidity and mortality, and increased access constraints due to ongoing armed conflict and security have exacerbated needs for basic primary health services and mobile services. Moreover, there is a risk of additional displacement due to frequent IDP/refugee/host community conflicts and competition over natural resources (e.g. water, grazing land and health services). 

CHF funding will be used to support and address major health needs in Maban. In Maban County, RI supports twelve PHCUs and PHCCs. However, uncertainty regarding funding continuation has led RI to scale down and suspend many basic health activities. Funding requested from CHF will ensure the essential, life-saving services are reinstated. Specifically, RI will support:

1) The reinstatement of health services at Dangaji PHCU. This facility is located in Banashowa payam, which supports an estimated host population of 23,962 and 2,746 IDPs. RI has been required to suspend services at Dangaji and the other three other facilities it supports in Banashowa payam. Funding from CHF will re-establish services at the PHCU.
2) The reinstatement of health services at Gasmalla PHCU. This facility is located in Bunj payam, which supports an estimated host population of 24,764 and 4,329 IDPs. RI has been required to suspend services at Gasmalla and two other facilities it supports in Bunj payam. Funding from CHF will re-establish services at the PHCU.
3) The expansion/scale-up of services at Bunj PHCC. This facility is located in the town of Bunj. RI has leveraged funds to support basic, skeletal services at this critical facility. Additional support is needed to ensure these services can continue and to re-initiate services RI was previously providing. 
4) Outreach within the host community surrounding Gentil PHCC. Catering to a large host community population in Jinmakda, which supports over 24,585 host community members and 2,685 IDPs, there is a need to support basic health outreach. Funding will also complement RI&#x2019;s ongoing basic health and EPR activities, especially during this peak season of malaria. Activities have been designed to contribute to the priorities of the cluster and second allocation objectives.

RI will procure and distribute essential drugs, including emergency surgical and obstetric kits (including trauma kits), drugs and medical supplies basic medical equipment and laboratory supplies by liaising with the MoH&#x2019;s supply chain (from the CHD to the facility level) as well as through its direct supply. In addition, RI will strengthen its partnerships with UNFPA and UNICEF to ensure the timely procurement and distribution of essential reproductive health kits and EPI supplies, as well as the functionality and continuation of essential cold chains. RI, together with the Ministry of Health (MOH) and the Maban County Health Department (CHD) also plans to strengthen emergency preparedness and response capacity at all supported health facilities and affected communities. 

To support communicable disease prevention and control, RI will also raise community awareness, boost immunization coverage through regular vaccination campaigns, and promote improved hygiene practices. Moreover, RI will engage in case finding, treatment and health awareness-raising for the prevention of common infectious diseases (e.g. cholera, meningitis, malaria, and other notify-able diseases). Finally, to ensure effective and timely response interventions and to maximize impact, RI will preposition essential emergency supplies and kits (drugs, vaccines, IV fluids, tents, personal protective equipment), integrate health programming with other interventions, and continue to work through key coordination mechanisms such as the inter-agency outbreak control team and the OCHA Inter-agency EPampRC Task Force.</narrative>
