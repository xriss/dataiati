   <narrative xml:lang="EN">South Sudan has remained consistently below global standards in WASH infrastructure and services, leaving vulnerable communities with little resilience to withstand the chronic and acute crises that has affected the country since December 2013 and according to the latest report from Radio Tamazuj revealed that only 40% of the population of 11 million have accessed to safe drinking water. Returns will continue to be significant in 2016 with 2,500,000 IDPs, in addition to the 300,000 refugees, increasing the pressure on limited WASH infrastructure and services. Many IDP populations remain in remote rural locations of Akobo and Ulang counties. These communities already had limited to no basic services before the crisis began. As conflict becomes protracted, host communities remain vulnerable with limited coping abilities to withstand the shocks. Inadequate WASH services contribute not only to disease outbreak, but also to increased malnutrition.  Lack of improved sanitation and limited knowledge of hygiene practices specifically for those under 5 years of age contribute to stunting, with long-term, and frequently permanent, effects on children&#x2019;s long-term cognitive development.  To mitigate against negative WASH impact in food insecure areas, WASH response will focus on counties in IPC levels 3 (crisis), 4 (emergency), and 5 (famine).Nutritional status is greatly impacted by diarrhea and other water-borne illnesses.  Those most at risk and affected by the Cholera outbreak last year were children under 5 years of age. 
 With limited access to safe water and improved sanitation displaced groups are at an increased risk for potential disease outbreaks as was seen in the Cholera outbreak from this past year in Juba.  The low rates of water and sanitation coverage throughout Greater Upper Nile and the limited access to basic health services and preventative care result in several counties, currently affected by conflict, identified as high risk for potential outbreaks because of proximity to polluted and untreated water from drinking and coupled with poor sanitation and hygiene.  Nile Hope WASH department will continue to mainstream disease prevention into hygiene promotion activities and ensure timely delivery of WASH services in locations that are high risk for outbreaks of diseases such as cholera and these counties are not exceptional. This intervention is expected to reach 24462 direct beneficiaries and 5000 through rehabilitation of 15 boreholes points/boreholes, emergency sanitation awareness household water treatment , provide hygiene promotion, training of hygiene promoters . The targeted locations for this intervention is in Greater (Akobo Jonglei) ,Ulang(Upper Nile. This project will cost about 99,991.50United Dollars for the period of five  months.Nile Hope before constructing the latrines will first organize stakeholders meeting with the beneficiaries and the focus area will be in the high populated location where belief high presence of IDPs population and where there is lack of sanitation facilities.Nile Hope construction team will consult with users on the design strategy ,preference desires of different user and will emphasis on the sustainability and proper use of the constructed sanitation facilities.</narrative>
