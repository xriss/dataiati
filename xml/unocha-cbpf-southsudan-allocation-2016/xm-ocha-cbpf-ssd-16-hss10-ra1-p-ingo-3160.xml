  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In and around Wau town, there has been a wave of armed violence since 2012 causing mass displacement of population and untold suffering among innocent civilians. This has resulted in deaths, looting and vandalizing of property, burning of crops, looting of drugs, abduction and mistreatment and rape both in Wau town and surrounding Payams such Besselia, bagari and Kpaile. Recent IRNA reports indicate high risks of sexual violence mainly associated with access to resources such as water and firewood where women and girls have to pass through secluded bushes and at times where there is high presence of soldiers. In villages like Mboro, humanitarian access was impossible for nearly 5 months as a result of insecurity until April 2016 when the first humanitarian mission was granted. Most community members lived in the bushes for fear of attacks if they came to Wau town. Humanitarian response to ensure safety and wellbeing of women and girls remains a huge protection concern that requires immediate interventions. 

Due to the mass displacement of populations in and around Wau town, the latest estimated population at UNMISS POC is about 19,711 while those currently seeking refuge at other collective centers such as the Catholic Cathedral is estimated at about 20,000 individuals.  

In order to address the current gaps in GBV prevention and response services, International Medical Corps proposes to start up GBV prevention and response program in Wau County. International Medical Corps will set up and equip a women and girls&#x2019; friendly space in Wau County where CMR services will be available. These women and girls friendly spaces will provide psycho-social and case management services through locally recruited and trained staff in Wau. Clinical Management of Rape services will be provided at the IMC health facility in UNMISS POC and Wau teaching Hospital while the IOM health facility will provide CMR services at the Catholic Cathedral. CMR trainings will also be provided to clinical and non-clinical staff to ensure quality CMR services. Establishment and operationalization of the women&#x2019;s and girls&#x2019; friendly space in and out of Wau Town will be one of the key program activities to ensure safe access to psycho-social and case management services. It will also provide an entry point for identifying the safety and protection concerns of women and girls as well as provide a safe space for all women and girls to attend group psycho-social activities and thus build a social network among women and girls and provide emotional support to one another.  A private and confidential space will be available for case management and individual counseling by trained IMC case workers.  All activities will be designed to meet the specialized and age-appropriate needs of adult women, adolescent girls, men and boys. The proposed program would strive to increase access to GBV case management services, provide psycho-social support (PSS), and referral to comprehensive medical care for survivors of GBV provided by International Medical Corps and other health implementing partners. Regular safety audits will also be conducted to identify GBV risk factors and advocate for risk mitigation efforts.

IMC UK is an independent affiliate of International Medical Corps (IMC), with which it shares the same name and charitable objectives and mission. IMC UK and IMC work together to deliver assistance programs in an accountable and effective manner in pursuit of their commonly-held charitable objectives. IMC will be performing services under any agreement that results from this proposal under the supervision of IMC UK</narrative>
