   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Promote the universal access of integrated nutrition care among vulnerable groups, children and PEW in particular, in Warrap State through the support of static and mobile services</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project main goal is to enhance the prevention and treatment of SAM and MAM among children U5, PampLW and other vulnerable groups (IDPs, refugees, elders) through improved coverage and quality of nutrition services at HFs and outreach level and the capacity building of local institution in their coordination.
The project area includes 2 counties (Tonj East and Tonj South) of Warrap State which, according to FSNMS report of June 2016, classify at critical nutrition levels for GAM (23.1%) and show a steady increase in the last  two years (GAM at 14.8% in August 2014). 
The project specific purposes, aligned with the Nutrition cluster, strategy are:
I. Scale up the integrated management of acute malnutrition through provision of high quality and comprehensive health services (PHCUs, PHCCs, outreaches) for girls and boys aged 0-59 months, pregnant and lactating women (PLW), elders and other vulnerable people of Warrap State
II. Increase the access to integrated health and nutrition services for children U5 and PLWs and other vulnerable groups by enhancing safe and appropriate infant and young child feeding practices, micronutrient deficiencies supplementation and nutrition initiatives through theinvolvement of local communities 
III. Ensure the coordination and monitoring of the nutrition response, through improved nutrition surveillance, monitoring and coordinated interventions, as well as the reinforcement of monthly data collection and analysis.
The prevention and treatment of acute malnutrition will be ensured through its integration into the health services, the involvement of local community and authorities in nutrition surveillance, the technical assistance and continuous supportive supervision to HFs, the capacity building of local health and nutrition staff and authorities. A detailed work plan shared with the local authorities and communities and the establishment of a reporting and data collection system dedicated to nutrition, will allow monitoring closely the nutrition status of the population in the target area. The integration of the present project into the wider HPF intervention, envisaging the reinforcement of the CHD and a consistent involvement of communities, will positively influence the intervention impact and sustainability, facilitating the accessibility to services even to the vulnerable and remote communities. Working as leading agency and in close cooperation with the other main nutrition actors (Hold the Child and World Vision) in both Tonj South and East counties, CCM will be in the position to implement a network of local institutions, international NGOs and community groups to assess the counties needs and define common and synergic plans. 
The project foresees to reach a total of 95,891 direct beneficiaries, including 63,190 children-U5 and 32,701 men and women. A total of 49,600 children U5 are estimated to be screened through MUAC at Health Facility and Community level. Based on the current GAM and SAM rates, about 2,300 are expected to be enrolled in the OTP services and 90 in the SC for the management of SAM. This caseload is based on a 80% coverage and, although it is above the cluster target, we consider that CCM is in a position to meet this target. We aim to go beyond cluster&#x2019;s target in consideration of our past experience and performance and, particularly, because of the increased number of outreaches  that CCM is going to carry out on a weekly basis. Concerning the MAM treatment, please note that CCM is not responsible for its management in either of the two counties, but a close link and collaboration with Hold the Child (local NGO based in the area) will ensure the proper referral and management of the cases. CCM is expecting to refer about 4,300 MAM cases (65% of the coverage) to Hold the Child over the 6-month project period. The target is slightly above the cluster target and the one from the CN, because MAM cases might be additionally identified directly by HtC.</narrative>
