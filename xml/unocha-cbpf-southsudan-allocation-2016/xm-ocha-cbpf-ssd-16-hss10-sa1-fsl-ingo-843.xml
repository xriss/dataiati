   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Enhancing Food Security and Livelihoods access by addressing high food insecurity situation in Guit, Unity State, South Sudan.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project aims to enhance access to food by providing support to productive livelihoods capacities of the communities. The project Household targets to deliver 9000 (9000HH Cereal Field Crops Kits, 9000HH Vegetable Kits and 3000fishing kits) livelihood kits obtained from the Food Security and Livelihood Cluster pipeline to communities affected by the ongoing conflict in Unity State. The project will target Guit County, Unity State. The project will aim to target vulnerable community members who are displaced as a result of the conflict in South Sudan. It will also support host communities accommodating the displaced persons. 
A number of factors have predisposed these targeted IDP and host community households to their current of food shortages and lack of income. These factors include the abandonment of farms due to conflict, destruction of crops by floods in the fields, and the loss of or abandonment of food stocks and livelihood assets (e.g. livestock). Proxy indicators show that coping mechanisms have been stretched to the last limits with evidence of decreased daily food consumption of most vulnerable households, (JAM Needs Assessment Report, 2015) i.e. restricting consumption by adults in order for small children to eat and reliance on kinship support (those in the PoC) for food assistance. The report also shows that women relied on wild food harvesting to feed their families and while the men have very limited fish catches. Women have often taken the risk of looking for food even in very risky areas by walking on foot for 2-3 days to Leer and the PoC site in Bentiu in order to access relief aid/food. Men&#x2019;s contribution to the household food economy has also been significantly affected, by the on-going large scale deaths of livestock (cattle) leading to diminishing milk production and unfavorable terms of trade since November 2014. This loss in livestock assets also means that most of the men lack any sustainable livelihood source and are idle. This reduction in daily meals to 1 meal per day, by most of the targeted vulnerable households, has also significantly affected lactating mothers, as they need to have adequate daily meals to enable them exclusively breast feed their children below the age of six months. Thus, the continued need to support the increasingly vulnerable beneficiaries with access to food production inputs (to access food through farming and fishing activities). Fishing is a key livelihood activity for people in Guit County, of which does not only contribute to nutritious food, but also household income, but is currently highly constrained by the lack of fishing equipment (e.g. Fish nets, hooks, canoes and post-harvest equipment) which this project will provide. 
JAM will provide agriculture extensions support and will provide post-harvest training for beneficiaries. 
The proposed activities are necessary and sufficient to achieve the stated outputs for these interventions based on the relevance of each activity in saving the lives of the communities. The indicators selected are SMART and JAM has a strong monitoring and evaluation system to measure these indicators and to ensure the intended results are achieved. Additionally, the output targets are reasonable and achievable considering JAMs strong implementation capacity and experience in Food Security and Livelihood Programmes. The means of verification, such as monthly reports, distribution lists and regular field visits are strongly credible and are currently used by JAM in its Quality Assurance.</narrative>
