   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Provision of Emergency WASH Services to the Unity State  population affected by armed conflict, food insecurity and high levels of malnutrition</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project is planned to be implemented within duration of 6-Months targeting 1,500 vulnerable IDPs and host community households (9,000 persons) in Nimni, Nyathoar and Bill payams of Guit County Unity State.
The purpose of this intervention aims to save lives of the affected population and reduce health related WASH issues through provision of safe water supply, sanitation facilities and hygiene education to the targeted beneficiaries. 

The prioritized specific objectives to achieve the overall goal of this project include:
I. To provide the affected population with access to safe adequate water supply of sufficient quantity for drinking, cooking, domestic hygiene and personal hygiene 15lts/p/day.
II. To promote household water treatment to communities at-risk of malnutrition crisis or disease outbreak due to consumption poor water quality.
III. To provide hygiene promotion activities to communities at-risk of malnutrition crisis or disease outbreak due to poor hygiene and sanitation practices.
IV. To promote and reduce environmental health risks
V. To promote safe excreta to reduce risks of water borne diseases

The key interventions SPEDP will be addressing in three payams of Guit County include:&#x2013; 

Water Supply:
i. Rehabilitation or repair of 10 hand pumps that will be distributed according to number accessed in the targeted payams of Guit County.
ii. Training for water source sanitation committees, comprising of 7 members in each water source rehabilitated (4female:3male) as water collection is considered as responsibility for women.
iii. Training of 20 community based pump mechanics for operation and maintenance of hand pumps (6female:9male)

Sanitation:
i. Prepositioning of materials for construction of 30 emergency shared household latrines in densely IDP sites considering gender specific needs. 
iii. Support household solid waste management campaigns for improved garbage disposal.

Hygiene Promotion: 
i. Recruitment and training of 18 Community hygiene promoters&#x2019; volunteers (8 females: 10 Males).
ii. Conduct routine hygiene awareness sessions in densely populated sites.
iii. Soap distribution to the affected population for three months targeting 1,000 HHs 
iv. Hygiene kits distribution to the affected population for three months. 
v. Train and distribute water purification products (PUR/Aqua tabs) to 1000 HHs accessing unsafe water from swamps, ponds, streams and rivers for drinking. 
vi. Provision of buckets, jerry cans for water collection and storage.

A number of factors have predisposed these targeted IDP and host community households to limited or acute shortages of safe drinking water. These factors include the multiple waves of displacement due to the conflict, floods making water logging and limited WASH infrastructure in the remote areas even before the crises. Most of the populations in Guit County were displaced to the PoC in Bentiu where there is access to basic services i.e. WASH while others hid in the bushes and swamps in Bill and Kedat Payams. IDPs and host communities in the remote areas of Guit County have limited coping mechanisms in the absence of adequate WASH services the remaining coping abilities have been further eroded by prolonged food insecurity, economic downturn and disease outbreaks. The widespread lack of safe drinking water, improved sanitation facilities and poor hygiene practices has left a large proportion of the population at risk of preventable WASH related diseases with the most acute and vulnerable populations found in Nimni, Bill,Kedat,Nyathor,Kuergine and Wathyona payams of Guit County (SPEDP assessment report 3rd to 5th December 2015). The affected community received little humanitarian assistance since the outbreak of the conflict. The very poor sanitation and hygiene practice means increased vulnerability particularly amongst women, elderly, disabled and children.</narrative>
