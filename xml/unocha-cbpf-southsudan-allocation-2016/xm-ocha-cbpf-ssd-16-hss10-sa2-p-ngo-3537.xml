  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">As part of the ongoing humanitarian response to provide critical and lifesaving needs to displaced populations, CINA has continued to demonstrate ability to response to growing child protection needs of IDP children in  Awerial. This second standard allocation of South Sudan Humanitarian Fund 2016  will continue to provide family tracing and reunification and psychosocial support services to children affected by the conflict. Populations influx continue to increase to Awerial from Bor and Twic East when insecurity arise. Most of the child protection actors closed down their interventions in Awerial in 2016 due to lack of funding. The protection cluster has tasked CINA to coordinate child protection sub cluster activities in Awerial. With this funding, CINA will be able to deliver in collaboration with CPSC, PC, RRC in Awerial and protection actors there to provide the child protection services needed and strengthen coordinated intervention and mainstreaming of child protection services with broader humanitarian service providers in Awerial, Lakes state.
