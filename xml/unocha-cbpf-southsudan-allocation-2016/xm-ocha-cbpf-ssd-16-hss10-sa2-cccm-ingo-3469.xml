   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed project serves to innovate DRC-DDG CCCM team&#x2019;s current Communication with Communities (CwC) and camp resident feedback mechanism work in Malakal and Melut Protection of Civilians (PoC) sites as well as in the spontaneous internally displaced persons (IDP) sites in Melut via the modification of the means by which DRC-DDG engages in &#x2018;two-way&#x2019; CwC and camp resident feedback on CCCM issues as well as the progressive inclusion of increasingly diverse &#x2018;voices&#x2019; of IDPs linked to community-led camp management processes and works. Specifically, the project will include the following: 

First, DRC-DDG will introduce an innovative CwC and beneficiary feedback programme in all project sites, using targeted mass Short Message Service (SMS) campaigns not only to communicate one-way messages (e.g. &#x2018;Tomorrow General Food Distribution will begin for Sector 1&#x2019;) essential to CCCM work but also to communicate and receive direct feedback on two-way CwC messaging (e.g. &#x2018;Did you find the Distribution Centre to be a sufficiently safe place to wait during this month&#x2019;s General Food Distribution? Reply SMS &#x2018;1&#x2019; for &#x2018;Yes&#x2019;, &#x2018;2&#x2019; for &#x2018;No&#x2019;). Those unable to read and respond fully in will be facilitated by DRC-DDG CCCM Outreach Workers to be located at in camp Info Posts at each site previous work in SMS messaging shows that neighbors also facilitate illiterate persons&#x2019; participation and uptake. Importantly, this messaging will target not only current camp committee members already liaising with DRC-DDG on in camp CCCM work, but sectors of the camp population, primarily women, not sufficiently engaged in providing feedback and guidance to DRC-DDG CCCM operations in both sites. 

Secondly, DRC-DDG will implement a complimentary project for the formation and support of onsite committees at all sites specifically geared towards: 1) Increasing community-led camp management work, and 2) Increasing community engagement in the process by which pressing CCCM issues are not only resolved onsite but how this resolution is communicated to the population. 

The first committee, the Camp Self-Management Committee, will be empowered to report from their blocks to DRC-DDG on issues (e.g. drainage, inter-communal disagreement) that demand attention, and then will be facilitated by direct interfacing with DRC-DDG to determine a course forward and respond sufficiently, with their voices, opinions, and efforts determining the outcome and process by which issues are resolved. The second committee, the Camp Management Communications Committee will similarly be engaged to work side-by-side with DRC-DDG CCCM staff to tailor and disseminate in-camp communications on CCCM issues using alternative means (e.g. Group Theater, block level forums, public opinion polls). These committees will ensure the passing of life-saving messaging and will also be instrumental in developing messaging and determining what format is best suited for communicating a message. Both of these bodies will be formed at all sites and will prioritize the presence of underrepresented sectors of the camp population which will lead DRC-DDG to more nuanced and context-appropriate interventions which benefit broader sectors of the population. Committees are to be formed with consultation from Block Leaders and other stakeholders. 

Finally, the project will make inputs to increase the visibility and accessibility of DRC-DDG CCCM complaint and feedback mechanisms in all sites. By engaging the aforementioned committees, DRC-DDG will ensure population knowledge of the process by which they can communicate in-camps issues in a secure and supportive environment, and the process by which DRC-DDG and community members pursue resolution of issues. This activity will make further progress on DRC-DDG efforts to demonstrate in real terms humanitarian accessibility and accountability to communities, demonstrating that feedback and complaint mechanisms do yield results positively affecting communities.</narrative>
