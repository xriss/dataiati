   <narrative xml:lang="EN">- Increased Supply and Monetization of Natural Gas, Gas Liquids and Oil, and Consequential Reduction in Imports:  Maples capital expenditure plan is targeted to increase Perus indigenous sources of energy, particularly through extending production levels in currently producing fields and the monetization of stranded natural gas reserves (a clean fuel), gas liquids and oil, in the central east area of Peru. In addition, Maples proposed investments may potentially lead to new hydrocarbon discoveries.   - Creation of Markets and Production of Renewable Bio-fuels:  Maples entry into the production of bio-ethanol using locally harvested sugar cane grown on its own land using state-of-the-art irrigation drip systems will boost the agricultural sector in Piura, promote the use of efficient irrigation technology in the Chira river basin, and produce a renewable, less polluting indigenous fuel.  Maples ethanol production will allow for exports to international markets and will also be available for mixing with domestic gasoline which is expected to become mandatory in Peru in 2010.   - Contribution to Peruvian Government Revenue:  The project facilitates the production and sale of hydrocarbons and ethanol which provides an important source of revenue to the country through both upstream royalties and corporate income taxes.   - Creating Local Employment and Sourcing in Peru:  Maples various operations currently directly employ approximately 400 people in Peru. The planned upstream activities are expected to provide additional employment opportunities and exposure to skilled employment to Peruvians. In addition, Maples new ethanol venture will create direct new employment opportunities in Peru associated with the cultivation and subsequent harvesting of land to be planted with cane and the construction and operation of an industrial ethanol distillery. The project will also have an impact on secondary employment through services provided by local companies and contractors.  IFC plans to monitor the following development impacts:  - employment; - local/national purchasing; and - payments to governments.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Maple Energy plc (Maple or the company) is an independent, privately-held integrated energy company with assets and operations focused in Peru. Maple engages in numerous aspects of the energy business, including exploration and production of crude oil and natural gas; refining and marketing of hydrocarbon products; gas-fired power generation and transmission and the development of an ethanol project.  IFCs proposed investments will finance Maples capital expenditure program in the short-to-medium term  (the project)  which will include:   - the drilling and well work-over programs and related activities aimed to extend production of its existing hydrocarbon fields;  - exploration and related activities in Maples hydrocarbon concessions; and  - the development of a greenfield ethanol project.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">Maples upstream operations are in the sparsely-populated central east area of Peru in the area regionally surrounding the city of Pucallpa. Maples hydrocarbon exploration and production Blocks 31 B, C, D and E are located in the three departments of Loreto, Ucayali, and Huanuco despite the relative proximity of the blocks. Currently, Blocks 31-B, 31-C and 31-D have producing wells and Maple plans to conduct exploration activities and reactivate prior producing wells in its Block 31-E. Maple also operates a refinery and a sales distribution plant located in the city of Pucallpa.   The proposed ethanol project is expected to be developed on 10,672 hectares of unused and uncultivated semi-desert land in northwestern Peru. The ethanol project will also involve the construction of storage and shipping facilities in the port of Paita to accommodate the sale of ethanol from the project.</narrative>
