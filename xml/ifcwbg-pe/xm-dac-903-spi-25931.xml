   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed project will continue to contribute to Perus tourism infrastructure, raise the level of competition and service standards, and improve the offerings to meet the evolving tourism demand. The project will introduce higher end tourists to a new region of Peru in line with the Government of Perus initiative to bring high-end tourism to all regions of Peru. In doing so, it will create additional jobs both directly and indirectly and also increase linkages with other industry sectors such as building materials, agriculture, textiles, handicrafts and food processing.  Higher spend tourists can optimize the economic impacts of the industry by generating more jobs, foreign exchange and higher tax revenue per tourist, while minimizing the potential negative impacts associated with overdevelopment, particularly in fragile environments.</narrative>
