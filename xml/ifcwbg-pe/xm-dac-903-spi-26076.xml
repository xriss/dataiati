   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project supports the continued development of one of Perus leading agribusiness companies. It will improve Virus competitiveness in the production of asparagus, artichokes and peppers through better economies of scale. The expansion will benefit the local economy, which remains particularly important in affected rural areas in the departments of La Libertad and Ica.  Other benefits result from the continuation and expansion of benefits to employees, farmers, agricultural industry and community development.  Employment: the company will continue to be a major contributor to the local economy: it directly employs 2,247 full time workers in its plants and 2,282 full-time agricultural workers for a total of 4,558 employees (36% women and 64% men).  Farmer benefits: The company also procures part of its requirements from third parties who benefit from canning operations. Viru procures from about 120 independent producers of peppers and artichokes (approximately 1,800 has).  Industry diversification: Viru was the pioneer in artichoke production in Arequipa, where it was the first to introduce and promote production from third-parties in 2004.  As a diversification from asparagus, production of artichokes and peppers was almost non-existent in Peru five years ago and currently represent over US$100 million in exports.  Community development: Over the years, the company has built a constructive relationship with the communities where they operate. The company established a Social Responsibility Department (SRD) aimed to improve the quality of life of its workforce and the community, The SRD has focused its activities primarily on improving the educational system, security, and income generation.</narrative>
