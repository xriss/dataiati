   <narrative xml:lang="EN">3G pour la Stabilit&#xE9;, in short: Stabilit&#xE9; 3G, or S-3G has been chosen as the French title for this project in order to facilitate ease of reference in Eastern-Congo. It refers to:

1.	G   Genre &amp; Garantie communautaire 
= Negative gender norms and values are addressed, SRH rights are more accepted, and community protection of survivors of (S)GBV is enhanced 

2.	G   Guichets Uniques 
= One-stop centres for comprehensive, multi-sectoral services for survivors of (S)GBV

3.	G   Gestion de la cha&#xEE;ne d&#x2019;approvisionnement des m&#xE9;dicaments essentiels pour la sant&#xE9; sexuelle et reproductive (SSR) 
= Management of the supply chain of essential SRH commodities

The three G&#x2019;s will combine and together be applied in a mutually reinforcing way to meet the four main objectives for this project: 

&#xF06E;	Specific objective 1: Empower GBV survivors and strengthen their resilience capacities through holistic GBV management within One-stop centres and other referral and counter-referral mechanisms. 

&#xF06E;	Specific objective 2 : Strengthen health systems to support the provision of sexual and reproductive health (SRH) services and promote continuous availability and affordability of SRH commodities to enhance the realization of human rights, including women&#x2019;s rights to be able to make an informed and free choice regarding their sexual and reproductive health, including the use of contraception.

&#xF06E;	Specific objective 3: Strengthen the effectiveness of provincial coordination and governance on GBV in order to allow actors involved in the fight against GBV to put in place strategies for prevention and response to (S)GBV.

&#xF06E;	Specific objective 4: Support the commitment of men, women and young people as well as communities to transform social and cultural norms unfavourable to gender equality and to promote the fight against (S)GBV. 

The S in S-3G stands for the overarching goal of this project: Stability. Firstly, working on the 3 G&#x2019;s will create effective, accountable and inclusive SRHR and SGBV institutions for survivors of SGBV and will contribute to giving them access to justice (SDG16, SDG 3, and SDG 17). Secondly, working with communities on harmful societal and gender norms, it will reduce SGBV and harmful practices, leading to more peaceful communities, less conflict and corresponding consequences (SDG5 and SDG 16). By providing a holistic response to SGBV, the project will hence affect the Eastern DRC as a whole by increasing long-term peace, security and therefore stability.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Addressing GBV in North and South Kivu provinces with a view to sustainable change requires political will and a holistic intervention involving various actors. In the framework of the project, the main stakeholders are:
&#xF06E;	The government represented by 5 ministerial structures: Ministry of Gender, Family and Children, Ministry of Public Health, Ministry of Social Affairs, Ministry of Justice, Ministry of the Interior. 
&#xF06E;	The member organizations of the consortium: Cordaid, Heal Africa. 
&#xF06E;	Technical and implementing partners: DFJ, AFEJUCO.
&#xF06E;	Community leaders and organizations: religious leaders, CODESA, youth organizations, youth associations, community platforms against GBV.

The primary target groups of this project will be: 
&#xF06E;	(S)GBV survivors seeking (S)GBV services at health centres and at One Stop Centres for holistic follow-up services in each of the six health zones
&#xF06E;	Women and men of communities who seek SRHR information, services and SRH commodities in the six health zones

The secondary target groups will include those professionals and community-based volunteers who will respond to (S)GBV or who will be influential in advocacy on regional and national level, for example: 
&#xF06E;	SRH service providers and (S)GBV service providers in existing health facilities in the targeted health zones (these two categories may overlap);
&#xF06E;	Community leaders and Health Committees in the communities, so-called &#x201C;CODESA&#x201D;, who closely collaborate with health centres and with&#x201D; Communaut&#xE9;s protectrices&#x201D;. (community members, parents, religious leaders) 
&#xF06E;	Community GBV focal points or &#xAB; Communaut&#xE9;s protectrices &#xBB;
&#xF06E;	Women&#x2019;s Rights groups in both provinces, and their local departments
&#xF06E;	Police and military hospital staff of the military hospital in Goma and the Police hospital in Bukavu (training on (S)GBV and provision of (S)GBV commodities; 
&#xF06E;	Pharmacists, pharmacy-assistants and health staff in charge of health commodities and part of the supply chain management (SCM)
&#xF06E;	Members of CODESA contributing to supply chain data verification and reporting processes at HF level and transportation of health commodities,
&#xF06E;	Members of technical and policy-making platforms at provincial levels, both in the health sector and in the multi-sectorial GBV technical committees under the Provincial Ministries of Gender. 

In the involvement of all these secondary target groups, special efforts will be made to promote inclusion of women within these groups, as this is unlikely to happen automatically.

Indirect secondary target groups, through advocacy and synergy with other key actors, such as women&#x2019;s rights organisations, operationalizing other projects in the two target Provinces, would be: 
&#xF06E;	Police Units;
&#xF06E;	Para-legals for mobile juridical clinics; 
&#xF06E;	Journalists and media experts;
&#xF06E;	Young men&#x2019;s groups;
&#xF06E;	Savings groups
Interventions with all these indirect secondary target groups mentioned here are recognized as highly relevant in prevention of and coordinated responses to (S)GBV, but beyond the capacity and budget limitations of the consortium partners for this project.  We will certainly seek synergy with other actors under pathway 4 for this.</narrative>

  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The eastern provinces of the DRC are particularly affected by (S)GBV and are among the most impoverished of the DRC with a poverty rate of 72.9%. Young people between 10-24 years, and especially young women belong to the most vulnerable population within these conflict-affected areas of the DRC. Data for 2019 shows for the Kivus a further increase in recorded (S)GBV cases; 11,276 new cases in North-Kivu and 4,208 in South-Kivu indicating the high burden of (S)GBV to women and girls in these provinces. Moreover, several statistics show that more than 80% of reported cases of (S)GBV corresponds to sexual violence. Rape is often used as a weapon of war and intimidation by different armed groups as well as sometimes by the national army. Since all of the communities particularly value the virginity of women as well as the notions of family honour; sexual violence aims to destroy these values and thereby break all social relationships within communities. 

Certain socio-cultural norms and traditions remain prevalent in these provinces and contribute to the perpetuation of other forms of (S)GBV such as domestic violence and forced and/or early marriages. Data collected by UNFPA in 2010 showing that 39% of women aged 20 to 24 in North Kivu married before 18 and 38% in South Kivu, with poverty and lack of education as risk factors. 

Poverty and stigmatization of (S)GBV survivors also causes young women to flee from their communities and to engage in transactional sexual encounters for their income and survival. This problem is especially pronounced among IDPs and refugees, as well as in mining zones. In rural areas of the Kivus, women and girls farming in the fields or searching for water or firewood, are vulnerable to become random victims of sexual violence due to weak security services and a general acceptance of violence against women.

The consortium partners aim to re-establish key services and processes by engaging in political dialogue and creating more access to basic SRH and holistic (S)GBV services.</narrative>
