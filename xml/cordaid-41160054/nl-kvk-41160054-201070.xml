   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Averting COVID-19 Impact on Pupil Enrollment post COVID19 lockdown in Rural Uganda</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Before COVID19, most rural districts in Uganda like Kamuli were already experiencing gaps in enrolment, retention and completion , and when COVID19 hit in March 2020, all education institutions in Uganda closed and as a result, all students and pupils were home for nearly a year. The Ministry of Education and Sports (MoES) in Uganda had started re opening schools in a phased approach however, according to the Ministry&#x2019;s  projection, a significant number of  pupils are not likely to return to school due to several factors that include failure to raise school fees, lack of scholastic materials like books, pens and school uniform, teenage pregnancies, early marriage and child labour/work among others.
In the recent years Kamuli had evidently registered 33% drop-out rate at Primary Education level as of 2019 before the COVID-19 pandemic. This number is expected to significantly increase as a result of COVID-19 impact on pupils</narrative>
