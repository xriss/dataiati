   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The 121 platform supports humanitarian organizations in making Cash &amp; Voucher Assistance
fast while preserving privacy-by-design. The platform is designed with People Affected by
disasters, Aid workers in the field and at HQ. 121 aims to use robust and available technologies, connecting to Financial Service Providers with existing payment infrastructures.

The history of the 121 platform can be split up in two phases: research and pilots. In 2017 the
Netherlands Red Cross recognized the increasing use of cash as aid and saw some potential
pitfalls in the underlying information systems. A research process of 9 months, during which
cash experts from the Red Cross Movement (National Societies, IFRC and ICRC) where involved
in identifying the challenges of cash for emergencies and the opportunities for digital
innovation in this space. Several platforms utilized by other humanitarian organizations were
reviewed to explore existing solutions and identify common approaches. A key challenge
derived from this research was the lack of an open-source alternative that could create scale
at with lower costs for humanitarian organizations.

For an open-source solution to be successful it was decided to build support and momentum
with Red Cross National Societies, the Dutch Relief Alliance, start-ups, corporate partners and
research institutes. The pilot phase incorporated the conception of two innovation consortia
to design, develop and test the 121 platform in a several humanitarian contexts:

&#x2022; In Kenya, with support of the GSMA and IKEA Foundation
&#x2022; In Ethiopia, Malawi and the Netherlands, with support of the Netherlands Red Cross
and Dutch Relief Alliance Innovation Fund

Together with the efforts of Dorcas, Tearfund, Help a Child, Netherlands Red Cross, Kenya Red
Cross, British Red Cross, Tykn, PWC, volunteers, researchers and 510, these investments have
resulted in two successful pilots in 2020.

In 2021, the project will be scaled up.</narrative>
