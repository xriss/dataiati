   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In the early hours of 24th February 2022 Russian forces launched major cross-border attacks against Ukraine from the north, east and south, by land, sea and air. Major attacks have been reported across Ukraine, including in the capital Kyiv, creating growing sense of fear and panic that forced many people into bomb shelters and subways. People in the capital, east and south of the country are fleeing towards Ukraine&#x2019;s western regions and are entering neighbouring European countries, as well as into Russia. As of 09/032022 UNHCR estimates that 2mln people have already fled to neighbouring countries like Moldova, Romania, Poland and Hungary, and 1mln people are internally displaced. And it is expected that more people will flee or get displaced during the coming period. The current crisis carries significant implications for a country already experiencing a humanitarian crisis with 2.9 million people dependent on humanitarian assistance, linked to the ongoing conflict after pro-Russian separatists took control over parts of the eastern Donbas region in 2014.                                                                              
In the morning of 9 March certain humanitarian corridors were agreed to by the Russian Federation and the Government of Ukraine. Evacuation has begun in the north-eastern city of Sumy. Early reports indicate there continue to be issues with evacuations of the cities of Bucha, Gostomel and Mariupul. Humanitarian corridors have been set up around several cities, however, they have not been respected by Russia, making it very complicated to savely evacuate people, as well as to get aid supplies into the cities.</narrative>
