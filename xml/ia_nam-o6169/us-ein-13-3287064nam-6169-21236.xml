   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Students in Tembaro Woreda face many barriers to access secondary school and continue to university. Many of the schools in this district lack educational resources, such as computers and libraries stocked with textbooks and study guides. Degale Public Library &amp;amp; Computer Center began as a dream among some of the first high school graduates from Tembaro Woreda. A few of these students, as the first from their community to complete secondary school and go on to university, realized that a library with study resources and space would enable other students in their community to achieve the same.

WEEMA International (WEEMA) completed construction of Degale Library in 2014, making it the first public library available in Tembaro district, home to approximately 130,000 people. The building includes a reading room and computer lab with internet. Beginning in 2015, WEEMA furnished and supplied the library and began operations seven days per week. While the priority of the library and computer center is to support secondary school students in their education, it is open to the entire public and houses educational resources for all ages.

The project goal is to improve access to quality information and educational resources to residents of Tembaro Woreda, and empower primary and secondary school students to succeed in their education. The project aims to:
&#x2022; Provide a safe/quality study and educational space for youth and adults, primarily for teachers and secondary school students.
&#x2022; Furnish, equip and maintain the library and computer lab to enable access to information and educational resources for students, teachers and the general public.</narrative>
