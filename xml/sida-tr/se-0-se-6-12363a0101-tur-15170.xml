    <narrative xml:lang="EN">In the submitted narrative report it has been assessed by Sida that the report is mainly based on activity reporting however making references to higher level outcomes. The narrative report structure is assessed sufficient however NPO has asked further questions on some of the results on the report for clarification which is to be commented here. With respect to the first outcome, it is assessed that Kader is highly active and shown great commitment to realise its aim. The trainings they have conducted has reached women at local level not limited to big cities such as Ankara or Istanbul but to smaller Anatolian cities. It is notable that 12 Kader trainees were elected as mukhtars. Kader members are also elected as deputy mayors, municipal councillors and city council members, 2 of Kader&#x2019;s members are currently, elected MPs. The activities have led the women trainees to better campaign, learn from experiences and have them to increase their knowledge on campaigning, politics, election systems etc. It is assessed that Kader has also better monitored the results they have received from these trainings and activities and Sida has a better and clearer view of what Kader was able to realise. This feedback from the monitoring activities that they have received has also contributed to the improvement of the training materials and content. It is also important to mention that Kader has increased its efforts to engage with young women and increased their number of volunteers for its work, and have them as trainees. On the second outcome Kader has increased its efforts for advocacy and lobbying with a very diverse group of stakeholders. Especially their work on collaborating with universities and local administrations and grass root CSOs is rather significant. They have definitely improved their media relations and received a high media coverage during their campaigns for elections and women&#x2019;s political participation awareness issues. One of the strengths of Kader, campaigning, continued to be an effective tool. Their efforts to keep dialogue channels open with conservative groups and government is also worth mentioning. It is assessed that Kader is on the right track and steering the process in a positive way. On the third outcome, it is assessed that Kader has empowered their branches in a significant way and realised activities in those cities and produced branch level activity plans. They have increased their volunteers and created a volunteers network. One important issue is about the Human Resources of the organisation which has been added as a risk item to TRAC. Kader needs to increase the quality and number of its staff and decrease the circulation. This issue is constantly being followed up by Sida and the efforts to improve the situation by Kader is also being observed. Kader has also managed to increase their funding resources in a significant way. This is observed to be a continuing trend in Kader for the last two years and they have managed to extend their activities to broader areas outside Sida&#x2019;s project funding which is very promising in terms of increased capacity for fund raising and proposal writing.</narrative>
