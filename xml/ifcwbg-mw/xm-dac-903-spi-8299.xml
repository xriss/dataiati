Project Cost Including Proposed IFC Investment   :   	The project is estimated to cost US$900,000 million and IFC has been requested to provide a loan of US$307,000.    Location of Project and Description of Site   :   	The project is located in Area 43, one of Lilongwe&apos;&apos;s premier residential and diplomatic suburbs.  The site area is 7 acres.    Description of Company and Purpose of Project   :   	The company was set up to develop a short to medium stay residential complex consisting of 17 one, two and three bedroom bungalows.  The site will also have a 3 hole pitch and put course, swimming pool, two tennis courts, a jogging trail and a small artificial lake.  The development aims at attracting guests seeking better facilities than are available at Lilongwe&apos;&apos;s hotels for medium term stays.    Expected Development Impact:	The diplomatic community; donor agencies; NGO&apos;&apos;s and the foreign business community in Lilongwe has been growing and demand for high quality housing for both long and medium term stays is not met.

The project will be capable of earning foreign exchange from many of its guests.  It will employ about 26 people.
