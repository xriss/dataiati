  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project is to support the continuing operations in Egypt of the hydrocarbon exploration and production branch of the PICO Group, PICO International Petroleum Group (PICO E&amp;P), including funding: (i) additional development investments (CAPEX) to delay the production decline of its mature Amal and Zaafarana fields, located offshore Gulf of Suez; (ii) exploration capex in the Companys existing licenses (minimal); (iii) refinancing and repayment of existing debt; and (iv) general corporate purposes including potential acquisitions approved by IFC.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Through this investment, IFC will support the development and growth of a junior, family-owned oil and gas company in its core operations in Egypt. The Project will lengthen the life of and help maximize hydrocarbon production from PICO E&amp;P&apos;&apos;s mature fields and promote continued gas development in the Amal field.  This supports the Government of Egypt (GoE)&apos;&apos;s efforts to increase natural gas development in Egypt to meet growing local demand.  Furthermore, by increasing production and extending the output horizon of the fields, the GoE will also benefit from a longer period of higher fiscal revenues. Also importantly, an investment in a locally-owned oil and gas operator, in a market dominated by international majors, will set an example for potential other indigenous players. Finally, as the company intends to grow internationally, IFC&apos;&apos;s stamp of approval will be helpful to demonstrate sound corporate governance, E&amp;S practices and financial soundness.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">The two assets supporting the investment (Zaafarana and Amal) are located offshore Gulf of Suez, in shallow waters (25 to 50 m deep). The Amal field is located in the southern province of the Gulf of Suez, approximately 55 km from the city of Ras Gharib, 15 km southwest from Morgan Oil field, and about 15 km offshore from the western shoreline.  The license, covering 26.8 km2, was originally issued in 1981 and fully acquired by PICO in 1998.  The Zaafarana field is located in the north central Gulf of Suez, about 6.5 km from the shoreline.  The license, covering 22.0 Km2, was originally issued in 1989 and since 1993 is managed by the Zaafarana Oil Company JV, for which PICO subsidiaries own 80% of the private shares.</narrative>
