   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project consists of an IFC investment in, and Technical Assistance (TA) Program to the Egyptian Mortgage Refinance Company (EMRC or the company), previously known as Egyptian Liquidity Facility (ELF) which has been established as part of the initiative of the Egyptian Government to develop a viable housing and housing finance sector in Egypt.   EMRC represents the second prong of reform which is aimed at enabling and encouraging commercial banks and other financial institutions to lend for housing. In this context the government has encouraged the formation of specialized finance companies and has established the Mortgage Finance Authority (MFA) to promote and oversee the housing finance sector. One of most important initiatives of MFA has been to push for the establishment of EMRC as a refinancing vehicle for commercial banks and other financial institutions engaged in mortgage lending. It is envisioned that as the primary mortgage market deepens, and primary mortgage lenders (PMLs) will be able and willing to offload their originations that they will do so to EMRC thus creating the possibility of efficient securitization into the capital markets.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The projects development objective is to encourage the primary lenders in the financial market to provide longer-term, market-based mortgage loan financing for residential housing. The development impact of this project is expected to be achieved in three specific ways:  - Development of the Primary Mortgage Market:  Access to long term fixed rate funding through the EMRC would encourage primary lenders to make longer term housing loans and would improve the access to housing finance for middle and lower income segment of the society.   - Mobilization of Resources for the Housing Sector:   As a refinancing entity EMRC will be able to connect the primary mortgage lenders to the capital markets and channel funds raised from the capital markets to the housing finance sector.   - Development of the Domestic Debt Market:   As a non deposit taking entity, EMRC will need to repeatedly tap the domestic market to raise long term resources for onlending to the primary mortgage lenders. This will offer institutional investors a new and much needed channel of investing their resources into highly rated fixed income instruments which are practically non existent in the markets today.</narrative>
