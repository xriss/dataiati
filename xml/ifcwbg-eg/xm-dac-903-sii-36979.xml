   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project consists of an IFC investment for an equity stake of 10 percent in AXA Egypt Investments SAE (AXA Egypt or the Company). AXA Egypt is the holding company of two wholly owned Egyptian licensed joint stock insurance companies, specialized in, respectively, Life &amp; Savings and Property &amp; Casualty. It is expected the Company will also acquire a service company in due course. The Company plans to offer life, health and non-life insurance covers to individuals, SMEs and corporate clients. Through AXA Egypt, AXA intends to leverage the strength of its global presence and play a significant role in the fledgling private health sector in Egypt through health insurance and integrated health services. Life insurance products shall be provided through AXA Life Egypt, the former CIL life insurance company in Egypt acquired by AXA in 2015, while non-life insurance products will be provided through AXA General Insurance Egypt (formed in 2015).</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project is expected to have a strong developmental impact by:   1) Enabling Fund Accumulation and Allocation: Insurers deploy long-term funds into the economy, allowing for long-term fund accumulation, thus supporting economic development and infrastructure build-up. This is particularly relevant for insurers with life businesses, which take long-term liabilities to provide life coverage to their policyholders and therefore seek long-term assets to invest into. Through the acquisition of CIL (a former IFC investee company, now AXA Life Egypt), AXA Egypt is expected to be a formidable player in Egypt&apos;&apos;s life insurance space.  2) Buttressing the Health Sector: AXA Egypt will enter the health insurance market and explores options to engage at a later stage in Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) services. This will contribute to closing the service gap as a growing middle class is seeking better healthcare and are expected to turn to privately run health care providers and insurers. The availability of sufficient private health care providers will lower overall private health care cost and make it more affordable for many upwardly mobile Egyptians to move out of the public health care system. This in turn is expected to unburden the public health care system, creating less stress on the limited resources of public health care.  3) Support to SMEs: AXA Egypt aims to launch standardized, but adaptable SME insurance packages, thereby providing insurance cover to SMEs in a more cost-effective manner and ensuring this growing segment of the Egyptian economy.  4) Support of Societies in Transition: Societies in transition and going through upheavals are in great need for risk management services so that individuals can be offered a safety net and can improve their social stability. Businesses can mitigate their enterprise risk through insurance coverage and thus are more comfortable taking risks and invest more.</narrative>
