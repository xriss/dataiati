   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Project is expected to be the first senior green bond issuance in Egypt. In the absence of green bond history in the Egyptian market, the Project represents a first step towards establishing CIB as a regular issuer through setting the green bond framework and program. IFC investment will testify its commitment to the local capital market and encourage other financial institutions to participate in future bond issuances. IFC is bringing its best practice expertise in structuring and issuing green bonds globally and regionally.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Proposed project comprises of IFCs subscription of up to US$65 million in the first tranche of Commercial International Banks (CIB or the Bank) first senior green bond program of US$100 million in Egypt, with 5 years maturity (the Project). IFC will subscribe to the first tranche which will take place through a private placement. Subsequently, IFC will work with stakeholders on listing future bond issuances.   &#xA0;  Under the Project, IFC as implementing entity of the UK Market Accelerator for Green Construction (MAGC) Facility expects to provide up to US$1.4 million in the form of a performance-based incentive (PBI) to help accelerate construction of green buildings in Egypt and make significant contributions to reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the real estate/building sector in the country. The PBI is designed to benefit the Banks end-borrowers, with payment of the incentive contingent upon their ability to meet specific green building eligibility criteria and completion of a green building certification process. The level of concessionality (i.e., subsidy) provided by the blended concessional finance co-investment is estimated to be up to 2.2% of IFCs subscription of US$65 million.   &#xA0;  Further details and historical information on estimated subsidy levels in IFCs blended finance portfolio can be found at: www.ifc.org/blendedfinance. As is the case with all of IFCs blended concessional finance co-investments, this Project has been assessed against the Enhanced Blended Concessional Finance Principles for DFI Private Sector Operations adopted by IFC and more than 20 other DFIs in 2017. Furthermore, as part of IFCs commitment to transparency in the deployment of concessional blended finance resources, the MAGC program and potential blended concessional finance support has been and continues to be considered in green building discussions with other banks in the Egyptian financial sector.</narrative>
