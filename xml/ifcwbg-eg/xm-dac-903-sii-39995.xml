   <narrative xml:lang="EN">- Contribute to ensuring energy security in Egypt: The Project is expected to support the construction of around 50MW of solar
projects.
- Development of the Egyptian Renewable Energy Sector: The Project is expected to help play a catalytic role in starting solar
power development in the country.
- Employment: The Project will have a positive impact on economic development due to increased power generation in Egypt,
and will support direct and indirect jobs creation during the construction and operations.
- Climate Change: The Project will support climate related mitigation impact by providing clean, zero emissions electricity and
avoid greenhouse gas emissions of approximately 60,750 tons of CO2 per annum and thus contribute to addressing global
climate change concerns.</narrative>
