   <narrative xml:lang="EN">IFC is considering a $350 million investment to be allocated to Orascom Construction Industries (OCI) and its wholly owned subsidiary, the Egyptian Fertilizers Company (EFC).  OCI is one of the largest construction and fertilizers groups in the Middle East and Africa region and is present in over 25 countries across the world. In its present form OCI acts as a holding and operating company. Collectively, the Groups companies (fertilizers and construction) employ more than 86,000 people.   OCI, post disposal of the cement business to Lafarge at the end of 2007, became a leading global nitrogen fertilizer producer and distributor through acquisition of existing players and investment in Greenfiled projects. EFC, which was acquired by OCI in 2008, manufactures granulated Urea with a total production capacity of 1.3 million tons per annum. The majority of EFCs output is targeted for export. OCIs overall production and distribution capacity is expected to reach 7.45 mtpa by 2012.    IFC funds will go to support OCIs growth plans for the fertilizers and construction operations as well as restructure the Groups debt financing towards a longer term, more stable structure that is suitable for the nature of the Groups operations.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed investment is expected to have the following development impacts: (1) revenue generation to the Egyptian government as both OCI and EFC through tax payments by OCI and EFC; (ii) contributing foreign currency income to the country through export revenues and dividends received from investments outside of Egypt; (iii) job creation, directly through a number of planned capacity expansions in the fertilizers sector, and indirectly through sub contracting parts of the construction works in many on the Group&apos;&apos;s projects; and (iv) contribution to food security through increased availability of fertilizers to support supply growth in primary agriculture.</narrative>
