   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Summary Of Project Information (SPI)       Project Name    Egypt-Unipak-Nile              Region    Central Asia, Middle East and North Africa        Sector       Project No008008   Projected Board DateMay 31, 1997   Company NameUnipak-Nile   Technical Partner and/or Major Shareholders    	The project is sponsored and will be fully owned by the Indevco Group, a major Lebanese industrial group established in 1953.  The Group is 100% privately owned by the Frem family.  It is involved in the paper and plastic sectors and has 23 affiliated companies in Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, the U.S. and Brazil.      Project Cost Including proposed IFC investment    	Total project cost is estimated at about US$19 million.  IFCs proposed investment is a loan of US$4.5 million.    Location of project and Description of site    	The project will be located in the 6th of October industrial city, 45km south of Cairo.    Description of Company and Purpose of Project    	The project consists of building a plant to manufacture corrugated boxes, for the local market, with a production capacity of 30,000 tons per year (tpy).  In recent years, the packaging industry in Egypt has witnessed a strong growth in line with the overall growth of the Egyptian economy.  Current local supply of corrugated boxes does not meet local demand, leading to imports.  By setting a manufacturing plant in Egypt, Indevco will achieve large savings in production and transportation costs compared to its present import activities and will allow it to become even more cost competitive in the Egyptian market.	    	The project will contribute directly to Egypts economy through job creation and  foreign exchange savings resulting from reduced imports.  IFCs main role would be to provide long-term funding in foreign-exchange to the project.  IFC will also play an instrumental role in helping the sponsor mobilize additional funding and complete the financial plan.  Finally, IFC helped structure the projects financing by advising the sponsor to have a more conservative leverage than originally envisaged.    Environmental Category and Issues    	This is an environmental category B project according to IFCs environmental review procedure.  Environmental, occupational health, and safety issues include: potential soil and groundwater contamination at the site, adhesives, liquid effluents and workplace air quality.  The project will be designed to meet all pertinent Egyptian regulations as well as World Bank guidelines.  The limited amount of fresh water, waste water as well as sewage generated by the plant will be handled by the industrial citys water treatment system which is shared by a number of companies.  In addition, the plant will have its own flocculation tank to eliminate material (mainly starch) which might cause clogging in pipes.  The new plant will be equipped with modern machinery and equipment which fully meet the highest requirements for working conditions.
