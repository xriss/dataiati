   <narrative xml:lang="EN">(1) Demonstration Effect of a South-South Investment: The Project will be the first PET project in Egypt and North Africa as a whole, a region which has the potential to become an important region in this industry. The Project is a South-South investment and its success could help GOE attract further FDI in the country.
(2) Promotion of Downstream Industry: The water and carbonated soft drinks bottling industries in Egypt, which comprise several small players, currently lack domestic sources of PET resin. This Project is expected to help these players improve the efficiency of their operations through savings in logistics costs.
(3) Diversification of export earnings: The majority of Egypt&apos;s foreign currency revenues currently come from natural gas sales and tourism. The Project is expected to contribute to the diversification of Egypt&apos;s export base.
(4) Employment Creation: The Project is expected to create about 450 permanent jobs and about 800 jobs during construction. In addition, it will provide indirect employment through use of local port facilities and supplies.</narrative>
