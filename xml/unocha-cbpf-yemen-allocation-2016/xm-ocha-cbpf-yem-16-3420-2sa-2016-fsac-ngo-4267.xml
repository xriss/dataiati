   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Life Makers Meeting place is proposing to implement a 7-month project that aims to increasing access of vulnerable persons in both IDP, returnees and host communities to food services through approach of food for work mechanism in Zabid, and al-Sukhnah districts &#x2013; Al-Hudayda governorate .

The project rationale is based on facts that target governorates have unmet food needs and there is evidence that little if any food services are available and reached mal-nourished children, pregnant and lactating women . 

The project also is built on the assumption that women and girls in both IDPs and host communities fall under more heavier burden of poverty and other forms of vulnerability and takes for granted that they have very low status more as IDPs and thus either unaware or unable to access food services. The project also assumes that there is still need for local level data collection on food vulnerability and types of mal nutrition services needed.

Working with the conceptual framework of Nutrition referral systems at national level for several years, LMMPO want to put into research the innovative approach to community based a control mechanism which heavily relies on community mobilization in support of identification and access of nutrition services. 
LMMPO in partnership with Hodeida Girls Association (HGA) will upscale the role of qualified community committees to serve as &#x201C;Food Community Control Committees amp Monitoring Committees&#x201D; composed of male and female members with very good food and agriculture experience and excellent local access and involvement to networks and traditional food actors, farmers, MOA, health/malnutrition centers, etc.).
The criteria of  selecting CCC are based on the following:

-	Living in targeted project area
-	Familiar with community peoples
-	Active and have good communication skills
-	Have good skills in reading and writing

LMMPO in cooperation with HGA and CCC will conduct the quick rapid assessment to define and select the project beneficiaries who are affected from mal-nutrition due to current conflict and prevailing negative practices. Some of beneficiaries will be attracted from host communities who likes to host their relatives for gain and benefit from food supports, for such cases LMMPO and HGA will add question in the QRA questionnaire for host communities if they continue work or stopped to indicate in food voucher mechanism. A condition is put for food assistance continuity for the IDPs host communities is that the host communities are encouraged to search for work or continue their current works, to get the food assistance. HGA will be responsible of conducting the raising awareness sessions with providing the feedback on suggestions, challenges with food related practices, also will be responsible on complaints mechanism. 
LMMPO and HGA had good experience in food distribution with other funded projects in Hodeida and Ibb governorates and the CCC are already established in 2014 and trained on how to deal with affected peoples, the refreshments trainings will be more specific in FSAC concepts and dietary diversity behaviors and Nutrition concepts. This committees will continue their responsibilities after project closure to define and follow up the families affected by mal-nutrition to guide them on how to treat their children or pregnant/ lactating women in OTP/TFC centers. The committees will have the mandate to conduct quick rapid assessment of both IDPs, returnees, and their hosting communities under supervision of LMMPO and HGA to identify unmet needs and encourage cases in need for food services. Also, the committee will serve as a reference data base for existing malnutrition cases in need for follow up and a source for newly identified cases in need for food.

The project will meet need of food monthly ration for 3 months through voucher mechanism and awareness raising activities for the other un-targeted beneficiaries will be carried out on mon</narrative>
