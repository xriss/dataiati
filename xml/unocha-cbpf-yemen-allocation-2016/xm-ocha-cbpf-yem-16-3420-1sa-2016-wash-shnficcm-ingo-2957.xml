   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Emergency WASH and Household NFI assistance to vulnerable IDPs and Host Communities in Taiz Governorate</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project seeks to meet the critical WASH and shelter NFI needs of 51,000 vulnerable IDPs and Host Community members in in Hayfan and Al-Mawasit district of Taiz governorate so that  lives are saved, suffering is alleviated, and human dignity is maintained. The project provides comprehensive emergency WASH assistance to the targeted households so as to enhance access to safe water and prevent the spread of water-borne diseases. Through the distribution of hygiene/dignity kits, the project also aims to increase communities&apos; knowledge and practice on key hygiene sanitation practices.  Moreover, the project will construct sanitation facilities in areas where there is high concentration of IDPs so that beneficiaries avoid the practice of open defecation.  The construction of latrines will not only reduce the incidences of diseases but will also reduce the protection risks faced by women. Although the WASH intervention will target and mainly focusing on IDPs, host communities will also be benefit from the intervention as both IDPs and their host communities share water system facilities. This is seen as an essential &apos;do-no-harm&apos; approach and more sensitive to the possibilities of conflict.

Meanwhile, this project also aims to enhance the availability of shelter NFIs to the most vulnerable IDP households who are in dire need of NFIs through the provision of in-kind emergency shelter NFI assistance for 5,100 households (35,700 Individuals).  Thus, CARE will distribute shelter NFIs in kind worth $110 for each household.

The project, in collaboration with the relevant stakeholders, will establish community committees and develop beneficiaries&apos; selection criteria so as to overcome possible inclusion and exclusion errors. The criteria shall include, but not limited to, female-headed households, child/elderly headed households, households without productive assets, and households with no income. The project shall ensure that vulnerable IDP and host men, women, boys, and girls have equal access to services through taking into consideration of their specific needs of each group. Although most of the activities are meant to benefit all gender groups, some of the project activities such as distribution of dignity kits shall target women only. The project will also build upon the existing feedback and complaint mechanisms and ensure that women, men, boys, and girls all have equal access.

CARE will partner with  Tamdeen Youth Foundation (a local implementing partner) to implement part of project activities. The local implementing partner will mainly be engaged in three main interventions: formation of community committees and selection/training of community volunteers hygiene promotion activities and distribution of WASH NFIs to the targeted households. In collaboration with CARE and other relevant stakeholders, Tamdeen Youth Foundation will establish/form community committees comprising of members from different segments of the community. In addition, it will implement the hygiene promotion component of the project through preparing IEC materials (brochures, leaflets, posters) in collaboration with CARE&apos;s WASH Center of Expertise. In addition, the local IP will conduct pre-KAP survey to guide the project to identify the gaps in knowledge, attitude and practices among beneficiaries with related to WASH, consequently, the appropriate messages will be prepared accordingly.  It will also be responsible for distribution of WASH NFIs, conducting of hygiene promotion sessions, as well as procurement/distribution of shelter NFIs to the targeted households. Tamdeen Youth Foundation is also responsible for follow-up of the proper utilization of NFIs and also monitoring of the changes in household&apos;s behavior towards key hygiene practices. The local IP will submit periodic progress reports on the implementation of project activities to CARE. CARE will also provide capacity building support (such as training ) to the partner.</narrative>
