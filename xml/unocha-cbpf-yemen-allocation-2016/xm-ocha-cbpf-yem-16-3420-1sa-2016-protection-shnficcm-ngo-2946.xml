   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Provision of Community Based Protection Referral Networks Support for IDPs and their Host Communities in Al-durihmi district in Al-Hodidah governorate and Amran city district in Amran governorate.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Yemeni Family Care Association (YFCA) is proposing to implement a 10 -month project that aims at increasing access of vulnerable persons in both IDP and host communities to quality protection services in Al-durihimi district &#x2013; Al-Hodidah governorates and Amran city  district in Amran governorate.

The project rationale is based on facts that both target governorates have unmet protection needs and there is evidence that little if any protection services are available.  There are large numbers of women and children in need for protection and who reside mainly within host families. The project also is built on the assumption that women and girls in both IDP and host communities fall under more heavier burden of GBV and other forms of vulnerability and  takes for granted that they have very low status more as IDPs and thus either unaware or unable to access protection services. The project also assumes that there is still need for local level data collection on protection vulnerability and types of protections services needed.

Working with the conceptual framework of protection referral systems at national level for several years, YFCA want to put into experiment the innovative approach to community based referral mechanisms which heavily relies on community mobilization in support of identification and access of protections services. YFCA in partnership with Yemeni Women Union (YWU) will upscale the role of previously qualified community committees to serve as &#x201C; Community-based Protection amp Monitoring Committees- CPMCs&#x201D; composed of male and female member with very good protection background and excellent local access to  networks and traditional protection actors ( Local councils, justice, health centers,  police, etc). CPMCs will have the mandate to conduct rapid assessment of both IDPs and their hosting communities to identify unmet need and to enter cases in need for protection services in a Community-based Protection Database (CPD). CPD will serve as a reference data base for existing protection cases in need for follow up and a source for newly identified cases in need for services. The data base will generate monthly reports that track referred cases and these will be disseminated to relevant clusters and feed into existing data management tools such as GBV management information system and  MRM.

A local network will be formed with CPMCs in its core to encourage recording and referral of cases from community level to service delivery points ( Protection clinics in YFCA centers and Women Shelters in YWU branches) near to target districts.


The project will support the completion and readiness of protection clinics and child-friendly spaces as well as equipping of mobile clinics that will facilitate reach of identified protection  cases to service delivery points.

CPMCs will facilitate community based protection sessions that will engage both IDPs and host community members in dialogue on local protection issues and mobilize support to the referral pathway and network. These forums will enable awareness raising on protection issues and also inform on available protection services. These sessions are also expected to reduce tensions between host and IDP  populations and may result in marked reduction in GBV and childe abuse cases.

NFIs that respond to need among both host and IDP communities will be distributed in service delivery points as an incentive for women and girls to report in data base and seek protection services. It is expected to better their position in their families as well as their status in host communities.</narrative>
