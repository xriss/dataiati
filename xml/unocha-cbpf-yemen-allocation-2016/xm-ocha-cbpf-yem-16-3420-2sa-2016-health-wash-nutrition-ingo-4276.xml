   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Integrated Child and Maternal Health, Nutrition and WASH Emergency Response in Amran and Sana&#x2019;a Governorates</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">SC is proposing an integrated health, nutrition and WASH project in Amran and Sana&#x2019;a governorates. The project aims to:
- Improve access to quality life-saving primary health care services with preventive and curative interventions 
- Provide treatment of acute malnutrition among children 6-59 months and pregnant and lactating women (PLW)
- Promotion of optimal infant and young child feeding practices to PLW
- Micronutrient supplementation for children 6-59 months and deworming for children 24-59 months
- Support the affected IDPs and communities with access to safe water, sanitation and gender sensitive hygiene promotion awareness on cholera prevention. 

Health, nutrition and WASH will provide services through the same platforms and to the same communities with an integrated approach. Based on the UNICEF conceptual framework for malnutrition, insufficient health services and unhealthy environments are major underlying causes of malnutrition. Alongside community based management of acute malnutrition (CMAM) and infant and young child feeding (IYCF), SC will support improved access to health, especially for children and PLW. WASH activities will improve access to water, sanitation and promote general hygiene. Improved water and hygiene can also contribute to reduce incidence of diseases such as diarrhea which may lead to acute malnutrition especially among children. Per November 10, 2016 update, 84 Cholera cases are confirmed and 56 people have died. The project will have joint mobile teams to provide health and nutrition services at the same time and children U5 and PLW who come for medical consultations will be screened for acute malnutrition. All malnourished children will be checked for medical complications. Women coming for other health services (e.g. family planning, ANC and PNC) will receive counseling on IYCF. SC will link the distribution of micronutrients with reproductive health services and child vaccination services. Community health volunteers (CHVs) will be trained on nutrition and linked topic on health and WASH that help to improve nutrition status. At community level, CHVs will deliver integrated health, nutrition and hygiene messages. The integration will also contribute to the capacity building for both CHVs and medical health workers to deliver essential public health services. The training will include integrated management of childhood illness, CMAM amp IYCF and operation and management of WASH facilities.

Through this project, SC aims to reduce the morbidity and mortality of children and their families including the reduction of malnutrition focusing on both IDPs and host communities with respect to different gender segregated groups. While the program aims to focus on emergency services provided across health, nutrition and WASH, it is critical that support is provided to strengthen public systems in different locations to enhance the ability of governorates to support the needs of the displaced and host population.

Under Health, SC will support 3 fixed health facilities (HFs) and 3 mobile teams - 1 in Amran and 2 in Sana&#x2019;a. Each mobile team will cover 5 sites. With the 3 fixed HFs, this brings the total service delivery points to 18. Service delivery for Nutrition will focus on interventions for malnutrition (MAM) for children 6-59 months as well as treatment of acute malnutrition for PLW through targeted supplementary feeding program (TSFP). Under WASH, SC proposes water trucking for 200 IDP households for 30 days, ensuring water quality by conducting the chlorination of the water source (if needed), rehabilitation of water points (such as piped water points or unprotected dug wells), rehabilitation of WASH facilities at health clinics and schools, distribution of water storage buckets, water ceramic filters, Yemen WASH Cluster standard basic hygiene kits and hygiene awareness sessions which will include a focus on Gender Based Violence (GBV) together with Cholera prevention message</narrative>
