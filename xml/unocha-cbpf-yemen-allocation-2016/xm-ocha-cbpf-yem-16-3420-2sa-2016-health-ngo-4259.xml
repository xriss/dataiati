   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Over the period of this project YFCA plans to provide lifesaving health assistance to 47520 direct beneficiaries mostly from the vulnerable groups of children under 5 and mothers via operating 4 emergency mobile teams EMMTs in Alhudaidah governorate - Bait Alfaqih and Alduraihimy districts- and Hajjah governorate- Wadhrah and Najrah districts as a part of consortium project for humanitarian assistance of people in need at the targeted 4 districts with THFY who will carry out the nutrition component and NFDHR who will implement the WASH component . The purpose of this project is to provide the integrated health services that contribute in improving the nutritional status of children under 5 and PLWs at the targeted 4 districts, which were identified by the nutrition cluster among the priority districts of acute malnutrition emergency level. In addition to the available secondary data about the health and nutrition situation at the targeted areas, YFCA had conducted a rapid needs assessment which reflected the accurate primary data about the health needs for the health facilities and their catchment areas as well. According to the data collected and analyzing findings YFCA humanitarian team in coordination with its partners in the consortium designed the health interventions plan to complement the rest two component activities towards achieving the purpose of improving the nutrition status of the most vulnerable groups in the targeted locations. For YFCA,  this will be the second experience in implementing health assistance using EMMTs modality as the first humanitarian actor in Yemen who applied this modality in Altaizziah district (ongoing project). The health service package includes wide range of primary and secondary health care to beneficiaries and will be conducted mostly by outreach activities at the second and third levels of the catchment areas of the targeted 4 health centers in the four districts covered by these project interventions. Minor part of the teams activities will be conducted in the health centers once or twice a week in order to help those health centers to cope with the huge hardships they are facing due to accumulative political, security and financial shortage reasons. The management of this project will be taken according to the highest standards and will be guided by the donor requirements and SPHERE standards furthermore YFCA will be in a close coordination with all stakeholders at the central and field levels benefiting from its robust partnership and relations with the vast majority of humanitarian and developmental actors. The smooth and effective accessibility that YFCA enjoys with will be for the great benefit for a quality delivering for the respective activities of this project as per the timeline set. The gender and protection mainstreaming is one of the main pillars guided this proposal developing and will be realized on the ground while managing and implementing the package of interventions under this project.</narrative>
