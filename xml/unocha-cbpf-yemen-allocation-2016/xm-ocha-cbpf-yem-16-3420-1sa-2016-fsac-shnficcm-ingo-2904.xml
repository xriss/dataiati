   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Emergency cash and household NFI assistance for the most vulnerable IDPs and host communities in  Hajjah Governorate</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project is designed to meet the critical and immediate food, non-food items, and shelter NFI needs of the most vulnerable IDP and Host households who lack any means of income to purchase food, NFI or shelter items. The project seeks to provide an integrated emergency (unconditional and conditional) cash and shelter/NFI assistance to 19,250 individuals (5,583 women, 4,430 girls, 5000 men and 4237 boys &#x2013; based on current population breakdowns) in the districts of Aslem and Ku&#x2019;aydinah in Hajjah Governorate. The project aims to improve the immediate household access to food for the most vulnerable and food insecure IDPs and their host communities through unconditional and conditional cash transfers. The project will also enhance the availability of household NFIs to the most vulnerable IDPs who are in dire need of these items.
Given the high level of vulnerability, in the first 2 Months, the project is designed to provide unconditional cash grants so that these families immediately can access the needed food, NFI and shelter items. After the 2 Months, IDP and Host families that can&#x2019;t engage in physical labor activities (labor-poor families) such as families headed by the elderly, disabled persons, children or pregnant women will continue to receive unconditional cash transfers. However, families in which at least one family member can engage in physical labor activities, will be provided with conditional cash transfers/cash for work (CFW) activities. Based on CARE&#x2019;s current assessments  this split will likely be 30% unconditional and 70% conditional (CFW). The CFW activities to engage in will be identified and prioritized by IDP and Host communities together. This will encourage ownership and sustainability. Given the vulnerability of both IDP and Host communities, the CFW activities will focus on small-scale activities that don&#x2019;t require heavy labor activities or equipment.  
The maximum amount paid per day for CFW activities will be pegged to the minimum expenditure basket endorsed by the Cash and Voucher Technical Working Group (CVTWG) and each household will be provided with $ 98/month which is 80% of the minimum staple food basket in Yemen. Market prices in each target area will be closely monitored to ensure cash payments are not having an adverse inflationary effect on local markets. If inflation as a result of the activity is detected then the project will adapt accordingly, such as having a phased approach to payments.
With regard to household NFIs, the target beneficiaries are IDP households and CARE will distribute household NFIs in kind of worth $110 for each household. 
The project, in collaboration with the relevant stakeholders, will establish community committees and develop beneficiaries&apos; selection criteria so as to overcome possible inclusion and exclusion errors. The criteria shall include, but not be limited to, female-headed households, child/elderly headed households, households without productive assets, and households with no income. The project shall ensure that vulnerable IDP and host men, women, boys, and girls have equal access to services through taking into consideration of their specific needs of each group.
CARE will partner with  Al-Khair Association (a local implementing partner) to implement part of project activities. The local IP will mainly be engaged in nutrition promotion activities and distribution of shelter NFIs to the targeted households in some project operational areas. The local partner will implement the nutrition promotion component of the project through preparing IEC materials (brochures, leaflets, posters). It  will also be responsible for procurement/distribution of shelter NFIs to the targeted households in some of the project operational areas. Al-Khair Association  will submit periodic progress reports on the implementation of project activities to CARE. CARE will also provide on-going technical support and capacity building support (i.e training ) to the partner.</narrative>
