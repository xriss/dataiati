   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project contributes to protection of conflict affected communities especially the most vulnerable population of women, men, boys and girls. The project is targeting the most vulnerable IDPs and host communities in Alsafra,a, Sa&apos;ada city, and Sihar Districts, Sa&apos;ada governorate. The project targets one of the thirteen prioritized governorates identified by the YHPF, 2016 first standard allocation, which is Sa&apos;ada. The project is focusing on protection response and is designed to significantly ensure gender equality. Selection of beneficiaries is based on agreed upon criteria (between stakeholder committee, NFDHR and local concerned authorities) that is in line with Sphere standards where priorities are given to most vulnerable including women, girls, boys and people with disabilities. Gender is mainstreamed via the project form the start to the end.By the end of the project, 14,652 individuals of men, women, boys and girls will have access to protection services. 
NFDHR is going to implement the project activities in integrated way with planned health project in the targeted governorate. The project is designed to significantly ensure gender equality. Selection of beneficiaries is based on agreed upon criteria (between stakeholder committee, NFDHR and local concerned authorities/organizations) that is in line with Sphere standards where priorities are given to most vulnerable including women, girls, men and boys , as well as, people with disabilities. By the end of the project, about 14652 individuals (2922 men, 5047 women, 3290 boys, 3393 girls) especially SGBV survivors will access the psycho-social, legal service and cash assistance or refer to appropriate services. 
Updating of mapping activity to identify valid protection and non-protection services providers is going to be implemented in the targeted districts. Training of valid and selected services providers on SOPs and building partnership with them in order to ensure that the referred cases access the appropriate services, then conducting awareness for men, women, boys and girls on referral mechanism and how to access other services of the project with integration of mine risks messages among the awareness sessions. NFDHR will establish mobile psycho-social support unit to provide the psycho-social support services to beneficiaries from IDPs, returnees and conflict affected communities. NFDHR will also identify GBV cases and support them with legal support. As some referred cases need further protection assistance, cash assistance will be supported to the most vulnerable protection incidences.   (All referred cases and project&apos;s activities will be followed up by project team to ensure the referred cases had the access and to achieve the project&apos;s indicators appropriately. NFDHR also complies with HPF communication and visibility guidance note to reflect lesson learned and success stories.
NFDHR is very keen to implement such kind of projects. We have already find response mechanism for the services. Mapping activity will provide us with the information necessary for referral. Awareness on referral mechanism will be conducted by protection committees members to inform the beneficiaries of the available services. Committees will inform the SGBV survivors and refer them. Vulnerable beneficiaries need psycho-social or legal support will refer to project, since we are providing these services in the project. Beneficiaries need primary health care will be referred to the already existed NFDHR medical team. Other needs, which are not provided by project, will be referred to selected services providers who we will build partnership and coordinate with, and train them on SOPs. Referred survivors who need some protection measures will be assisted by cash assistance, such as cash assistance for paying services&apos; costs of admissions, transportation to the places of services and fees for medicines of mental or psycho-social intensive cases.</narrative>
