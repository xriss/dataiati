   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The objective of the proposed project is to contribute to reduced morbidity and mortality through health and nutrition services among conflict affected communities in Al Dhale&#x2019;e and Al Hudeidah. The project will ensure that conflict affected communities have increased access to essential health and reproductive health care through three mobile health teams and support to one emergency obstetric care facility in Al Dhale&#x2019;e and one in Al Hudeidah that EmONC facilities are equipped with appropriate equipment, drugs and medical supplies, and incentives are provided to selected staff to enable the provision of basic and comprehensive emergency obstetric care services and that Women and girls have safe and equal access to services, and find the support they need when they experience GBV. MHT staff will be trained by psychological specialists to assess/screen the mental health and psychological status of individuals at risk, particularly of those who have experienced trauma and psychological distress during the conflict, and provide information and referrals for appropriate treatment. The project will provide support to secondary health care. In order to improve access of women to skilled deliveries, the emergency obstetric and newborn care (EmONC) unit of Al Dhale&#x2019;e hospital will be provided with required essential drugs. The EmONC facility will be provided with solar panels to maintain the life-saving services during electricity outrages. Minor rehabilitation will be also provided. 

The proposed project will contribute to the reduction of both morbidity and mortality due to malnutrition among vulnerable communities in the targeted areas through supporting the MoPHP to implement and scale up community-based management of acute malnutrition (CMAM). The project aims to increase coverage and access to the prevention and treatment of both severe and moderated acute malnutrition (SAM/MAM). The intervention will also i
The proposed project will contribute to the reduction of both morbidity and mortality due to malnutrition among vulnerable communities in the targeted areas through supporting the MoPHP to implement and scale up community-based management of acute malnutrition (CMAM). The project aims to increase coverage and access to the prevention and treatment of both severe and moderated acute malnutrition (SAM/MAM). The intervention will also include vitamin A supplementation and de-worming as well as promotion of optimal infant and young child feeding (IYCF) practices.  The proposed nutrition activities will be implemented through an integrated approach, working closely with the IRC health team to provide life-saving treatment for acute malnutrition in the targeted district of Qa&#x2019;ataba in Al Dhale&#x2019;e Governorate and in Al Duraihimi and Al Faqeeh districts of Al Hudeidah Governorate through community-based management of acute malnutrition (CMAM) targeting children under five and pregnant and lactating women (PLW). Through engaging District Health Officers, nutrition coordinators and managers and as well as the director general (DG) of health and key community figures in their respective governorates to ensure proper coordination, community participation and appropriate response to the real needs of the affected communities. The project responds to the increased need for coordination in the targeted Governorates among humanitarian actors and the Health District partners as well as the need to improve nutrition surveillance to ensure that an appropriate response is provided. To guarantee quality of services, formal training and ongoing field support visits will be taking place throughout the project cycle. 

The project will work with Responsiveness for Relief and Development (RRFD) in Hudeidah, a national organization that already has a foot print in these communities where they have been providing emergency support and working directly with community volunteers and key figures to address the critical need in the targeted areas.</narrative>
