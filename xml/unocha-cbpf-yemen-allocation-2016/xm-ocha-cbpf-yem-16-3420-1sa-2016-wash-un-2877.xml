   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Enhancing access to safe drinking water for vulnerable IDP and host communities in Taizz and Abyan governorates</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Since the beginning of the crisis in Yemen, the conflict continues reaching new areas in the country, and leading to the displacement of more families seeking safety and security. Due to the lack of access to conflict areas, some of the most vulnerable communities remain difficult to reach by much needed emergency assistance, while others could not be adequately assessed due to security constraints. While IDP needs vary from one location to the other, priority needs are outlined as those for food, Shelter/NFI and WASH support. According to the 8th Task Force for Population Movement (TFPM) report  ,issued in April 2016, the scale of the displacement seen in Yemen currently identifies 2,755,916 IDPs having fled their homes with few of their possessions as a result of conflict, resulting to their dire need of support in the hosting communities. The report indicates significant problems exist across the board in relation to access to water and WASH facilities, with some variation from one governorate to the other. IOM further notes major problems associated with accessing potable water are due to the damage to water infrastructure, as well as congregation of IDPs in locations that are not, or not adequately, served by water supply. In relation to WASH, the number of available toilets and showers are reported as limited  , especially when most IDPs tend to stay with Host families of large number of members. Issues with regard to waste disposal were also identified. 

In line with priorities identified through the Yemen Humanitarian Response Plan 2016, that are also outlined in the first 2016 HPF allocation, and based on continuous IOM Displacement Tracking Matrix (DTM), needs assessments conducted by IOM, UN agencies and other humanitarian partners, this project aims to reduce levels of morbidity and mortality among vulnerable populations displaced to and within Taizz and Abyan governorates, where critical WASH infrastructure has been destroyed or made inoperable by the conflict, or has become insufficient to address the needs of conflict-affected communities.

While durable solutions for water provision are found through water site rehabilitation or enhancement, IOM proposes to bridge the gap in access to safe drinking water in Taizz by trucking water for a period of 4 months to 14 sites in the districts of Salh, Al-Mudhaffar, and Al-Qahira, while assessing and rehabilitating three water sites in the district As-Shamayatayn, in order to improve access to water in these areas. In addition, IOM teams will complement the intervention through conducting hygiene and sanitation promotion campaigns and the provision of hygiene kits to most vulnerable 300 displaced and host community families in target areas. In addition to that, IOM plans to rehabilitate 2 water sites in Abyan (Lawdar district) where IOM has an established presence and access capacities, and where access to services has been most severely hampered by the conflict, with special attention accorded to women, boys, girls,the sick and elderly and those with special needs.</narrative>
