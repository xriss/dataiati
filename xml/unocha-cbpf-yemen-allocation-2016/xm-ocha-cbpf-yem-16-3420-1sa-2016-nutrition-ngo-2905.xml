   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Emergency life-saving Nutrition Assistance for the most vulnerable groups (Under 5 children and Pregnant  Lactating Women) among IDPs (Internally Displaced People) and Host Communities in Taiz and Hodieda Governorates in response to the urgent humanitarian needs.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project aims at contributing in saving the life of under five children suffering from severe acute malnutrition and improving the nutritional status of pregnant and lactating women among IDPs and Host communities in highly affected districts in Taiz and Hodieda Governorates (8th Report of Task Force on Population Movement - Apr 2016). We will work in full coordination with the Governmental authorities and nutrition cluster and sub-clusers in Taiz and Hodieda zones and adhere to the national CMAM protocol and the international standards.  
Using a case-finding and home -based visits screening, the project will provide its services through involving the community in management of acute malnutrition (CMAM) where community health volunteers (CHVs) will screen the children at homes and transfer the malnourished cases to the mobile OTPs for intensive treatment. CHVs will be trained on screening using MUAC and referral of malnourished cases among children under five years to the well-equipped mobile OTPs, as per the national volunteers&#x2019; guideline. In addition, they will conduct awareness sessions to the targeted communities in public gathering or during the home visits. The project will also contribute in capacity building of the health staff within targeted districts through training them on CMAM package by qualified national trainers using national CMAM guideline. 
CHVs will play a major role in finding malnourished cases (children SAM and MAM and malnourished PLW) though conducting home visits and screening the targeted beneficiaries using MUAC, meanwhile performing awareness session on IYCF, proper feeding practices and hygiene best practices. They will inform the targeted beneficiaries about the schedule of mobile team&#x2019;s visits to their localities and encourage them to attend the clinic to follow up those who are admitted into the program, to make sure there is no interruption in taking the therapeutic food and perform defaulters&#x2019; tracing activities. The mobile teams will visit every locality once a week to enroll and treat the malnourished U5 children (SAM and MAM) and PLW. Treat common child illnesses and communicable diseases provide reproductive health and family planning counseling session to the mothers and general health education to the public. Train the mobile teams&#x2019; staff and conducting awareness activities for promoting IYCF for the frequent visitors to health facilities especially pregnant and lactating women. The Sensitization workshops for the community leaders in the targeted locations will facilitate the implementation of the project activities.
The targeted locations were selected by the Governmental Health Offices (GHOs) in Hodieda and Taiz and in full coordination with sub-cluster coordinators to avoid any duplication with other humanitarian actors (as IRY in Hodieda districts) and to ensure the availability of well coordinated referral system for the SAM children with complication to be addressed. The SAM children with complications will be referred to the Therapeutic Feeding Centers (TFCs) in the following Hospitals:
- In Taizz: Al-Barh Rural Hospital, Yemeni Swedish Hospital, AlModhafar Hospital and MSF Hospital.
- In Hodieda: Abs Governmental Hospital. There is also hope to open TFCs in Al Zaidya District and in Al Qanawis District in Hodieda  soon.
We have now agreements with Taiz GHO and Hodieda GHO to provide us with the required malnutrition treatment that was provided by UNICEF to all GHOs including Plumby-Nuts and the essential medicines.</narrative>
