   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Emergency Integrated Nutrition Response for Acutely Malnourished Children 6-59 months, Pregnant and Lactating Mothers in targeted districts of Hodeida, Saada and Amran Governorates with high number of internally displaced persons in Yemen</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project is designed to complement an on-going WFP funded Community Based Management of Acute Malnutrition (CMAM) project in 9 districts of the targeted three governorates. It will address the existing gaps in the 51 IRY supported health facilities (HFs) which includes 17 new HFs for provision of an effective and integrated  live-saving nutrition interventions (CMAM) and other key primary health care services. The funds will also seek to improve Infant and Young Child Feeding (IYCF) and provision micro-nutrients supplementation  to  address under-nutrition. All project activities will be implemented in close collaboration with Ministry of Public Health and Population (MoPHP), UNICEF and WFP at all levels in both government and IRY supported HFs as well as their linked level 2 and 3 villages. 
The project will recruit additional HWs who will be posted to operationalize the closed HFs and as well as high volume HFs. They will be responsible for providing integrated package of nutrition services for children 6-59 months with severe and moderate acute malnutrition at HFs and at community levels i.e. malnutrition screening, admission of  severely and moderately malnourished under-fives (U5s) and pregnant amp lactating women (PLW) into various feeding programmes (TSFP amp OTP), immunization of all deserving cases vitamin A supplementation and De-worming of children 12 &#x2013; 59 months, and other key primary health services to the HFs&#x2019; catchment population to ease the current disease and injuries burden. The incentivized HWs will also carry out monthly integrated outreaches in far flung villages and those villages with high concentrations of Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) to offer a similar integrated nutrition package.
To strengthen community mobilization, active and passive screening for malnutrition, referral systems and defaulter tracing mechanisms, the project will give monthly incentives to CHVs based at level 2 and 3 villages of the targeted HFs. These CHVs will also disseminate key IYCF messages at all points of interaction with project beneficiaries and community at large through health/nutrition sessions. The incentives will be given during monthly review meetings where the CHVs will present their malnutrition screening, defaulter tracing, home visits and health/nutrition education reports. 
IRY nutrition team in collaboration with governorate and district health managers and nutrition focal persons in the respective districts will offer technical support and capacity build HWs for effective implementation of integrated  nutrition package activities. This will be achieved through classroom trainings, refresher trainings, on-job-training, mentor-ship and regular supportive supervision. Through WFP funds, IRY will provide logistical support to ensure that all nutrition supplies are safely stored and delivered on timely basis  to respective food distribution points - HFs. 
To address the low IYCF indicators, IRY with technical support from UNICEF will conduct classroom trainings to at least one health worker from the fixed health facilities as well as selected CHV in our areas of intervention. The trained HWs will then cascade the skills/knowledge (through nutrition sessions) to project beneficiaries during distribution days at their respective HFs with support from IRY nutrition/health promoters. They will also establish IYCF corners in their facilities for IYCF counseling to PLW who attends HF for any reason. The project also aims at establishing one Mother-To-Mother Support Groups (MTMSGs) in each of the targeted districts as a pilot whose members will undergo intense IYCF training/sensitization after which the mothers will be expected to share their knowledge/skills with other mothers in their locality. IRY will coordinate and collaborate with other organizations and government bodies at global, national and sub-national level, supporting the health and nutrition cluster at all levels.</narrative>
