       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Through the grantmaking support we gave, three organisations where able to come up with varied plans at different levels of sophistiction and in response tto their institutional gaps. HRI, an LBQ organisation in the post conflict region of Northern Uganda had a gap around capturing their Monitoring and Evaluation data on GBV both in terms of collecting data on a very personal subject, analysing it, and using it to make sense to their programme and hence part of their grant support went around developing a monitoring and evaluation frame work on the monitoring and evaluation of GBV among their constituency. Other organisations and plan include Smart ladies a female sex worker group in the sex work violence endemic country of Nakuru who came up with a strategic plan, and WOPEIN a trans and female sex worker group in tthe informal urban settlement of Bwaise in Kampala, Uganda.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Through the support through grants made to 3 sex worker led organisations in Kenya and Tanzania. 30 sex workers were empowered with capacity and knowledge on advocacy, law, online safety and security, as well as safety at work place and home leading to increase awareness on mechanisms of assessing and mitigating risks of or actual violence in relation to their work. A sex worker led organisation from Kenya engaged and participated in a crucial advocacy platform that is ICASA 2019.In so doing they strengthened their capacity for collaborative collective advocacy that raised their capacity in programming that is inclusive of violence prevention among Trans women sex workers. Support to another Kenyan sex worker led organisation facilitated the enhanced capacity of Kenyan sex workers to respond to violence using existing violence redress mechanisms.</narrative>
