   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Throughout the proposed 8-month intervention, Concern Worldwide (CWW) intends to address health and nutrition needs of most vulnerable population in Jebel Moon, Kerenik and Kulbus localities through establishing mobile clinic, temporary static facilities and strengthen service delivery in selected facilities to expand access and coverage. CWW also plans to allocate a portion of the Reserve for Emergency (RfE) funding to distribution of non-food item (NFI) kits in Jebel Moon, to synergize response efforts with those planned under another donor-funded emergency action. The interventions will target sedentary communities and Arab nomads alike, to address some of the frustrations stemming from perceived exclusion from humanitarian support and compliment the limited ongoing response in Jebel Moon, Kereinik and Kulbus localities. The proposed intervention is structured around 3 main sectors with specific interventions for locality: 

-	Health in Kulbus locality: CWW will support Ministry of Health (MOH) to run primary health care services in four static health facilities (selected due to the size and composition of the catchment areas &#x2013; i.e. higher estimated percentages of IDPs and Arab nomads). Expansion of services in the catchment area will be ensured through establishment of one temporary health clinic in one of the areas covered by the static health facilities as an expansion of services, and one mobile clinic. Basic primary health care services will be delivered to the most vulnerable individuals among conflict affected population including curative consultations, outreach immunization, procurement and supply of essential medicines and PHC materials, medical waste management in the health facilities through the construction of incinerators, disease/vector surveillance, capacity building, supportive supervision and awareness raising. National partner SAWA Sudan will also complement Concern&apos;s efforts in community engagement regarding the nutrition response (establishment of Mother Support Groups and training of lead mothers roll-out of Breastfeeding week).
-	Nutrition in Jebel Moon and Kreinik locality: Nutrition gaps will be addressed in Kerenik and Jebel Moon localities through establishment of 2 temporary clinics and 1 mobile unit in Kerenik, and 1 mobile clinic and one temporary clinic in Jebel Moon. Staffing will be seconded by MOH, with Concern providing supportive supervision on management of acute and moderate malnutrition, mass MUAC screening, capacity building training, transportation of supplies, referral of SAM cases with and without medical complications to different points of care according to needs, production/circulation of IEC materials, and overall/IYCF awareness raising. Furthermore, provision of hygiene kits will be guaranteed for SAM and MAM cases admitted in the OTP and TSFP sites. National partner SAWA Sudan will also complement Concern&apos;s efforts in community engagement regarding the nutrition response (establishment of Mother Support Groups and training of lead mothers roll-out of Breastfeeding week).
-	NFI distribution in Jebel Moon: Upon need and in complementarity with other funding, procurement and distribution of emergency NFI kits will be ensured in selected villages across Jebel Moon locality. The NFI component of the action will be carried out in cooperation with national partner SAWA Sudan. 

Protection against Sexual Exploitation and Abuse (PSEA) will be mainstreamed consistently across project activities given the high relevance vis-&#xE0;-vis identified needs. Training sessions for both Concern and SAWA Sudan project staff and other project stakeholders (e.g. suppliers, seconded MOH staff, etc.) will be held to inform on risks, preventive measures and feedback/response mechanisms. Awareness sessions will be also organized with beneficiaries across selected communities, residing in the catchment areas of the supported facilities and receiving NFI kits.</narrative>
