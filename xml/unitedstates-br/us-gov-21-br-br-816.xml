   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Assist special populations which may be vulnerable or at-risk on a temporary or chronic basis whose needs are not addressed under emergency humanitarian assistance or other programs. These include groups such as the disabled; orphans, children and at-risk youth; victims of trafficking; victims of gender-based violence; refugees, returnees, ethnic minorities, internally displaced or other socially excluded groups; the elderly; and female heads of household. Depending on circumstances, services may intend to protect groups; mitigate adverse conditions they face, or to remove barriers to help integrate them into society. Components may include measures to increase the capacity of local service and advocacy NGOs and/or professional social workers; to establish public/private service delivery partnerships as well as family and community focused service models; to establish effective referral networks; to develop appropriate service protocols and methods for screening prospective recipients; or to improve public understanding and sensitivity to the needs of the vulnerable.</narrative>

The United States will continue to assist in the deployment of new technologies and methods in the Ministry of Health to create an AIDS-free generation. Brazilian military officials will continue to receive training that fosters closer cooperation and the ability to implement shared strategies. Brazilian and U.S. security will be enhanced by combating transnational crime, improving the rule of law, and strengthening counterterrorism programs. Under the U.S.-Brazil Joint Initiative on Climate Change signed in 2015 and the USAID-GOB Development Objective Agreement on Biodiversity Conservation signed in 2014, the United States and Brazil are pursuing cooperation on environmental priorities, including biodiversity conservation and climate change mitigation and adaptation.</narrative>
