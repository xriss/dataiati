The WaSH kits will be issued to these pairs when they leave the TFU/ANC with the aim of enabling the mothers to continue the good practices of chlorinating drinking water and handwashing with soap in their respective households. The other reason for distributing these kits when they leave the TFU/ANC is also that, if they receive the kits when they are first admitted to the facility, some mothers do not stay for the full course of treatment of their malnourished children. For polygamous households, the kit will be given to the mother of the malnourished child admitted to the TFU.  This distribution will be preceded by a number of awareness sessions on correct use of the kits. The kits will be given to the targeted TFUs/ANCs in advance so that each mother -child p</narrative>
