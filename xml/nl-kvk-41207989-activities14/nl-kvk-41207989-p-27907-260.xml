Bridging the Gaps (2011-2015) has reached more than one million people with HIV prevention, treatment care and support that match their needs. In the second phase of Bridging the Gaps (2016-2020) we will build on the experiences and results of the first phase of the programme. Through our regional approach we conduct advocacy on a regional level, capacity strengthening of regional partners and networks and linking and learning in a region. We have identified three interrelated long-term goals:  
1. A strengthened civil society that holds governments to account 
2. Increased fulfilment of the human rights of key populations 
3. Improved SRHR and fewer HIV transmissions</narrative>

Key populations (sex workers, PWUD and LGBT people) are still hit hard and disproportionately by HIV, with a million new infections a year &#x2013; that&#x2019;s half the total worldwide. It is often difficult for key populations to have control over the risks they face because they have to deal with a toxic mix of legal, political and social factors which institutionalise stigma and social exclusion. As long as policies are not rights-based and key populations are criminalised, barriers to HIV services will remain and we will not reach the global target of zero new HIV transmissions by 2030. 
 
The Bridging the Gaps Alliance is a resilient and innovative health and rights partnership which works directly with key population organisations. The alliance brings together nine organisations Aids Fonds, AFEW, COC and Mainline, GNP+, INPUD, ITPC, MSMGF and NSWP, the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs and almost 100 implementing organisations.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Our mission is to achieve universal access to HIV/STI prevention, treatment, care and support for sex workers, LGBT people and people who use drugs. In our approach we want to create added value by focusing simultaneously on all three key populations and on the crossovers between them in one single programme. Moreover, we link human rights and health as well as community level work with regional and global advocacy. The alliance brings together nine organisations Aids Fonds, AFEW, COC, Mainline, GNP+, INPUD, ITPC, MSMGF and NSWP, the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs and 73 implementing organisations (both in-country and regional partners). Bridging the Gaps is one of the biggest programmes of its kind that works with and for the health and rights of key populations.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The programme aims to end the aids epidemic among key populations through 1) a strengthened civil society that holds governments to account, 2) increased fulfilment of human rights of key populations, and 3) improved SRHR and fewer HIV infections. The specific outcomes include: 
&#x2022; key populations are aware of their rights, health literate, mobilised and empowered to be meaningfully engaged in service delivery and advocacy 
&#x2022; key populations demand services that meet their needs, and demand an enabling legal, social and policy environment 
&#x2022; strengthened mechanisms for civil society to engage, monitor, and improve service delivery and upholding human rights 
&#x2022; enhanced communities&apos; advocacy and monitoring capacity to improve services and policies, and to uphold human rights 
&#x2022; stronger partnerships between civil society and governments result in more services that adhere to normative guidance 
&#x2022; a more enabling legal, social and policy environment 
&#x2022; sensitised and competent service providers are aware of normative guidance 
&#x2022; reduced stigma and discrimination, and increased respect and protection of (young) key populations&apos; rights, among policy makers and in society 
&#x2022; accessible, affordable, sustainable and comprehensive quality services tailored to the needs of (young) key populations</narrative>
