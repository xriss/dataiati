   <narrative xml:lang="EN">As part of the PITCH programme in Zimbabwe, Zimbabwe National Network of People living with HIV (ZNNP+) and Zimbabwe Young Positives (ZY+) will focus on strengthening organisational capacity of ZY+ so they can grow to be the strong voice of young people living with HIV. Together, they will raise awareness on stigma human rights, monitor and respond to SRHR violations, establish a mobile hotline for young people living with HIV and hold advocacy engagement meetings with the Ministry of Health to bring issues of young people living with HIV to the table.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">PITCH seeks to strengthen the capacities of local civil society organisations to advocate for sexual and reproductive health and rights, and uphold the human rights of key populations. Our work centres around key populations, adolescent girls and young women in nine countries in East, West and Southern Africa, South-East Asia, and Central Europe. These communities in many contexts carry the main HIV burden. At the same time, they are often neglected in the HIV response and face many barriers in accessing HIV and SRH services as well as human rights violations. PITCH addresses this urgent gap, and is reactive and responsive to local needs/urgencies that have been identified in its geographical foci.</narrative>
