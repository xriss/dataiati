   <narrative xml:lang="EN">As part of the PITCH project in Uganda, NAFOPHANU will raise awareness among adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) and young people living with HIV so they can demand services, advocate and inform communities about SRH, GBV and stigma and discrimination. NAFOPHANU will facilitate training of caregivers and health service providers so they can strengthen care and support for young people living with HIV. They will further organize district based and national level meetings with stakeholders and duty bearers on SRH services, policies and laws for AGYW and YPLHIV, as a platform and unified voice to lobby for their SRH.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">NAFOPHANU contributes to all ToC outcomes: 
S1.1 Communities are knowledgeable about health and rights for KPs and embrace efforts to address stigma and discrimination against KPs and AGYW. 
S1.2: Across the Healthcare systems (public, private and CSO-led) there is increased technical competency and improved attitudes to meet the specific SRHR needs of KPs and AGYW 
S2: Coordinated strategies for informed advocacy are developed, including identification of key stakeholders and opportunities for engagement on health and rights priorities for KPs and AGYW 
S3: Evidence is methodically collected for the purpose of evidence-based advocacy and research on health and rights priorities for KPs and AGYW 
M1: KP and AGYW-led CSOs country-wide are equipped with sufficient technical, human and financial resources to empower and mobilise their constituencies, both as individual organisations and as strong, united coalitions. 
M2: Evidence-based advocacy, targets the government, policy makers, police, judiciary, cultural and religious leaders, and healthcare professionals for full implementation supportive laws and policies for KPs and AGYW 
M3: Improved knowledge and understanding of human rights as well as existing SRHR policies and services empower and mobilise KPs and AGYW to demand and utilize SRHR services. 
L1: Friendly, quality, comprehensive, integrated HIV, SRHR and harm reduction services are available, accessible and acceptable in public, private and NGO facilities country-wide. 
L2: Community structures promote and protect SRHR for AGYW and effectively eliminate GBV, sexual exploitation/abuse and harmful cultural practises (including early marriage and FGM).

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">PITCH seeks to strengthen the capacities of local civil society organisations to advocate for sexual and reproductive health and rights, and uphold the human rights of key populations. Our work centres around key populations, adolescent girls and young women in nine countries in East, West and Southern Africa, South-East Asia, and Central Europe. These communities in many contexts carry the main HIV burden. At the same time, they are often neglected in the HIV response and face many barriers in accessing HIV and SRH services as well as human rights violations. PITCH addresses this urgent gap, and is reactive and responsive to local needs/urgencies that have been identified in its geographical foci.</narrative>
