   <narrative xml:lang="EN">By engaging with police and training them on human rights of sex workers and other key populations, police officers can play a key role in violence and HIV reduction amongst these groups. Aidsfonds will work with regional police institutions and national police institutions, such as South African Police Service (SAPS) and Mozambique Republic Police (PRM), to roll out the Dignity, Diversity and Policing training. This training was developed under Hands Off I under coordination of COC to educate police officers on rights of key populations. In the meanwhile, Hands Off partners and peer educators will seek and intensify relationships with police at community/ station level.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Prejudice, gender normative beliefs, as well as the criminalisation of sex work, sodomy and drug use make sex workers, LGBTI people and people using drugs vulnerable to stigma, extortion, physical and sexual violence by police. Research has shown that violence is a root cause of HIV and that police behaviour can have an adverse impact on HIV risks among key populations. Prejudice, gender normative beliefs, and the criminalisation of sex work make sex workers vulnerable to stigma and violence by police.

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">The number of male police officers attending training has increasd and been balanced because those that attend training are nominated which help to maintain a balance. General CSO/NGO facilitators reported improvements in knowledge, attitudes and proactises by police officers towards SW, PWUD and LGBTIQ when they seek help and services from police officers. It was reported by SW that some male police officers had gone an extra mile to help SW if a client had declined to pay for SW services. This is was a very usual act by a police officer. A good number of police officers also showed interest in joining Champions/Ambassadors groups in all the provinces. This is a good way ot starting peer to peer actions among police officers. It is sad that the programme lost the police officer due to COVID19 complications from Gauteng Provincial officer spear heading formation of Champions/Ambassadors group in Gauteng.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">There was one police officers reporting to be gender non-conforming. Although the ambassadors/champions groups does have transgernder it is hard to get training representatives when nominations are done. Champions/Ambassadors will be utilised to nominate transgender police officers to attend the DDP training in the provinces.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Training took place in Nelspriut (Mpumalanga), Bloemfontein) (Free State, Potchefstroum (Nortn West), Bisho (Eastern Cape), Hluhluwe (KZN), eThekweni (KZN), Newcatsle (KZN), Ugu (KZN), Ugungundlovu (KZN). The training focused on some rural areas of KZN, Mpumalanga, Free State, Eastern Cape and North West provinces. All the training was conducted from September to December 2020. Generally sex workers who shared their stories at some of the training reported improvement in knowledge, attitudes and practices by law enforcement officers. This maybe linked to the training and other interventions at the level of  Deputy Police Minister who has shown committment to improvement on human rights for SW and KPs in general.</narrative>
