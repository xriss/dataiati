   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In Debre Sina town, children below the age of 18 accounted for 48.5% of the total population. Many of these children are vulnerable and disadvantaged in terms of access to essential services such as education, health, shelter, nutrition, and parental care. There are an estimated 427 orphan children who lost either one or both of their parents due to various causes of death including HIV/AIDS. Taking into account the HIV risk factors prevalent in the town, it is believed that the number of children directly or indirectly affected by AIDS is large. As mentioned earlier, the town hosts 14 children living with HIV and there are 21 children orphaned by AIDS. The office believes that the number of HIV positive children and that of children orphaned by AIDS is extremely underestimated. An NGO had been providing school materials support to some needy children. However, the support lacked comprehensiveness and consistency so that it failed to bring significant change in the lives of needy children, as commented by the office of women and children affairs.

Young females make desperate decisions for earning and engage in activities that are socially unacceptable in their communities as well as risky for them. They engage in commercial sex work and informal prostitution as well as decide to get married as soon as they come across a man who wishes to do so with them. However, the marriages dissolves soon. The next alternative most of them take is commercial sex work. 

The majority of people in Debre Sina Town live on very low incomes that are derived from varieties of petty trade activities. The incomes derived from these sources are barely enough to cover the minimum requirements of households. Most children are under- and malnourished.  Women are hard working and have desirous to change but they are held back by lack of opportunities and access to financial resources. As a result they remain poor as well as their household members.</narrative>
