   <narrative xml:lang="EN">INSIDA (Inqu&#xE9;rito Nacional de Vigil&#xE2;ncia, Comportamento e Informa&#xE7;&#xE3;o) data indicates high levels of HIV and AIDS among adolescents and young people aged 14 to 24 years. Also, AGYW and YPLHIV face high levels of GBV and lack comprehensive information and access to quality services.

In 2018, AGYW partners intend to reach out to more young people in urban and rural areas bringing the approach of male involvement of adolescents and young people to break gender norms that perpetuate GBV. Partners will empower AGYW on HIV and SRHR and with leadership skills, through trainings and support groups. They will furthermore work with community and religious leaders and health service providers to provide and create friendly services, and will refer adolescents and young people to sexual and reproductive health services.

In Mozambique, there is often a lack of coordination between organizations working in the same (public health) areas, making it difficult to reach the desired results. The PITCH AGYW partners will work together, and will link up with others, to achieve clear and satisfactory results for AGYW and YPLHIV.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">PITCH seeks to strengthen the capacities of local civil society organisations to advocate for sexual and reproductive health and rights, and uphold the human rights of key populations. Our work centres around key populations, adolescent girls and young women in nine countries in East, West and Southern Africa, South-East Asia, and Central Europe. These communities in many contexts carry the main HIV burden. At the same time, they are often neglected in the HIV response and face many barriers in accessing HIV and SRH services as well as human rights violations. PITCH addresses this urgent gap, and is reactive and responsive to local needs/urgencies that have been identified in its geographical foci.</narrative>
