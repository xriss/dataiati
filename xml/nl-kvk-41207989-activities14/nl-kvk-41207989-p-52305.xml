In fact, police seem to be treating sex workers very harshly during the COVID-19 lockdown, especially if the find them working at night. Sex workers have continued to work in order to sustain their livelihoods despite the lockdown regulations and curfews imposed. Despite breaking the law, it id difficult to advise sex workers not to work because they have families that depend on their income.</narrative>
