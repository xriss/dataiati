       <narrative xml:lang="EN">100 kilogram bamboo seeds( B.tulda, B bamboos, D.lomgispathus and B.polymorpha) were procured and supported to 12 nurseries in Kenya and Uganda through Kenya Environment and Forestry Research Institute(KEFRI) and National Forestry Authority(NFA) in Uganda. Supported 24 small nurseries, ~2.75 million quality planting materials ready for plantation. Taxonomic research field data collection completed in Ethiopia and ToR developed for similar study for Kenya and Uganda. 2 tissue culture lab in Kenya and Uganda supported.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">During Year 1, the programme strengthened 36 nurseries against the overall programme of 35 nurseries. Moreover, 25 women and youth nurseries were established achieving 25 percent of the target. The programme procured around 1310.5 Kilogram of bamboo seeds from China, India and Ethiopia. The seeds procured from China(Dendrocalamus asper, D yunnanensis, and Bambusalonginternode)and India (Bambusatulda, Bambusapolymorpha and D strictus) belong to the sympodial bamboo species. The indigenous bamboo species: Yushaniaalpina or Oldeaniaalpina(Highland bamboo) and Oxytenantheraabyssinica(low land bamboo) were collected from Ethiopia. These seeds were distributed to the nurseries and portion of the indigenous bamboo species are stored in cold storage for further distribution. The large and small scale nurseries produced a total of 1,606,006 bamboo plant against the overall target of 4 million plants. 

Taxonomic classification study and DNA SNP marker identification study and tissue culture protocol development works are ongoing. Two scientists from Uganda who were trained during phase&#x2013;I on bamboo TC plants production and management were further supported virtually by tissue culture experts and the tissue culture protocol is streamlined to produce the bamboo plants of two species namely: Dendrocalamus asper and Bambusa vulgaris.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">The program supported 36 government including one private nurseries with hard support (seeds,&#xA0;planting materials, and hand tools. Currently, the nurseries are having around 1,800,000 quality planting plants for plantation in rainy season on the degraded land, river bank, and distribution to the farmers. Moreover, 90 kilograms of bamboo seeds (Bambusa bamboos; Dendrocalamus strictus) imported from India and 125 kilograms of lowland bamboo seed of lowland bamboo seed (Oxytenanthera abyssinica) collected in Ethiopia.&#xA0;KEFRI&#xA0;in Kenya and NaFORI in Uganda, tissue culture labs supported through established hardening center, virtual training with Indian scientists, lab renovation and chemicals. 42 small nurseries supported and produced 800,000 plants. Overall achievement till December2021: 36 nurseries are operational and having ~2Mns bamboo seedlings in stock. 72 small nurseries established. Taxonomic study in progress, and 2 tissue culture labs operational.</narrative>
