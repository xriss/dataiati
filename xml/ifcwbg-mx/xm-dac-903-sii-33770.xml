   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed investment consists of an approximate US$2.2 million straight equity for a minority stake in SalaUno (the Company) in order to finance the expansion of specialized eye care (cataract surgeries) in Mexico.  The purpose of the project is to provide specialized eye-care procedures to a large and underserved market in Mexico.  As such, it has exceptionally high development impact and a strong strategic fit for IFC.  The Company is expanding in a region with rising incidence of eye cataracts where the current supply has insufficient capacity to treat conditions that cause needless blindness.  The Project will also reduce geographic, economic and information barriers that prevent patients from restoring their sight.</narrative>
