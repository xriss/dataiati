   <narrative xml:lang="EN">1)	Job creation: Chiapas province is one of the poorest provinces in Mexico with limited supply of full-time employment opportunities.  To date, the Company has created approximately 1,000 jobs and will generate at least 1,000 additional direct jobs. 2)	Outreach: about 40 local fishermen from the local communities have seen their income and skills significantly improved as the Company assisted them in developing their own fish farms with annual production of up to 40 MT per annum for the larger farmers. Over 300 additional local fishermen will benefit from similar arrangements in Lake Malpaso. 3)	Health and education infrastructure: as a result of the Project, more families will have access to health and education support provided by the Company.</narrative>
