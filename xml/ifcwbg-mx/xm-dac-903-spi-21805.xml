   <narrative xml:lang="EN">TMM Purtos y Terminales, S.A. de C.V. (TMM PyT or the company), is a Mexican company, which operates the Manzanillo, Veracruz, Cozumel, and Progreso terminals in Mexico under concession contracts.  The company is currently ultimately wholly-owned by Carrix, Inc., a US-based port and terminal operator.  In May 2003, Carrix, through its Mexican subsidiary, SSA Mexico Holdings, S.A. de C.V. (the Borrower), acquired 51% of the outstanding shares of TMM PyT.  Combined with the remaining 49% of TMM PyT already owned by Carrix through a subsidiary, TMM PyT became a 100% owned subsidiary of Carrix.  IFC will provide up to $45 million in financing to the Borrower as part of a medium term facility that includes commercial bank co-financing under a Citibank syndicated loan (the Citibank Financing).  The financing will support the acquisition of 51% of TMM PyT by Carrix.    Manzanillo is one of the largest container ports in Mexico and is currently the only facility on the Pacific Coast of Mexico able to service the largest transpacific services.  TMM PyT began operating a single berth container terminal at the Port of Manzanillo in 1995 after winning a 20-year concession through a competitive bidding process.  It also provides stevedoring services for general cargo at the public terminal of San Pedrito within the Port of Manzanillo.  Since 1995, TMM PyT has significantly improved the ports productivity and helped increase Manzanillos share of Mexicos Pacific Coast container traffic from 51.4% in 1995 to over 90.6% in 2002. TMM PyT currently accounts for approximately 69% of containerized cargo moved in Manzanillo (the remaining cargo is primarily moved by the public terminal) and approximately 62% of total container traffic handled at Mexicos Pacific ports. The Veracruz port is located on the Gulf of Mexico and historically served as an entry point for Mexicos trade with European and Caribbean nations. In 1991, TMM PyT, through a competitive bidding process, won a 23-year concession to provide stevedoring and marine terminal services at Veracruz.      TMM PyT primarily handles automobiles for Volkswagen, which uses Veracruz to export production from its plant in Puebla, Mexico. TMM PyT also services other car manufacturers such as Ford, General Motors, Peugeot, BMW, Chrysler, Renault and Nissan.  Finally, TMM PyT operates two cruise line terminals at Cozumel (a small island off Cancun, Mexico) and Progreso (located near Merida, Mexico) after winning 20-year concessions (also through competitive bidding) in 1996 and 2000, respectively.  Cozumel is a popular destination for seven day cruises originating in the US while Progreso is a new Cruise ship destination and is currently being marketed to cruise lines in the US.</narrative>
