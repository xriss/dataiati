   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Demonstration effect:  Despite the fact that the State of Oaxaca houses one of the best wind resources in the world, up through 2008, Mexico had only 88 MW of installed and operational wind projects (not including those under construction).  The successful commercial financing of an additional 250 MW of wind capacity of the Eurus project will send a market signal to global windpower developers that the Mexican windpower market is viable and ready for scale-up, thereby helping to accelerate development of windpower potential in the State of Oaxaca.

Decreased emissions leading to improved local air quality and climate change mitigation:  The Project will displace fossil-fuel generation.  This will help reduce local air pollutants (SOx and NOx) and improve air quality for the local population.  It will also contribute to Mexicos climate change abatement efforts by displacing an expected 600,000 tCO2e per year.

Job creation/community development.  The local community, La Venta, who collectively owns the land surrounding the Project, will benefit through (i) significant sourcing of labor from local communities during the construction period, and overall job creation during the construction and operation period; (ii) community development programs undertaken at the Companys initiative; and (iii) direct payments from the Company to community member for use of land.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Eurus SAPI de CV (Eurus or the Company) is a special purpose vehicle incorporated in 2006 under Mexican law for the development, construction and operation of a 250.5 MW wind farm and associated transmission assets in the La Venta Ejido, Juchit&#xE1;n de Zaragoza Municipality of the State of Oaxaca, Mexico (the Project).  The Project will utilize 167 1.5 MW AW70 Class I turbines manufactured by Acciona Windpower (AWP), and benefits from an exceptional wind resource with high average wind speeds matched by few locations in the world.  Project construction is well advanced; to date, all 167 turbines had been erected, of which 110 (165 MW or 66%) have been connected to the grid and declared operational.  The substation and related transmission assets are complete.  

Eurus is 94% owned by Acciona Energ&#xED;a M&#xE9;xico S. de R.L. de CV (AEM), itself a wholly owned subsidiary of Acciona Energ&#xED;a S.A. of Spain (AE or the Sponsor).  The Project is being developed under Mexicos autoabastecimiento, or autogeneration, framework.  As such, the remaining 6% shareholding in the Company is owned directly and indirectly by Cemex M&#xE9;xico SA de CV (Cemex M&#xE9;xico), who is supplying itself with the Projects output pursuant to a 20-year power purchase agreement (PPA) with the Company.  Cemex M&#xE9;xico originally initiated development of the Project for a source of clean, low cost, fixed price energy, and selected AE to take over ownership and development of the Project in 2006.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Project is located in the State of Oaxaca, in the Isthmus of Tehuantepec approximately 10km north of Union Hidalgo, about 1km south of the La Venta municipality (the closest population), which communally owns the land in which the Project site is located.  The Company has entered into 30-year land lease agreements with the community.  The Project site comprises farmland and sparse tree lines along roads, fields and several small streams, and its design has taken into account ongoing farming activities and limited disruption on existing environmental features.  As such, it is expected that there will not be a large change in land use.</narrative>
