Project Cost Including proposed IFC investment    	The project cost is estimated at US$46 million and the proposed IFC investment consists of an A loan of US$14 million (for IFC&apos;&apos;s own account) and a B loan of up to US$4 million (for the account of participants).     Location of project and Description of site    	The project is based in Queretaro, 135 miles north of Mexico city.  The plant is located in the Benito Ju&#xE1;rez Industrial Zone, in the city of Quer&#xE9;taro and the facilities are situated on a terrain of 15.67 hectares of which only 7.18 hectares have been developed.    Description of Company and Purpose of Project    	Turborreactores is Mexicos sole service provider, and one of only two such plants in Latin America, for the overhaul and repairs of aeronautical jet engines.  The proposed project consists of: (i) rehabilitation and upgrading of the current facilities to enhance the plants efficiency; (ii) expanding the range of engine repair capability to access a larger market; and (iii) working capital requirements to support the operations.   	The project assists the country to diversify from its current export oriented manufacturing base into the high-tech service sector. The project would lead to a more balanced regional development in Mexico by diversifying from the automotive sector in the northern states, to a high-tech industry in a new part of the country.  The project is designed to improve the company&apos;&apos;s long-term competitiveness and depends critically upon long-term financing which is currently not available locally.  The proposed project will contribute toward several developmental impact objectives.  First, the project will encourage strong local private sector participation by promoting a healthy local enterprise in the overhaul and repair of aeronautical jet engines sector, a high tech industry in which Mexico has a natural market.  Assisting an export-oriented project will also contribute to an increase in Mexicos foreign exchange earnings.  ITR in collaboration with local educational institutions and technical institutions is providing vocational and professional courses to high school students in Quer&#xE9;taro and its commitment to the education and training of its workforce will help attract skilled and educated labor to the region contributing to its overall development.
