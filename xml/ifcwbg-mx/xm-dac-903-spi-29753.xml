   <narrative xml:lang="EN">By supporting Harmon Hall, IFC will have the following development impact: (i) expansion of access to high quality English education and primary and secondary education: Consolidation of Harmon Hall presence, as well as further expansion into new markets, will expand the availability of high quality English education in the country, which provides skills necessary to compete and advance in the national job market; (ii) creation of employment opportunities: as a result of its expansion, Harmon Hall hires additional teachers and sales personnel to serve its growing student base, thereby helping to improve living standards and contributing to human capital development; (iii) expansion of high quality training: Harmon Hall provides training support to all its personnel in order to ensure a healthy pipeline of high quality trained staff to serve its current and future schools; (iv) standard setting among English language schools: the high quality standards by which Harmon Hall operates will set a precedent in the English education market, which will generate pressure on other competitor schools to pursue accreditation and quality standards; (v) community engagement: Both K-12 and English schools provide scholarships to students who cannot afford the tuition.  Additionally Harmon Hall has begun to engage with public schools to provide the English program within their regular program. By doing so, more low income students will have access to quality English education which today is inexistent in the public system.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Harmon Hall was founded in 1966. Today Harmon Hall is the leading English language school chain in Mexico, with a network of 110 English schools in 63 cities and over 40,000 students in the whole system. Harmon Hall also owns and operates  K-12 schools in the interior of the country.
 Nexxus Capital Private Equity Fund III,  L.P. acquired 60% of HH in April 2008. Since then, the Company has implemented a series of measures to improve the operations and profitability of the Company, which have resulted in a significant growth of revenues and EBITDA generation.
The transaction represents an equity investment for IFC which consists of two components: (i) the purchase of the selling shareholders shares and (ii) a capital increase in Harmon Hall to finance the expansion plans of the Company for the next 18 months.</narrative>
