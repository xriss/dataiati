   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Alta Growth Capital Mexico Fund II, L.P. is targeting equity investments in 10-15 SMEs that will be supplemented with environmental, managerial and technical value addition.  Private equity-sponsored companies often adopt management practices (in environment and social, financial control, cost accounting, quality control, corporate governance, legal structure and tax reporting) that are better than those used by their local peers. If Alta Growth is successful and delivers developmental and financial results for its investors, it may be able to launch successor funds. Examples of successful, well-run private enterprises will contribute to encourage foreign investment in Mexico. The Fund is expected to contribute to a vibrant and sustainable private sector that will improve employment, trade balance, and public finances in Mexico. Finally, by attracting new investors to the private equity asset class &#xE2;local pension funds, insurers and investment companies, the Fund will help these companies to achieve higher risk adjusted returns as well as the implied benefits that private equity brings into their overall portfolio. The IFC team will measure and report on the following developmental impact indicators: 1) percentage of funding disbursed, 2) net/gross financial return, 3) number of jobs created, 4) annual growth sales, 5) annual growth EBITDA, 6) launching of follow-on funds, 7) tax paid to local governments, among other indicators.</narrative>
