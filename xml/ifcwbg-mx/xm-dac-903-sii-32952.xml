   <narrative xml:lang="EN">ABC Capital, S.A. I.B.M. (ABC Capital or the Bank) is a new financial entity resulting from various mergers and acquisitions, since it started operations in 2000 when it mainly targeted the construction industry sector. To further consolidate its growth strategy, in March 2011, ABC Capital started operating under the Mexican banking law with a clear strategy to tap into the Mexican SME segment, diversifying its loan portfolio while divesting from the construction and real estate industry. Today, ABC Capitals strength and differentiating product strategy is based on their low risk, standardized products (packaged products). Standardization allows credits to be processed through an in-house credit scoring model providing consequent cost efficiencies, low risk, high volume and high margin products.  Now a strengthened financial institution with over 800 employees and presence in 22 states in the country, its willing to expand its product offering and target markets. As part of their expansion plans and in line with market needs, the Bank is further focusing on the SME segment, through their specifically targeted lending products, launched to the market in May 2012.</narrative>
