  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Grupo Calidra (Calidra or the company) is an existing IFC client. The company is Mexico&apos;&apos;s leading producer of lime and lime-related products. The company produces construction hydrated lime, quicklime, dolomitic lime, chemical hydrated lime, and calcium carbonate products. Calidra operates twenty plants in Mexico and one in Honduras.   Calidra has approached IFCs for assistance in financing its capital investment plan from 2008 to 2010, consisting of:  - the modernization of some of Calidras production facilities;  - Calidras international expansion; and  - investments aimed at increasing Calidras energy efficiency.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed corporate financing package would be Calidras first loan for corporate uses as all its previous long-term loans, including IFCs were tied to specific investment projects. A good combination of sufficient available credit amounts, long tenor and reasonable costs to support its corporate financing needs will provide Calidra with the financial flexibility to undertake the investment program which is anticipated to contribute to:  - Immediately improve energy efficiency and mitigate environmental footprint:   Calidras investment program includes shutting down six obsolete, inefficient and highly pollutant kilns (part of a recent acquisition) and replacing them with state-of-the-art technology.  - Raise industry standards in terms of health and safety, environment, energy and cost efficiency.  With the implementation of environmental, health, and safety (EHS) management systems and procedures, the programs to mitigate EHS impacts, the assignation of dedicate personnel to handled these aspects a at corporate and plant levels as IFC requirement, and the initiatives to optimize raw materials, energy and water consumption, Calidra is helping to improve the air quality and raise the overall EHS performance of lime extraction and production in Mexico.  The recently acquired facilities are representative of the operations of the rest of the players in the industry (i.e. old technology, minimum environmental, health and safety programs and goals.)   - Increase usage of lime of lime for industrial usage:   Calidra produces a basic industrial product that supplies the construction, industrial and agricultural/food processing industries.  Calidra is increasingly targeting sectors such as glass making, water purification and treatment, thermal plants, and food and pharmaceutical industries, which can benefit from the greater use of lime but which in Mexico have historically used comparatively little lime.  Through a more efficient production of lime, several industries will benefit by having access to a higher quality product at competitive prices.</narrative>
