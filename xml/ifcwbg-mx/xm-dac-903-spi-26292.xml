   <narrative xml:lang="EN">IFC has been successfully involved in the evolution of the Housing Finance sector in Mexico, by covering the housing finance chain in full: from the supply side to the mortgage origination and secondary markets development. This, together with the environment of macroeconomic stability of the country during the last ten years, and the Governments agenda to prioritize the housing sector, have boosted the demand for housing from the low and middle income population.  By providing direct financing to the housing developers, IFC will be complementing its existing strategy in Mexico, by further developing the housing sector from the final product supply side of the chain. The project will contribute to the development of supply of housing in Mexico to match the already originated supply of mortgage loans.  The IFC has selected Vinte as the first developer worldwide to be granted with direct funding given the potential impact on the companys growth, and to help it implement new initiatives that would improve low and mid income families way of living.    The proposed facility can be replicated with several other second tier housing developers, and can therefore have a demonstration effect. The facility will contribute:  - to facilitate increased competition in the housing sector by promoting the growth of mid-sized developers that currently face substantial financing limitations compared to a limited number of large publicly-traded home builders; - to promote the development of more efficient financing products to the sector by SOFOLES and commercial banks; - to encourage improvements from the eco efficiency perspective, which could generate environmental and financial benefits for the developer and the house owner.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed project consists of an IFC long term revolving facility of up to $12.5 million equivalent Mexican peso revolving facility to finance its working capital requirements for the construction of low income housing developments. To complement the financing of the companys investment plans for the next three years, the company is also inviting IFC to make an up to $5.0 million equity investment in the company that will support the companys long-term investments.  Despite improvements in the access to finance for the housing sector in Mexico, mid-size housing developers still continue to face constraints in accessing medium to long-term financing. Their options are limited to project specific bridge loans offered by SOFOLES (local mortgage financial institutions), which are very rigid.  This lack of alternatives results from the financial markets lack of interest in lending on a corporate basis to second tier housing companies, in addition, the issuance of commercial paper or bonds on the domestic market is not a cost-effective financing alternative for mid size housing companies due to investment amounts required from institutional investors and the setup &amp; maintenance costs of such capital markets structures.</narrative>
