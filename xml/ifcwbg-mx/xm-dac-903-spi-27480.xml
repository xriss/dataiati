   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Nasofts services contribute to the adoption of better business processes and accounting reporting compliance for enterprises, especially SMEs.  The typical business application consulting services implementation includes a review, and as appropriate, improvement of the clients accounting practices, internal controls and reporting requirements.  Nasofts offering makes it possible for SMEs to adopt top enterprise software applications such as SAP and Oracle, and the associated better practices at an affordable and cost effective manner, as SMEs are able to pay for the usage without major investments in expensive licenses and IT infrastructure.  The project will help catalyze the emergence of a strong regional player in the IT services segment with the potential to establish joint ventures with other IT service companies in the region, replicating many of the solutions already in place in Mexico City.  Nasofts services are being scaled up across and replicated in other cities in Mexico and Central America.  Companies similar to Nasoft contribute to the growth of and innovation in the IT sector.  The IT sector is a creator of high quality employment opportunities, due to the highly skilled labor requirements for delivering world-class, competitive products and services.  Nasoft offers college graduates an opportunity to apply their talents and knowledge to innovative technical solutions in many sectors (such as retail, banking, and manufacturing), thereby creating a domestic alternative to brain-drain foreign destinations.  Nasoft already has a Central American office in San Jose, Costa Rica, from where regional sales of business applications consulting services are coordinated.  The use of proceeds from this project includes penetrating further the Central America market.  As data communications infrastructure improves in the region, Nasoft will consider establishing regional hosting centers from where an outsourcing offering will be possible, benefiting SMEs in the region, some potentially located in IDA countries and frontier regions.</narrative>
