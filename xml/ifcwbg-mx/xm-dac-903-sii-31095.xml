Edilar supports teachers from the public sector by facilitating the access of teachers to training and training materials. Edilar has a large geographic presence and reaches public sector teachers in rural areas. The project will finance the Companys working capital needs for the next three years, as it expands its client base to further cities and states within Mexico.

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Provision of quality education material: Edilar plans to expand its product offering and geographic reach further. This will have a strong development impact by providing public sector teachers with books, teaching material and ongoing training financing and thus enhancing the quality of the Mexican public education system. The Project is expected to reach over 80,000 teachers in 2017, which represents more than two million students reached annually.  Private-public collaboration: Edilar works hand in hand with the Mexican Ministry of Education and teachers union by (i) providing certified educational content for K-12 public sector teachers, (ii) supporting the ongoing training and provision of teaching materials, and (iii) providing financing alternatives to public sector teachers for certified training purposes.   Frontier regions: Edilar is present in 27 Mexican states, of which 6 are frontier states, providing education material to school teachers in rural areas, some of which are only accessible by 4x4 automobiles. These school teachers would have no other possibility of acquiring books, teaching material or training.</narrative>
