   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Founded in 2001, Vinte Viviendas Integrales S.A.P.I. de C.V., (Vinte or the Company) has become a strong performing homebuilder company focused on affordable entry-level and middle-income housing in Mexico. Vinte is conservatively managed, has a solid reputation, a sound track record and it has played an active role in the development of Mexicos homebuilding sector. Vinte&apos;&apos;s strategy is to differentiate itself from other housing developers by offering functional and attractively designed homes, community infrastructure not easily available in this segment, and good location within or very close to urban centers.  Vinte is a holding company that consolidates six operating subsidiaries: (i) Promotora de Viviendas Integrales, engaged in the promotion of the developments; (ii) Urbanizaciones Inmobiliarias del Centro, engaged in research and development of housing, including technological, environmental, and design aspects; (iii) Edificaciones e Ingenieria del Centro, engaged in urbanization, design and construction activities; (iv) Conectividad para el Habitat, engaged in the distribution of computers, internet, and related services; (v) Vinte Administracion, Dise&#xF1;o y Consultoria, engaged in human resources management; and (vi) Comercializadora de Equipamientos y Mobiliarios para la Vivienda, engaged in the sale of home equipment such as floors, closets, furnitures and solar panels.  Vintes operations include land acquisition, house design and housing development planning, construction, and sales. Vinte offers several housing products within the affordable entry-level and middle income segments. Most of Vintes sales are concentrated in the middle-income segment.  The purpose of the project is to finance the construction of 2,000 Excellence in Design for Greater Efficiencies (EDGE) homes in middle to low income housing developments in Mexico during the next five years. This Project will address a long-standing housing shortage in Mexico by providing good quality affordable housing in rapidly urbanizing areas of the country.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">a.	Increase green-housing supply: The Project will not only help to reduce the current housing deficit but will provide green-housing to its consumers, which is expected to carry financial benefits to its tenants through savings achieved from lower utilities costs. It is also expected to have a strong demonstration effect on the financial feasibility of building homes under green standards throughout Mexico. The project will also lead to a 30 percent reduction in CO2 emissions.  b.	Formation of equity value for home owners: The homes built by the Project will result in increased home prices over time, and this accrues to the benefit of home owners (i.e., on average Vinte&apos;&apos;s homes appreciates by 6 percent annually).  c.	Job creation: This Project will create 1,491 direct jobs both during construction and operation of the housing communities.   d.	Linkages: The Project will increase demand for construction and building materials in the country. Once the construction is completed, the housing units will stimulate the use of local supplies of goods and services, supporting maintenance, retailing and wholesaling operations.  e.	Community Development: The housing developments built by the Project will contribute to urban infrastructure and surrounding community development, such as roads, electricity, water access, sanitation, etc.</narrative>
