    <narrative xml:lang="EN">Community members needed to understand how to relate with the structures of government especially HYPREP in the important task of clean-up and restoration of polluted sites in Ogoni communities ravaged by the oil and gas industry activities. Tackling misconceptions about the project funds seen to bring about the breakdown of peace was perceived as necessary to the cleanup process of Ogoniland. In the buildup to the clean-up process, misconceptions abound about the intervention and what the budgeted fund was actually meant for so winning the cooperation of the local people to support the project with the pre-existing conditions was important to the success of the entire process.</narrative>
