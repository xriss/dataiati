    <narrative xml:lang="EN">NACGOND observed over the years that people of the region have been made to feel unduly dependent on the exploration and exploitation of oil and gas resources, which bears very few opportunities for the youths. Many youths across local communities in the region have no independent, productive livelihood sources. This has created a scenario of collective frustration and the oil and gas industry activities have become easy targets for oil theft, pipeline vandalism and artisanal refining activities. This activity was created to orientate the youths (of secondary school age) to values of environmental stewardship, through strategic ecological education, awareness creation, and media education programmes targeted at behavioral change for environmental leadership of the region.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">The surge in awareness levels among school club members across targeted communities informed the decision to extend club structures to community level in communities where environmental problems had large impact in the Niger Delta. Environmental Monitoring Clubs (EMCs) were established in selected communities across the Niger Delta with quarterly visits undertaken to ascertain that club members were in line with intended objectives. Media campaigns were done through airing of strategic radio drama series and production of NACGOND information materials. These were seen as necessary to augment other activities that were already being implemented in line with this particular objective.</narrative>
