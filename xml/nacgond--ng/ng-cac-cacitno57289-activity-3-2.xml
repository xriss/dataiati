   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Advocacy visit to Cross River State Forestry Commission to Seek Tree Planting Partnership</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Based on the recommendations of the midterm evaluation report that, the engagement with the National Youths Service Corps which failed to synergise as planned be suspended, the budgeted sum for it was used for this activity. As such, the advocacy visit was planned to foster unity between NACGOND and the forestry commission in response to the outcome from quarterly visits to the community environmental club in Boki where members requested for assistance to get indigenous tree species from the commission for planting in areas affected by deforestation. Boki Local Government in Cross River State remains one of the areas housing Nigeria&#x2019;s remaining rain forests. However, of recent, incessant logging activities in the forest creates anxiety whether the rain forest would remain what it is in the nearest future since it inhabits some endangered species as the Cross River Gorilla. It was based on this and likely impact which deforestation in Boki could have on climate change that the visit was initiated.</narrative>
