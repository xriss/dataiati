   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This activity was designed to engage the audience using the radio to create awareness on environmental issues mainstreaming climate change issues in parts of the Niger Delta. Listening audience were educated on climate change peculiarities in the entire Niger Delta with focus on the need to get the state governments buy-in to climate change action for the state. Few persons called in to contribute to the Programme and commended the donors and implementing partners for the work they are doing especially in educating the audience on some salient issues on climate change and local adaptation measures suggested in the region. Series of short 15 minutes&#x2019; radio dramas series and single episodes were aired with powerful messages to the listening audience emphasizing the need for environmental education for youths and the dangers of oil theft and artisanal refining of crude in the region. The same message tune was used for the short jingles which were aired in the radio stations as well. Periodic bulk SMS were sent to our audience which includes data base of critical stakeholders gathered over the cause of our work and IEC materials which comprised of stickers were distributed to community people through our partners working in various parts of the Niger Delta.</narrative>
