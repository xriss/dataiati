Long-term objectives and strategies of Social Enterprise is providing commercial sport, recreational and educational services for children from 4 to 8 years old on the territory of the city of Novi Sad in order to support services provided by Montessori Kinder House for Roma children ensuring sustainability and bigger visibility of the services. Beside all this facts Social Enterprise will open the possibility to provide a necessary license for transforming the Montessori Kinder House to Kindergarten which will also give a much bigger financial support of the local government and provide sustainability for the non-commercial services for Roma children and commercial services for the wider population of children in the city Novi Sad in the future.&#xA0;

&#xA0;

Expected results 

The Action aims providing commercial sport, recreational and educational services for children from 4 to 8 years old on the territory of the city of Novi Sad.&#xA0;

Main activities 

To provide activities every working day in the afternoon in the premises of the Montessori Kinder House divided in two large parts:&#xA0;sport and recreational&#xA0;part&#xA0;(gymnastic and corrective gymnastic) and&#xA0;educational part&#xA0;using Montessori Method (additional education through fun and games). The Action addresses children from 4-8 years old, as well as their parents. &#xA0;The Action aims at the same time to promote the Social Enterprise through the Open day activity, meetings with the local government and other stakeholders and through social networks (facebook and tweeter).

Results achieved&#xA0; 

In September 2016 sport and recreational activities and the montessori workshops were launched, and started to be regular two times a week. Soon, the activities sport, recreational and montessori workshops were held three times a week and once a week a new service was provided &#x2013; art workshops. About 20 children are on the list for these services, but regularly about 10 to 15 children are coming to the workshops. Not all parents are paying yet for the service, so in this moment we can not yet speak about the sustainability of the Social Enterprise SOFIA.

Also in September the services were promoted through open day in the kindergarten for children and their parents. Through promotional sport, recreational and educational workshops children and their parents could take part in the activities and learn more about our services.&#xA0;

Beside SOFIA has also a facebook site and a web site (www.sofia.co.rs )&#xA0; in order to promote the service, enlarge the number of the children using the services, become more sustainable and reach the long-term objectives of the project.
