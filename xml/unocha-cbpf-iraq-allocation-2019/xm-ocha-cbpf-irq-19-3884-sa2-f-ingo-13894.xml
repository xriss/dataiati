   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project aims to decrease vulnerability of the returnees and local communities in Wana sub-district.

According to the FSC-Iraq, there are more than 2.5 million people in need of which 51% are children. IDPs in camps and non-camp settings are subject to returns to their areas of origin where they face ongoing insecurity, lack of basic services, lack of income sources, and food insecurity, tribal disputes and explosive hazard contamination, and often end up re-displaced. Consequently, return movements must be monitored to ensure that they are safe, having basic and essential food and livelihood assistance, informed and sustainable.
In response, this project will provide food security and livelihood assistance to the extreme vulnerable returnees and local communities in Wana sub-district in Ninewa. The overall objective of this project is to decrease vulnerability of the Iraqi people and improve the food intake with focus on agriculture sector through the provision of agricultural inputs and services to protect agricultural productive assets and help restore fragile livelihoods of returning or vulnerable families in Wana sub-district.
The nine months project will target 1400 HHs equivalent to 8400 individuals (2200 men, 2100 women and 4100 children) severely food insecure households in the targeted sub-district of Wana. A total of 600 HHs will be economically supported through livelihood intervention in the sectors of agriculture, poultry, and livestock, of which 270 HHs (main recipients are men) will be supported through distribution of seeds (Wheat and barley) and fertilizers, 30 HHs (main recipients are men)will be provided with 30 greenhouse (Please see specification in the attached BoQ) which will enable farmers to grow certain types of crops of vegetables year round, the farmers will also be trained on how effectively utilize the greenhouses and obtain maximum benefit, the training will be provided through an external expert hired to deliver training sessions to the selected farmers. The project team will ensure that the farmer who participated in the training will also convey the knowledge and skills gained from the training to other farmers in the area to ensure sustainability of the project as well as convey of the experience among the farmers in the area. 250 HHs (main recipients are women) will be supported with livestock inputs (3 female sheep pre family) for animal breeding, fodders and vaccines to cover the hunger gap for sheep, and a total of 50 HHs (main recipients are women) will be supported through provision of poultry to improve the food intake of the family and children through the intake of eggs and meat, in addition, broilers can be also sold to bring an income to the household and improve their income. (see BoQs-Annex-I). In addition, this project will benefit 800 HHs through rehabilitation of two boreholes, provision of sprinkler irrigation systems to 10 farmers, provision of cash for work for 50 farmers/labors for the purpose of preparation of lands of farmers in the targeted area. The cash transfer will be done through cash transfer Hawala (Asia Hawala/Hawala firm).    
The project will also form community committees among men and women in the targeted area to act as a link between the project and targeted beneficiaries, represent the beneficiaries, and be part of the service delivery monitoring process. The formed committees will be part of the rapid assessment to identify the most vulnerable returnees and local communities</narrative>
