   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Mobile site management response to vulnerable IDPs in informal sites across Anbar Governorate Camp</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">HIRQ19-CCM-154826-1 
As Kilo 18 and other camps in Anbar are imminently closing, NRC&#x2019;s project will focus on providing support to underserved populations in continued displacement, both in secondary displaced areas, and at areas of origin, in alignment with the 2019 CCCM Cluster Strategy. NRC&#x2019;s CCCM intervention will support these populations through a comprehensive package of community mobilization, small-scale care and maintenance activities, the establishment or bolstering of referral pathways (with an emphasis on referrals to protection services), and linkages to other services which will benefit displaced populations. 

The proposed activities are a continuation of NRC&#x2019;s support to Camp Management activities in Kilo 18 camp, and will be delivered through a mobile site management (MSM) approach for internally displaced persons (IDPs) across informal sites in Anbar Governorate. The population of IDPs is expected in informal sites is expected to increase as camps such as Kilo 18 have faced premature closure and coerced returns or evictions, while other camps such as Bziebiz and HTC appear to be on the same track. Building on its existing geographic presence in Anbar, NRC will seek to reach 1,000 households (HH) through MSM interventions across Anbar, with a focus in Qa`im, Rawa, Ana, Hit, and the rural areas of Al-Khaldiyah. The intervention will begin with identified informal sites, but also expand to newly identified locations of displacement in coordination with the CCCM Cluster. NRC expects a further 926 vulnerable host community individuals to benefit from project activities that emphasize community public works, in the form of communal infrastructure/service projects. This gives NRC a unique opportunity to provide multiple services to vulnerable HHs where other actors are yet not present. 
 
The selection of informal sites in Anbar for this project is based on the current movement trends out of the Anbar camps &#x2013; as they are forcibly closed (such as Kilo 18) and through analyzing the areas of origin of IDPs currently in Bziebiz and HTC camps - which are both expected to close in the coming months. As many IDPs will be unable to return to their areas of origin due to lack of services, destruction of homes, security clearance issues, and perceived extremist affiliations repeated displacement is expected to rise. This project is based on NRC&#x2019;s direct assessment of needs, as well as an analysis of displacement data from the International Organisation of Migration (IOM)&#x2019;s Displacement Tracking Matrix (DTM), the Rapid Assessment Site Profile (RASP), and the Formal Site Monitoring Tool (FSMT). The proposed activities will complement and build upon NRC&#x2019;s existing ongoing multi-sectoral programming in Anbar governorate, both in CCCM and across a range of other integrated sectors such as Information, Counselling and Legal Assistance (ICLA), Education, and Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH). Recognizing that different groups such as men, women, boys and girls, people with disabilities, or the elderly have different needs and abilities to access services, NRC will assess and tailor approaches accordingly. One of the examples in this context, in particular accessing women and people with disabilities (PWD), that NRC uses are (i) gender-sensitive mobile teams to support linking these groups with relevant services, and (ii) referral system. These interventions are highly important for vulnerable populations who remain displaced in Anbar during 2019. Although continued returns of displaced populations were witnessed in 2018, the slowed pace of returns in the final quarter of 2018 has indicated that voluntary returns are likely to be saturated. As the focus of both the GoI and institutional donors shifts towards returns and durable solutions for those who are able to return, it is imperative that humanitarian actors maintain support to meet the needs of the underserved population that will remain in protracted displacement.</narrative>
