   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Action is the second phase of a large multi-country, multi-donor programme entitled Qudra&#x2013; Resilience for Refugees, IDP&#x2019;s, Returnees and Host Communities in response to the protracted Syrian and Iraqi Crises. Qudra is an Arabic word meaning &#x2018;strength, &#x2018;ability&#x2019; or &#x2018;resilience.&#x2019;

Qudra II will be implemented by five European Development Agencies, including Enabel, and is jointly co-financed by the EU Regional Trust Fund in Response to the Syrian Crisis (EUTF Syria also referred to as EC Madad), the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ) and the Spanish Agency for International Development Cooperation (AECID). The programme will be implemented in four countries bordering Syria; Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey and Iraq. Enabel&#x2019;s action will be implemented in Jordan over a period of 36 months.

The Overall Objective of Qudra II is &#x201C;To contribute to mitigating the destabilizing effects of the protracted Syrian and Iraqi crisis and to better respond to the resilience needs of refugees, internally displaced persons (IDP), returnees and host communities&#x201D;. This will be achieved through improving education and protection opportunities, employment and income generation opportunities, capacities of local governmental institutions and civil society organizations to deliver services, and social community cohesion in targeted areas, for targeted youth and women in particular.

Given the contextual impact of migration of Syrian refugees, with Jordan being the second highest host of refugees&#x2019; share per capita in the world, the protracted Syrian crisis has affected the relationship between Syrian and Jordanian communities, their access to public services including education and vocational training, and labor market employment opportunities. The labor market situation in Jordan features 19% unemployment rate and 34.5% unemployment rate amongst youth population (20-24 years old), while unemployment rates among Syrian refugees residing in Jordan is 60%.

Therefore, Enabel&#x2019;s contribution will be harnessed towards enhancing employment and income outcomes for Syrian and Jordanian vulnerable youth and women. Action&#x2019;s Interventions revolve around improving the relevance of vocational training and facilitate the transition from the world of training to the world of work for targeted group. This will be achieved through enhancing the involvement of local organizations in the private sector through building partnerships, utilizing work-based learning approaches and developing demand-driven, work-based vocational training programs. The program aims at training 2,000 Syrian and Jordanian vulnerable youth and women on semi-skilled work to better equip them with the skills and knowledge that match identified local labour market needs. Demand-driven vocational training programs will be delivered by contracted local private and public vocational training centers. Moreover, the program aims at enhancing the capacity of local private enterprises in Human Resource Management (HRM) as part of its holistic approach to create a more favorable working environment resembling improved employee retention rates and productivity.
