   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Learning to Work

High levels of youth unemployment is one of the main causes of poverty in the Palestinian Territory. At the same time, the private sector needs properly skilled people to work in companies or to start their own business. To tackle this paradox, the Belgian Development Cooperation launched a program to improve the quality and the labour-market relevance of Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) in the Palestinian Territory by supporting a series of innovative public-private partnership initiatives stimulating an interactive partnership between the TVET institutions and the labour market. 

To reach this objective, ECIB focuses on improving and extending work-based learning (WBL) practices in TVET. The principle behind work-based learning is fairly simple: the best way to make sure that young people learn skills relevant for the labour market is to assure that part of the training takes place in the workplace while doing real work. This way, WBL improves the practical skills of the students and facilitates the transition from the world of training to the world of work.

To assure the sustainability, ECIB aims to achieve its objectives through a coordinated multi-stakeholder approach integrating work-based learning in TVET on a strategic, operational and individual level: 

-		 Strategically: Ensuring systemic change by enabling the necessary institutional environment for TVET and work-based learning at the national level 

-		 Operationally: Empowering the different public and private stakeholders to implement labor-market relevant TVET by integrating WBL in the training programs 

-		 Individually: Facilitating the access to WBL schemes for disadvantaged youth with a matching pro-poor, pro-gender scholarship fund</narrative>
