   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Population Services International (PSI) seeks to break down barriers to access and use of voluntary, modern contraception among girls and young women (age 15-24), with the aim of reducing unintended pregnancies, reducing unsafe abortions and preventing transmission of sexually transmitted infections (STIs). The Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs is funding PSI to test two innovative models, and two theories of change, to tackle youth and adolescent sexual health issues (2016-2020). The market development approach implemented by PSI in DRC (2016-2017), Cote d&apos;Ivoire (since November 2017), Haiti and Mozambique, consists in addressing market failures that prevent Sara from accessing the contraceptive products and services she wants and needs. Main approaches used include a thorough landscape analysis to understand how the market is failing Sara (production to use spectrum analysis). This helps ensure that the response is highly context-specific and that programs in each country are geared towards prioritized market players to address the failures identified. PSI also uses user-centered design inspired techniques to gather consumer insights and develop fast prototypes. The Ecosystem development approach, implemented by Triggerise in India and Kenya, consists in improving health the livelihood of micro-entrepreneurs who are incentivized to improve access to contraceptive products and services. Using a peer-to-peer approach that connects consumers to local small businesses, Triggerise gives them the power to both access and deliver aid on their own terms. Building on these relationships, Triggerise uses rewards-based platforms to motivate consumers to make positive choices?helping them to overcome individual barriers as they arise while adding value back into their economies. The project will deliver on 5 outcomes: 1: Increased informed demand for SRH services by girls and young women, 2: Increased access to a wide range of SRH products and services for girls and young women, 3: Improved enabling environment for youth and young women for improving their SRH rights, 4: Create wealth (via improved depth and reach of the ecosystems) and 5: Improve lives (via improved SRHR health outcomes).</narrative>
