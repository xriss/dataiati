   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Summary Of Project Information (SPI)       Project Name    Slovak Republic-Scametatra Project              Region    Europe        Sector       Project No008761   Projected Board DateFebruary 27, 1998   Company NameScametatra   Technical Partner and/or Major Shareholders    	The Project is to construct and operate a plastic injection molding plant in Poprad, Slovak Republic.  The Project is to be undertaken by a joint venture company, Scametatra a.s. (Scametatra) which is 55%-45% owned by Scame Mastaf SpA of Italy (Scame) and Tatramat a.s. (Tatramat) of the Slovak Republic, respectively.    Project Cost Including Proposed IFC Investment    	IFC has been requested to provide senior debt financing on a limited recourse basis in the amount of DM3.75 million (US$2.2 million). This represents 32% of the total project cost of about US$7.0 million.    Location of Project and Description of Site    	Scametatra is located in Poprad, Slovak Republic      Description of Company and Purpose of Project    	In June 1997, Scame and Tatramat signed a framework agreement regarding the establishment of the joint venture, and Scametatra was legally incorporated in August, 1997.  The Project has been conceived of for the purpose of producing sets of molded plastic components for  clothes washing machines.  Injection molding lends itself to relatively quick change-over to manufacture of a wide range of parts which could have any number of customers or applications.    	Scame is well regarded as a cost effective producer of quality molded plastic parts for major appliance manufacturers.  In order to support the transfer of its know-how to Poprad, Scame has had key technical staff in training at its Italian facilities for nearly one-half year and Scame will send technical management to live on-site in Poprad for a minimum of one-half year following the start-up of operations.    Environmental Category and Issues    	This is a category B project according to IFCs environmental review procedure. The plant will be located in an enlarged building within a manufacturing complex; existing manufacturing operations are not expected to have resulted in land contamination.  Infrastructure services (water, sewer, gas, electricity) will be provided by the complex.  Environmental, occupational health and safety issues associated with this project include:  solid and hazardous waste disposal, fire protection and emergency response, and employee training and workplace safety. Plastic scrap will be recycled in the process and about 130 tons per year of paper wastes will be sold for recycling.  Solvents used will be disposed of in accordance with local regulations. Fire systems and training will be coordinated with those in use at the Tatramat complex.  Induction training and refresher courses for plant operation and health and safety will be provided for all employees.  All plant personnel will be trained in safe working practices and in proper handling of chemicals.    The  is  from the Public Information Center.
