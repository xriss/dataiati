   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Fund would serve as a catalyst for the development of the microinsurance industry throughout the target regions and would introduce insurance, savings and/or protection products that would otherwise not be available to the poor. In addition, the Fund will facilitate knowledge management and transfer which is crucial for the development of a healthy and dynamic primary microinsurance market and is necessary for a holistic micro risk protection/lending solution. Finally, it would stimulate additional demand by catering to populations who otherwise would not have considered conventional insurance.  Specific development impacts are:

Poverty Alleviation:  Microinsurance will significantly alleviate poverty by stabilizing income levels for low-income and vulnerable populations, including dampening shocks that might leave families destitute.  As a savings tool, it can contribute to wealth creation and the opening up of opportunities to this segment of the population.  It will also enable lifestyle improvements and further integration with society at large.

Demonstration effects:  The project will demonstrate the business case for microinsurance and for microinsurance investment vehicles and encourage other private sector players to invest in this sector.  It will accelerate the build-up of local capacity and broaden professionalism in the sector.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The LeapFrog Financial Inclusion Fund (LeapFrog FIF or the Fund) is a greenfield fund which will invest in micro-insurance providers in Africa and Asia.  The target size of the Fund is $100 million.  The Fund intends to focus on companies offering life insurance primarily but will also consider investing in companies providing health and property insurance and long-term contractual savings products. LeapFrog FIF will be the first micro-insurance investment vehicle globally and intends to develop three broad categories of investments: (i) investments in existing micro-insurance businesses; (ii) distribution-driven investments by partnering with MFIs or NGOs that have a large footprint; and (iii) insurer-driven investments by partnering with insurance companies that will look to LeapFrog FIF to share the early risk of their investments in microinsurance businesses.</narrative>
