   <narrative xml:lang="EN">1.	Contribution to global food security: Noble Agri is a midsize global trader and has financing constraints for its investment programs. The COFCO acquisition will provide the Company with access to long-term capital to expand its operations, ultimately increasing the supply of agri-commodities.   2.	Improvement in food supply chain efficiency and productivity: The COFCO partnership will enable the Company to invest to improve its competiveness. The global agri trading platform will exploit business synergies as well as economies of scope and scale to improve the supply chain efficiency of major agri commodities.    3.	Rural livelihoods and private sector development: Significant direct and indirect employment will be created in multiple developing countries.  It is expected that 3,900 additional jobs will be created at Noble Agri by 2018.  Increased productivity and improved standards in the value chains will also lead to increased wages and incomes for farmers.  Significant purchases from domestic suppliers and third party logistics providers is expected, with related indirect employment effects.  4.	Turnaround of underperforming assets: Noble Agri&apos;&apos;s sugar assets in Brazil have been underperforming. The full acquisition of Noble Agri will give COFCO greater control, enhancing COFCO&apos;&apos;s ability to implement operational changes needed to turn the assets around to profitability.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Noble Agri, recently spun out of Noble Group, is a global agri commodities company, involved in the origination, processing and distribution of grains and oilseeds, sugar and ethanol, and other soft commodities (coffee and cotton).  It operates through 60 major offices around the world, including Brazil, China, Argentina, Eastern Europe, India and South Africa and has over 13,000 employees.   IFC is considering an investment to participate its pro-rata share to buy out the 49% minority stake of Noble Group in Noble Agri, together with COFCO Corporation (COFCO), the leading agribusiness group in China, and an international consortium of investors (IC, including IFC, HOPU Fund and other investors).  This is a follow-on investment (project no. 34738) in which COFCO and the IC bought a 51% shareholding in Noble Agri through a subsidiary and created a joint-venture trading platform to capitalize on potential synergies across the supply chain with COFCO. IFCs investment transferred into an indirect ownership of 4.6 percent in Noble Agri.</narrative>
