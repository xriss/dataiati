   <narrative xml:lang="EN">- Stimulate economic activity in emerging markets: As of FY16, the Company generates about 24% of its revenues and about 11% of its operating profit (excluding overheads) in emerging markets. The IFC loan will be directed to finance recent and ongoing capital expenditures in architectural and automotive glass production in emerging markets, likely Poland and Brazil. Increased production will not only stimulate the construction and automotive sectors but also boost the intermediate industries in its supply chain. The multiplier effect of this process will generate greater economic activity, increase economic complexity and competiveness thus providing a momentum for emerging markets to progress along in their development path.

- Industrial Competitiveness, Productivity and Jobs: The Project will introduce new energy efficient technology to the Company&apos;s operations, helping address the urgent need for cold repairs and equipment upgrades which is required every 18 to 20 years to stay competitive in the glass manufacturing sector.  This type of investment is necessary to improving productivity and competitiveness and maintaining the current job levels.  Specifically for NSG UK Poland: (i) since the 1990s, the Company has continuously been adding jobs to the Polish economy, starting with about 300 in the early years and having more than 3,500 today.  The new investment will create more than  200 additional jobs (many of them highly skilled) of which at least 25% are expected to be women employees.  (ii) The greater impact however is in the job preservation.  The cold repair is needed to keep the float line running.  Without this investment, the float operations cannot sustain the level of existing jobs.  (iii) In the downstream investment, the service centers are expected to be extended to under developed regions of Poland, thus creating employment opportunities in such areas.  (iv) NSG UK Poland operations include European Shared Service Center for NSG Group employing 160 highly qualified jobs, of which 95% are occupied by female employees. At a time when these investments are needed, IFC can support the Company in maintaining these critical jobs along the supply chain, while at the same time promoting innovation and know-how transfer. For example, the Project will also include R&amp;D investments primarily undertaken in the Company&apos;s R&amp;D facilities in the UK, however, geared towards improvements in the manufacturing process in emerging markets (Poland and Brazil) with the view to make them more efficient and for the development of innovative energy efficient product

- Demonstration effect: Responsible environmental and social behavior of a global player in emerging markets has a demonstration impact which fosters adoption of industry best practices of sustainable growth by local market players.

- Climate change benefits: Glass products can play an important role in energy conservation and generation. NSG UK is committed to developing innovative products that help address climate change. The Company has sustainability targets to improve its own energy usage as well as make a positive environmental contribution through its products.</narrative>
