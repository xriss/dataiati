   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Summary Of Project Information (SPI)       Project Name    Slovak Republic: EuroTel Bratislava              Region    Europe        Sector       Project No009318   Projected Board DateNovember 30, 1998   Company NameEuroTel Bratislava a.s.   Technical Partner and/or Major Shareholders    	The primary sponsors are MediaOne (formerly part of US West) and Bell Atlantic, which jointly and equally own a 49% economic interest and a 40% voting interest in EuroTel.  MediaOne consists of US Wests cable television and international wireless communications operations, is known to IFC through US Wests sponsorship of Westel 450 (Hungary, IFC/R92-39), Westel 900 (Hungary, IFC/M94-14), and RTDC (Russia, IFC/R94-159).  Bell Atlantic is a regional Bell operating company, with more than 41 million wireline customers and 6.7 million wireless customers in 23 countries.  The other shareholder (with a 51% economic interest and a 60% voting interest) is Slovak Telecom, the state-owned national fixed-line operator.  It has about 1.5 million telephone lines in service.    Project Cost Including proposed IFC investment    	Total project cost is estimated to be about US$250 million, and IFC&apos;&apos;s proposed investment would be up to US$30 million, which would likely consist of:  up to US$10 million in an IFC &quot;A&quot; Loan, and up to US$20 million in an income participating IFC &quot;C&quot; Loan.  Other financing is expected to come primarily from a syndicate of commercial banks whose loans will be backed by ECAs and/or MIGA.    Location of project and Description of site    	The project is to help finance EuroTels continued build-out of its nation-wide mobile cellular telecommunications networks and improve the Companys capital structure.  EuroTel owns and operates an analog NMT mobile network that covers approximately 94% of the population and 76% of the geography of the Slovak Republic, and a digital GSM network that covers approximately 93% of the population and 68% of the geography.  Future build-out would likely focus on increasing network capacity, improving indoor coverage, and improving network quality.      Description of Company and Purpose of Project    	EuroTel is one of two national mobile cellular operators in the Slovak Republic.  In 1990, EuroTel was awarded a 20-year license to operate a national analog mobile cellular network. In 1996, it was also granted a 15-year national digital GSM license.  In February 1997, the Company began offering GSM services along with its existing analog services, and as of August 1998, EuroTel had over 150,000 wireless subscribers, which accounts for a large share of the mobile cellular market.    	The Slovak Republic is one of the Extending IFCs Reach countries, and the project would demonstrate to the government and to potential foreign investors that IFC supports private sector participation in the infrastructure development of the country. In addition, IFC would not only provide scarce long-term financing, but would also act as a source of comfort to other lenders, which will be more likely to invest knowing IFC is present.    Environmental Category and Issues    	This is a category B project according to IFC&apos;&apos;s environmental and social review procedure.  Environmental issues associated with this project include:  right-of-way alignment, land acquisition, development of sensitive land, tower site selection, impacts and monitoring of ongoing operations, PCBs, solid and liquid waste.  Occupational health and safety issues include: fire safety, emergency response, and general employee safety and training.To help mitigate these potential environmental and social impacts, EuroTel will comply with applicable IFC and Slovakian environmental and social laws, regulations and guidelines, and IFC will monitor compliance by evaluating reports submitted annually by the Company, and by conducting on-site reviews during project supervision as needed.  The Company will locate new base stations on existing telecommunications sites wherever feasible, and EuroTel will select and construct new sites in accordance with applicable regulations.  EuroTel provides training on environmental health and worker safety, including hazard identification, accident prevention, first aid, safe chemical handling, fire prevention and safety and proper control and maintenance of equipment and facilities.

Date SPI sent to InfoShop     October 21, 1998      This Summary of Project Information is prepared and distributed to the public in advance of consideration of the proposed transaction by the Corporations Board of Directors.  It is provided for the purpose of enhancing the transparency of IFCs activities and should not be construed as presuming the outcome of IFC Board consideration.
