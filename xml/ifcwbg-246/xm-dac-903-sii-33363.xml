   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Greater access to finance: the facility will increase access to credit for emerging markets financial intermediaries, individuals and SMEs. The aggregate settlement credit available to financial institutions in a country largely determines the total amount of non-cash transactions possible on payment networks and by increasing the settlement credit, the facility will enable greater access to finance in the country.   Safer transactions and integration with international markets: greater use of electronic payments will make transactions safer, more efficient and inclusive and will enable greater integration in international markets which in turn fuel growth and drive business growth for merchants.    Support enabling environment: the wide range of payment solutions offered by MasterCard would support the development and implementation of credit, debit, prepaid and related payment programs and solutions for consumers and merchants.   Skill transfer: MasterCard establishes and enforces a common set of standards for adherence by its customers for the use of its payments network.  Supporting MasterCard&apos;&apos;s further expansion into emerging markets will thus result in a transfer of skill and innovation from a sophisticated technology company and payments industry leader to local financial institutions institutions to drive greater acceptance of digital payments, especially at the bottom of the pyramid and lessens the usage of cash.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed project is a USD $250 million risk participation facility whereby IFC will share with MasterCard the settlement risk of emerging market banks arising out of their settlement obligations to MasterCard. The facility, which has a five year term, will contribute to the World Bank Groups universal financial inclusion goal and create greater financial access by increasing the issuance of prepaid, electronic, debit and credit cards and the number of emerging markets financial institutions that can participate in the global MasterCard network.   The project is a part of IFCs collaboration with MasterCard to enhance financial inclusion in emerging markets by extending the reach of low cost, cashless financial services to the unbanked and under-banked customer segments. MasterCard has customers in over 200 countries/territories including in 75 IDA/Fragile and Conflict-affected States which offers huge potential for partnership in delivering innovative financial services in areas of common interest such as this project and the Partnership for Financial Inclusion already in place. The Partnership for Financial Inclusion is a joint $37.4 million initiative between the IFC and The MasterCard Foundation to advance financial inclusion in Sub-Saharan Africa by expanding access to microfinance and developing mobile financial services.</narrative>
