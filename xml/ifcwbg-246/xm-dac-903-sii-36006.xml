   <narrative xml:lang="EN">(i) Job creation: the underlying funds will focus on mid-cap companies which in IFC&apos;&apos;s experience achieve high job creation rates. (ii) Access to finance: the underlying funds&apos;&apos; target regions / sectors suffer from limited long-term equity capital and debt provided by commercial banks in those markets tend to focus on asset back lending and large corporate or state owned companies.  (iii) Private sector development: Abraaj&apos;&apos;s hands-on management approach in the underlying funds&apos;&apos; portfolio companies will help companies improve operational efficiency, achieve national and regional growth, and explore exit opportunities through cross-border trade sales or listing on national / regional stock exchanges, which will further support the equity capital markets in IFC&apos;&apos;s target countries.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed projects entails forming a strategic partnership with the Abraaj Group (Abraaj) whereby IFC would commit to a number of Abraaj-managed private equity funds, spread across a number of growth market countries and sectors via an Abraaj-managed feeder vehicle established for this purpose.    The proposal entails transferring to an Abraaj-managed feeder vehicle IFCs potential commitment to the Abraaj Growth Markets Health Fund and Abraaj Turkey Fund which were disclosed on IFCs website on December 16, 2013 and Mar 27, 2015, respectively through separate Summary of Investment Information, and IFCs existing commitments to Abraaj North Africa Fund II and Abraaj Africa Fund III, each of which were disclosed on IFCs website on June 13, 2014, and July 17, 2014 respectively through separate Summary of Investment Information.
