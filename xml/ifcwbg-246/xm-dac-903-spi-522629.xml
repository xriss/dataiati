   <narrative xml:lang="EN">IFC and the USAID propose to create the Balkans Infrastructure Development Facility (BID Facility), a multi-donor facility that will assist in development of private infrastructure in the Balkans region, enhance private sector participation and investments in infrastructure projects, and facilitate public private partnerships.  The BID Facility would help committed public entities (such as local governments and municipalities etc.) identify, analyze, structure, and develop viable and attractive infrastructure projects suitable for private sector investment and participation mainly in water and sanitation, transport, and energy sectors.  The BID Facility will help prepare infrastructure project proposals which have a reasonable potential to successfully attract private sector participation and financing.  The BID Facility will function as a revolving fund and will support project preparation funding throughout the project development process, from feasibility through transaction structuring, negotiation and financial closure.  At times, IFC may consider BID Facility projects for financing, but IFC would not be obligated to consider or provide such financing.     The Facility will be IFC managed and will initially begin operations with an office in Sofia, Bulgaria with a small core team of specialists supported by project specific consultants.  The BID Facility will be governed by a Board of Donor Representatives which will set the overall policies, guidelines and direction of the Facility.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">The BID Facility would be established in Sofia, Bulgaria with most of the staff located there, but the Facility would operate regionally in all of the Balkan countries from Sofia covering projects in Albania, Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, FYR Macedonia, Romania, Serbia and Montenegro.  In addition, as an IFC managed facility, BID Facility will also leverage off of IFCs presence in the region as appropriate.</narrative>
