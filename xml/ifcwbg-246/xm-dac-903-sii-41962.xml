   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Stakeholder Impact: 

Improved access to housing finance: The Platform includes a large number of countries with a range of housing finance gaps. For instance, in Rwanda, only 4.5 percent of urban household would be able to afford the cheapest newly built house at US$19,768 with existing available housing finance. The ratio of outstanding mortgage debt to GDP was 3.6 percent in 2016 and the percentage of the population (age 15+) with an outstanding housing loan was 6.6 percent. Rwanda&apos;s demographic and urbanization trends are putting considerable demand pressure on the domestic housing sector. The country&apos;s population is growing at 1.3 percent per annum, while its urban population grows at a faster pace of 6.6 percent per annum. Rwanda has an estimated housing deficit of 109,000 units. 
The Platform will indirectly lead to the construction of more homes hence impacting spending and employment in the economy. 

Change in affordability: Housing affordability is mainly driven by mortgages terms. The Platform will increase affordability by providing lower monthly payments through extended  maturity terms 

Market Level:

Integration: Financial Integration: The Project is expected to contribute to the development of bond markets in target countries, through a demonstration effect by: (i) providing corporate bond issues which could attract more liquidity if these issues are taken up by institutional investors in each market (ii) extending the corporate bond yield curve therefore enabling to diversify market participants and attract institutional investors; and (iv) reducing borrowing spreads. Long-term funding in local currency is essential for the development of housing finance.

Competitiveness: Change in market structure and mortgage terms: The Platform is expected to enhance competitiveness in the mortgage markets through the capacity building and demonstration channels by increasing the number of financial institutions offering mortgages. As the mortgage sector expands, the number of PMLs  will increase further as well, resulting in increased volume of mortgage finance and greater benefits for homebuyers, such as product diversification and pricing pressure. To measure progress against this outcome, IFC will track the number of institutions offering mortgages in the country</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed MRC Programmatic Platform Middle East &amp; Africa (MPP MEA or Platform) was designed to operationalize the framework for how IFCs and WBs interventions complement each other to support Mortgage Refinancing Companies (MRCs) across the MEA region and promote housing sector development. The investment component of the Platform consists of up to US$20 million in equity/quasi-equity in selected MRCs; and up to US$150 million in debt/bond participations. The team will request support from the IDA PSW including up to US$90 million from the Local Currency Facility (LCF), and up to US$5 million from the Blended Finance Facility (BFF).  Through the $95 million financing IDA PSW will support a total project costs estimated to reach $500 million. For non-PSW eligible countries, other BF support could be tapped such as climate funds. The MPP MEA will request delegated authority from the Board to process investment.</narrative>
