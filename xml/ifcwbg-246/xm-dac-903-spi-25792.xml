   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Facility addresses the on-going demand from Government and private investors to receive support from the World Bank Group in the development of an increased pipeline of bankable private and PPP projects.  The Facility is expected to increase the number of private and PPP infrastructure projects in IDA countries, which in turn would supply scarce infrastructure services to companies and citizens in these countries.  The sectors targeted by the facility (i.e., energy, water and transport) typically have high economic returns to society, particularly in low income countries, and are crucial to the overall developmental process.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The IFC Global Infrastructure Project Development Facility (the Facility or IFC-GIPDF) is a facility of up to $100&#xA0;million, which will provide IFC with a flexible platform from which it can pro-actively support the development of private and PPP infrastructure projects in IDA countries, with a focus on Sub-Saharan Africa.  The Facility will involve dedicating an experienced group of professionals who would have a hands-on approach by actively participating in the early stage project development efforts, which would be partially funded through the Facility.  IFC would, therefore, act as co-developer and provide expertise in critical areas of the project development work.  In this respect, the Facility would be an additional tool available to IFC to address a key constraint to private sector participation in frontier countries/sectors, namely the unavailability of sufficient funds and experienced professionals dedicated to infrastructure projects.    Target projects would include:   - private infrastructure projects at an early stage of development where the sponsor has some form of agreement with the host Government;  - projects that are in the process of being tendered, where IFC would support the prospective investors on a non-exclusive basis during the selection process, to help ensure that the resulting project is bankable, and to help the winning sponsor finalize the development of the project and bring it to financial close;  -&#xA0;early stage private infrastructure projects which do not require a contractual relationship with the host Government (captive plants, logistics, shipping, etc.); and  - post-conflict country initiatives. Request for IFCs involvement could come either from private companies or from Governments.  The Facility will provide risk capital to fund early stages of development of infrastructure projects.  Eligible costs to be funded by the Facility would include:   - consultant expenses and fees;  - planning and feasibility studies, such as environmental and social assessments and related community engagement activities;  - early project development costs, such as permits, land acquisition, prototypes and pilot studies; and  - other project development expenses, as deemed appropriate.</narrative>
