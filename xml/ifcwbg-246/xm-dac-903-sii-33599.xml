   <narrative xml:lang="EN">(i) Promoting affordability: MOOCs will counter-act the trend of continuous increases in costs of higher education experienced in many countries by making available to students of different socioeconomic backgrounds high quality instruction and education materials for free. (ii) Improving quality and accountability: By making available new learning opportunities in emerging markets, Coursera can help build the capacity of local higher education institutions, potentially promoting systemic quality improvements and greater accountability on student outcomes.  (iii) Supporting employability: The wide variety of course offerings coupled with Coursera&apos;&apos;s student recruitment services can allow students globally to access knowledge and skills that otherwise would not be available to them and open opportunities to access quality jobs by making job-seekers more visible to potential employers.  (iv) Supporting lifelong learning in an increasingly knowledge-based economy: MOOCs make available advanced courses that are not widely available in emerging markets and can help the next generation of life long learners acquire 21st century skills and apply them in the workplace.  (iv) Supporting innovation: Coursera has the potential to transform the traditional classroom-based education, by allowing universities to license their content to develop personalized and more flexible programs that effectively meet student&apos;&apos;s needs.  (v) Individualizing learning: Technology has the potential to promote a more individualized learning experience, segmenting the student population according to learning patterns and preferences and providing each segment with customized content and pedagogical tools. (vi) Measuring outcomes: the combination of scale and technology can facilitate data-driven approaches to measure student learning (e.g. through data mining) feeding back relevant information about student learning patterns to instructors and institutions for academic improvement.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Coursera is an educational technology company started in 2011 by two- computer science professors from Stanford University. The company offers the new generation of online and scalable courses known as Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs). The companys mission is to provide access to high-quality courses from top universities to every student around the world. Coursera is looking to raise a Series B round of equity to support its ambitious growth plan. The Series B round is expected to significantly increase Courseras exposure and impact in developing markets where there is significant unmet demand for quality higher education and MOOCs. Specifically, Coursera will help provide students in emerging markets with access to an innovative online learning experience that can help them build skills, enhance their employability, and support life-long learning. Coursera will also help increase the number of top emerging markets universities in the Coursera network; and help build the capacity of higher education institutions in emerging markets by integrating Courseras content and developing innovative and flexible pedagogies such as blended learning.</narrative>
