   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In the proposed project, IFC will establish a risk-sharing facility of up to $100 million with Deutsche Bank, AG (DB) to share the risk of credit losses resulting from certain corporate and financial institution credit risk events in emerging markets.  The facility will cover a pool of eligible transactions which include cross currency swaps and forwards and local currency interest rate swaps entered into by DB originated during a term of two years (the Facility).</narrative>

  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed Facility is expected to have a number of development benefits and should help IFC meet its Institutional Development Goals (&quot;IDG&quot;). First, it will increase the depth of local and cross-currency hedging products that are available to clients in emerging markets. Second, it will promote hedging transactions in markets where there are significant barriers to entry for many companies and financial institutions, by seeking to widen the circle of counterparts to include second-tier credits. Third, by improving access for emerging market clients to currency risk hedging products, it will facilitate financial risk management and planning, specifically in sectors that are key for the development of local economies such as microfinance, medium-sized enterprises operating in the manufacturing and agribusiness sectors, pension funds, and low-income housing. Broadening access to cross-currency hedging tools will enable clients in these key industries to better manage foreign exchange risk and strengthen their balance sheets and, through increased access to finance and more efficient use of capital, expand their businesses. Fourth, since only swap transactions with at least one local currency leg will be eligible for inclusion, the Facility will contribute especially to the development of local derivatives markets.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project will risk share on a portfolio of transactions in emerging markets, and IFC member countries in Latin America, Middle East and North Africa, sub-Saharan Africa, and Asia are eligible.  While the geographic distribution of the portfolio will depend on market demand, it is expected that up to 40% of the portfolio will be in Latin America.</narrative>
