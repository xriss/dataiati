The Fund is registered as a limited partnership and it holds a Global Business License (GBL) from the Financial Services Commission of the Republic of Mauritius.

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">LeapFrog is an experienced fund manager focusing on the financial and healthcare sector. Project level outcomes are delivered through increasing access to equity and value creation for mid-cap companies in Asia and Africa, including investees with an inclusive business model to serve underserved and bottom of pyramid customers; and increasing access to financial services for underserved private individuals and businesses including MSME customers across many emerging markets in Africa and Asia. The Fund Manager will support value creation in its investee companies through institutionalization, improved customer focus, and operational improvements including digitization leading to market expansion. 

Market creation is delivered by strengthening the competitiveness of Africas PE market. The project supports an experienced emerging market-focused fund manager to raise a US$1 billion follow-on fund in the mid-cap market segment with a meaningful allocation of approximately 40% to the African market. Beyond the Project, the success of the Fund will encourage global fund managers to raise new or follow-on funds in the African PE market. In turn, this is expected to attract international institutional investors and reduce the need for capital from Development Financial Institutions (DFI) for future fundraisings.</narrative>
