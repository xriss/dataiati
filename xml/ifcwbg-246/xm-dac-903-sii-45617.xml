   <narrative xml:lang="EN">GTFP&apos;s guarantees on trade finance transactions provide risk mitigation to their cross-border correspondent banks, protecting the essential networks that enable EMDEs to be integrated with the global trade finance network, as well as to participate in global trade.  GTFP improves overall market integration by (1) maintaining and expanding trade finance, financial linkages and trade across multiple markets through strengthening these bilateral correspondent banking connections; (2) helping to create new connections between local and international banks; (3) channeling new sources of capital to support trade flow through demonstration and replication of trade finance as a viable investment asset class in EMDEs.  GTFP has a particularly strong presence in IDA/FCS markets, where it helps to protect and deepen cross-border trade finance networks, and thus trade corridors.  Such support is especially critical in the maintenance of liquidity and essential goods during this crisis, as well as protecting the architecture that is necessary for crisis resilience and recovery.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The MIGA IFC Trade Finance Guarantee Initiative (the Initiative) is expected to respond to COVID-19 by leveraging IFCs existing trade solutions platform, to provide trade finance guarantees under IFCs Global Trade Finance Program (GTFP) to state-owned banks (SOE Banks) to support trade flows of critical goods, equipment and supplies to emerging markets during the crisis.&#xA0; For IFC to implement the MIGA IFC Trade Finance Guarantee Initiative, IFC will temporarily increase the GTFP by up to US$500 million in outstanding balances.&#xA0; This outstanding balances of US$500 million is expected to allow US$1 billion of commitments counter-guaranteed up to 99 percent by MIGA.  &#xA0;  By partnering with MIGA, IFC can address trade finance gaps by providing trade guarantees, particularly in IDA/FCS countries where SOE Banks represent a portion of the trade finance market.&#xA0; Through this partnership with MIGA, IFC will contribute further to the economic recovery in IDA/FCS countries and emerging markets developing economies (EMDEs) by promoting the revitalization of private sector value chains during the COVID-19 and the post-COVID-19 period.]</narrative>
