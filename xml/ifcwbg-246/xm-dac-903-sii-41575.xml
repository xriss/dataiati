  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">IFC and Water.org have teamed up to create an innovative, market-based, credit enhancement offering called the Global Credit Enhancement Facility (GCEF or Facility). The GCEF is designed to encourage financial institutions (FIs) such as commercial banks and microfinance banks to increase the availability of water and sanitation (WSS) loans to borrowers at the base of the economic pyramid still lacking basic services. The Facility will provide credit enhancements structured as risk sharing facilities for portfolios of water and sanitation loans made by local banks, thus mitigating credit risks and enabling local banks to introduce or scale up lending for WSS assets. GCEFs credit enhancement offering will consist of guarantor funding raised by Water.org, as the subordinated or first loss tranche, and IFC funding, as the senior or second loss tranche. The GCEF will look to support banks in a number of countries, including India, Kenya, Bangladesh, the Philippines and Indonesia.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Project Outcome: Stakeholder Effect: The project will facilitate access to small loans for safe water and sanitation to low income population in EM. IFC expects this investment to unlock up to US$1bn in over 2.7m loans by banks over the life of the Facility, improving access for over 13m individual and household stakeholders.
Market Impact: Inclusiveness: The investment would benefit BoP individuals and households, and women specifically who do not have access to safe water and sanitation. The investment will improve inclusiveness by crowding in private sector banks to provide loans to these population tailored to address these issues through innovation, demonstration effect, replication, and competition channels. Integration: the investment will promote integration of private banks to address safe water and sanitation challenges for low income population through innovation, demonstration and replication channel.</narrative>
