   <narrative xml:lang="EN">1.	Improving Water Sanitation and Wastewater Reuse in Emerging Markets:  Organica&apos;&apos;s wastewater treatment (WWT) technology offers a highly cost competitive, space saving, and decentralized solution to customers.  This technology application is particularly attractive in the chosen emerging markets that Organica operates in, where a) urbanization and water quality issues are prevalent; b) WWT infrastructures are relatively new and stakeholders are relatively more open to adopting new WWT solutions; and c) increasing urban population density requires WWT solutions that minimizes footprint whilst aesthetically pleasing/ecosystem-like solutions allow for preservation of land value in the vicinity.   2.	Promoting a Decentralized and Distributed Wastewater Solution:  In addition to driving resource efficiency on every level- lower energy usage, lower geographic footprint and lower infrastructure costs; Organica&apos;&apos;s WWT solution is comprised of botanical garden like structures which blend into the urban landscape with no resemblance to traditional facilities. The sustainable look and feel as well as the smaller infrastructure footprint promote a decentralized and distributed approach towards WWT and contribute to a drive towards urban sustainability in emerging markets.  3.	Improving Effectiveness of Wastewater Treatment Solutions: Organica&apos;&apos;s utilization of plant roots andits patented artificial media as a special biofilm carrier creates a more diverse and complex biological treatment system that improves treatment efficiency by maximizing oxygen transfer. This ultimately enhances the resilience of the WWT infrastructure against variations in treatment volume and wastewater quality variability.   4.	Stimulating Water Technologies Innovation and Resource Efficiency:  Organica&apos;&apos;s innovative biological treatment solution generates substantial savings in capital cost, operating cost, energy use and physical land use compared to conventional WWT technologies.  IFC&apos;&apos;s investment will stimulate technological innovation in WWT solutions that addresses energy and resource efficiencies, thereby strengthening its target market&apos;&apos;s ability to delivery key infrastructure services and offer decentralized solutions.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Organica Water Inc. (Organica or the Company) is a Budapest, Hungary based wastewater treatment (WWT) technology company that is developing and deploying a next-generation, biological wastewater treatment technology. The Organica technology utilizes proprietary algorithms to create engineered ecosystems that efficiently treat and recycle the same quality wastewater in significantly less space, using less energy and generating less sludge than conventional treatment plants, and done in an aesthetically appealing way that integrates seamlessly into urban environments.   The Organica WWT technology was originally conceived in 1998 and the Company has since completed 28+ installations operating worldwide, including in Hungary, France, China, and Poland.  The technology is designed to enhance the natural processes of complex ecosystems by creating considerably more diverse biology than those already in use in the industry.  Since 2008, Organica has signed over 20 contracts for its technology deployment, including 11 projects in France, 5 projects in China, and its first 80,000 m3/day retrofit plant in Hungary using its second generation technology.  The Company is currently seeking to expand its commercialization efforts in emerging markets such as India, China, Indonesia, Turkey and Eastern Europe, focusing on municipal and industrial WWT opportunities in the 1,000-100,000 m3/day hydraulic capacity.</narrative>
