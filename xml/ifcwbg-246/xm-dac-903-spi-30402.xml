   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Altobridge Limited (Altobridge or Company) is a leading provider of GSM mobile telecommunications solutions for remote communities.

The Company specialises in developing technology that cuts the cost of delivering mobile telecommunications connectivity to remote communities in developing and emerging markets.

Central to this, is its satellite backhauled, solar powered, Altobridge lite-site solution which enables mobile network operators to cost effectively extend their networks, into remote communities, at low cost.

Meeting the needs of 100 to 1,500 size subscriber communities, the Altobridge lite-site has been specifically designed to optimise satellite bandwidth and minimise power consumption.

At the heart of the Companys offering lie a series of patented and patent-pending technologies namely; Data at the Edge (data optimisation in wireless networks), Local Connectivity (local voice switching) and Split ArchitectureTM&#xA0;(transmission and power optimisation), all of which  individually and combined - drive down communications delivery costs for mobile network operators, by reducing backhaul and power consumption costs.

With headquarters in Ireland and facilities in Malaysia, USA, Indonesia and China, Altobridge was founded in 2002, by a group of GSM industry specialists who recognized that mobile operators and their traditional equipment suppliers were focused on urban network expansion. As such, Altobridge set about developing a unique solar powered solution with the lowest operationally efficient solution in the industry that would enable mobile network operators to deliver connectivity to the 1.6 billion adults who live in unconnected, off-grid communities.

Since then, the Altobridge solution has been deployed on land, air and sea by mobile network operators worldwide. Moving forward however, the company will exclusively focus on refining, honing, improving and developing the Altobridge lite-site solution for land based, remote enterprise and remote village communities in developing and emerging markets.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project aims to achieve the following development impacts:
I. Provide Voice &amp; Mobile Internet Connectivity to Remote Communities
-Mobile Operators have been commercially constrained from extending their networks into remote regions in emerging markets due to the costs involved of rolling out traditional network infrastructure, e.g. towers, microwave links, power etc. The low operating and capital costs of the Altobridge lite-site reduces the barriers to rural and remote network expansion, namely, expensive satellite backhaul, power source and truck-roll costs.
-The Company&apos;s Data at the Edge solution and other products will provide reliable and affordable mobile broadband connectivity to schools, homes and enterprises in areas that currently lack such access to the internet.
II. Assist in the creation of direct and indirect employment in emerging markets
III. Promote energy efficiency through the reliance of Altobridge products on renewable power sources</narrative>
