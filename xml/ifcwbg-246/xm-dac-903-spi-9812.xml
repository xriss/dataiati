Technical Partner and/or Major Shareholders    	Scametatra is a joint venture between Scame Group (55%) an Italian manufacturer of plastic injection molded products, and Tatramat (45%), a Slovak manufacturer and assembly company.    Project Cost Including proposed IFC investment    	The total project cost is estimated at US$6.0 million. The IFC will provide a Euro 1.5 million A loan.     Location of project and Description of site    	The project is located near Poprad in north central Slovakia. IFC financed the Scametatra greenfield project in 1998. This has been successfully completed. Phase II of Scametatra will include the construction of a modern factory building on a site adjacent to the original project plant in an existing industrial area. The site is already owned by Scametatra and has excellent highway and rail transportation. The existing industrial area can also provide adequate power and other utilities.    Description of Company and Purpose of Project    	Scametatra produces and assembles plastic injection molded part sets for a major manufacturer of durable goods. The expansion is being undertaken to support an increase in production by this facility in Slovakia. The project is to expand capacity of existing plastic injection molding plant from 350,000 to 700,000 part sets per year (about 14 million individual parts). The project includes construction and outfitting of a new factory building, and the purchase and installation of plastic injection molding presses and industrial robots.    Environmental Category and Issues    	This is a category B project according to IFC&apos;&apos;s environmental review procedure. The additional injection molding capacity will be installed in a new factory building located adjacent to the original greenfield plant, and within the same manufacturing complex; existing manufacturing operations are not expected to have resulted in land contamination. Infrastructure services (water, sewer, gas, electricity) will be provided by the complex. Environmental, occupational health and safety issues associated with this project include: solid and hazardous waste disposal; fire protection and emergency response; and employee training and workplace safety. Plastic scrap will be recycled in the process and about 260 tons per year of paper wastes will be sold for recycling. Solvents used will be disposed of in accordance with local regulations. Fire systems and training will be coordinated with those in use at the Tatramat complex. Induction training and refresher courses for plant operation and health and safety will be provided for all employees. All plant personnel will be trained in safe working practices and in proper handling of chemicals    The  is available from the InfoShop.       Host country location of environmental documents    1.
