   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In February 2006, the Millennium Challenge Corporation signed a five-year, $307 million compact with the Government of Benin aimed to increase investments and private sector activity through the implementation of four projects. These projects will increase access to land through more secure and useful land tenure; expand access to financial services through grants given to micro, small, and medium enterprises; provide access to justice by bringing courts closer to rural populations; and improve access to markets by eliminating physical and procedural constraints currently hindering the flow of goods through the Port of Cotonou. The MCC compact in Benin entered into force (EIF) in October 2006, formally initiating the five-year timeline for project implementation. For the most up-to-date information on implementation progress, please read the Quarterly Status Report.</narrative>
