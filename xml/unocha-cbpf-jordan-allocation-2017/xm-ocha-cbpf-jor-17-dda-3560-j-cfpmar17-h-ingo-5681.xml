   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Adreen (We can): Health assistance and inclusion for marginalised people with disabilities from the Syrian and host communities in Irbid and Amman governorates.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The overall project goal is to enhance the quality of life for women, girls, boys and men with physical disabilities and for their families, meeting their urgent rehabilitation needs and referring to further life-saving, secondary and tertiary health care those in need. The action will focus in particular on increasing the outreach to the rural and remote areas of Amman and Irbid governorates (mainly in the Ramtha area, where most of the war-wounded are based) and targeting the most marginalised individuals who generally face hardship in accessing health services because of their impossibility to leave their house, financial constraints or the fear of discrimination and stigmatization , with a view of improving  not only their health, but also their inclusion and participation in the community. 
The envisioned outcome will be the improvement of the access to secondary and tertiary health services for women, girls, boys and men with physical and psychomotor disabilities, through the provision of   physiotherapy rehabilitation sessions, psychological counseling, occupational therapy, mobility aids  (prosthesis, orthosis and customized wheelchairs),  potential referrals for people with further  urgent health care needs or mental health disorders, as well as training for caregivers and/or disabled individuals in vulnerable households in essential home-based rehabilitation, occupational therapy, and mobility aids maintenance, to ensure the sustainability and cost-efficiency of the intervention after the end of the project. This outcome will be reached through a combination of outreach through mobile clinics and Community Based Rehabilitation (CBR) approach, in order to better reach the most vulnerable, marginalised and house-bound people with disabilities. Further referral to secondary health care, mental health and protection services will be provided according to the specific individual needs of each beneficiary. The sustainability in the medium-long term for targeted households will be ensured through capacity building for both family caregivers and beneficiaries. This will be possible through one-on-one customized training sessions for the caregivers of the beneficiaries on both basic home-based daily rehabilitation exercises (to be provided in cases where access to constant and regular physiotherapy sessions is difficult), mobility aids maintenance and on best practices when dealing with people with disabilities. In order to maximize the efficiency and depth of the intervention, , a radio campaign will be launched at the beginning of the project explaining the services provided and how to access them. 
The action will be conducted by UPP together with its strategic local implementing partner Al Hussein Society - Jordan Center For Training amp Inclusion (AHS). AHS center, a specialized institute established in 1971 for the care of the disabled in Jordan, will share its expertise to provide the project beneficiaries with cost-efficient quality services and customized mobility aids (produced directly in the AHS workshop), and its decades of experience in providing healthcare in the local community  will ensure that the activities are implemented with authentic awareness of the beneficiaries&#x2019; needs. Additionally, the involvement of a local partner contributes to a better outreach and sustainability of the project, promoting a long-lasting positive impact of the proposed intervention. 
The intervention strategy is that of working on a limited number of extremely vulnerable beneficiaries in order to ensure the provision of high-quality, comprehensive services and a considerably sustainable impact for each targeted household beyond the duration of the project. UPP and AHS intend to lead efforts to complete and thorough assistance provision for each target individual, rather than providing partial services to a higher number of beneficiaries without fully meeting their multiple health needs.</narrative>
