   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Provision of life-saving and life-sustaining dialysis treatment to underprivileged and needy patients with end-stage renal disease as to the acute patients in underserved areas of the sub-districts of Dara Governorate in south Syria.
The intervention will take place in three dysfunctional field hospital dialysis units(HD), otherwise functional.Moreover, currently as per latest need assessment and facility report there are 22 designated dialysis units in the south Syria and only five(22%) are functioning.However, these five field hospitals are facing constraints, in terms of capacity to cater recommended  3 sessions of dialysis /week/patient needs of the target group.Also, have an interruption of HD services due to lack of continuous support in terms of consumables, medication and other support due to various known and unknown reasons.
However, the project has been designed in a way that it can cater to the other catchment to other field hospital and in the target population, as per their dire need.According to the Initial rapid need assessment and facility report, conducted by the partner from all field hospitals.Moreover the data from DOH, Syria, OCHA and WHO was also reviewed, analyzed and used in the planning stage.The total number of minimum direct beneficiaries will be 46 and indirect beneficiaries 322.
The procurement will be completed in Jordan by the implementing partner under the strict supervision  of medical and financial /admin teams  from Johanniter, due to unavailability of goods in Syria and to have in place stringent accountability, transparency, and inventory and price control.Moreover, procurement medication and supplies will have a mandatory pre-consignment inspection by Johanniter technical team to ensure quality.However, the budget for one standby HD equipment has reflected in the budget but HD equipment will not be procured in the initial stage of the project.In the case of dire need reflected from the technical group inside Syria due malfunction or damage due to unseen factors at this stage, and there will review from Johanniter technical team  and prior information will be given to the donor.
The project will have an independent monitoring mechanism to monitor services on weekly/monthly/quarterly basis from inside Syria.The documentation and reporting have planned that will confirm to standard and international norm, and are easily adaptable to the health management information system(HMIS) and other applicable and available platforms.The project will generate daily/weekly/monthly and quarterly information and reports for analysis and monitoring.The implementing partner will simultaneously also generate data and information as to collaborate and triangulate information by  verifiable means (reports/photos/video clips and other).
As,the, the project duration will be for six months.And,planning will start in the month of July 2017 as to able to be ready to roll out HD services in the first week of August 2017.Moreover, the project  has been designed with inbuilt  stringent, robust internal and external monitoring mechanism.The project has also  been planned in the most cost effective platform, keeping in view to provide safe, efficient and quality life-saving medical care to dialysis-dependent patients in vulnerable and dire needed clients/patients among the target group.
 
Thus, the field hospital identified are--Bosar sham,Naseeb and Hrak and have been selected on the basis of their critical and strategic Geolocation, as well as to have maximum catchment areas, the workload  for most vulnerable and need among  the target group .The services are likely to start from the month of August 2017.The project will have qualified technical staff (Nephrologist,GPs,Nurses) and program staff, to provide HD services at affordable,cost-effective and efficient manner to the dialysis dependent patients.</narrative>
