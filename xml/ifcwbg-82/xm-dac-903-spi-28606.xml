   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The need for increased capital and operating expertise in the district heating networks of the former Soviet Union has been clear for many years.  A decade long reform effort has recently attracted international industry capital and expertise to the power sector but low tariffs, constrained by limited affordability, has resulted in little progress in the heating sector. A number of domestic groups have entered the sector in recent years, often in conjunction with power distribution.  They are new to the heating sector; achieving the improved technical performance they projected has proven a challenge and most are now also suffering from capital constraints.  Effective intervention in this sector has the potential to deliver very considerable development impact. 

Dalkia has demonstrated its ability to achieve significant improvements in the heating sectors of post-Communist markets in Lithuania and Estonia and to generate returns for the long term upgrading of the networks.  It is the international industry investor best placed to make a region-wide impact on these systems.  

Reduced water losses, energy savings and heat generation in CHPs create savings which allow improved maintenance and upgrading, the provision of an improved service and the preservation of important capital assets. 

More efficient use of water and energy, conversion from HOBs to CHPs, and the increased use of renewable fuels in these CHPs, brings local environment benefits, which also contribute to climate change goals. 

Improved technical, operational, managerial, environmental, and corporate governance standards in the heating companies will promote the wider development of PPPs and contracting out of services by municipalities.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This investment supports a new holding company (the Company), expected to be established in France, using existing investments in district heating (DH) in the Baltic states as a platform, for expansion into district heating ventures in Russia, Ukraine and other CIS countries.  DH networks in the CIS region represent a very large capital investment, comparable in scale to that of the regions power sector.  Neglect of this capital stock has resulted in extensive water leakages, excess energy use and adverse environmental impacts.  The investment proposed here directly addresses water conservation, energy efficiency and environmental improvement</narrative>
