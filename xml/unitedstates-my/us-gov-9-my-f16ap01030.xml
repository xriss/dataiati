    <narrative xml:lang="EN">U.S. foreign assistance in Malaysia promotes peace and security by strengthening cooperation on law enforcement, nonproliferation, counterterrorism, rule of law, and expanding military ties. Assistance will further Malaysia&apos;s role as a reliable partner in maintaining regional stability, fighting terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMD), and strengthening key regional and global institutions that will contribute to the America&apos;s security. Counterterrorism (CT) assistance builds capacity within Malaysian law enforcement and judicial organizations; supports activities to improve Malaysia&apos;s border security; and strengthens networks between civil society, the government, and the private sector to counter violent extremism (CVE). Counter-proliferation assistance strengthens Malaysia&apos;s ability to prevent transshipments of controlled munitions and dual-use commodities. Military assistance and training builds critical capabilities among Malaysia&apos;s armed forces, allowing it to take on an expanded international role, including peacekeeping and stabilization operations and promotes a positive and lasting transformation of the U.S.-Malaysian relationship to further shared goals.</narrative>
