   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This award strives to conserve biodiversity and manage natural resources in ways that maintain their long-term viability and preserve their potential to meet the needs of present and future generations. Activities include combating illegal and corrupt exploitation of natural resources and the control of invasive species. This includes This project will promote the health of Sabah&#x2019;s gibbons and orangutans by creating a new Wildlife Health Monitoring and Surveillance Program that will work to minimize the risk of introducing infectious diseases to recipient populations from animals translocated from fragmented forests. It will also initiate research that will study the link between deforestation and disease in apes. The Recipient will do this by: (a) creating a Wildlife Health Unit within the Sabah Wildlife Department (SWD) including a veterinarian, a molecular biologist and four rangers as a subunit of the Wildlife Rescue Unit; (b) developing a Sabah Wildlife Health Monitoring and Surveillance Program to be led and implemented by the Wildlife Health Unit; (c) having the Wildlife Health Unit conduct ape health assessments, collect and analyze samples and store samples at the SWD Biobank; (d) processing clinical samples for infectious disease analysis; (e) training the Wildlife Health Unit to perform health assessments and clinical sampling for disease surveillance as part of rescue activities; (f) building much needed capacity by providing a vehicle for the Wildlife Health Unit to allow them to conduct disease surveillance and to respond to sick or injured animals across Sabah with optimal efficiency; (g) increasing laboratory capacity by training the molecular biologist to use PREDICT viral family PCR protocols; and (h) initiating a study on the effect deforestation has on ape health by analyzing the change in viral diversity along a deforestation gradient..</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">U.S. foreign assistance in Malaysia promotes peace and security by strengthening cooperation on law enforcement, nonproliferation, counterterrorism, rule of law, and expanding military ties. Assistance will further Malaysia&apos;s role as a reliable partner in maintaining regional stability, fighting terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMD), and strengthening key regional and global institutions that will contribute to the America&apos;s security. Counterterrorism (CT) assistance builds capacity within Malaysian law enforcement and judicial organizations; supports activities to improve Malaysia&apos;s border security; and strengthens networks between civil society, the government, and the private sector to counter violent extremism (CVE). Counter-proliferation assistance strengthens Malaysia&apos;s ability to prevent transshipments of controlled munitions and dual-use commodities. Military assistance and training builds critical capabilities among Malaysia&apos;s armed forces, allowing it to take on an expanded international role, including peacekeeping and stabilization operations and promotes a positive and lasting transformation of the U.S.-Malaysian relationship to further shared goals.</narrative>
