   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This award strives to conserve biodiversity and manage natural resources in ways that maintain their long-term viability and preserve their potential to meet the needs of present and future generations. Activities include combating illegal and corrupt exploitation of natural resources and the control of invasive species. This includes &apos;The purpose of this project is to estimate the abundance of orangutans in the Ulu Sungai Menyang landscape and to work with stakeholders to prepare a draft management plan of the area for the Sarawak Forest Department. The survey will be carried out on six plots in the landscape using the marked sign count method developed under a previous GACF grant. The project will consist of the following activities: 1. Identifying owners of native customary rights (NCR) lands and acquiring written permission to conduct orangutan nest count surveys in the Ulu Sungai Menyang landscape. 2. Zoning the landscape for surveys, i.e. easily accessible and difficult-to-access areas. Six plots will be surveyed. Four of these are to be randomly selected from the easily accessible stratum and two from the more difficult to access stratum. 3. Conducting five trips into the landscape within six months: a. Trip 1. Will be for a reconnaissance (recce) survey to identify potential sites for setting the plots (to assess the accessibility of the areas), identify ideal guides for different sites, and to plan the travelling schedule for the training and three repeat surveys. b. Trip 2. Will be for the cutting of new strip lines for three plots. c. Trip 3 to 5. Will be for three repeat surveys at three different plots. d. Repeat Trips 1-5 for a second three plots. 4. After the six months of surveys, compiling and analyzing the data. The data will then be used for the preparation of a final report on the orangutan population estimates at the Ulu Sungai Menyang landscape. 5. In the final two months of the project period, initiating preparation of a management plan draft for the Ulu Sungai Menyang landscape. WCS Asia Program Madhu Rao will be brought in to facilitate the conceptual planning workshop. &apos;.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">U.S. foreign assistance in Malaysia promotes peace and security by strengthening cooperation on law enforcement, nonproliferation, counterterrorism, rule of law, and expanding military ties. Assistance will further Malaysia&apos;s role as a reliable partner in maintaining regional stability, fighting terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMD), and strengthening key regional and global institutions that will contribute to the America&apos;s security. Counterterrorism (CT) assistance builds capacity within Malaysian law enforcement and judicial organizations; supports activities to improve Malaysia&apos;s border security; and strengthens networks between civil society, the government, and the private sector to counter violent extremism (CVE). Counter-proliferation assistance strengthens Malaysia&apos;s ability to prevent transshipments of controlled munitions and dual-use commodities. Military assistance and training builds critical capabilities among Malaysia&apos;s armed forces, allowing it to take on an expanded international role, including peacekeeping and stabilization operations and promotes a positive and lasting transformation of the U.S.-Malaysian relationship to further shared goals.</narrative>
