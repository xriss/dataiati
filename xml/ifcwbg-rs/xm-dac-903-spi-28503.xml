   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Climate Change Mitigation:  Climate change benefits include a corporate commitment by Kronospan to produce panel products from waste-wood chips, forest residues and pulpwood, and to stimulate growth of forests through sustainable forest management practices. Kronospan Serbia aims to source 50% of raw material inputs from wood chips and saw dust.    Employment: The Project will generate approximately 200 additional jobs in the relatively undeveloped rural area.     Benefits to Local SMEs: High volume production of value added products will benefit the local furniture manufacturers and construction industry through lower prices and higher product quality.    Increased Linkages:  The Project is expected to increase the sourcing of raw materials and wood from local suppliers, thereby enhancing the income of the people involved in the upstream production as well as the planting and harvesting of forests.        Import Substitution: Domestic wood panels manufacturers in Serbia are unable to meet local demand. Increased local supply of particleboard is expected to substitute imports and lower board prices in the country and contribute to the competitiveness of exports and the local downstream construction and furniture industries.     Strong Demonstration Effect:  The success of the project during the ongoing financial crisis is likely to have demonstration effect for similar investments by other global and regional companies.  This is likely to encourage FDI, boosting confidence in the economy and the environment for private sector investment.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Kronospan Serbia has finished construction of a particleboard plant in Lapovo to better serve the markets of Serbia and the Balkan countries.  Planned plant capacity is 380,000 m3 of particleboard and 11 million m2 of melamine facing per annum.   The project was financed by Kronospan and HVB, Germany.  Production was to commence in Spring 2009, but the project was delayed due to difficulties with land acquisition, regulatory permissions and a decision to increase capacity to better realize economies of scale.  It is expected that the full scale production will start in 2010.</narrative>
