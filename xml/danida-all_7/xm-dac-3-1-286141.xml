   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Local Support is included in the extension of the ROI IV Afghanistan Programme until the end of 2021. There is a continued need for local programme support at the Embassy in Kabul. The grant will fund a Local Programme Officer at the Embassy in Kabul. 

The overall objective of the ROI is to help secure access to protection and durable solutions for refugees and internally displaced persons as close to their home as possible, including through:
- Improving living conditions and protection for targeted groups of forced migrants, including refugees, Internally Displaced People (IDPs), rejected asylum-seekers and host populations; 
- Supporting the safe and dignified return of forced migrants to their place of origin and assist in their re-integration; 
- Assisting with support to self-reliance or local integration in the country of asylum, where possible in line with existing integration/resettlement policies.</narrative>
