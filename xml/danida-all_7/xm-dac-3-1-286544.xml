   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project will provide life-saving and life-improving health activities, and conflict-affected adults and children in Northeast Syria are protected from and treated for the consequences of communicable and non-communicable diseases.

The project will support the vulnerable populations in NES to a) have increased and sustained access to life saving, primary healthcare services; b) have increased knowledge and understanding of COVID-19 including how to protect themselves; c) have access to support services to facilitate functional autonomy. 

Due to its nature as a response to a humanitarian appeal operational results are general and highly aggregated and the MFA contribution is thus reflected in the overall results reporting by the partner.  Please refer to the hyperlink below.
