   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Development Engagement will address the current gap in the construction industry between the workers&#x2019; skills needed for green transition and the current skills supply. Male and female youth will gain vocational skills that are - and will be - in demand by employers and dual and work-based learning, including quality intern and apprenticeships will ensure improved employability. The DE introduces innovative elements at both top-down (policy dimension) and bottom-up (company, local and educational institution dimension) to achieve long-term systemic changes. The DE engages social partners and enterprises in Kenya from the outset, ensuring local ownership and participation while including social partners, gender specialists and TVET institutions from Denmark in providing tailored advisory assistance during the full DE implementation phase.
The objective of the DE will be sought achieved through three outcomes, namely 1) the social partners promote decent work within the construction sector in Kenya through their cooperation to improve TVET for the sector, 2) TVET institutions and social partners promote green transition in the construction sector through cooperation for improved, demand responsive training and certification, and 3) TVET institutions and social partners in Kenya promote an improved gender balance and equal opportunities in the construction sector in Kenya through TVET access, training outcomes and sustainable development competencies.</narrative>
