  <description type="2" xml:lang="EN">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Objective of the information campaign is two-fold; a) Awareness raising activities in the Horn of Africa and Sudan on the risks of onward irregular movement and, b) Provide information on available services in countries of first asylum and opportunities for regular movement, when available.

With support of the Government of Denmark the project&#x2019;s core awareness raising activities can:
&#x2022;	Continue providing truthful and trustworthy testimonials by members of the diaspora in Europe and elsewhere, as this proved to be the most powerful tool to maintain and reinforce a critical intra-community discourse on the dangers of &#x201C;Tahriib&#x201D; (i.e. the journey to Europe);
&#x2022;	Widen and deepen the direct involvement of the community and refugee members by actively bringing on board teams of refugee volunteers, who will engage directly with the target populations and see to the sustainability of the project;
&#x2022;	Keep reframing the narrative on life in Europe, debunking myths and providing trustworthy information on entitlements to protection and of the economic and social realities of everyday life in close cooperation with the respective diaspora, including in Denmark;
&#x2022;	Counter the narrative of smugglers and traffickers, expose their methods and undermine their credibility;
&#x2022;	Provide information on complementary pathways should they be made available in the countries of first asylum; and
&#x2022;	Continue to promote intra-community dialogue on risks and opportunities.

UNHCR launched the awareness raising campaign, Telling the Real Story (TRS) , in 2015, as part of a multi-country initiative aimed at providing truthful and trustworthy information to refugees and other persons of concern in mixed flows. The purpose was to empower target audiences (asylum-seekers, refugees and other people on the move) to make informed decisions about their future, their immediate courses of action, and the risks associated with their choices; decisions based on facts rather than on smugglers&#x2019; and traffickers&#x2019; narrative or misinformation from the diaspora.</narrative>

TRS testimonies are gathered from refugees and asylum-seekers in Europe, countries of transit in North Africa and from returnees in Somalia. These stories are uploaded to the various digital platforms &#x2013; dedicated website, and social media sites in the languages of the communities &#x2013; which are then promoted by the project team in Europe through carefully built up networks with the diaspora groups. Diaspora engagement is crucial to ensuring that messaging on onward movement is adapted to the populations the project engages with - Somali and Eritrean. Telling the Real Story has built up, over its five years of operation, a trust base with communities and a solid audience base.
TRS has been successful in enhancing an intra-community dialogue through innovative refugee-to-refugee communication. The project utilizes both traditional forms of communication in camps and urban settings as well as social media and broadcast media to reach the wider communities.</narrative>

Somalia has one of the world&#x2019;s lowest school enrolment rates&#x2014;70% of children of primary school age do not attend school.  Almost half of the youth in Somalia are unemployed. Among young unemployed people and persons, who stay out of education, many still have the intention to seek employment and opportunities outside Somalia, including in the Gulf countries and in Europe. 
TRS has reached approximately 36,000 persons (including children) in Somalia (Somaliland) through dialogue sessions with community members and religious leaders, debate sessions in 40 primary and secondary schools, engaged with returnees who&#x2019;s stories serve to complement the project video testimonies, career counselling sessions in schools, engaged  with 12 celebrities in 15 events. Awareness raising activities also have taken place in camps for Internally Displaced People (IDPs).</narrative>

      <narrative xml:lang="EN">Baseline: 22,000 refugees and asylum seekers reached and engaged in direct outreach activities 

Sudan is currently a major host and transit country for East African refugees as well as migrants, who intend to move along the Central Mediterranean route to Europe. 

As of February 2020, 397,000  refugees and asylum-seekers are estimated to live in Khartoum and an additional estimated 105,501  in refugee camps in Eastern Sudan, 35% of whom are children. The rate of onward movement from the camps in the East was 50% in 2019. Based on some extrapolation from random registration records, it is believed that some 60% went to Egypt, while the rest either stayed in Khartoum or moved to Libya.

Research has revealed that the main protection concerns among urban refugees and asylum-seekers in Khartoum centres around legal and physical protection issues, SGBV risks, education and child protection issues, as well as community mobilization challenges.</narrative>

Ethiopia is a country of destination and transit for refugees, asylum-seekers, and other persons of concern who are fleeing persecution in their countries of origin. 

Telling the Real Story has played a significant role in the provision of information and raising awareness of the difficulties and dangers of onward movement in refugee camps in Jijiga (Somali region), Shire (Tigray region hosting Eritrean refugees) and urban refugees in Addis Ababa. In addition to awareness raising, Telling the Real Story was able to incorporate community empowerment projects that address some of the root causes of onward irregular movement.</narrative>
