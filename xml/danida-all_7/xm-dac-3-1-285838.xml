  </title>
  <description type="2" xml:lang="EN">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">As a prerequisite for receiving debt relief through the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative, Somalia must clear its arrears to the International Financial Institutions. The International Financial Institutions have conditioned their contribution to the HIPC on full compensation for their cost of this,  which donors have agreed to cover. For three countries who all had large arrears to the IMF (Liberia, Somalia and Sudan), it was agreed that donors would contribute to the arrears clearance process when the countries approached the HIPC Decision Point. Denmark contributes to clearing Somalia&#x2019;s arrears to IMF through a) Denmark&#x2019;s share of so-called &#x201C;membership contributions&#x201D; in IMF and b) a bilateral grant to cover the financing gap resulting from the fact that many developing countries are not able to contribute with their &#x201C;membership contributions&#x201D;. 

The development objective is to support stabilization and development in Somalia through reinforcement of the financial underpinnings of the exercise of core government functions at the central and decentral level. The actual support will be based on progress achieved by Somalia in meeting the preconditions for treatment under the HIPC initiative as described above. This will be measured through the reporting of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank and by the Danish Embassy in Nairobi. For Danida&#x2019;s reporting purposes the following key outcome and output indicators have been selected to document progress:  1. A credible and sufficiently realistic Poverty Reduction Strategy, as assessed by the IMF and the World Bank. 2. Satisfactory performance on the IMFs 4th Staff Monitored Program. 3. Agreements in the boards of the IMF and the World Bank that Somalia has med the conditions for the HIPC Decision and Completion Point.</narrative>
