   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The objective(s) of the peace and stabilisation cooperation among the parties is core support to Adelphi&#x2019;s research, analysis, policy formulation and advocacy efforts, which complement and reinforce efforts of national governments including Denmark, the EU, the UN, other regional and international organisations, as well as wider stakeholders to climate, conflict and security, including opinion makers and peace actors, to prevent or resolve conflicts and build a lasting peace. 

The Danish core contribution will be used to enable Adelphi&#x2019;s core activities of field research, advocacy, and policy engagement and outreach. This will contribute to the development of knowledge products and operational guidance on the interlinkages between climate and security with a view to preventing, resolving and mitigating conflict through informing and influencing the perceptions and actions of policymakers and other key actors in fragile settings. 

A regional focus will be on fragile and conflict prone countries in Africa (for example, specific geographical contexts in the Sahel and/or the Horn of Africa).</narrative>
