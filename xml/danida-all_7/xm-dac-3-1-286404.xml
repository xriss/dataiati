  </title>
  <description type="2" xml:lang="EN">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">To facilitate coal phase-out in Indonesia and Vietnam by: 
1.	Develop a common fact base to align decision makers and supporting organizations on optimal power transition pathways. 
2.	Design financial mechanisms for piloting in Vietnam and Indonesia. 
3.	Define a path for early coal phaseout in Vietnam and Indonesia. 

RMI&#x2019;s approach to achieving an effective, rapid coal phaseout rests on the development of innovative and inclusive financial approaches that support key decision-makers to pursue pathways to declining coal utilization, ramp-up clean energy investment, and facilitate a just transition for workers and communities. To achieve these outcomes, our work is centered on three priorities: Refinancing coal capital costs on the condition of power plant owners committing to an accelerated phase out, which frees up capital to help fund coal transition while lowering customer costs; Reinvesting in clean energy, which allows owners to phase out coal plants and reduce customer costs further while replacing returns from coal plants with returns from clean energy; and Transition financing for coal workers and communities, raised in part through refinancing, which offers immediate resources to preserve livelihoods, protect benefits, and ensure that host communities can continue to thrive.</narrative>
