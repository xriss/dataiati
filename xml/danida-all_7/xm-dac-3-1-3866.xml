   <narrative xml:lang="EN">An estimated 2 billion poor people, corresponding to almost 40% of the world&#x2019;s working age adults, are excluded from formal financial services. Financial inclusion is considered as one of the most important factors to mitigate poverty as it can empower poor people, reduce their vulnerability to unexpected economic and social shock, and enable them to graduate into the formal economy through income generating activities, access to education, access to health care and better housing.

CGAP&#x2019;s mission is to promote the lives of poor people through the promotion of responsible, sustainable and affordable financial markets.
