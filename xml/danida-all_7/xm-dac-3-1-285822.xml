   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Strategic Sector Cooperation on Food Safety Between Denmark and Mexico Phase I.

The Strategic Sector Cooperation on Food Safety is a peer-to-peer cooperation  between the Danish Veterinary and Food Administration and the Mexican National Agro-Alimentary Health, Safety and Quality Service. The objective of the Strategic Sector Cooperation is to strengthen animal health, food safety, and public health including through improving the preparedness of the veterinary services in the handling of exotic diseases in Mexico. Mexico is the world&#x2019;s 9th largest producer of pork meat. The industry employs more than two million people directly and indirectly. The Government of Mexico wants to strengthen productivity, self-sufficiency, disease prevention and food safety and to promote job creation through national food production, areas where Denmark has plenty of expertise and experience. There is especially a strong wish from the mexican government to work on prevention of African Swine Fever and Antimicrobial Resistance. The project will reduce risks from of loss of income and livelihoods in the pig industry, of negative impacts on human health and of pollution of the environment.</narrative>
