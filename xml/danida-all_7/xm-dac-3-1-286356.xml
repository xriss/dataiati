   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This appropriation note covers a Danish contribution of DKK 7.4 mio. kr. to the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent
Societies&#x2019; (IFRC) emergency appeal related to the COVID-19 outbreak earmarked to India. The Danish contribution will hence support the Indian Red Cross, which delivers assistance and support to Indian communities affected or at risk of being affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The support is provided through the Danish strategic partner, Danish Red Cross (DRK).

Through IFRC&#x2019;s global COVID-19 appeal, support to Indian Red Cross in delivering assistance and support to communities affected or at risk of being affected by the COVID-19 outbreak, with a focus on sustaining health and WASH, addressing socio-economic impacts and strengthening the Indian Red Cross.

Due to its nature as a response to a humanitarian appeal operational results are general and highly aggregated and the MFA contribution is thus reflected in the overall results reporting by the partner.  Please refer to the hyperlink below.
