   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The overall aim of this programme is to contribute to poverty reduction through support for the development, implementation and monitoring of Mozambique&apos;s poverty reduction strategy. The immediate objectives are to:

1. Enhance partnerships between the government and programme support partners based on a formalised, open and transparent dialogue on the content and progress in implementation of the poverty strategy. 

2. Through programme support, ensure financing of the national poverty reduction strategy, strengthen effectiveness of aid and provide the basis for mobilisation of Mozambique&apos;s own resources for the development process. In addition, the aim is to improve the efficiency of the state administration and promote the parliamentarians and citizens insight into public administration.

Programme support is provided within the framework of joint programme for general budget support involving 19 donors. Total commitment for 2011 amount to USD 454 million, which is a slight drop of 4 percent from the 2010 commitment. Total aid accounts for about half of Mozambique&apos;s state budget. The programme requires the government to continuously update a three-year spending plan with measurable indicators, which form the basis for the donors&apos; and the government&apos;s assessment of the momentum. The government is committed to maintaining and strengthening critical elements of the reform process, including the implementation of anti-corruption, a new financial management system in public administration and new public procurement rules based on international standards, as well as improving internal and external audits. In addition, the government is committed to strengthening tax administration and increasing tax revenues.

Budget support consists of a fixed tranche, disbursed on the basis of satisfactory implementation of the poverty strategy, and a variable tranche initiated by the achievement of financial management objectives.</narrative>
