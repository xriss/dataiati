   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In the last 20 years, global demand for shea has increased by 600%, and industry experts forecast a further 50% increase within the next 5 years. To guarantee the sustainability of the shea industry in terms of meeting demand trends, stakeholders are increasingly looking at Nigeria as key to the supply chain. Although Nigeria represents 23% of the land available for shea in West Africa, its share of commercial production and exports is only 10%. To meet the sustainably sourced demands of industry and to realize Nigeria&#x2019;s potential, AAK in partnership with Global Shea Alliance, the National Association of Shea Products in Nigeria and MEDA, adapts its Kolo Nafaso model, a direct sourcing model, for an organized supply network of quality shea in Nigeria.  The Kolo Nafaso model incentivises women shea kernel collectors by increasing shea-related incomes and building their capacity to engage in a global marketplace.
The Danida Market Development Partnerships programme (DMDP) is designed to support commercially oriented partnerships for sustainable market development in developing countries. In addition to reporting on individually determined outputs and outcomes, all DMDP projects report on five key programme indicators. These five indicators are the same for the whole project portfolio, enabling strategic and programme level monitoring, and aggregation of results.
At the programme level, three key outcomes which are related to three of the five key programme indicators, have been chosen for results reporting: Outcome 1: Increased employment (decent jobs) for women, men and youth. Outcome 2: Increased income opportunities from improved market linkages. Outcome 3: Additional capital raised (investment leverage).</narrative>
