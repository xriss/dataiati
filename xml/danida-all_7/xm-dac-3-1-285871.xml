   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Strategic Sector Cooperation on Energy between Denmark and Turkey, Phase II 

The Strategic Sector Cooperation on Energy is a peer-to-peer cooperation between the Danish Environmental Agency and Turkish Ministry for Energy and Natural Resources. The main objective of the Strategic Sector Cooperation  is to assist in developing relevant policies, strategies and solutions to enable a sustainable transition of the Turkish energy sector. The cooperation addresses the challenges Turkey face regarding the significant dependence of imported energy sources. Around 75% of all Turkey&#x2019;s energy needs are based on imports. This heavy energy import dependence is a security concern, has a negative effect on Turkey&#x2019;s trade balance and result in relatively high energy prices that hits the low-income households, which contributes to an increased social imbalance. The combination of a trade deficit, high-energy costs and energy supply security makes energy a major national political focus area for the Turkish Government. 

The Danish Model and experience can contribute to create framework conditions for an energy efficient heat market and over time leading to a green transition of the energy system in Turkey. The Danish know-how within offshore wind will be a major contribution to create affordable and green energy in Turkey not dependent on import of foreign energy sources.</narrative>
