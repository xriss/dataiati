   <narrative xml:lang="EN">A number of donors established the SRHR fund operating under the name AmplifyChange in
2014 The fund was established as a response to an identified challenge faced by small and
medium sized civil society ( in developing countries to access funds from traditional
donors recognizing the potential embedded in building the capacity of these small and medium
si z ed CSO to advance the SRHR agenda. AmplifyChange is a well known advocate for
improved policy and action on the most neglected SRHR issues F rom inception in 2014
AmplifyChange has over a 5 6 years period built its brand and an administrative set up
capable of managing a large number of small and medium size projects, and developed an
innovative virtual platform for knowledge sharing and tools for its grantees AmplifyChange
uses a &#x2018;call for proposals&#x2019; model in combination with activities for strengthening grantees&#x2019;
organisational capacity. Since the start of the fund, about 750 grants hav e been approved to a
varied range of groups, each working on a key aspect of SRHR. AmplifyChange showed its
strength during the Covid 19 lock down where it quickly adapted to changing circumstances in
the way of working and quickly set up webinars for its grantees and established a platform for
grantees to share knowledge and ideas on how to continue working under Covid 19.</narrative>
