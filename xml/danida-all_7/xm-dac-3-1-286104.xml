   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Indonesia being the fourth most populated country in the world and the sixth largest global emitter of greenhouse gases is an essential partner in the dialogue and action on the green transition. 
This project focuses on institutional capacity development where transformational change for low carbon development can be achieved.
Partners in the project have Government mandate (and authority) in the chosen areas of collaboration. They are already trusted partners in Strategic Sector Projects (DK/ID), and the applied government-to-government modality has been verified as being fit-for-purpose.
The formulation process for INDODEPP has included series of close consultations with national partners. In the end of the formulation process partner commitment was confirmed by the joint (DK/ID) signing of a Consultation Document summarizing the main targets of INDODEPP.
The project is in line with the Danish Government&#x2019;s Climate Act and targets climate change mitigation and SDGs prioritised in Denmark&#x2019;s strategy &#x201C;The World 2030&#x201D; for development cooperation.
Inclusive, sustainable growth - and development is one of the strategic objectives of Denmark&#x2019;s Strategy for Development Cooperation and Humanitarian Action. Economies in transition and emerging economies are considered key players to achieve the global Sustainable Development Goals. The development strategy underlines the importance of providing support for their sustainable development, as they demand expertise, knowledge, technologies and investments to make appropriate strategic choices. Energy is in this regard a priority sector where Denmark has particular knowledge, resources and interests. The strategy also points to the relevance of building strategic partnerships and government-to-government cooperation to promote common agendas such as climate change.</narrative>
