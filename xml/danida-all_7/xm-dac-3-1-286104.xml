   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project will support an enabling environment for sustainable energy in Indonesia as a part of a cost-efficient electricity system with increased security of supply and reduced energy intensity. This will be reached through improved energy planning and modelling, larger shares of variable renewable energy sources and strong system integration, as well as increased energy efficiency.

The Danish Energy Agency (DEA) will deliver TA under government-to-government cooperation including deployment of international long-term advisors (LTAs) to key partners in Indonesia. The partners are:  Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources (MEMR), Director General of New, Renewable Energy and Energy Conservation (EBTKE), including the Secretary General of National Energy Council (NEC) and Director of the Indonesian state owned transmission-, generation- and distribution- facility (PLN), Director General of Electricity, as well as expert staff to the Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources. The Danish Energy Agency (DEA) will be supported by the Embassy in Jakarta and the  and the sector counsellor.

Impact at outcome level will be evaluated in a mid-term review in 2023 and in the final report in 2025. Project implementation progress is measured by a yearly report on accomplishment of activities in the annual workplan (measured by a percentage of total planned activities)</narrative>
