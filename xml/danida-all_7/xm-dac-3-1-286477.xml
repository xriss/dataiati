   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The objective of the development cooperation is to achieve more sustainable and greener food systems in developing countries and hence reduce hunger and malnutrition. The contribution of Denmark will be allocated and administered with the overall aim of advancing the transition of developing countries towards sustainable food systems that advance achievement of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The contribution will particularly support developing countries and less developed countries (LDCs) in engaging through the work of national and regional Food Systems Summit Dialogues. It will also place particular focus on how producers, with a focus on poor smallholder farmers and fishers organizations, women&#x2019;s organizations, indigenous peoples, youth and other vulnerable groups in these countries are able to engage in the Summit&#x2019;s preparatory process, as they are some of the most critical constituencies in food systems, but often the most marginalized. 
The department of Green Diplomacy and Climate will base the actual support on progress attained in the implementation of the engagement as described in the documentation provided by the grantee (see Results Framework as Annex 3 attached). Progress will be measured through the World Food Programme&#x2019;s monitoring framework.</narrative>
