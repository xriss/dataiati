   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Humanitarian Policy Group (HPG) within the Overseas Development Institute (ODI) implements a biannual integrated research programme (IP) that addresses core issues related to the efficiency of humanitarian action.  The IP for the period 2019-21 has been extended due to the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on research activities. It provides a critical analysis of the ability of the humanitarian sector to deliver on its stated commitment to impartiality. The IP focuses on the key obstacles to &#x2013; and enablers of &#x2013; a more inclusive aid system, analysing why certain groups or individuals are excluded from assistance; exploring the relationships between changing gender norms and assistance and vulnerability in displacement; exploring the emerging impacts of new technology in improving or undermining the system&#x2019;s ability to address those furthest behind; and assessing historical and contemporary practices of humanitarian advocacy and protection on behalf of those most at risk in conflict. Themes for the 2022-2024 IP will be selected through a consultative process during 2021, involving among others the Advisory Group.
Key results: Policy Briefs, Working Papers (based on case studies), Roundtables and Final Reports in four components: 
i) Falling through the cracks: inclusion and exclusion in humanitarian action 
ii) How gender roles change in displacement 
iii) The humanitarian &#x2018;digital divide&#x2019;: understanding the impact of technology on crisis response
iv) Advocating for humanity: opportunities for improving protection outcomes in conflict
This will be delivered before March 2022, following which the next IP cycle will be initiated. This will be finalized by the end of the current grant period.</narrative>
