   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The DEPP III supports China, Vietnam, South Africa and Mexico to achieve low carbon development, implement the Paris Agreement on Climate Change and continue upscaling and realizing their National Determined Contributions. The programme is based on government-to-government partnerships between the Danish Energy Agency and strategically selected national authorities in the partner countries in order to share and transfer Danish expertise on low carbon development within the energy sector.   

China, Vietnam, South Africa and Mexico are selected as strategic partners of the DEPP III due to their historic, current and forecasted acceleration in energy demand, significant GHG-emissions and the
potential for cost-efficient reduction of GHGs. The four countries are all important transition economies
and their collective total GHG-emissions constitute almost 1/3 of the world&#x2019;s GHG-emissions. Therefore,
these countries play a significant role globally in achieving the objective of the Paris Agreement as well as Sustainable Development Goal 7 (newable energy) and 13 (climate change). In addition, the partner institutions all have a clear interested in learning from Danish expertise and know-how on renewable energy, energy efficiency and other measure to promote mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions.    

Impact at outcome level will be evaluated in a mid-term review in 2023 and in the final report in 2025. Project implementation progress is measured by a yearly report on accomplishment of activities in the annual workplan (measured by a percentage of total planned activities)</narrative>
