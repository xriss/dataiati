Since the signature of the MoU in September 2019, the ETM Centre in Gashora improvement works have been conducted through the rehabilitation/modification of 30 accommodation blocks, which have the capacity to accommodate 300 evacuees from Libya as at May 2020. All the houses are equipped with beds, bedding materials, sitting room chairs, etc. For the public infrastructures, the operation constructed a new dining/kitchen block servicing PoCs to have their meals; a reception/medical screening area in durable materials at the main entrance for medical screening services upon arrival; a new security screening area at the main entrance assisting the police for security checks at the centre. Improvement of sports and recreation facilities were achieved through the construction of the new basketball/volleyball courts, the rehabilitation of an improved football pitch, and the construction of an indoor game structure.</narrative>

In November 2020, UNHCR conducted a rapid livelihoods assessment at the Gashora ETM centre with the objective to:
1. Identify livelihoods needs and willingness of PoCs to pursue livelihoods opportunities.
2. Explore possible short to medium term livelihoods interventions for ETM PoCs and their host communities.
The mission team explained to PoCs that the purpose of livelihood interventions would be to support them to ensure productive use of the transition period-pending durable solutions (e.g. skills training which they need to prepare their future and become productive wherever they are). Most of the youth emphasized that their primary goal is to be resettled. However, some were open and willing to pursue short courses in the following areas as they understand that the skills they would acquire at the ETM would be useful whatever durable solution will be applicable. Follow up discussion with the youth showed a growing interest in skill building opportunities.</narrative>

Considering the profile of the evacuees that includes many children and youth who went through traumatic experience during their journey and in Libya, UNHCR and its partners have invested from the onset of the ETM programme into education and recreational activities. Literacy and language classes in English and Kinyarwanda have started but temporarily had to be stopped to COVID 19 restrictions. As soon as these restrictions are lifted UNHCR wants to resume / initiate accelerated learning programs, livelihoods activities, self and community empowerment initiatives which are part of the healing process and are critical to help these PoCs rebuild their lives while waiting for durable solutions to be identified. In this process, special attention and support &#x2013; including psychosocial support - is provided to the refugees and asylum seekers with specific needs including victims of torture and SGBV survivors in order to help them cope with their trauma and foresee a brighter future.</narrative>

PoCs are mostly young, unaccompanied males. Half of them experience detention while in Libya and the majority have been subject to severe human rights violations. Over 40% of them need psychosocial support to cope with the trauma and abuse they have faced during their journey and while in Libya. While psychosocial assistance has started from the onset of the ETM programme in Rwanda, this support, particularly group counselling activities, have been affected by COVID 19 restriction measures related to confinement and social distancing. These activities need to be resumed and strengthened to avoid the development within the evacuee population of negative coping mechanisms that could lead to substance abuse and violence, disinterest in livelihoods and adult education programmes, difficulties to implement durable solutions with too high expectations on resettlement while some PoCs will not be deemed fit for this solution.</narrative>

Sport and community work activities did exist but have been temporarily stopped due to COVID 19. These activities are needed to build up peaceful coexistence between the host community the evacuees (their new neighbours) so they do not perceive them as a threat but as vulnerable people whose presence is bringing new projects and opportunities. This social interaction between the communities plays a critical role in the healing process of PoCs, who have been outside of any social network for years and need to rebuild trust and basic social skills to integrate in a new community/country.</narrative>

Half of the ETM population is made up of unaccompanied minors, mainly teenagers. Libyan Evacuees from Libya and host community members are now living side to side in a rural area and face similar challenges and barriers for communication, social interactions and personal development. Providing them access to and utilization of ICT, Music &amp; Art, and life and interactive skills, would allow social linkages to develop between the communities and also to unleash their potential by building or strengthening their self-confidence, self-esteem and self-reliance capacities.</narrative>
