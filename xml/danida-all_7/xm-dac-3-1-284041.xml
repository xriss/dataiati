  <description type="1" xml:lang="EN">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Since the outbreak of armed conflict in the northern regions of Mali in 2012, the country has been hit by a humanitarian crisis that has since spread to the far more densely populated central regions and 140,000 people have fled to neighboring Mauritania, Niger and Burkina Faso, while just over 168,000 people are internally displaced in the country. The unrest and instability in the Sahel spread in earnest in the period 2016-17 from Mali and Niger to Burkina Faso, where regional as well as local terrorist groups have successfully destabilized retail areas in the north and east. Armed groups attack security forces as well as other state and, in some cases, religious and local institutions. During 2019, there are several cases in which the civilian population has also been the target of attacks, just as several hundred civilians have lost their lives in ethnic violence between local communities in the north. As a result, there are currently approx. 290,000 internally displaced persons, and more than 2,000 schools and numerous health centers have been closed due to threats from jihadists. 
The grant is in support of UNHCRs general efforts to support displaced people in Central Sahel &#x2013; in terms of protection, basic services, food supply etc. Subsequent reports on these activities can be found at: https://www.unhcr.org/globalreport2019/ and https://reporting.unhcr.org/wca</narrative>
