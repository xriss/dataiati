   <narrative xml:lang="EN">People and their communities are able to progress towards and reach durable solutions to displacement, supported by the collaborative efforts of governments, humanitarian and development actors that are based on high quality evidence. JIPS supports this by ensuring high quality standards and effective use of profiling and displacement data systems.

The Joint IDP Profiling Service (JIPS) aims to provide core evidence for programmes in support of internally displaced people by establishing a stronger data and information base on demographic and vulnerability issues. The program is led by a steering group composed of, among others, UNHCR, Danish and Norwegian Refugee Council, UNDP, OCHA and IDMC. Since its establishment in 2009, profiling projects have been carried out in a large number of countries affected by internal displacement. In addition, extensive training has been carried out by both own and partner employees, and a number of web-based tools have been developed, which are now available for free use on the JIPS website. 

Key results:
Ensuring high quality standards and effective use of profiling and displacement data systems through: &#x203A; Field support and capacity building &#x203A; Information management and innovation &#x203A; Advocacy and communications
Goal 1: Joint responses to displacement are informed by comprehensive durable solutions analysis shared by governments, humanitarian and development actors and affected communities
Goal 2:
Responses to urban displacement crises are informed by adequate, tailored analysis that accounts for displacement and population vulnerabilities in addition to the wider urban context
Goal 3:
Governments and local authorities are able to make an informed choice of displacement data systems that are appropriate for their contexts and intended uses, and are supported to implement profiling exercises as relevant</narrative>
