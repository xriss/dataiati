The Strategic Sector Cooperation on health is a peer-to-peer cooperation between the Danish Ministry of Health and the Brazilian Ministry of Health. The main objective of the Strategic Sector Cooperation is to support the improvement of healthcare management in Brazil. A rapidly aging population as well as changes in disease patterns put the Brazilian health care system under pressure and calls for improvements of the current system. 

This project addresses the need for improved health care in Brazil through improved use of health data as well as more efficient and transparent approval processes for pharmaceuticals. The project is divided into two work streams: I) digitalisation and standards including the use of a Diagnostic Related Group system, and II) optimisation of the approval processes for pharmaceuticals.</narrative>
