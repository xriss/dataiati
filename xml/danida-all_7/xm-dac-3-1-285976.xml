The Sector Cooperation aims to support ambitious sustainable urban development in Buenos Aires, especially in the key areas; buildings energy efficiency, flood prevention, and waste water management. 

The City of Buenos Aires has high levels of energy inefficiency due to former energy subsidies. The City of Copenhagen has relevant experiences within energy efficiency in buildings and wastewater treatment. Also, Buenos Aires faces challenges as a traditionally flood prone mega city, which makes Copenhagen experience with attractive green solutions to reduced flood risk particularly valuable. The goal is for the city government and the water utility of Buenos Aires to save money while reducing CO2 emissions and making a more liveable city.</narrative>
