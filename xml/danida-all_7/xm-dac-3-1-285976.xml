   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Strategic Sector Cooperation on Urban Development is a peer-to-peer cooperation between the City of Buenos Aires and the City of Copenhagen. 
Through the project, the City of Buenos Aires will achieve energy savings and CO2 emission reductions through investments in energy efficient measures in public buildings, develop a long-term climate change adaptation plan in relation to water issues and achieve energy optimization of wastewater treatment plants and sewer systems through successful demonstration projects. 

 A Strategic Sector Cooperation (SSC) is a partnership aiming at improving sector framework conditions in a partner country. The initiative is a flexible and adaptive instrument for exchanging experiences, learning and capacity building, which builds on a consolidated strong relationship and trust between the involved authorities. The commitment to finance the Danish authorities&#x2019; participation is sequenced in phas-es; an inception phase of approximately one year resulting in a project document; followed by phase one, two and &#x2013;if need be &#x2013; a phase three during which the cooperation is deepened and developed. All SSC partnerships are supported by a sector advisor at the embassy, who impel progress and stir the partnership in the direction agreed upon.

Annually, the SSC projects deliver a report on project progress and results achieved. Progress on selected outputs are displayed in openaid.</narrative>
