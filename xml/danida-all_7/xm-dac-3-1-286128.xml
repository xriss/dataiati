  <description type="1" xml:lang="EN">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Insufficient access to clean energy remains a critical impediment to inclusive growth and job
creation in developing countries while a transition towards renewable energy is a cornerstone to
meet the Paris Agreement climate goals. The Energy Sector Management Assistance Program
(ESMAP) is a multi-donor trust fund anchored in the World Bank (WB) that provides analytical
and advisory services to low- and middle-income countries to reduce poverty and boost growth,
through environmentally sustainable energy solutions.
From 2017-2019, ESMAP had an outreach to more than 70 countries and its technical advisory
services informed a total US$ 26.6 billion in World Bank energy financing. ESMAP&#x2019;s work in the
period is estimated to benefit 76 million people with access to electricity and instalment of 17.6
gigawatts of renewable energy in more than 54 developing countries. Recently, ESMAP has also
become the formal umbrella trust fund for energy within the WB&#x2019;s energy practice and it will also
be responsible for managing associated energy trust funds. Denmark has supported ESMAP since
1999 and it is perceived as a strategic trust fund in the Danish effort to align the World Bank
lending portfolio to the Paris Agreement.
This development engagement document is the basis for the new phase of Danish support to
ESMAP for an amount of DKK 90 million and provides the justification for the renewed support
to ESMAP. It also describes how Denmark will engage in the management and monitoring
structures of the ESMAP trust fund during implementation.</narrative>
