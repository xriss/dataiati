   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The South African government provides funding for building projects for low income people through a national subsidy program. After reaching its 1994 target for the construction of 1 million houses, the focus has shifted towards the quality of the houses built under the program. The project aims to develop and test affordable and energy efficient low-cost houses in relation to the design and materials. Energy efficient low-cost houses will contribute to reducing poverty in two areas: (i) it will reduce heating costs in winter, and (ii) it will improve the quality of the indoor air through reducing the use of coal inside the houses and therefore improve the health of poor families.
The Danish support primarily goes towards the installation of solar water heaters in the low income housing as well as disseminating lessons learned.</narrative>
