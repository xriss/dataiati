   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Strategic Sector Cooperation on Education between DK and Vietnam, Phase II 

The Strategic Sector Cooperation on Education is a peer-to-peer cooperation between between the Danish Ministry of Education and the Vietnamese Ministry of Labour, Invalids and Social Affairs. The main objective of the Strategic Sector Cooperation is to strengthen the relevance, quality, and responsiveness of vocational education in Vietnam. More than one million young people enter the Vietnamese labour market annually. The vocational education system is key to their personal success and to ensuring the productivity gains needed to sustain Vietnam&#x2019;s economic growth. Denmark has a long tradition of quality vocational education developed through systematized dialogue between colleges and private and public enterprises. The dual system of Denmark also increases capacity by shifting a significant part of the education to enterprises. This cooperation addresses gaps between the actual skills and competences of vocational education graduates and the skills and competences required by industries operating in Vietnam. Developing the right skills for Vietnam&#x2019;s increasingly internationally competitive industries remains a high priority for the Government of Vietnam, and steps have been taken to implement a vocational system where students alternate between school and company &#x2013; the so-called dual-system. Vietnam targeted providing technical vocational training to 2.2 million people in 2018, through more than 1,900 vocational training establishments.

Phase II will focus on three sectors in 12 of these colleges: Graphic design and furniture where Danish companies in Vietnam export to all parts of the world, and food (new) relevant for public health in Vietnam and already supported by another SSC project aiming to improve food safety.</narrative>
