   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The action provides safe, dignified and sustainable housing solutions for displaced Afghans, as well as
promote socio-economic integration and access to essential services, in the provinces of Herat and Balkh in
Afghanistan, and in Khorasan Razavi and Kerman province in Iran. This is primarily achieved through shelter
and community centre construction supported by WASH and ICLA interventions, such as legal counselling
and wash upgrades for each household. It will also address socio-economic (re)integration and urban
regeneration by improving displaced Afghans and Afghan refugees&#x2019; access to livelihood opportunities. In
addition, enhancement of educational spaces in Iran will be coupled with socio-economic integration efforts.
Lastly, the action will also improve Afghans&#x2019; access to services and information through a community-based
response by ensuring that displacement-affected communities are protected and able to access life-saving
assistance and durable solutions for their recovery.</narrative>
