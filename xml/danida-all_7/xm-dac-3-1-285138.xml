  <description type="1" xml:lang="EN">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Taveta Banana Project will roll out interventions geared towards enhancing the competitiveness of the banana value chain and improving market access for the targeted farmers. It will deliver a socially and environmentally responsible fruit pulp processing factory that is economically viable. Aggregation centers and a 300-acre organic farm will be set up to ensure a consistent banana supply while also developing the capacity of 2,000 smallholder farmers. MESPT, in partnership with Orana and Wanda Agriculture Group Limited lead the project which will contribute to increased and sustainable incomes and decent jobs within the banana sub-sector in Taita Taveta County, with an emphasis on women and youth. This will by extension contribute to poverty alleviation. Production capacities of smallholder farmers and service providers will be developed, and vertical and horizontal linkages facilitated, thereby sustainably creating value and business efficiencies.
The Danida Market Development Partnerships programme (DMDP) is designed to support commercially oriented partnerships for sustainable market development in developing countries. In addition to reporting on individually determined outputs and outcomes, all DMDP projects report on five key programme indicators. These five indicators are the same for the whole project portfolio, enabling strategic and programme level monitoring, and aggregation of results.
At the programme level, three key outcomes which are related to three of the five key programme indicators, have been chosen for results reporting: Outcome 1: Increased employment (decent jobs) for women, men and youth. Outcome 2: Increased income opportunities from improved market linkages. Outcome 3: Additional capital raised (investment leverage).</narrative>
