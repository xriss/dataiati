   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Syria OCHA Operation in Turkey 
An estimated 2.8 million people in the northwest required humanitarian assistance in 2020. Renewed military escalations displaced almost a million people in the area in late 2019 and early 2020. Despite a March ceasefire agreement, hostilities continued to claim civilian lives throughout the year, while explosive hazards and clashes between armed groups heightened the security challenges facing civilians, including humanitarian workers. OCHA continued to coordinate the cross-bor der response into north-west Syria from Turkey. With different parts of Syria controlled by various parties to the conflict, the United Nations cross-border response was authorized to deliver aid to people in need by Security Council resolution 2165 (2014) and subsequent resolutions. 

Due to its nature as a response to a humanitarian appeal operational results are general and highly aggregated and the MFA contribution is thus reflected in the overall results reporting by the partner.  Please refer to the hyperlink below.
