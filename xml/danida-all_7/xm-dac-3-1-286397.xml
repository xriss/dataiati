   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed project seeks to show that interventions over longer periods of time are needed to ensure that children and youth are empowered, have access to platforms and are able to engage with their peers, duty bearers and relevant stakeholders in the promotion and protection of human rights. This is in line with the &#x201C;Declaration on the Right and Responsibility of Individuals, Groups and Organs of Society to Promote and Protect Universally Recognized Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms&#x201D; &#x2013; frequently abbreviated to &#x201C;The Declaration on human rights defenders&#x201D;. The project will seek to engage SCSA&#x2019;s current and Alumni children&#x2019;s networks to address knowledge gaps relating to the Constitution (Chapter 2), Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), United Nations Convention on the Right of the Child (UNCRC) and the African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child (ACRWC) amongst their peers. This will ensure that children  can claim their rights and also exercise their right to defend human rights. They will not only be enabled but also empowered to do so. 

Through education and capacitation of advocacy tools, a generation of children in areas of South Africa will claim their rights and also exercise their right to defend human rights. They will not only be enabled but also empowered to do so. They will also enjoy their rights without encountering hindrances of them and without unnecessary or unjust restrictions.  The project has the overall objective that children make submissions to human rights institutions to claim their child (human) rights.</narrative>
