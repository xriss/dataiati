   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In 2020-2022, Denmark supports WFP with DKK 210 million annually, subject to annual Parliamentary approval. The total amount of support for 2020-2022 amounts to DKK 630 million. Annually, DKK 203 million constitutes a non-earmarked multilateral contribution; DKK 7 million is Human Resource Support, providing stand-by  advisers to WFP;  and DKK 3 million annually is provided for Danish Junior Professional Officers.

WFP is UN&apos;s largest humanitarian organization. Its mission is to save lives and end hunger. In 2020, WFP distributed food to 114 million people and operated in 88 countries. WFP provided food assistance to 18 level 3 and level 2 crisis in 2020, which makes up 2/3 of WFP&#x2019;s operational interventions.

WFP also works with forecast-based early action, relying on weather and other forecasts to trigger funding for predetermined action ahead of shock before it turns into disaster.

Cash-based transfers make up 37% of WFP&#x2019;s food assistance, which makes it the humanitarian organization providing most cash-based support. In 2020, WFP received 8.4 billion USD in voluntary contributions from donors. The flexible and predictable funding provided by the Nordic donor countries, is valued by WFP as it strengthens WFP&#x2019;s ability to initiate operations in acute crisis. Denmark is the 17th biggest donor to WFP and the sixth bi</narrative>
