   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The overall objective of the program is to improve employment opportunities for the disadvantaged section of the population in South Africa. This purpose has for many years been supported though financial assistance for a reform of the academic instititions, the so called FET colleges. The program aims to meet the need for skilled labor in the industry, especially in small and medium-sized enterprises. Under Phase I and II, the program has focused on supporting the merging of the country&#xBF;s technical schools into 50 big education centers. In the third phase, the focus has been on supporting the structure and building of student counseling services, including the establishment of contact to the labor market to ensure internships and jobs for the students.

The project has at national level been working with the Ministry of Education and has locally supported the reform process in some of South Africa&apos;s poorest provinces: KwaZulu- Natal, Western Cape and North West. During the third phase, Eastern Cape has also been included in the project.</narrative>
