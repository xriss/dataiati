   <narrative xml:lang="EN">To build the awareness and skills of staff, so the institutions is better positioned to build client demand and finance country-level action to address Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR).

Building an AMR lens into World Bank analytical and operational work requires an enabling environment. This is created by raising awareness, developing skillsets and changing mind-sets among key stakeholders, both externally on the demand side with clients, and internally including WB staff and WB management, especially at the country level. The project sets out to build this enabling environment through 1) Establishing a set of core AMR sensitive intervention areas, 2) Develop tools, training and materials to support Bank staff and management in accelerating policy dialogue in the core AMR sensitive intervention areas, 3) Continued presence in international forums to build client demand and awareness and 4) Deep engagement in selected countries to build demand and capitalize on opportunities.</narrative>
