   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Denmark&#x2019;s voluntary contributions to WHO are made within the framework of Danish Organisation Strategy for World Health Organisation (WHO) 2020-2023. 
The overall objective of Denmark&#x2019;s support is to contribute to the achievement of the health related United Nations&#x2019; Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), in particular SDG 1 (no poverty), 3 (good health and well-being), 5 (gender equality), 10 reduced inequalities, and 17 (partnership for the goals).
Three priority areas have been chosen based on the WHO Programme of Work:
1. Health system strengthening to achieve universal health coverage.
Increased health security preparedness and coverage of essential health services and lower level of people suffering financial hardship (defined as out-of-pocket spending exceeding ability to pay) in accessing health services.
2. Human rights and gender equality including sexual and reproductive health and rights. 
Effective human rights and gender mainstreaming, reduced global maternal mortality and increased proportion of women who make their own informed decisions regarding sexual and reproductive health care, and have their need for family planning satisfied with modern methods.
3. A more effective and efficient WHO. 
Financial, human and administrative resources managed in an efficient, effective, results-oriented and transparent manner. Alignment with SDG and UN reform.</narrative>
