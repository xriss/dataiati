   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Starting from February 2021, NIRAS will be in charge of administrating seconded to the OSCE&#x2019;s SMM mission in Ukraine. The purpose of this is to professionalize the administration of seconded and to ensure that the procedure is similar to seconded  FSB, following MFA&#x2019;s policies on postings to countries with security and health difficulties.

EUN has set a target figure for 10 seconded to OSCE&#x2019;s SMM mission, of which three are managerial level positions. The selection of a Dane seconded as a team leader (in the field) or centrally placed at the head quarter in Kiev is a priority. 

Key results  
To contribute to the OSCE&#x2019;s monitoring of the parties to the Minsk-agreement to observe the ceasefire and pull-out of weaponry. 

Justification for support:
The Danish contribution to the SMM-mission is a part of Denmark&#x2019;s membership of the OSCE and the decision made by the 57 OSCE-member states to prolong the SMM-mandate with one year. 

The role of the OSCE in Ukraine is twofold: Firstly, the OSCE-leadership&#x2019;s special representative is sitting at the top of the table in the Trilateral Contact Group, continually negotiating the implementation of the Minsk-agreement. Secondly, the observers from the OSCE&#x2019;s Special Monitoring Mission (SMM) monitors the parties&#x2019; implementation of the Minsk-agreement on the ground in relation to the ceasefire and pull-out of weaponry.
