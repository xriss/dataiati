   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The overall objective of the grant is to strengthen the training capacities of the Tunisian border
agencies. The specific objectives are to:
1. Provide a targeted and sustainable response to initial and continuous training needs specific to border areas in desertic conditions;
2. Optimize training resources of border agencies (human, material, financial, among others);
3. Strengthen and support interaction and cooperation between agencies at borders.

In order to achieve the objectives of the development cooperation, the project will be implemented through two main components:
Component 1: Construction of an Inter-Agency Training Centre on Border Management in Nefta and Purchase of Equipment
Component 2: Development of a comprehensive border management training curriculum</narrative>
