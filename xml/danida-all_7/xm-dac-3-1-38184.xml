  <description type="2" xml:lang="EN">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The International HIV/AIDS Alliance is a global alliance of nationally-based, independent civil society organisations with the objective of securing the human rights of all people affected by HIV/AIDS in low and middle income countries, with a particular emphasis on vulnerable and marginalised population groups. It is particularly concerned with the access to health services of groups exposed to stigmatisation and discrimination, such as commercial sex workers, men having sex with men etc. 

The Alliance was set up in 1993 to support communities in developing countries to play an active role in the global response to AIDS. It works through a network of over 35 so called `linking organisations&#xBF; in the South. The overall objective of the organisation is to stop the spread of HIV and to end AIDS. It is pursued through actions to promote health and human rights via direct engagement with and through local communities.

Denmark has supported the Alliance since 1999. The latest core contribution covers 2014-2015 and supports implementation of IHAA&apos;s strategy &apos;HIV, Health and Rights - sustaining community action&apos;. In addition, the Alliance receives a project contribution specifically towards improving access to information and health services for men who have sex with men in four African countries. 

The Danish support aims to reduce the spread of HIV and mitigate the effects of HIV, particularly for the most vulnerable and marginalized population groups. This is done by strengthening civil society capacity to participate meaningfully in all aspects of the HIV/AIDS response, including influencing national and international policies relating to HIV/AIDS and health.</narrative>
