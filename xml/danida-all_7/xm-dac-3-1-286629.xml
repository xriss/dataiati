  <description type="2" xml:lang="EN">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The objective of the programme is twofold: 
1.	In response to the effects of climate change, secure the water sources for the cities of Kayes, Sikasso and Koutiala 
2.	Improve access to drinking water in the fast-growing urban areas of Kayes, Sikasso and Koutiala including that of the poorer segments of the population in new neighbourhoods, health centres and schools and thus enhancing health and hygiene conditions. 
Two projects will be implemented to achieve the programme objectives:
1.	Securement of drinking water in the towns of Sikasso and Koutiala (Denmark) 
2.	Urban water supply and sanitation project in Kayes Town and neighbouring communes (Delegated cooperation to KFW)  
The programme has the following outcomes: 
1.	Health conditions and resilience of the urban population in Sikasso and Koutiala have improved through better access to clean water, adaptation of public service delivery to climate change, and prevention of conflicts related to access to water.
2.	A more efficient and effective use of scarce water resources has been obtained by strengthening water production and distribution, service levels have improved, and better financial viability of the operator has been achieved.
3.	Access to water supply (and liquid sanitation) services has been improved for the population in the town of Kayes and neighbouring communes.</narrative>
