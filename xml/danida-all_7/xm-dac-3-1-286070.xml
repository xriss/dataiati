   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The funds represent part of the Danish commitment made by the Minister for Development Cooperation during the Brussels Conference on 30 June 2020 to provide a total of DKK 361 million for humanitarian efforts in and around Syria in 2020. As part of the total commitment, DKK 130 million was allocated for the humanitarian efforts of Danish civil society organizations (through an &quot;NGO round&quot;). This is the ninth round of NGOs since the crisis in Syria broke out.

Mission East&apos;s project proposal was found to represent a good balance between emergency food aid and long-term efforts with a well-founded focus on vulnerable groups in Syria as well as Syrian refugees and host communities in Lebanon. The project proposal was deemed well-argued and analytically solid with regard to the criteria and methods for selecting the target group.
