   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Danida&#x2019;s own information aims at raising awareness and understanding the situation in developing countries and the importance of Danish participation in international development cooperation. The framework for communication is the SDGs and overarching political priorities, including the development and humanitarian strategy &#x201C;World 2030&#x201D;. This appropriation supports, among other things, major thematic actions and campaign activities undertaken in the field of development policy, as well as communication activities supporting the work of the specialised offices and the efforts to strengthen interest in and commitment to development cooperation. The aim is to ensure that Danida&#x2019;s partnerships are also used in thematic actions and in digital communication, so that interlocutors help spread messages and reach new audiences. Communication will be mainly digital and Danida&#x2019;s presence on social media is expected to be strengthened in 2020.</narrative>
