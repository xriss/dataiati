   <narrative xml:lang="EN">DETI will respond to a preceding demand from Danish embassies and a range of state authorities in developing countries where DEA is currently not engaged, enquiring short-term technical assistance. The DETI model functions as a catalyst for partnerships between equals. The aim is to increase capacity of the partner institutions and foster low-carbon policies and political decision-making. The model facilitates a government-to-government (G2G) modality of cooperation with peer-to-peer exchange of knowledge and experience, possibly at both policy and technical level</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The DETI engagements will target concrete capacity-building interventions in partner countries to nurture cost-effective implementation of the partner country&#x2019;s Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) and/or preparing measures and frameworks that fosters ambitious and achievable targets for upcoming updates of the NDCs (next time in 2025). 

The Danish Energy Agency&#x2019;s (DEA) core competencies on energy transition are the thematic focus areas of the existing DEA energy partnerships, where a comparative advantage over most other leading energy authorities persists. These areas are:
1.	Long-term energy modelling and planning; 
2.	Enhanced framework conditions for renewable energy; 
3.	Integration of renewable energy and flexibility of the power sector;
4.	Energy efficiency, including district heating.</narrative>
