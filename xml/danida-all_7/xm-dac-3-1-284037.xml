   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Over 900,000 Rohingya refugees are now staying at Cox&#x2019;s Bazar in Bangladesh under miserable conditions. Cox&#x2019;s Bazar was already one of Bangladesh&#x2019;s most marginalized and vulnerable areas, and the large influx of refugees has put the host communities under further pressure. The refugee camps in Cox&apos;s Bazar are extremely densely populated, and the need for humanitarian assistance in the form of e.g. food, better housing conditions, emergency supplies, water, sanitation, health and education are great. In addition, there is a great need for psychosocial support and protection efforts, especially for women and children. In the camps in Cox&apos;s Bazar, there is also a high risk of gender-based violence. The UN&apos;s overall humanitarian response plan is 920.5 million. USD and is estimated to help 1.2 million. people - both Rohingya refugees and the most vulnerable from the local host community. UNHCR plays a leading role in terms of general coordination of humanitarian efforts as well as concrete services within e.g. protection, rehousing, provision of psychosocial support and prevention of gender-based violence, etc. and in terms of promoting long-term solutions.
