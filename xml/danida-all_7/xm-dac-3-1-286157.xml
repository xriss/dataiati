   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The overall objective of the DE is &quot;to increase the number of Kenyan youth who are gainfully employed or self-employed through a replicable, self-sustainable job and skills development model&quot;.

The Development Engagement presents an innovative approach to key Danida priority issues relation to job creation and skills development by focusing on: a) stimulation of demand (jobs), b) enrichment of supply (skills), and c) a foundation of guidance from a range of public and private sector actors to help young Kenyans navigate the world of work. The DE includes a sustainable model for youth employment/self-employment through the provision of career counselling and various life skills reinforced by an integrated digital blended learning platform and supported by labour market specific, public and private sector initiatives to help youth become more employable through the attainment of relevant skills. The objective of the DE will be achieved through three outcomes: 

1) Skills development through improved outlook and motivation of 4,000 youth participants on prospects for the future and becoming self-sufficient, responsible members of society.
2) Job creation through improved quality and relevance of TVET opportunities for 2,500 youth participants.
3) Successful youth-led businesses, creating employment for 1,500 youth participants.</narrative>
