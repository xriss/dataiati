   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This allocation of 25 million DKK to the United Nations Children&apos;s Fund (UNICEF) contributes to meeting the objectives of the Ukraine Flash Appeal  for 2022, which points to 18 million people in need of assistance and calls for 1,1 billion USD for 3 months (March-May) in response to the escalated humanitarian crisis UNICEF is now scaling-up its humanitarian operation and hence seeking 66.4 million USD to provide access to basic services including water and sanitation, immunization and health care, schooling and learning, psychosocial support, and emergency cash assistance for up to 7.5 million children.

This allocation contributes to meeting the objectives of UNICEF&#x2019;s response in Ukraine and hence seeking 66.4 million USD to provide access to basic services including water and sanitation, immunization and health care, schooling and learning, psychosocial support, and emergency cash assistance for up to 7.5 million children.

Due to its nature as a response to a humanitarian appeal operational results are general and highly aggregated and the MFA contribution is thus reflected in the overall results reporting by the partner.  Please refer to the hyperlink below.
