   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Irregular migration from Pakistan is a persistent phenomenon, with each year approximately 30,000 Pakistanis attempting to cross Pakistan&#x2019;s own borders through irregular channels, especially via the porous border with Iran . Consequently, repatriation has also remained high with over half a million Pakistanis being sent back to their home country in the past 6 years, with the highest numbers from Gulf Countries and Turkey . 

The Government of Pakistan, especially its Ministry of Interior and Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) has taken various initiatives to curb irregular migration, such as the two new legislations on Trafficking in Persons (TIP) and Smuggling of Migrants (SOM), known as &#x201C;Prevention of Trafficking in Persons Act, 2018&#x201D;  and &#x201C;Prevention of Smuggling of Migrants Act, 2018&#x201D;  and the FIA&#x2019;s National Action Plan to Combat TIP and SOM (2021-25). However, due to challenges of limited technical capacities and resource constraints, the process of implementation of these initiatives is slow, requiring extensive support from various partners for a more coordinated and efficient response. The COVID-19 pandemic has also increased challenges for the Government of Pakistan with regards to managing migration and borders. With the pandemic&#x2019;s adverse impact on socio-economic conditions, such as reduction in employment opportunities, loss of health coverage, higher incidence of poverty and increased negative perceptions about migrants due to the pandemic, irregular migration is on the rise and requires strengthened measures relating to prevention, protection and prosecution.

Keeping in view the above, the proposed project aligns its outcomes with the priorities of the Government of Pakistan to strengthen measures to combat TIP and SOM. Furthermore, IOM will build on its previous and ongoing initiatives as well as fill in key capacity building gaps in light of the additional challenges posed by COVID-19 pandemic, learning from best practices from IOM missions acr</narrative>
