   <narrative xml:lang="EN">As a result of the Russian invasion in Ukraine, more than six million people are currently internally displaced in Ukraine. Due to severe shortage of food and other basic needs goods in relevant warehouse facilities in Poland, Denmark will utilize its unique opportunity &#x2013; via the Humanitarian Contact Forum &#x2013; to facilitate and procure relevant goods being shipped to these currently empty warehouses.

The objective is stated as Prevention of food insecurity and lack of basic needs goods by the more than six million internally displaced people in Ukraine as a result of the Russian invasion.

Due to its nature as a response to a humanitarian appeal operational results are general and highly aggregated and the MFA contribution is thus reflected in the overall results reporting by the partner.</narrative>
