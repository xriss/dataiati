   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Overview
This project proposal is expressly for the two year &#x2018;start-up phase&#x2019; of the CIP. The initial start-up phase, particularly the first 6 months (Q2 and Q3 2020), will be oriented around learning-by-doing, real-time adjustments, and making informed recommendations on rapidly and effectively taking CIP to scale. The first six-month period is considered as an inception phase where there should be room for adjustments and modifications in the set up and will include monthly calls with the Government of Denmark. The &#x2018;start-up phase&#x2019; will then be followed by the full scale-up of the CIP where multiple donors should collaborate to fund the CIP strategic targets.
The project objective is to pilot CIP&#x2019;s country-level support, network outreach and management systems, with the aim to establish the CIP&#x2019;s initial credibility and added value, and to inform the design of the scale-up phase of the CIP. In order to achieve this goal, the CIP will initially build on existing systems, programmatic activities, and capabilities of the announcing partners in order to move quickly and efficiently.

The project activities are organized around three workstreams:
 Workstream #1: Country-level activities. The CIP&#x2019;s start-up phase will prioritize on-the-ground activities,
aiming to achieve early results and impact with in-depth, quality support. The CIP&#x2019;s clients are developing
countries and the private sector. An origination strategy will be developed and operationalized. Support
on country-level activities will include but will not be limited to: country scoping missions; convening
country-level partnership discussions with MDBs and others; preparing investment roadmaps and plans;
funding concept review and strengthening.
 Workstream #2: Outreach and building the CIP Network. Capitalizing on the high-level support and
visibility of the CIP deriving from its launch at the 2019 UNSG&#x2019;s Climate Summit, the project will ensure
continued outreach activities to enhance the CIP&#x2019;s</narrative>
