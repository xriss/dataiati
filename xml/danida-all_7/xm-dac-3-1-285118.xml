   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Small holder farming in Kenya continue to be negatively impacted by unpredictable weather patterns and lack of appropriate financing to stimulate sustainable agricultural commercialisation. DanChurchAid and commercial partner Ingemann &#x2013; together with Juhudi Kilimo and Momentum Trust &#x2013; seek to ensure smallholder farmers have increased incomes through climate resilient livelihoods and increased financial inclusion. The Agri-Tech Project aims to improve economic productivity through i) the provision of affordable and user-friendly digital climate smart agro-extension advisory services (BioClimatica) that will contribute to higher yields and productivity, and ii) enhancing climate adjusted credit risk scoring by financial service providers to avail tailor made financial offers and products for smallholder farmers. In addition, this project will strengthen farmer organisations to enhance collective action including access to competitive markets as we as agro-inputs. Ultimately, this project will seek to demonstrate a strong responsible and commercially viable business case for smallholder farmers, off-takers, financial service providers and providers of Agri-tech solutions which can be up-scaled to other African countries.
The Danida Market Development Partnerships programme (DMDP) is designed to support commercially oriented partnerships for sustainable market development in developing countries. In addition to reporting on individually determined outputs and outcomes, all DMDP projects report on five key programme indicators. These five indicators are the same for the whole project portfolio, enabling strategic and programme level monitoring, and aggregation of results.
At the programme level, three key outcomes which are related to three of the five key programme indicators, have been chosen for results reporting: Outcome 1: Increased employment (decent jobs) for women, men and youth. Outcome 2: Increased income opportunities from improved market linkages. Outcome 3:</narrative>
