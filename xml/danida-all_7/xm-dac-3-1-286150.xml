   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The overall objective of the engagement is to contribute to building low-carbon, inclusive, climate resilient societies based on models of transformative and inclusive green growth &#x2013; with a special focus on Danish SDG7 leadership through inclusive green transformation in Africa and strategically important Danish climate front-post countries where Denmark engages in green strategic partnerships.

Denmark&#x2019;s financial contribution totals DKK 80 million, split between core funding for GGGI&#x2019;s Strategy 2030 and earmarked funding for GGGI programmed pilot activities, not least in Africa. The support will overall target inclusive, green transition, especially through renewable energy, and will integrate concerns for innovation, gender, livelihoods and jobs as well as covid-19 green recovery at country level. In addition, Denmark will engage actively with GGGI at country- and central level, in particular on the Danish priority issues and GGGI&#x2019;s overall programme effectiveness.


The Danish contribution to GGGI is monitored on the basis of GGGI&apos;s own performance reporting. The latest report can be found at the following link: https://gggi.org/report/gggi-annual-report-2020.</narrative>
