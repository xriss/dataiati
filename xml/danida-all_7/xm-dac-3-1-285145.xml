   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Tourism is one of the strongest drivers of world trade and prosperity and contributes to 10% of global GDP. Its capacity to generate jobs, increase exports, and adopt new technologies makes it an important pillar for economic growth. However, according to UNEP, of each 100 USD spent on a vacation tour by a tourist from a developed country, only around 5 USD stays in a developing destination&#x2019;s economy. The purpose of the project is to tackle this problem of the unequal distribution and leakage of tourism income by creating income opportunities for youth and women in Kenya through platform economy in tourism. Furthermore, the project works to open new and increased income streams for our commercial partner, I Like Local, by leveraging ActionAid&#x2019;s wide network of local community organisations, thereby increasing I Like Local&#x2019;s social impact and, by extension, strengthening diversified and sustainable income flows to the local communities involved.
The Danida Market Development Partnerships programme (DMDP) is designed to support commercially oriented partnerships for sustainable market development in developing countries. In addition to reporting on individually determined outputs and outcomes, all DMDP projects report on five key programme indicators. These five indicators are the same for the whole project portfolio, enabling strategic and programme level monitoring, and aggregation of results.
At the programme level, three key outcomes which are related to three of the five key programme indicators, have been chosen for results reporting: Outcome 1: Increased employment (decent jobs) for women, men and youth. Outcome 2: Increased income opportunities from improved market linkages. Outcome 3: Additional capital raised (investment leverage).</narrative>
