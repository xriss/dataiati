   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Indonesian government views the dairy industry as a driver for improvements of the welfare of the large number of low income and small holder farmers, primarily organised in cooperatives. Indonesia is experiencing an increasing consumer demand for organic dairy products, yet there is currently no local organic dairy production. Landbrug &amp; F&#xF8;devarer F.m.b.A./SEGES and key commercial partner, Arla, in partnership with Bina Swadaya, seek to pilot a market driven and sustainable organic dairy production, whilst increasing milk productivity and the economic output of the dairy value chain in Indonesia. The interventions are designed to increase the number of decent jobs all along the dairy value chain, and increase revenues at farm, dairy, sale and distribution levels. Farmers converting to organic milk production, will be linked to commercially viable and &#x201C;green&#x201D; dairy value chain, increasing their net income post Covid-19.
The Danida Market Development Partnerships programme (DMDP) is designed to support commercially oriented partnerships for sustainable market development in developing countries. In addition to reporting on individually determined outputs and outcomes, all DMDP projects report on five key programme indicators. These five indicators are the same for the whole project portfolio, enabling strategic and programme level monitoring, and aggregation of results.
At the programme level, three key outcomes which are related to three of the five key programme indicators, have been chosen for results reporting: Outcome 1: Increased employment (decent jobs) for women, men and youth. Outcome 2: Increased income opportunities from improved market linkages. Outcome 3: Additional capital raised (investment leverage).</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The objective will contribute directly to: 1. SDG 8 through increased revenues at farm, dairy and supplier level, as well as creation of better jobs on farms, in cooperatives, in dairies and in support functions, such as milk collection, sales and distribution. 2. SDG 2 through increased productivity in the dairy value chain and sustainable dairy practices that are more resilient to climate fluctuations, will contribute to self-sufficiency within dairy production and promote better nutrition and local food security. 3. SDG 17 through the North-South/private-public-NGO cooperation, which represents a cross-sectorial and cross-geographical partnership to promote long term business relationships, innovation and knowledge-sharing for the benefit of the dairy sector development in Indonesia.</narrative>
