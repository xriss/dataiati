   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The &#x2018;More with Less in the Philippine Coconut Industry&#x2019; project by ICCO, Lionheart and PCA will
contribute to SDG8 by stimulating higher levels of economic activity in the coconut sector
through technological upgrading and innovation, and by focusing on safe and labor intensive
production of high-value added products from coconut sap. By introducing planting materials of
superior variety, coupled with environmental friendly Good Agricultural Practices, yield will
increase. Introducing innovative technologies in sap tapping will make the task less difficult,
thereby increasing productivity and generating jobs. These twin interventions result in increased
income for farmers and farm workers, and therefore contribute to poverty alleviation. For the
commercial partner Lionheart this would mean more raw materials for its processing plant
resulting in a 30% increase in the company&#x2019;s income. The Danida Market Development Partnerships programme (DMDP) is designed to support commercially oriented partnerships for sustainable market development in developing countries. In addition to reporting on individually determined outputs and outcomes, all DMDP projects report on five key programme indicators. These five indicators are the same for the whole project portfolio, enabling strategic and programme level monitoring, and aggregation of results. At the programme level, three key outcomes which are related to three of the five key programme indicators, have been chosen for results reporting: Outcome 1: Increased employment (decent jobs) for women, men and youth. Outcome 2: Increased income opportunities from improved market linkages. Outcome 3: Additional capital raised (investment leverage).</narrative>
