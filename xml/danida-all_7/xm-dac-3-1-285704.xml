   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Strategic Sector Cooperation on Food is a peer-to-peer cooperation between Danish Veterinary and Food Administration and the Vietnamese Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development. Through the project, the Vietnamese Ministry  will improve feed and food safety in the Vietnamese pork value chain.

A Strategic Sector Cooperation (SSC) is a partnership aiming at improving sector framework conditions in a partner country. The initiative is a flexible and adaptive instrument for exchanging experienc-es, learning and capacity building, which builds on a consolidated strong relationship and trust between the involved authorities. The commitment to finance the Danish authorities&#x2019; participation is sequenced in phas-es; an inception phase of approximately one year resulting in a project document; followed by phase one, two and &#x2013;if need be &#x2013; a phase three during which the cooperation is deepened and developed. All SSC part-nerships are supported by a sector advisor at the embassy, who impel progress and stir the partnership in the direction agreed upon.

Annually, the SSC projects deliver a report on project progress and results achieved. Progress on selected outputs are displayed in openaid.</narrative>

Score from 1-5, 1 lowest and 5 highest.

The planned output targets in the project have been met in 2019.

The project has had substantial and direct influence on the development of the legal
framework for feed management and veterinary drug management in Vietnam. In 2019, the SSC-partners worked closely together on the development of legislation to implement the feed management chapter in the 2018 Animal Husbandry Law. In addition, the SSC partners cooperated on the further development of the Circular on Prescription of veterinary medicine, and preparations were made for an impact analysis of the planned legislative changes to map the expected impact of the new law on public and private stakeholders.</narrative>
