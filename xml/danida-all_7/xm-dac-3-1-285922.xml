   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The minister for development cooperation has decided to commission a taskforce to explore issues, opportunities and challenges in job creation and skills development for youth in Africa. The purpose of the taskforce is to engage main Danish partners in a process to map and zoom in on the main challenges to job creation and skills development of youth in Africa and learn from the taskforce member&#x2019;s experience in Denmark as well as developing countries. The outcome will be a report outlining selected main challenges to job creation and skills de-velopment for youth in Africa (referred to as white book/challenge catalogue). The paper will feed in to the further work on this agenda as key development political priority, including through development of pioneer projects to promote skills development of youth in selected African countries. The launch of the white book will take place in September 2020.

 The current consultancy contract shall support the MFA in the process of conducting a task-force process and writing up the white book/challenge catalogue of the taskforce. The con-sultant shall also provide technical input and evidence base on skills development in develop-ing countries to the work of the taskforce.</narrative>
