   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The overall goal of the Think Big Start Small project proposal is to equip school students and their teachers with practical skills and ideas to develop STEMI-related solutions for sustainable climate futures. The secondary goals are to:
- Meaningfully engage teachers and school students on the meaning and intentions of the climate-oriented SDGs; 
- Develop and hone technical and practical skills in climate problem-solving using robotics and chip technology; 
- Facilitate digital learning and skill development aligned with the future of work; and 
- Deliver prize challenges, award ceremonies, as well as feature the developed climate solutions.

The work will be implemented by UNDP in South Africa, with its partners, namely a company called XinaBox (Danish innovated), through its South African company, FEMSTEM (Pty) Ltd. UNDP will also collaborate with Sci-Bono Discovery Centre, a Johannesburg-based science centre and NGO; and with UNICEF.</narrative>
