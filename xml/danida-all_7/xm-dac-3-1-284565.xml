   <narrative xml:lang="EN">OMCT is a Geneva based NGO working with the promotion and protection of human rights in two key areas which coincides with Danish priorities: the fight against torture and protection of human rights defenders. 
The Danish grant is a core contribution in support of the activities and programmatic goals of the organisation as outlined in the OMCT&#x2019;s Strategic Plan 2017-2020, &#x201C;Strengthening the Global Movement Against Torture: OMCT Core and Regional Engagement&#x201D;, in particular relating to the local, regional, and international developments in the global fight against torture, and in the promotion, protection, and defence of human rights defenders around the world. The project covers all five complementary priorities of the OMCT Strategy 2020, implemented with the SOS-Torture Network and other anti-torture actors and initiatives: 1) Compliance, 2) Accountability, 3) Protection; 4) Network excellence, and 5) Protection of Human Rights Defenders.
The key objective is to advance toward the eradication of torture worldwide, by strengthening the growth, sustainability, cooperation, and impact of the global civil society anti-torture movement.</narrative>
