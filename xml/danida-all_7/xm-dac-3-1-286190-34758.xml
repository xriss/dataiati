     <actual value="Due to the stagnant political situation in Myanmar, the issue of accountability went only as far as
highlighting the need for accountability and justice in the attempt to find a solution and move on,
rather than the substantive integration. The actual contribution to the outcomes were made more at
the level of ensuring that legal and accountability related aspects are sufficiently and accurately
integrated into the Special Envoy&#x2019;s engagement with stakeholders and also strengthened
cooperation between other mandated UN mechanisms by way of sharing contacts, and initiating
the idea of Myanmar Witness project."></actual>

     <actual value="It was the most challenging of all in the course of 2021, as hardening positions by conflicting parties left little room for the Special Envoy to take up her mediation role. This was also compounded by the fact that her departure from the position was announced in February 2021,
which meant that she was  bounded by her own timeline. Her mediation role was also challenged by differing views within the Security Council and there was no consensus among the SC members on what they considered the way out. Despite the challenges, the Special Envoy has taken
advantages of her social and political capitals she had acquired prior to the coup with the
Tatmadaw leadership and other democratic and conflicting actors and kept their faith in the role of
the Special Envoy as potential mediators to prepare grounds for mediation."></actual>

Rohingya inclusion as a part of political discussions to find sustainable solutions for Myanmar.
These assessments were appreciated especially in New York as her exposure to the Security
Council and to the PRs has significantly increased post-coup.
Meanwhile, community-level initiatives which the Special Envoy supported prior to and post coup
indicated her continued support have provided them with much needed moral support and the
sense of confidence in the direction they are going."></actual>
