Investigations (IICI) which provided a training on core investigation skills to 33 UNITAD staff. In
addition, a training in intelligence analysis and communications data analysis was provided by a
leading intelligence analysis training provider, for 16 UNITAD staff members. Lastly, a three-day training was provided by Arctic Wind (AW) to 5 members of Al Karkh Criminal Court which is one of the leading counter-terrorism courts working on ISIL prosecutions in Iraq. Both trainings received very positive evaluation from the participants due to the direct application of the
learning outcomes in the trainees&#x2019; daily tasks. They represent a legacy product of the project and
allowed to successfully attain Output 2.1 and will therefore contribute to outcome-level change within Outcome 2 moving forward
