  <description type="2" xml:lang="EN">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">URG will elaborate guiding principles for the establishment and development of NMIRFs, conduct pilot projects in two developing countries to establish or strengthen NMIRFs, identify good practices with the national implementation of human rights recommendations and measure the impact on children&#x2019;s and women&#x2019;s rights in 10 developing countries, and conduct two capacity-building workshops for environmental human rights defenders in Africa and South-East Asia. URG will partner with OHCHR, UNFPA, UNICEF and UNEP.
The key objective of the project is to promote the translation of international human rights obligations and commitments into improved national laws, policies and practices in developing countries. This will in turn help strengthen progress towards the achievement of the SDGs &#x2018;leaving no one behind,&#x2019; the strengthening of democracy and rule of law, and the prevention of human rights crises and conflict.</narrative>
