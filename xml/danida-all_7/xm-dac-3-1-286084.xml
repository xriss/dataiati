   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Beyond the Grid Fund for Africa (BGFA) aims to incentivise the private off-grid energy service providers to expand energy services to underserved people in rural and peri-urban areas in Uganda. This will achieved by offering financial incentives through public tenders to select Energy Service Providers that can expand energy services to households outside the grid. The Danish support to BGFA will support the Uganda window and be targeted provision of access to primarily off-grid solar home systems. The funding window in Uganda aims to contribute to connecting up to 3 million with basic off-grid renewable energy. 

BGFA was set up as a financing facility in 2019 and is managed by the Nordic Environment Finance Corporation (NEFCO). It is designed to contribute to the global effort of accelerating access to affordable energy access at scale, to the almost 550 million people living without access to electricity today in Sub-Saharan Africa. BGFA particularly supports the objective of Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG7), which aims to ensure universal access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, modern energy for all by 2030, the Paris Agreement on climate change and Uganda&#x2019;s country priorities.

First disbursement took place only on 18 December 2020; thus first reporting will first be included in 2021 annual report. Brief progress on BGFA can be found in this link to the 2020 annual report of NEFCO:
