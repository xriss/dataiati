   <narrative xml:lang="EN">10 mio. DKK for UNFPA&apos;s humanitarian efforts in Ethiopia: UNFPA has the coordinating UN responsibility for sexual and reproductive health services and the fight against SGBV and FGM. In the light of the extensive humanitarian challenges throughout Ethiopia, UNFPA works in an integrated manner to promote life-saving sexual and reproductive services and to prevent and address gender-based violence in both humanitarian and development programs. The Ethiopian Humanitarian Response Plan estimates a need to reach 4.6 million people with health services, including life-saving sexual and reproductive services. In addition, the plan estimates that 395,000 women and girls will need interventions related to gender-based violence. However, UNFPA has stated that it estimates that 2.5 million girls and women live at risk of SGBV. In the light of the acute humanitarian challenges, UNFPA has drawn up an additional response plan for Tigray and the conflict-affected neighboring regions of Afar and Amhara with a budget of 5 million. USD, of which 2.5 mill. USD so far is covered. The response plan focuses on UNFPA&apos;s core services and aims to reach 112,200 women and girls over a six-month period. Finally, in addition to the plan, UNFPA has identified new urgent needs for the establishment of &apos;safe spaces&apos; for women and girls in internally displaced persons&apos; camps.
