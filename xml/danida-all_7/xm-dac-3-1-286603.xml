   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The expected long-term impact of the project is: The resilience, the food security and the livelihoods of the vulnerable small-scale women and men farmers, and unskilled workers from host communities and displaced Syrians are improved.

To achieve this goal, the project will work with the MoA, Green Plan to support farmers&#x2019; investments in land reclamation, water reservoirs and other on-farm complementary works.  This will be pursued through the support of the Green Plan funding mechanism, monitoring activities, developing the capacities of the farmers in collaboration with MoA extension services centres, with a priority given to women farmers.

The project will be supporting 1 000 vulnerable small-scale women and men farmers&#x2019; investments with matching grants (representing around 25 percent of the total initial cost of the investment paid by the farmer) for reclaiming their unproductive or abandoned lands, constructing water reservoirs for buffering water shortages, and/or other on-farm complementary works (terracing, retaining walls, planting of tree seedlings, installing more efficient drip irrigation systems, and fencing). Assuming that 70 percent of beneficiaries will enter into production after 3 years, it is expected that 700 beneficiary farmers will be producing at the end of the project. These matching grants will support investments that would generate a production value of about USD 3 to 9 million when farms reach maturity. It is expected that these investments will generate unskilled labour for host communities and displaced Syrians for the value of USD 1.0 to 1.5 million.</narrative>
