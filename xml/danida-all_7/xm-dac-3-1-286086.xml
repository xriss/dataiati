   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The New Democracy Fund is a part of DANEP and has the overall goal of strengthening democratically organised civil society in the Neighbourhood region.

The New Democracy Fund will work within several overarching themes: youth, media, culture, labour market, climate and gender equality, and will operate in three tracks:
1) Strengthening of civil society and long-term regional networks between civil society and youth organisations in Denmark and Neighbourhood countries. 
2) Rapid response funds for civil society organisations, human rights activists and journalists in urgent need of support. 
3) New people-to-people relations through exchange between civil society, culture and education institutions in Denmark and the Neighbourhood countries. 

The New Democracy Fund will be administered by a consortium of civil society organisations with active partnerships between Denmark and the neighbourhood region.

Key results: 
- Strengthened democratic participation and democratically organized civil society in the Neighbourhood Region.
- New sustainable partnerships, networks and people-to-people exchange between Denmark and neighbourhood countries. 
- Strengthened Danish civil society presence in the Neighbourhood region. 
- More efficient modes for Danish response to changing contexts and emerging needs.</narrative>
