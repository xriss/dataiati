   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The activities in this JP focus on women&#x2019;s and girls&#x2019; empowerment in the context of the COVID-19 by enabling them to mitigate the health and socio-economic impacts of the pandemic in their households and communities. This programme aims to:

(i) increase the resilience of local communities, especially vulnerable, marginalized and hard-to-reach women and girls to prevent, respond to COVID-19 and limit its spread (Pillar 3 of the CF)

(ii) increase the resilience of marginalized and vulnerable women, young women, and girls through technical support to mitigate the socio-economic impact of COVID-19 and including all forms of GBV (Pillar 1 of the CF).

(iii) support the regional and local authorities in pilot areas (K&#xE9;bili and Kef) to provide health leveraging the community awareness work (Pillar 3 of the CF).

For interventions (ii) and (iii), two pilot governorates from the south and the north-west, K&#xE9;bili because UNDP is currently working in this area and Kef because of the high mortality rate during COVID outbreak, have been chosen to implement these activities.</narrative>
