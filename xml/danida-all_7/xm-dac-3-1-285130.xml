   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Globally, consumers and retailers are becoming increasingly aware of the need for responsible production and consumption. There is therefore a market push to reduce the impact of harmful pesticides and other farm inputs on the environment, promote biodiversity and ensure natural resource management. The TRACE Kenya project will contribute to economic growth and promote environmental and social standards of 15,000 smallholder coffee farmers (30% women and 10% youth) in Kericho, Nandi and Bungoma counties by growing Kenya&#x2019;s organic coffee for export to consumer markets in Europe and the USA by 2023. Our approach includes capacity building initiatives and interactive training on innovative organic coffee practices, facilitating access to high yielding and disease-resistant coffee varieties and eco-friendly inputs, and promoting eco-friendly technologies. With this comes improved coffee productivity (quality and quantity) and access to new markets, resulting in improved farmer&#x2019; incomes and a wider market base for the commercial partner. The project strives to create an inclusive, market-driven and sustainable coffee sub-sector that generates increased income opportunities and creates decent jobs for many along the value chain. The project also targets to deliver Kenya&#x2019;s first certified organic coffee to global consumers.
The Danida Market Development Partnerships programme (DMDP) is designed to support commercially oriented partnerships for sustainable market development in developing countries. In addition to reporting on individually determined outputs and outcomes, all DMDP projects report on five key programme indicators. These five indicators are the same for the whole project portfolio, enabling strategic and programme level monitoring, and aggregation of results.
At the programme level, three key outcomes which are related to three of the five key programme indicators, have been chosen for results reporting: Outcome 1: Increased employment (decent jobs) for wom</narrative>
