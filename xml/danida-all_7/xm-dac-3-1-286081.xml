  <description type="1" xml:lang="EN">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">HURIDOCS (Human Rights Information and Documentation Services) is an NGO that helps human rights groups gather, organise and use information to create positive change in the world. Founded in 1982, HURIDOCS has developed methodologies and software tools that make it easier not only to manage collections of evidence, law and research, but also to analyze them for insights.
This project aims at a growing need for human rights defenders (HRDs) that engage in efforts to advance accountability and justice: a state-of-the-art software tool that helps them record, manage and analyse human rights violations in a way that is easily adaptable to local contexts, while protecting sensitive data on sources and victims. The need for such a tool is timely, as existing alternatives have reached their end of life, just as threats against the digital resilience of HRDs are increasing, and the amount of potential information that HRDs can leverage is growing exponentially. HURIDOCS will be to cooperate with partners on the ground in Cameroon, China, Egypt, The Gambia, Iraq, Mali, Mexico, Myanmar, North Korea, Palestine, Philippines, Sri Lanka, Turkey and Ukraine.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">Human Rights Defenders&apos; (HRD) investigations supported by software tools demonstrably lead to:
- Perpetrators being held to account to deter future violations.
- Achieve justice for victims through reparations, memorialisation, policy change, brought about by institutions that are open to all.
- Collective memory of the past brings societies to heal and grow into a better future.

Target (2022): At least 10 Organisations are using the software tool and report that it significantly aids their efforts in furthering at least one of the impact indicators listed above.</narrative>
