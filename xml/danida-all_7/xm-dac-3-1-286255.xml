   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Afghanistan Humanitarian Fund (AHF) makes an essential contribution to supporting absolutely critical humanitarian needs in Afghanistan. The fund continuously responds to current humanitarian challenges, not least through international and local NGOs, which in many cases have better access to e.g. Taliban-controlled areas than is the case for the UN. In 2020, the fund has so far distributed 67 million USD in support and has received 57 million USD in donations from donors. In 2019, the total level of support was 63.9 million USD. The funds ensured, among other things, that 266,000 people received emergency items and other support for emergency rehousing, 561,000 were covered by support for improved drinking water supply and sanitation, 29,635 children were vaccinated, 388,100 were given food security, eg through support for agricultural production and animal husbandry, and 227,900 were covered by various protection measures, not least related to gender-based violence.
