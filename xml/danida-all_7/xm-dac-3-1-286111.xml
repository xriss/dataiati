  <description type="1" xml:lang="EN">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Tanzania is among the world&#x2019;s largest producers of raw cashew nuts and accounts for 75% of the total production in East Africa. More than 80% of Tanzanian cashews are exported as raw cashew nuts to Vietnam and India for processing, before entering the global market. However, when processed only 20% of the cashew mass is extracted and the remainder is treated as waste. CARE, in partnership with Out-Growers, will contribute to eliminating raw material waste and unlock untapped commercial opportunities in the cashew value chain. This will be done by improving the human and infrastructure capacity to locally process quality cashew products in the Mkinga region of Tanzania.
Cashews provide an important and often primary source of income for 250.000 smallholder farmers, in the southern coastal regions, which together account for 80-90% of Tanzania&#x2019;s marketed cashew crop. The project contributes to SDG 8 by creating green jobs in localising the cashew nut processing and unlocking untapped commercial opportunities in the cashew value chain in Mkinga region.
The Danida Market Development Partnerships programme (DMDP) is designed to support commercially oriented partnerships for sustainable market development in developing countries. In addition to reporting on individually determined outputs and outcomes, all DMDP projects report on five key programme indicators. These five indicators are the same for the whole project portfolio, enabling strategic and programme level monitoring, and aggregation of results.
At the programme level, three key outcomes which are related to three of the five key programme indicators, have been chosen for results reporting: Outcome 1: Increased employment (decent jobs) for women, men and youth. Outcome 2: Increased income opportunities from improved market linkages. Outcome 3: Additional capital raised (investment leverage).</narrative>
