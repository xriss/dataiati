   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The overall objective of the SASSP second phase is to &#x2018;support countries in strengthening their Adaptive Social Protection systems to expand coverage and reach&#x2019;. This objective contributes to achieving CCDMP Outcome 3 &#x2018;strengthened integration of climate change hazards into collective risk mitigation mechanisms in vulnerable communities and areas&#x2019;, and will ultimately contribute to the overall CCDMP objective of &#x2018;increasing the resilience of vulnerable populations to the impacts of climate change&#x2026;&#x2019;
&#x2018;Reach&#x2019; in this context means that anyone who needs to be reached can be reached ? it focuses on the reach of the adaptive social protection system. The SASSP change pathway is straightforward, as illustrated in the diagram below. The SASPP invests, through recipient executed activities (RETFs), in building systems (registries, payment systems, triggers, Early Warning Systems (EWS) etc.), but also in implementation of social protection programs, including cash transfers to build resilience and respond to shocks, productive inclusion, cash for work, and human capital development interventions, via government systems. In addition, it also invests in knowledge creation and sharing, and analytical work. This analytical work provides strategic directions for the work but also creates a body of evidence. 
The investments, both in terms of direct support to government programs but also to knowledge creation, target each of the four building blocks of an adaptive social protection system: (1) government and institutions, (2) programs and delivery systems, (3) data and, (4) finance. The outcome of the investment across building blocks and various thematic areas are strengthened systems. Strengthened systems can expand their coverage and their reach; they can scale up or down as needed.</narrative>
