   <narrative xml:lang="EN">A more sustainable and grounded theological environment where more people take part in contextual theological discussions and bring that learning into motivated engagement in local contextual issues in Myanmar.

A larger group of students, alumni, religious leaders and actors learning to engage in dialogue and thus have a diminished fear of the other, and more have actively engaged themselves in dialogue initiatives.

To create safe spaces and platforms for interfaith dialogue to take place, where inter-faith, inter-ethnic and inter-denominational participants, religious leaders and actors, faculty and students and alumni can come together and learn to engage in dialogue and non-violent communication in order to grow an appreciation for diversity and contribute to national peacebuilding</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The grant is given to the organisation due to their application to the COVID-19 Emergency Pool (N&#xF8;dpulje) in order for the organisation to continue their skills development activities in India. Due to COVID-19 restrictions, planned development activities are in risk of closure, which would negatively affect results. 

The goal of the project is to engage people in theological debates. The debates will diminish fear of the other and help strengthen communities across religious differences.</narrative>
