   <narrative xml:lang="EN">HPG overall aim is to inform and inspire principled humanitarian policy and practice and enhance the effectiveness of humanitarian action in saving lives and alleviating suffering. This is achieved through the Integrated Programme (IP), a two-year rolling body of independent research and policy engagement, which examines critical issues facing humanitarian policy and practice.

During the period 2019-21, the IP critically analyses the ability of the humanitarian sector to deliver on its stated commitment to impartiality. The IP focuses on the key obstacles to &#x2013; and enablers of &#x2013; a more inclusive aid system, analysing why certain groups or individuals are excluded from assistance; exploring the relationships between changing gender norms and assistance and vulnerability in displacement; exploring the emerging impacts of new technology in improving or undermining the system&#x2019;s ability to address those furthest behind; and assessing historical and contemporary practices of humanitarian advocacy and protection on behalf of those most at risk in conflict.
Key results: Policy Briefs, Working Papers (based on case studies), Roundtables and Final Reports in four components: 
i) Falling through the cracks: inclusion and exclusion in humanitarian action 
ii) How gender roles change in displacement 
iii) The humanitarian &#x2018;digital divide&#x2019;: understanding the impact of technology on crisis response
iv) Advocating for humanity: opportunities for improving protection outcomes in conflict</narrative>
