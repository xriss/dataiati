   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Nile Basin covers one tenth of the African Continent and is divided between eleven countries with a total of 350 million inhabitants. The ten initial countries are: Burundi, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Egypt, Ethiopia, Kenya, Rwanda, Sudan, Tanzania and Uganda. South Sudan is now accepted as a full-fledged member.

Acknowledging the challenges, the potential and the necessity of regional cooperation, the ten initial countries established &quot;the Nile Basin Initiative (NBI)&quot; in 1999 as a regional partnership with a broad vision of creating a sustainable socio-economic development through equal utilisation of the Nile&apos;s water resources. This was a historical step taken in a region, where the countries&apos; relations often have been shaped by mistrust and opposition. A strategic action programme was established. It includes a capacity-building programme (Shared Vision Programme) with focus on creating the necessary trust and establishing regional institutions and capacities, and an action-programme (Subsidiary Action Programme) focusing on investment and development projects. The capacity-building programme covers all member countries, while the investment projects can be developed between two or more countries.
A range of donors support the initiative and the World Bank has established a Nile Basin Trust Fund (NBTF) for the administration of donor funds.
The overall objective of the Danish contribution is to ensure that the Nile&apos;s water resources are utilised and administered in an - for the Nile countries - equal, optimised and sustainable way promoting socioeconomic development, peace and stability in the region. The immediate objective is to support the enhancement of the regional water resource management, which serves as an integrated part of the countries&apos; common initiative, including the strengthening of the capacity and the institutional infrastructure for cooperation on a sustainable utilisation and administration of the Nile&apos;s water resources.</narrative>
