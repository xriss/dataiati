     <actual value="The process around the 2020 High Leve Political Forum was
special in 2020, due to the Covid-19 situation. All activities, such
as side-event etc. were held on different virtual platforms. The
virtual set-up made it very difficult to ensure civils society
participation in general and even more so for countries in the
global South, let alone vulnerable groups.  The Danish 92 Group has actively participated in all relevant fora
in relation to the Danish NAP, using every opportunity to speak for
17
the development of this plan. Together with Globalt Fokus and
member organisations, the Danish 92 group has kept in touch with
the political developments during Covid-19 and in the re-opening
process, to ensure that the NAP is still on the political agenda.
The 92 Group has worked for the 2030-panel to advocate for a
NAP. This resulted in letters from the 2030-panel to the
government (the Finance Minister) on this. This contributed to the
government deciding to develop a NAP by the end of 2020."></actual>
