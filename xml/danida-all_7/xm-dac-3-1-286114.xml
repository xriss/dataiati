  <description type="1" xml:lang="EN">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Bangladesh&#x2019;s waste system is not profitable, not widely implemented, and leads to environmental damage. Streams that are easy to recycle and have a high value, such as glass, metal and PET, are more likely to be collected and recirculated into the economy than low-value and hard-to-recycle waste. As only items with a higher established value are recycled, there is a missed opportunity for lower value plastic. Practical Action and commercial partner Riverrecycle Oy, seek to transform the lives of informal waste workers by creating a new market for a stream of plastic waste which currently has no commercial value. The project introduces pyrolysis technology to the most polluted points of the Padma River in Bangladesh, and will integrate waste pickers into a plastic-collection and processing workstream, creating new jobs, improving working conditions and creating commercial value out of plastic waste.
The Danida Market Development Partnerships programme (DMDP) is designed to support commercially oriented partnerships for sustainable market development in developing countries. In addition to reporting on individually determined outputs and outcomes, all DMDP projects report on five key programme indicators. These five indicators are the same for the whole project portfolio, enabling strategic and programme level monitoring, and aggregation of results.
At the programme level, three key outcomes which are related to three of the five key programme indicators, have been chosen for results reporting: Outcome 1: Increased employment (decent jobs) for women, men and youth. Outcome 2: Increased income opportunities from improved market linkages. Outcome 3: Additional capital raised (investment leverage).</narrative>
