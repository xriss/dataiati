   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project is a finalisation of the Danish engagement in the NORSAD Fund, which was established in 1990 by Denmark, Finland, Norway, Sweden and the SADC-countries. The purpose of NORSAD was to support economic growth through lending to small and medium-sized enterprises in Southern Africa.

At the end of 2011, NORSAD was privatised and transformed into a limited liability shareholding company, Norsad Finance Ltd., which was launched in March 2012 and is now owned by the development finance institutions of the participating countries. As part of this privatisation, Denmark has handed over its shares to the Danish Investment Fund for Developing Countries (IFU). 

With establishment as a private company, a capital injection of about USD 35 million was required to secure financial sustainability, as Norsad Finance Ltd. became tax liable and additional capital was needed to introduce new financial products demanded by the market. Denmark supported the capital injection with DKK 57 million to purchase preferential shares.The new preferential shares have also been handed over to IFU.

Throughout its more than 20 years of existence, NORSAD has delivered results under changing and at times difficult circumstances. NORSAD has contributed to the establishment of more than 46.000 jobs in almost 500 companies, of which about half have been created in rural areas and about 25% for women. 

Norsad Finance Ltd. continues the original purpose of NORSAD - contributing to the improvement of living conditions in Southern Africa, particularly in the rural areas, through financial services to SMEs.</narrative>
