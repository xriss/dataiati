   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Based on the latest updated version of the World Bank Group Corporate Scorecards (source 1-3), The World Bank Annual Report 2020 (source 4) alongside the Danish organisational strategy for the World Bank (source 5), the following results can be noted in relation the Danish priorities:

&#x2022;	Concerning target 1 of &#x201C;ending extreme poverty&#x201D;, extreme poverty has continued its decline. Compared to the 2011 baseline outlined in the organisational strategy (source 5:10), where 13,5% of the population lived on less than USD 1.90 a day, the most recent scorecard updates shows a decrease to 9.2 % in 2017 (source 1: see section on goals). For the most recent regional updates regarding extreme poverty, see Table 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13 in source 4. 

&#x2022;	In relation to target 2 on &#x2018;promoting shared prosperity&#x2019;, the income growth for the 40 percent poorest in each country serves as an indicator. Compared to the 2011 baseline outlined in the organisational strategy, the growth rate has decreased from 3.6 % in 2011 (source 5:10), to 1.9 % in 2019 (source 1 see section on goals).

&#x2022;	Regarding target 3 on CO2eq emissions reductions per year, improvements have been made compared to the FY15-17 baseline. In 2011, the emissions reductions reached app. 15 million CO2eq/year (source 5:10), whereas the latest Corporate Scorecard update shows a 157 million CO2eq/year emissions reduction in FY19-FY21 (source 2: see section on Resilience). For the most recent regional updates regarding CO2 emissions, see Table 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13 in source 4.

&#x2022;	With reference to target 4, on client feedback on WB effectiveness and the impact on development results improvements can be measured vis-&#xE0;-vis the FY13 baseline. In 2013 the WB scored a 6.9 out (source 5:10) of 10 whereas in 2020 a 7.4 score was measured (source 3: see section on Supporting Clients To Achieve Development Results).

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">IBRD, the World Bank, was established in 1945 and has 188 member countries. IBRD helping to reduce poverty in middle-income and creditworthy poorer countries. IBRD surplus fund development activities in low-income countries and favorable loan terms for middle-income countries .

The latest general capital increase of the World Bank took place in 1998 when Denmark subscribed to approx. DKK 2644.1 million worth of shares of which 6 per cent corresponding to approx. DKK 158.9 million was paid. The remaining 94 per cent were pledged as guarantee capital. The distribution of shares in IBRD is based on a formula reflecting the countries in the world economy, openness, financial stability and the level of foreign reserves. The World Bank spring meeting in 2010 approved a reform of the distribution of votes that gave developing countries a greater share of the votes in the Bank. Denmark&apos;s share of the capital amounts to 0.76 per cent.

The decision on a voice reform paved the way for a further resolution on general and selective capital increase for the World Bank. In the period 2011-2016, Denmark&apos;s paid contribution amounted to DKK 190 million. The guarantee stands as non-paid.</narrative>
