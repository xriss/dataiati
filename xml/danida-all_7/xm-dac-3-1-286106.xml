   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Unlike other African markets, the Nigerian aquaculture industry is highly fragmented, consisting majorly of smallholder farmers with little access to credible market information. Most of these fish farmers have limited access to quality inputs like extruded feed, healthy fingerlings and proper education. They are poorly organized and have limited or no access to financing inadvertently limiting the industry&#x2019;s development. Solidaridad and key commercial partner, Aller Aqua, in partnership with IDIPR , OxyGuard, WorldFish, aim to create sustainable business in the aquaculture value chain for smallholder fish farmers. By lifting their level of education and access to market information, the Aquaculture Development Project seeks to position these smallholder fish farmers as the medium size fish farmers of tomorrow and at the same time contribute to closing the demand gap for fish in the country. Through capacity building, introduction of modern techniques and education for improved output the project will create decent, green jobs as well as opportunities for economic growth and empowerment of smallholder farmers.
The Danida Market Development Partnerships programme (DMDP) is designed to support commercially oriented partnerships for sustainable market development in developing countries. In addition to reporting on individually determined outputs and outcomes, all DMDP projects report on five key programme indicators. These five indicators are the same for the whole project portfolio, enabling strategic and programme level monitoring, and aggregation of results.
At the programme level, three key outcomes which are related to three of the five key programme indicators, have been chosen for results reporting: Outcome 1: Increased employment (decent jobs) for women, men and youth. Outcome 2: Increased income opportunities from improved market linkages. Outcome 3: Additional capital raised (investment leverage).</narrative>
