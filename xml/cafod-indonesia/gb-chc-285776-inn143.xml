   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Access to modern, sustainable, safe and affordable energy services in developing countries is an essential step to poverty reduction and sustainable development in a time of increasing environmental threats. Globally 1.3 billion people still lack access to any form of electricity and 2.7 billion still cook over open fires. More than 95% of people living in energy poverty are in sub-Saharan Africa or in Asia. 

A renewed political focus on tackling energy poverty is emerging through the post-Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) discussion - energy access is often referred to as the &#x201C;missing MDG&#x201D; - and also through UN Secretary General Ban Ki Moon&#x2019;s Sustainable Energy for All Initiative (or SE4All).  This initiative has 3 objectives to be achieved by 2030: ensuring universal energy access; doubling the share of renewables in the global energy mix; and doubling energy efficiency globally. Ban Ki-moon has stated that civil society is central to this initiative, yet there are no clear action plans on how to engage civil society or those living in energy poverty at either international or country level. Civil society organisations are also concerned with the unclear definition of the goals and lack of clarity over delivery, monitoring and accountability frameworks.  

Over the next 12-18 months, SE4All will move into its operational phase in over 60 countries. The focus will shift to the national level engagement, with countries undertaking Gap Analyses of their energy sectors and developing National Action Plans (NAPs) to achieve the SE4All goals. 

CAFOD will support Institute for Essential Services Reform (IESR) to carry out a scoping of the opportunities for civil society organisations in SE Asia to engage with sustainable energy access advocacy, using the SE4All initiative as an entry point. Scoping activities will include awareness raising/policy mapping, advocacy mapping and advocacy strategy development, as well as participation in meetings with other CAFOD partners globally that are working on sustainable energy access for all. 

This scoping study will provide IESR with evidence to develop a regional campaign on SE4All, which will aim to support civil society in SE Asia to influence national energy planning and to assess the role of access to sustainable energy services in delivering national development objectives.</narrative>
