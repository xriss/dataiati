   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project is part of a programme started in 2013 by CAFOD and IIED aiming to support the design of energy services that benefit poor groups called the &#x2018;energy delivery model&#x2019; (EDM) approach. A 6-step design process, called the EDM Toolkit,  aims to ensure services address end users&#x2019; wider development needs, fit the local context and are financially, socially and environmentally sustainable in order to maximize their development impact. CAFOD and IIED have piloted the EDM process in Boafeo community, Flores Island. Indonesia, where most people have no access to grid electricity. 639 people live in the village mostly subsistence farmers. Through the EDM process, the villagers identified three top development needs. 
1. Better education for primary school children through interactive learning; 
2. Increased and higher quality household lighting; 
3. Additional income generation from coffee farming

 Boafeo has a Catholic primary school  with 92 pupils and nine teachers. The EDM process identified three key gaps preventing the priority need being met. Firstly, &#x2018;lack of infrastructure/resources&#x2019;; secondly, &#x2018;poor teacher training&#x2019; and; thirdly, &#x2018;teacher motivation&#x2019;. These are interlinked issues and unlesss all these gaps are addressed in a holistic manner, the solution developed will not meet the need and be sustainable. The project goal is therefore to provide a holistic solution through the following:

- Provision of  two laptops, projector, printer and learning materials
- Provision of sustainable electricity service including maintenance and repair function
- Teacher trainings on interactive learning and literacy

The community will fund maintenance and repairs of AV quipment and SHS. Their involvement from the initial design  through to implementation will support its long-term sustainability.  To support wider scale-up of the EDM, the training will include teachers from other schools and a community of practice developed to support ongoing peer-to-peer learning.</narrative>
