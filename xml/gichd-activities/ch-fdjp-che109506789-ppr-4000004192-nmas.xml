       <narrative xml:lang="EN">In Q1 2022, during the reporting period, the GICHD further worked on the development of the templates for generic NMAS. The two drafts on risk management and quality management were shared with external stakeholders like NMAAs, international operators and UN for feedback. Following that, it has been decided that the two templates will be blended to come up with a guidance on how NMAS should look like. This will borrow best elements from both templates. 
The GICHD aims to create a set of guidelines on NMAS chapters to support NMAA in the development of context-specific national standards this year. The set of NMAS chapters/guidelines shall specify, and detail, minimum requirements given in IMAS (shall/should formulations), offer generic text blocks examples where appropriate, and highlight critical aspects that need context-specific adjustments. Further guidance shall be given by providing examples, critical guiding questions and recommendations</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Conducting NMAS baseline assessments has not been possible during 2021 due to Covid-19 restrictions and lockdowns globally. The GICHD has however identified that addressing the issue of managing liabilities in MA operations was an area of concern for many National Mine Action Authorities and operators alike. As identified in previous GICHD assessments, addressing liabilities is important for the overall improvement of the NMAS frameworks. During the reporting period, the GICHD has designed a questionnaire on liability, which was shared with 42 NMAA and 11 Mine Action organisations and operators. The questionnaire will set a baseline for the main challenges facing NMAA and programs with regards to addressing liabilities and possible areas for supporting the enhancement of National Mine Action Standards in various countries, thereby identifying potential areas for further NMAS assessments.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">During the reporting period, the GICHD has been working on finalising the liability in mine action study. The liability assessment for Afghanistan had to be halted due to the on-going security situation in country. Currently, the GICHD is exploring opportunities on the support to Afghanistan in the wake of the new circumstances. The funds were further allocated to support the NMAS assessment and development in Angola for EOD, RM and ADS. For all the three chapters, a draft has been shared with the Angola National Mine Action Authority (ANAM) for feedback and then futher approval. In the meanwhile the GICHD has also started work on the developing generic chapters of NMAS to guide the NMAAs in all NMAS development processes stemming from assessments - more to follow in Q4.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">During the reporting period, the liability assessment for Afghanistan was halted due to the security situation in country and no follow ups have been possible since then.

The funds were further allocated to support the NMAS assessment and development in Angola for EOD, RM and ADS. For all the three chapters, the drafts were finalised with the support of the Angola National Mine Action Authority (ANAM) and then  approved. The three chapters on NMAS now are being validated in ANAM and the deliverables from GICHD&apos;s end have been achieved.

Also, the GICHD has onoging work on the development of generic chapters of NMAS to guide the NMAAs in all NMAS development processes stemming from assessments - two draft chapters oon QM and RM have been drafted and are currently undergoing peer review.</narrative>
