   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Rehabilitation of Water Supply in Al-Hassakeh Governorate</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In response to the most pressing needs in the most underserved areas identified through the Humanitarian Response Fund for Syria, several cities and towns will be targeted in Hassakeh governorate with the rehabilitation of basic services such as water and electricity.
The governorate of Al-Hassakeh with a population of around 1.3 million located in the north-eastern region, hosts thousands of IDPs scattered across the governorate. Most of the basic services (like electricity, water) are secured to a minimum, but the recent crisis has limited the ability of the technical authorities to support and provide services or carry out needed maintenance work.

population in Al-Hasakeh city used to depend on groundwater wells for their drinking water, the main pumping station is located in Allouk area and contains 30 wells, due to the ongoing military action in Rass Al-Ein the station has been out of service which may lead to a humanitarian disaster in terms of potable water. On the other hand, people now being forced to rely on unsafe water from shallow wells, UNHCR have drilled 18 wells since 2013 as a response to the immediate need for water by that time, those wells currently are out of service and need to be rehabilitated.

The first urgent response of UNDP to the severe water shortage in the Hasakeh city was the provision of the needed requirement to fix the electricity lines supplying power to the Allouk water station.in addition, UNDP provided the needed equipment to rehabilitate 5 of the public wells which were selected by the local authorities due to their critical role in the provision of potable water for the people in the area.&#x201D;

Through this project, UNDP will expand the response to the urgent water need by targeting 12 locations (Qamishli, Khweitleh Reidat, Rehiyeh Sawda, Tal Hmis, Farfara Tal Hmis, Krefati, Saadia Derbasiya, Rashidiyeh Derbasiyeh, Abu Tineh, Kherbet Elsweifat, Al Sihah, Al-Hasakeh), focusing on the rehabilitation of 9 wells and three pumping stations to support services for the unserved resident and ensure people have this basic need met.in addition UNDP will provide two dosing pumps to ensure water quality.
The targeted pumping stations considered the main pumping stations for potable water in Al-Hasakeh and Qamishli cities and the targeted wells are public drinking water wells which were partially damaged due to the recent military operations. Moreover, all targeted wells and pumping stations selected based on the fact that having water tanks, water distribution networks, and feed a high percentage of the selected residential areas and can be put on service and deliver potable water immediately upon finalization of the required rehabilitation.

UNDP will adopt community-based approaches in workers&#x2019; selection and implementation of the various activities/interventions. Under the project, necessary equipment (submersible deep well water pumps, control panels, transformers, horizontal surface pumps and sodium hypochlorite dosing pumps) that will be provided and installed to ensure the water delivered to people</narrative>
