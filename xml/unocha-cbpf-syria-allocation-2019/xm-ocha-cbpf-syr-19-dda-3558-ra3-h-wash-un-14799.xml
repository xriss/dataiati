  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project addresses the immediate health needs of internally displaced children (girls and boys) under five years of age and women in child-bearing age in Roj and Newroz camps in Hassakeh, Mahmoudly camp in Raqqa, Al-Thawra district in Raqqa, Abu Khashab settlement in Deir Ezzor. In addition to the provision of vaccination services to all girls amp boys under the age of one year in Aleppo, Raqqa, Hassakeh and Deir Ezzor governorates. 
The project will address the health services needs of girls, boys and women through pediatric and maternal check-ups, treatment of illnesses, and referral of complicated cases to higher level by fixed health points and mobile medical teams and provide vaccination services through MOH fixes health centers and mobile vaccination teams.
Based on WHO assessment of 47 shelters in Hassakeh more than 70% of the key informants reported that they don&#x2019;t have routine immunization services within their communities, 83% reported diarrhea in their community, and more than 73% reported respiratory infections. Lice and scabies were among the most 5 common diseases in the shelters with rate more than 40%.
Antibiotics were the mostly needed medicines in the shelters. Emergency and child health services were the most needed services in the shelters (around 75%) followed by maternal health, nutrition, and routine immunizations. Availability of routine vaccination services in health facilities inside shelters is around 6% only, availability of child health services is around 58%, and maternal health is 63%. Only 53% of informants reported that they have a health facility or mobile medical team in their shelter, and 25% reported that it is not accessible during night. In average the distance between the shelters and the nearest free hospital is more than 10 km. The assessment shows urgent need to increase access to maternal amp child health services for IDPs in those shelters taking into consideration that NES governorates are the most vulnerable governorates and include the vast majority of districts that ranked with high-severity health need. UNICEF is working with WHO and MOH to finalize an agreement with GAVI to provide Syria with essential vaccines, SHF fund will be used to procure non-GAVI vaccines (BCG, Td, Dt, Hep B, and bOPV) for children in NES governorates including all IDP children in those governorates. The project will be implemented in cooperation with WHO amp UNFPA who are supporting IDPs through their projects in NES governorates. Coordination is done through health sector at national level amp sub-sector coordination meetings in NES region. UNICEF will support local NGOs (Syria Al-Yamama, Mar Asia, and Al-Bir Wal- Ihsan in Hassakeh) to meet the immediate needs of IDP children amp women in those governorates.</narrative>
