   <narrative xml:lang="EN">GOPA Emergency intervention in Al Hol camp to provide the Initial needs to the IDPs</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The security situation in the Eastern area remains volatile and unpredictable. USA government decided to withdraw its forces from Syria while SDF confirmed their readiness to clear the area from ISIS and repel any proposed ISIS attack.In total, the camp population is now 66,247 people (19,216 families), the vast majority of them women and children, including 23 per cent under the age of 5 and 8 per cent pregnant and nursing mothers (According to OCHA Flash update &#x2013; No. 7). 
As a result of the large number of displaced persons who arrived to the camp and the absence of a contingency plan to accommodate these numbers, people stayed outside for two days in the reception area, waiting the completion of the registration process and the distribution of the tents. This resulted in the deaths of dozens of  children and many others in critical condition were taken to the hospitals of Al-Hasakah due to the severe cold and not receiving any blankets for a day and a half from the day they arrived.
The purpose of this project is to rapidly respond to the emergency needs of the families in Al Hol to raise the IDPs hygienic conditions by targeting them with hygiene promotion activities due to the fact that these IDPS are extremely vulnerable to water-borne infections and other diseases related to personal hygiene. The unavailability of, or lack of access to, a continuous safe water source put everyone at risk of disease transmission.  
Having an understanding of some of the basic hygiene practices can reduce incidence of disease, 120 awareness sessions will be implemented in the camp targeting 3000 beneficiaries, each beneficiary will receive a personal hygiene kit after attending the HP awareness session.  A protection/GBV specialist will attend the HP sessions and provide the beneficiaries with GBV basis according to their needs, gender and age.
 In addition the intervention will include maintenance of 90 latrines in the camp benefiting 9.250 individuals taking into consideration ensuring safe and comfort access to all targeted IDPs especially PWDs, elderly, women and children. Total of 20 latrines out of 90 will be prepared to suit PWDs needs. This activity will be combined with desludging of 5000 m3 of sewage. 
As well, the response will include contributing to support the main protection needs in the camp alongside with distributing the following items:
- Dignity kits:10,000 Women and girls aged between 15 to 45 years will receive dignity kits.
- Infant kits: 1,500 Babies under 2 years age will receive 1,500 infant kits.
GOPA team who is responsible of the distribution process and will be in a direct contact with beneficiaries is going to be trained on basic of GBV, DO no harm principles and is totally aware of code of conduct. GBV awareness sessions will be implemented in conjunction with distribution process. IEC materials will be distributed in the place delivering messages of different GBV topics. While the beneficiaries are at the distribution point in Al Hol, which is equipped to be a safe a comfortable zone. Two GBV case managers will be present in this whole process to give any needed counselling and to inform the beneficiaries that there will be specific time where they can ask for any counselling. GOPA will ensure referring any remarkable cases to the specialized volunteers as there are different protection activities are being implemented in the camp in cooperation between GOPA , UNHCR and UNICEF, UNFPA and other protection partners.. In addition, the distribution process will be implemented under supervision and monitoring of protection/GBV specialist. During HP awareness sessions, a protection/GBV specialist will attend the HP sessions and provide the beneficiaries with GBV basis according to their needs, gender and age.</narrative>
