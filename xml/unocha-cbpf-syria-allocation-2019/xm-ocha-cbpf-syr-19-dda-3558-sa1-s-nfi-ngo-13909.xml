  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project main goal is to provide life-saving seasonal NFI support to most vulnerable families targeting crisis-affected households in Al Quneitra and Dar&apos;a. This project would  provide mid to long-term sustainable resilience to those most in need for non-food items assistance. The objective is to provide highly vulnerable Syrian families affected by the crisis in both of Dar&apos;a and Al Qunietra with winterization  non-food items to maintain their health, privacy amp dignity. It is worth to be mentioned that GOPA has a previous experience in implementing such projects with OCHA, other NGOs and INGOs and has access to these areas. GOPA has an office, warehouse and four community centers in Dara&apos;a in addition to a warehouse in Al Quneitra.
The project will target total of 4300 households in Dar&apos;a (Ash-Shajara,  Kherbet Ghazala, Sheikh Miskine, Nimer) and Al Quneitra (Hameidiyyeh, Um Batna, Ofania) with total number of 21,500 beneficiaries received total of 4300 blankets, 8600 clothes kits and 8600 shoes.
The primary target beneficiaries will be  war-affected vulnerable families from communities. Special emphasis is placed on targeting efforts towards female-headed households, families with pregnant and/or lactating women, families with children under 2 - 5 years of age, family members who are disabled/have special needs and/or family members who are elderly.
This will take place in locations where GOPA-DERD can have access. GOPA has the necessary organizational and technical capacity to efficiently manage the procurement, receipt, transport, storage and distribution of the relief commodities. All contents of the NFI kits are purchased from local vendors in Syria and are commonly familiar and recognized items to the beneficiaries. During this project, GOPA will provide seasonal non-food items assistance including high-thermal blankets, winter clothing (such as trousers, sweaters, socks, and scarves)and shoes, to affected and returnees families with children from ages five to 17 years. A range of shoe sizes is ordered from the supplier that correspond with the children&#x2019;s ages. All the children that receive shoes first try the shoes on to ensure proper fitting. The clothing and shoes will target both gender according to the cultural and age standards. Each child will receive one clothes kit and one pair of shoes taking into consideration their age and gender. 
The targeted age groups in distributing clothes and shoes will be as following:
6-7 years old:1433
8-9 years old: 1433
10-11 years old:1433
12-13 years old: 1433
14-15 years old: 1433
16-17 years old: 1435
GOPA&apos;s mobile team will attend field visits to the targeted areas before starting the distribution and conduct focus group discussions with the beneficiaries from both genders and from different ages to in order to ensure targeting the most vulnerable household according to GOPA&apos;s beneficiaries selection criteria and to ensure involving the targeted groups with the project planning. The distribution will take place at safe and accessible distribution points in the provinces to ensure safe access to various ages of beneficiaries as well as to avoid any expected GBV cases during the distribution. GOPA coordinated with NFIs sector to avoid any duplication and overlapping during implementation.
During distribution, GOPA&apos;s field monitor will be attending the distribution process to ensure that the distribution process is being implemented in a good manner as well as all beneficiaries data is being collected disaggregated by age and sex. After distribution is completed, GOPA will conduct post distribution monitoring by calling beneficiaries to have feedback of the provided services and to measure the impact of the project on the beneficiaries to take it into consideration for further projects.</narrative>
