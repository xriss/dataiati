   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Emergency support to crisis affected wheat farmers in Al-Hasakeh and Ar-Raqqua to build their resilience to food and nutrition insecurity</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In October 2019, the security situation in the northeastern parts of Syria has worsened due to military operations from Turkey, affecting Al-Hasakeh, Ar-raqqua and Aleppo governorates. These governorates between them represent around two thirds of national wheat production.
The areas targeted under the current proposal in Al-Hasakeh and Ar-Raqqua for wheat seed distribution are adjacent to the locations affected by the current crisis in northeast Syria. These areas are hosting large numbers of Internally Displaced Peoples. The districts are mostly rural areas relying heavily on agricultural production for food and nutrition security. IDPs may be hosted in camps in extended families - household sizes increasing from around 5-6 people to 10-15 or in private accommodation.
Farmers, across the North East have been affected by an accumulation of negative factors in recent years - from drought (2016-2017), to floods and, later, wildfires (2019) and now large scale population displacement following the Turkish-sponsored military attack in Ras Alain, and neighboring sub-districts.
Wheat production, especially for the most vulnerable households plays a vital role for the food and nutrition security and in stabilizing communities, in the north east, an area, which used to be considered the breadbasket of Syria. Without wheat production , poor farmers in rural areas will have little alternative but to migrate to nearby towns and cities, or further to the west or central governorates, with negative social consequences (disposal of productive assets, protection issues, division of families, reduced capacity to support vulnerable members of extended families - old and infirm, etc). Such migration also creates additional pressure in urban areas to which the rural population travel - in terms of access to basic services.
According to recent rapid assessment conducted by FAO field officers in coordination with Directorates of agriculture in the concerned governorates, the numbers of farmers households affected by the crisis is about 13,700 farmer households. With an average land size of about 10 ha in the affected areas, about 137,000 ha of farmland are out of production. The land is mainly planted with wheat, and with an average production rate of 2 tons of wheat per hectare, the total estimated production loss is about 274,000 tons. This amount of production would have been enough to cover the food security requirement of about 1.4 million people per year.
The project will support 9,410 households (56,460 people) with 1,882 tons of wheat seeds (200 kg for each family enough to plant 1 ha of land for each targeted family). This will contribute to the production of 18,820 tons of wheat enough to provide food needs for about 94,100 persons, and thus increase food availability in their local communities, compensating for the loss of wheat production in the evacuated areas.</narrative>
