   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The protracted crisis in Syria, now in its eighth year, has forced an estimated 2.1 million, over one third of children, out-of-school and has put a further 1.3 million children at risk of dropping out. Over 5.8 million school-aged children and over 120,000 teachers are in need of education assistance inside Syria, 61 per cent of whom are in acute and immediate need.  Hostilities have resulted in over one in three schools being damaged, destroyed, no longer accessible or occupied for shelter and other purposes. This shortage, as well as irregular and under payment of qualified teachers also limits the quality and provision of education. Children who are out of school face increased protection risks including child marriage and the worst forms of child labor. More than 40 per cent of the out-of-school children in Syria are between 15 and 17 years of age and have differentiated learning, skills development and livelihoods needs. The escalation of violence has led to increasing war related psychological trauma for children, their families and education personnel. Exposure to violence decreases attendance, leads to drop out, and affects learning outcomes by limiting concentration. In some areas, over half of children with a disability have an unmet need for education, and over two thirds require specialized health services which are not available in their area.  
Al Raqaa city, which is witnessing returning movement of its citizens after years of war siege is in acute need to optimize the education level to create a safety area for children to encourage the families&apos; returning.
The returning movement to Al Raqqa started after the city became accessible as families started to return to their homes after hard war siege. This movement raised the necessary to respond to the huge and varies needs in the city. The past years of war in the city affected the citizens as well as buildings, facilities and infrastructure. 
The project main goal is to provide safe and protective spaces through small-scale rehabilitation of seven schools in the city as the following:
- Al Moutanabi School - 400 students.
- Al Maari School - 450 students.
- Khadija Al Koubra School - 350 students.
- Saleh Al Ali School - 400 students.
- Rabiea Al Raqi - 400 students.
