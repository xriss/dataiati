   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Raqqa , Al Hassakeh and Deir ez Zor are in the northeastern region of Syria. They were considered by their residents as an area of multicultural coexistence prior to the outbreak of the crisis in Syria. UNDP Local Context Analyses (LCA) conducted in 2019 reports   that nearly every military and political reality in north-eastern Syria has been upended in recent weeks by the withdrawal of U.S. forces from the Syrian border, the memorandum of understanding between Russia and Turkey to implement the Turkish &#x2018;safe zone&#x2019;, and the military agreement between the SDF and the Government of Syria.  The rapidly developing situation in northeast Syria is nothing short of a paradigmatic shift in the trajectory of the Syria conflict. The U.S. withdrawal from northeast Syria will have a profound impact on wider regional dynamics however, in the local context, its most profound and immediate effect has been to force the shotgun wedding between the SDF and the Government of Syria. However, the conflict continually started spreading around in different parts of the governorate which has caused disintegration among the diverse social groups, and In the past few months, as a result of the Turkish military operation in the north of Syria, which led to the displacement of large numbers of the population of al-Hasakah towards the safe areas in the nearby governorate of Raqqa and Deir Ezzor. Moreover, it was noticed that people in the governorates shape their affiliations not based on personal motives but based on an unjustified fear that other groups may adopt hostile attitudes towards them.  Such fear may lead influential people/entities or groups to exploit that &#x201C;fear&#x201D; for their own interests to have a protracted crisis 

In order to address the challenges of safety and community security, UNDP envisages to implement a project that will be mainly focused on promotion of social cohesion in order to promote sense of togetherness among the different social groups for mitigating safety risks and It is  envisaged that this project will contribute to raising the legal awareness of vulnerable groups on their basic rights, and introduce them to the available mechanisms, either formal or informal, to obtain these rights. This will include launching awareness and consultation campaigns targeting the most vulnerable groups, particularly women, and IDPs. These campaigns will cover a wide range of legal topics, with a special focus on the laws and issues that are pertinent to the current situation, such as family status law and civil documentation, women&apos;s rights, and gender equality, in addition to property rights law. Moreover, Mines and unexploded ordinances (UXOs) continue to be a major source of physical danger. Communities must be equipped to recognize and respond appropriately to these threats. Efforts at mine and UXO awareness must be evenly spread across and within at-risk communities.

UNDP will establish Legal Counselling centers in each of the target towns. The centers will be as a safe space to provide legal guidance and consultation on a range of issues including on Housing, Land, and Property related issues. Legal counseling will be offered by practicing lawyers and legal practitioners. The counseling centers would be established in the municipalities building in each target town. The project will undertake an outreach program in the target areas to inform the public about the facility.
 
The project will support the four neighborhoods/towns to establish Community and safety centers in two governorates. Community security activities may include but not limited to 1) Provide legal aid assistance to IDPs and most vulnerable groups including women, youth and PWD, to reduce risks and enhance safety,, 2) Reducing community tension through dialogue, common spaces and enhanced engagement of marginalized groups, 3) Mine-risk education and 4) legal awareness campaigns.</narrative>
