   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Child Protection Emergency Response for IDPs, refugees and host communities in Deir Ez Zor and Al Hasakeh-  North-Eastern Syria</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project will be implemented in two governorates of Dier ez zor and Al hasakeh (Al hole camp) focus on child protection services, prevention and mitigation of GBV and Risk Education for IDPS, refugees and host communities as specified in different locations. 
This project shall provide case management services to the most vulnerable children in need, including separated and unaccompanied children. It will also provide psycho-social support (PSS) for distressed children and their families to help them regain normalcy and improve welfare and well- being through  child-friendly spaces, mobile teams and community-based activities. This will also include self-learning and educational support in terms educational supplies to encourage mobilizing children-out-of-school to rejoin formal education. 
The project will also provide risk education for the population due to reported presence of explosive remnants of war (UXOs etc.). Another key component will be awareness raising on child-protection and providing information to prevent violence against children, particularly due to negative coping mechanisms such as child marriage, and child labor. Furthermore, the project will feature a capacity strengthening element to improve knowledge on providing child-friendly responses.
 Al-Hol camp currently hosting over 73,000 peoples of whom 65 per cent of the population are children, more than half of the camp population is under the age of 12, including 16,000 who are under the age of five years.  This population were exposed to extreme violence, both before leaving the ISIL-controlled areas or during hostilities and during the long dangerous journey to the Al hole camp. Both children and adults have psychological distress, possibly witnessed involuntary family separation, endured undignified conditions and lack of social support in the camp. This would require by providing support system to the newly arrivals   initial through provision of basic information, psychosocial first aid and later once settled in the camps provide them structured Psychosocial support interventions. The static child friendly spaces will be used in the camps and mobile teams will be used for host communities.  
In Al Hole camp, child protection concerns especially the issues of unaccompanied and separated children is high, and  registered 457 children   identified as unaccompanied or separated, while UNICEF registered 335  UASC of which 109 unaccompanied children remains in the two-interim care center in the camp. Restoration of family links remains one of the main gaps and dedicated mechanisms will be established to support families and children who are foster/temporary care arrangements and unaccompanied children will also be supported to reunify with their families whereas a more  complex cases requiring cross boarder FTR will need to be referred to other specialized actors such as ICRC for FTR efforts. 
There is need to expand the information desk  and CFS services to facilitate identification of person in need of care and support. There will be integration of gender-based violence and reproductive health services safe spaces for women and girls in collaboration with UNHCR in the camp level. This would facilitate reducing the risk of Gender based violence and other forms of violence against most vulnerable categories in the camp. Support community-based protection to provide some forms of services to population with specific needs with particular attention to women and girls, children in general, persons with disabilities. All these sensitivities needs to be addressed to provide required protection. 
There will be  expansion of  the information desk and CFS  services to facilitate identification of person in need of care and support. There will be integration of gender-based violence and reproductive health services safe spaces for women and girls in collaboration with UNHCR in the camp level.
UNICEF shall have three implementing partners for the project</narrative>
