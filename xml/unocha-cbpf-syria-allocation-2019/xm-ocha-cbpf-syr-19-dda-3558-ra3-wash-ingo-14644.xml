  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Close to nine years into the crisis, the scale, severity, and complexity of needs across Syria remain staggering. Of the three million people living in NES, 1.8 million are in need of humanitarian assistance, including over 900,000 in acute need. More than 710,000 of those living in the area are internally displaced. Turkey&#x2019;s military offensive which started on the 9th of October 2019 has both exacerbated those existing needs and created urgent new ones. More than 190,000 women, children and men are newly displaced, and damage to and closure of critical infrastructure has been reported, including health and water treatment facilities. As of 12th of November 2019, more than 74,000 people remain displaced, including from Al-Hassakeh (48,134), Ar-Raqqa (19,471) and Aleppo (6,776) governorates.
The already overstretched water sources of the region are now being exploited to meet the needs of the population. In addition, frequent breakdowns as a consequence of poor DoW capacity for maintenance, lack of funds for repairs, and limited human resources, are contributing to drastically reducing the water supplied (through both networks and water trucking). Support to maintain and repair water stations and wells are needed to minimize strain on existing supplies and ensure continuous access to safe water for populations. As consequence pf new displacements and the closure of camps in the buffer zone, new camps have been created and those already established have expanded to accommodate new arrivals. Providing essential assistance and services in new camps or camps that are expanding such as Newroz, Mahmoudli, Areesha and Abu Kashab is paramount to ensure continuation of basic services such as access to water and sanitation, particularly for women and children as the most affected. 
Taking into consideration the 3rd Reserve Allocation strategy and the needs identified in the field, the proposed intervention aims at ensuring continuity of basic WASH services in benefit of vulnerable conflict-affected communities and IDPs in Hassakeh and northern Deir Ez Zor. The main objective is to assist the newly displaced, particularly those in collective shelters and residing with host community members, and to maintain support in existing IDP camps, sites and settlements, as well as in the affected host communities. The project is designed with a two-pronged strategy that complements the provision of critical WASH services with medium/long term solutions through the maintenance and/or rehabilitation of key WASH systems. In particular, the project will:
-	Cover water trucking and de-sludging services in Abu Kashab IDP camp for the entire period of the project, in addition to solid waste management and latrine cleaning services for a period of 40 days, in benefit of 8,677 individuals
-	Provide water trucking services, including cleaning and maintenance of communal tanks, in two neighborhoods of Al Hassakeh city for a period of 2 months the water trucking will address the needs of 13,000 individuals among host community and IDPs hosted in shelters
-	Cover the needs for maintenance of water sources across the entire governorate of Hassakeh for a total of minimum 50 repairs completed benefitting approximately 75,000 beneficiaries
-	Replace old or broken pumps, including accessories, in at least 6 wells across the entire governorate of Hassakeh benefitting an estimated 21,000 beneficiaries
-	Rehabilitate Makhron water treatment station that serves 8,000 individuals.</narrative>
