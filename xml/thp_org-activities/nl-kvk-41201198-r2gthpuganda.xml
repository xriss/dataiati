      <narrative xml:lang="EN">Many nutrition policies  and interventions have been implemented in Uganda by the government under OPM and Ministry of Health, implementing partners, and other stakeholders but there is no robust monitoring and evaluation system for increased transparency and accountability of most of the activities and interventions under the nutrition policies.  The tracking Systems for material, financial and human resources when implementing nutrition policies are not sufficient. Furthermore, financing for nutrition was not well accepted hence was never well established. Generally, the budget transparency for nutrition interventions across sectors during nutrition policy implementation was low due to high levels of aggregation of budgets making information on nutrition-sensitive and specific expenditure scarce and difficult to track. Despite there being good nutrition policies that cover most of what needs to be done, there are gaps in skills and required competencies in the relevant departments of different ministries which impede the implementation of nutrition policies and targets for example in the ministry of finance implementing nutrition policies.</narrative>
