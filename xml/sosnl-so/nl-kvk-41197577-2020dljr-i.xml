   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Desert Locust Joint Response - Implementation SOS</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">&quot;Somalia is facing extreme food insecurity due to desert locust infestation, compounded persistent drought, an ongoing civil conflict and more recently, the Covid19 pandemic. According to the latest IPC Report, 250.000 people are/will be classified in IPC Phase 3&amp;4 in the desert locust affected areas of Somalia (April-June 2020). The Desert Locust Outbreak Needs Assessment - Somalia (March 2020) and assessments by SOS Somaliland (SOS SX) confirm the huge need for locust control tools and equipment, training and support, and food security and livelihood support for farmers and pastoralists as well as the most vulnerable members of the population. The spread of Covid19 poses significant challenges to an already weak health sector. Poor hygiene practices in the targeted areas are further increasing the risk of waterborne diseases and spreading Covid19, resulting in a complex crisis.

In line with current needs, SOS SX will intervene in Baki and Lughaya districts (Awdal) and Gabiley and Buluxar districts (Woqooyi Galbeed). The main interventions are mechanical control to mitigate further spread of the swarms, agricultural inputs to prepare for the next planting season, MPC and cash for work to enable access to basic needs and livelihoods recovery. SOS SX will contribute to the national efforts to tackle the locust crisis, by coordinating work with the Ministry of Agriculture&#x2019;s National Locust Taskforce. Prevention of COVID19 and other communicable diseases will be promoted by raising awareness on hygiene practices, combined with provision of appropriate hygiene kits. All activities will adhere to Covid19 regulations. Collaboration with DRA members is achieved through geographical complementarity and a multisectoral approach. With World Vision working on FSL in Gabiley, SOS SX will compliment with WASH in some of the target communities. With Oxfam working in Lugahya district, we are coordinating and selecting different villages to avoid overlap.
