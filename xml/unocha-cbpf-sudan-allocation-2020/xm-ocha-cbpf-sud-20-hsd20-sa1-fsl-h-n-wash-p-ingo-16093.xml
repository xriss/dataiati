   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project objective is to provide integrated Food Security amp Livelihoods (FSL), water, sanitation amp hygiene (WASH), Nutrition, Health and protection assistance to approximately 143,625 individuals.  These comprise 35405 men, 37355 women, 34015 boys and 36850 girls in North Kordofan State (NKS) within West Bara, Jabrat El Sheik and Um Dam localities. Recent improvements in security situation across western parts of the country and South Kordofan which borders NKS after disarmament campaigns and the good rainfall in 2019,  there are good opportunities for the targeted communities/ beneficiaries to restore lost livelihood due to economic deterioration in the country and political instability that have pushed more people below the poverty line. This integrated health, nutrition, WASH, and FSL approach aims to provide life-saving services for those most vulnerable populations in selected localities. The project will address the food and nutrition security and livelihoods of the targeted population through provision of productive agriculture and livestock inputs (seeds, tools, animal vaccination and treatment), income generation activities and skill development through trainings. The project is designed to come out with increased agricultural production, increased and diversified household income that improves the food security and livelihoods of targeted beneficiaries. The WASH component will increase affected peoples&apos; access to basic water, hygiene and sanitation services which will include increased awareness of hygiene and sanitation, at individual, household and community level, vector control activities will help mitigate the risk of vector born diseases. Such integrated services will contribute to alleviating the situation of women and girls who carry the burden of productive and reproductive roles, while enhancing their role in decision making in the community committees. Food insecurity often leads to malnutrition which is a particular risk factor for pregnant and lactating women (PLW) and children under five years old (CU5), because of their increased nutritional needs, hence the project will work with the targeted communities to improve their nutritional knowledge through trainings , campaigning MUAC screening and referral. The project will support essential healthcare package, including maternal, reproductive, and child health services for vulnerable people, particularly those living with disabilities, mental health and GBV survivor will be provided through equipping health centers, training and incentivizing health cadre and community health workers. The project also will contribute to early detection, preparedness and response to emergencies and public health threats. Besides this vulnerable groups especially women and girls and those with disabilities will be targeted through enhanced community based protection activities through upskilling community platforms to play effective role in addressing protection concerns of women, girls and children, children with special needs will be provide with assistive devices.

The project will be implemented by a consortium group consisting of Plan International Sudan (PIS) which is leading the consortium, Save the Children International (SCI) and AORD.  All consortium members have strong presence and footprint in North Kordofan and will play a key role in delivering integrated and well coordinated services in the target area.</narrative>
