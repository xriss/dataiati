   <narrative xml:lang="EN">IAS WASH-IWRM amp; COVID-19 Intervention: Transforming the Vulnerable Disabled into Able Responders in Leri and Alreef Alshargi, South Kordofan State</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Based on the need assessment and the leaving of many beneficiaries of Um Durein to Alreef Alshargi, IAS will implement this project in Elleri and Alreef Alshargi in south Kordufan, targeted (Kaiga Temairow, Albardab, Abusafeefa, Al-shaeir, Alremaila, Albukhas and Albajaaya) in Alreef Alshargi and (Jbeil Alezairig, Almatar, Alkhor Sharig, Tero, Um Goga, Tibsa, Alshug and Lono) in Alliri. There are overwhelming basic needs for most of the population as Ellirri has a number of refugees and Alreef Alshargi has a shortage in drinking water which lead to conflicts over water sources. this project targets 35,460 direct beneficiaries and approximately another 20,250 indirect beneficiaries of mainly destitute host community, returnees from conflict in emerging areas, and refugees. The main objective of this project is to contribute to saving and protecting lives (especially vulnerable children, women and people with disabilities), while increasing the resilience of protracted displacement groups through providing WASH, Sanitation and Hygiene services while mitigating the covid19 pandemic in Alliri and Alreef Alshargi localities, 
The interventions include the construction (with beneficiary participation) of four solar-powered mini water yards with added pipe extensions to serve potential livelihood needs as well as the schools and reproductive health centres in the area. current water points will be surveyed for highest water yields to support the MWYs. IAS will drill 5 new boreholes with 5 new hand pumps after surveying the region with the geologist, representatives of diverse backgrounds within communities will be consulted to ensure that chosen locations will not start conflicts between rival groups. 12 hand pump rehabilitations will be completed. piped water will serve 4 health centres and schools. 4 hand-washing units for schools and health centres made of strong tiga with taps and cooler and thermal bricks. IAS will construct four new 6 drop latrines for the health centres and schools. they will be gender sensitive and disability-friendly. all water and sanitation hard components are to provide safe water to be used by patients and staff of the health centres, schools, as well as the host communities.
 To improve sanitation and hygiene practices IAS will also provide sanitation and hygiene awareness and cross-cutting issues training to community committees who will then share with the remainder of targeted beneficiaries. each new or rehabilitated water point will be maintained and operated by water management committees (WMCs), 50% women who will also receive mechanic training to ensure operation and maintenance of water points. the project includes a cash-based incentive for purchasing tool repair kits to be used by the WMCs for maintaining water-points. People with disabilities will be involved by collecting water usage fees and monitoring and evaluating construction and training classes. more sanitation needs will be met by the beneficiary cantered community led total sanitation (CLTS) campaigns in 4 villages. 10 mass media campaigns will be conducted by girls, boys, women men and those with disabilities in an effort to advocate and inform communities about the looming covid19 pandemic threat using hundreds of IEC materials.
throughout the project, integrated water resource management (long term water for all sectors of society including water economics and conservation) will be advocated so that durable solutions, resilience, and sustainability will become a reality.</narrative>
