   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Protection and WASH Response for White Nile Refugee Camps (PWR)</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">White Nile State (WNS) currently hosts 253, 847 South Sudanese Refugees (SSR) (UNHCR March 2020). As of March 2020, 172,309 SSR individuals are registered in 9 refugee sites. UNHCR and Commissioner of Refugees (COR) are currently working on the development of 5 camp extensions. Despite no clear timeframe, UNHCR has announced that Aljamia will host 5,000 HH relocated from Khor Alwarel, and Alkashafa and Um Sangour extensions will soon start to receive new arrival. An unknown number of SSR live in the neighbouring host communities. In 2020, UNHCR estimates the arrival of 64,793 new SSR in WNS. Women and children constitute 56% and 70% respectively of the total population. Elderly people represents almost 3% of the population. Currently, there are no data about the number of people with disabilities. Arrival numbers show a regular increase linked to continued instability, fighting and food insecurity in South Sudan. Existing camps have largely exceeded their hosting capacity and they are not able to meet the growing population needs. Despite positive improvements, the overall response of both local and international actors has not been able to keep up with the increasing population and their needs. This is particularly evident in the WASH sector where needs and gaps remain very high. Limited availability of adequate WASH facilities (latrines, handwashing facilities, water distribution points), poor access to safe and clean water, limited availability and use of soap for proper handwashing practices and widespread open defecation remain a significant concern. WASH statistics show that none of the camp meets SPHERE standard. Concerning appropriate and adequate sanitation facilities, recent data show an average of 49 people/functioning latrine which is more than double the SPHERE Standards of 20 persons/latrine (UNHCR, Dec 2017). Women and girls are reported to be disproportionately affected by the existing gaps in WASH facilities. They represent the highest percentage of the refugee population and they have the primary responsibility when it comes to taking care of the household and household members including fetching water for drinking, cooking, cleaning and hygiene/bathing. Some of the existing WASH facilities are in unsafe, distant and dark areas thereby increasing security threats and exposure to risks for their users. ADRA registered a very low number of disabled children attending schools (less than 1% of the total students), lack of appropriate WASH infrastructure might be one of the factor that discourage children with disabilities to attend schools. WASH Technical Working Group has recently developed a new approach for latrine construction that will be used in the camps extension which aims at transitioning from communal to family latrines. Some funds for their construction have been so far secured by UNHCR, but the gap remains huge. In WNS, there is a strong need to strengthen coordination in among the actors working in the SSR response and particularly in WASH to make sure that existing needs are met with no delays and duplication. ADRA aims at providing a total of 3900 individuals in Jamya, Dabat Bosin and Al-Redais 2 camps with improved sanitation facilities, ensuring that 50 of the latrines are inclusive and support the needs of disabled populations. Latrines will be designed and constructed through community training and engagement through cash for work, serving a duel approach. The project will also enhance hygiene information through community-based awareness delivered to 10,000 individuals. The project will also integrate Protection training as one of the components tied to WASH, through the training of Water Committees as protection networks to screen and refer protection cases within the camps and targeted HC. ADRA will also target 20% host communities in Al-Jamya, Dabat Bosin and Al-Redais villages in Alsalam and Aljabaleen locality.</narrative>
