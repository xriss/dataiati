  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">A protection assessment conducted in October showed that water remains the main challenge of IDPs and Arab nomads in Sortony area. Escalation of intercommunal conflict, withdrawal of key WASH partners from the area, and breakdown of the Kobe main water supply scheme in the area further exacerbate the challenges of water. Aside from the damage to the pipe system, the generators that run the water point are either broken or difficult for the local community (or IDP leaders) to run due to the cost of diesel needed to operate it. These challenges put 80% of the population in the area at the risk of extreme water scarcity. Other options including harvesting of surface
water and boreholes are not able to provide the recommended quantity of water per household for the entire population of the area. If the problem with the pipes ok Kobe water point is not solved, there will be overcrowding during the dry season, further increasing tension and even conflict between the IDPs and the Arab nomads. To avoid this, some IDPs will move to further to Samra, a borehole located 7km from the IDP gathering, exposing them to more security risks and tensions with the Arab nomads who live in the area. This will result in even less water per household as they try to ration the little water that they will get. Therefore, this project intends to rehabilitate 2 existing water schemes (from Kupi water storage to Sortony village and from Sortony water storage tank to School and Child Center) and to carry out operation and maintenance services for the 5 existing schemes. Provision of refresher training to the 5 scheme water Chlorinators, to the operators on Operation and Maintenance and to the hand pump mechanics.
600 HH will be supported in the construction of their family latrine.
In order to mitigate water-related conflicts among the communities, COOPI will conduct ToT training on mediation, negotiations, and conflict resolution skills for reconstituted village water management committee (VWMC) plus 25 selected members of the community (Women, Youth, Local leaders and Intellectuals, Farmers and Pastoralists, IDPs and Arabic Nomads).

On the other hand, this project is integrated in the framework of the recent flood response in Kabkabiya (shelter and NFI distribution) helping to address the longer-term needs of the affected population by rehabilitating water points and rebuilding the shelter of most affected. Meanwhile, in Sortony, the project will help address an acute scarcity of water while putting in place mechanisms to identify and manage water-related conflicts thus ensuring peaceful coexistence among different community and livelihoods groups. The project shall improve access to safe and clean drinking water to 45,881 people living in the communities of Kabkabiya and Sortony and rebuild the shelter of 3,600 flood-affected people in Kabkabiya town and Rural areas addressing the needs of IDPs, returnees, host communities, and Refugees. In Kabkabiya, COOPI intends to rehabilitate 1 Water yard, including a detailed water sources technical assessment, water quality analysis, pump/recovery test, and provide training to the VWMCs on operation amp maintenance of the rehabilitated water scheme. In addition, hygiene and sanitation activities will be conducted such as hygiene promotion campaigns and triggering communities on CLTS approach targeting 600 HH. COOPI will conduct Pre and Post WASH KAP survey.
Procurement of WASH NFI and Hygiene Kits for emergency response is also included in this proposal. In Kabkabiya 600 HH, selected among the most vulnerable and worst affected by floods will be supported with CVA for the reconstruction of their shelter (transfer value to be determined after market assessment. COOPI will provide technical guidance on safe shelter during the construction phase extending to communities messages on &#x201C;build back better&#x201D; to reduce the risk of future collapse.</narrative>
