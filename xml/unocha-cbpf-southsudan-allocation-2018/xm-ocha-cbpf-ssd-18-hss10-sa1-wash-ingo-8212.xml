   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Life-saving WASH support and preparedness for vulnerable IDPs and host and return communities affected by violence and at risk of Cholera in Budi County of Eastern Equatoria State</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">INTERSOS will provide lifesaving WASH support in response to the specific needs of IDPs, Host and return Communities, children, women and vulnerable groups in Budi county of Eastern Equatoria State who are affected by conflict and recent cholera outbreak and still at risk of cholera.

INTERSOS will carefully consider the specific needs, concerns and priorities of women and girls, men and boys of different ages and disparities such as disabilities in its response, incorporating protection principles during implementation.

INTERSOS will cover Budi county mainly focus on corridor between Imatong to Chukudum payams uncovered by existing partners. Following a triangulating security and access-related information available in Kapoeta and Torit (consultation with IOM and INTERSOS team based as SFP for S/NFIs Cluster) INTERSOS is confident that the proposed locations are accessible for assistance, and therefore lifesaving WASH intervention can be achieved. 

Considering additional WASH needs and large rural areas in Budi, INTERSOS has identified areas in Budi, most especially Chukudum and Imatong through its staff implementing Child Protection project financed by UNICEF and currently based in Budi County. This project will therefore fully complement the Child Protection project that INTERSOS is currently implementing in Budi County.
 
INTERSOS would like to expand its lifesaving WASH activities to populations recently affected by cholera in Budi hence, this SSHF funding is crucial for further delivery of WASH services most especially to areas affected by cholera in Budi County like Chukudum and Imatong Payams.

INTERSOS will maintain flexibility to change target locations, in case of cholera outbreaks or any developments in security situation and/or access constraints.

Considering WASH Cluster&#x2019;s recommendations and feasibility, INTERSOS will ensure usage of the following lifesaving WASH activities as an integrated WASH package to respond to cholera and New displacement WASH needs including:

Water Supply: Water supply will include borehole rehabilitation/repair, hand pump mechanics training and establishment of Water Sources management committees for the rehabilitated/ repaired water sources with availability of basic spares. 
Sanitation: Sanitation services will include strong awareness campaign on hygiene and Sanitation and social mobilization towards construction of household&#x2019;s latrines in communities.

WASH NFIs distribution: provision of WASH NFIs (aqua tabs/PUR, soaps, Jerry cans, buckets, MHM kits) for vulnerable groups affected by the conflict and still at risk of cholera

Hygiene Promotion: Focusing on areas with active transmission of cholera, INTERSOS will work closely with community hygiene promoters to organize sessions on hygiene promotion, such as usage of house hold water treatment, hand washing and prevention of diarrheal diseases with special focus on prevention of Waterborne diseases. Hygiene promotion activities will continue with more focus on promotional and demonstration activities like correct usage and maintenance of latrines, safe water chain, households&#x2019; visits. 

INTERSOS will target communities living in in areas affected by Cholera and at risk of WASH related epidemics. In addition, key local leaders (heads of village, traditional leaders) will be encouraged to participate to the sessions and help mobilizing the population. 

School WASH activities: INTERSOS will provide technical support to education and Health partners, by establishing and providing training of school WASH and Nutrition clubs, conducting awareness sessions through child2child approach to spread hygiene messages and provide technical assistance to WASH and Nutrition club members in the implementation of School WASH and Nutrition activities through intensive training and provision of booklets containing relevant information on school hygiene and sanitation.</narrative>
