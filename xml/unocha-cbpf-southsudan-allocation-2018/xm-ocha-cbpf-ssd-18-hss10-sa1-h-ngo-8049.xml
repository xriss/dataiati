   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Increasing access to essential life saving emergency clinical health care services packages to vulenerable populations, IDPs, returnees and conflict affected communities in Mayendit, Leer and Panyijiar (Nyal) counties of the former Unity state.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project is aimed to maintain the delivery of the emergency primary health care services, treatment of SAM with complication and scale up of mobile teams and RRMs responses in Mayendit, Leer and Payinjiar counties in former Unity state and to enhance access to life-saving health services at the IDPs and the host communities. These two counties apart from Payinjar county are much devastated by the conflict and have always remain volatile for the last 4 years in terms of lost to human lives, destruction and looting of the health infrastructures and the livelihood of the inhabitants also severely ruined. People have continuously been forced out from their homes and hence could not access the health care services at the facilities since huge population resort to living in the islands for their safety and comfort. The data on the HNO for 2017 released earlier in the year by UNOCHA estimated the number of IDPs in Unity to be at 463,736. Over 5million people in the country need humanitarian assistant in a situation where the proportion of clinicians per patients is estimated at only 1doctor per 65,000 patients. And based on the population projection data released by NBS in the Jan 2017, the population of these 3counties is at 282,124. 
IPC in May 2017 reported 6.0million people (50% of the population) in the country are expected to be severely food insecure in June-July 2017 compared to 5.5million (45% of the population) in May 2017.  Koch, Mayendit, Leer and Panyijiar are population in crisis although the declared famine has been lifted the two counties (Leer and Mayendit) are still under emergency humanitarian situation.
A SMART Survey conducted by UNIDO in Nov 2017 reported GAM rate at 17.9% and SAM at 3.5% in Mayendit county, while in a reference made to SCF SMART Survey conduct in April 2017 shows a prevalence of malnutrition rates among children in Leer county is high &#x2013; estimated GAM prevalence of 20.1% (15.6-25.5 95% C.I.) and SAM of prevalence of 5.0% (3.2- 7.7 95% C.I.) based on weight-for-height/WFH z-score this is alarming and classified as &#x2018;Critical&#x2019;.
 Therefore the plan in the provision of these emergency primary health care services shall include the OPD curative consultation at  6 mobile sites and 6 PHCUs that requires more capacity support (Meer island, Tuochriak island, Tuochnhialchang  island,  Dongol, Rupnor, Dhorleak mobile sites and Bow, Dindin, Pabuong, Dablual, Duong and Majak PHCs), therefore a 6 mobile teams will be establish for the mobile health care services and response to Acute Watery Diarrheoa/cholera and other  diseases outbreaks in the islands and hard to reach areas in Leer and Mayendit Counties. Because it is worth mentioning that measles suspected case was identified by partners in Tuochriak island of Leer county last month. The project will support two stabilization centers i.e. Mayendit PHCC and Rupkuay PHCC to treat SAM cases with medical complications. UNIDO has been and will still be part of RRMs team with its existing teams which were established and participated in last year (2017) RRMs in Leer and Mayendit Counties. We will support the health promotion activities through health education sessions and ensure the availability of the preventive measures specially the routine immunization (EPI) services at the facilities and the outreaches and UNIDO is already at the advance stages in the establishment of cold chain system in Leer TPA in partnership with UNICEF, WHO and MOH. We will also support the psychosocial and basic mental health services through updating/on-job trainings the clinicians on clinical management of sexual violence protocols to deliver the First aids such as protection and care for the survivors.  And also with this project UNIDO will support the response to disease Outbreaks such as Cholera and Measles as we did in 2016 in Mayendit county, Leer highlands and Nyal. We will ensure that the hygiene promotion activities are conducted in collaboration with the WASH.</narrative>
