   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Provision of emergency health services to IDPs and host communities in Tambura</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Through the South Sudan Humanitarian Fund (SSHF) second standard allocation, World Vision South Sudan (WVSS) will provide emergency life-saving primary healthcare in 2 PHCUs and 3 mobile clinic units which will target 19,408 (men: 7,513, women: 7,819 , boys: 1,997, girls: 2,079) internally displaced persons and 6,365 (men: 2,464, women: 2,564 , boys: 655, girls: 682) beneficiaries from the host community. The project aims to provide critical lifesaving health interventions to the most vulnerable particularly women and children among the IDPs and host communities in Tambura County through provision of primary healthcare services at 2 PHCUs (Mabia and Gamnakpe PHCUs) and through provision of 3 mobile integrated outreaches to the IDPs site in Mabia IDP camp, Namutina and Duma. 

The 2 PHCUs and 3 mobile clinics will offer a package of lifesaving health interventions including diagnosis and management of common illnesses, normal deliveries, family planning, routine immunizations, and health awareness campaigns. According to the March 2018 MOH EPI administrative coverage report, Tambura and Yambio had very low routine immunization coverage which was as follows: Penta 3 (6% Nagero and 21% Tambura), Measles ( Nagero 4% and Tambura 14%) and BCG ( Nagero 5% and Tambura 31%). By June 30, the DPT3 coverage was at 54% which is far below the recommended target of 80%. Nagero County is among the counties with the lowest immunization coverage according to 2017 EPI performance report. Because of this poor immunization coverage, this project will ensure that routine immunizations target the IDPs and the host community in Tambura and Namutina. 

Due to conflict in Nagero and subsequent displacement, this project will respond to humanitarian needs and the health gaps that have emerged and can&#x2019;t be covered under the health pooled fund project that is currently being implemented by World Vision in Tambura under Lot 22. WVSS will work in collaboration with the core pipeline managers (WHO, UNICEF, UNFPA) to ensure that essential medicines and reproductive health commodities are secured and delivered to the health sites, and ensure that the cold chain is efficiently maintained. This project will build the capacity of staff in disease surveillance, CMR and also on infection prevention and control.

In addition, the project will strengthen and use the already existing structures such as home health promoters, Boma village health committees, community nutrition volunteers, mother to mother support groups (MTMSG), men and women champion groups to deliver health education messages on health promotion and diseases prevention among IDPs and the host communities. 

This project will ensure that the health response is integrated with WASH and nutrition interventions. This will be done by ensuring that the beneficiaries have access to sanitation and water supplies at the 2 PHCUs and 3 mobile clinics supported with the SSHFSA2,. WVSS will ensure that cases identifies with SAM and MAM in the health facilities and mobile clinic units are referred to OTP/TSFP sites and those with complicated SAM will be referred to the stabilization centers. 

WVSS will complement the ongoing funding of Health Pooled Fund (HPF) that focuses on health system strengthening with an emphasis on maternal child health and nutrition which is currently being implemented in Tambura and Nagero (Namutina Payam). 80% of the South Sudan humanitarian fund will be used in the provision of lifesaving health services in Tambura county while 20% of the fund will be used for the same purpose in Namutina payam. WVSS will work in collaboration with the MoH staff and HPF supported health workers and community health volunteers to provide quality health services. This project also will strengthen the technical capacity of health workers.

This proposed project will be implemented by World Vision South Sudan with the support of World Vision Taiwan.</narrative>
