   <narrative xml:lang="EN">A Static life Saving Programme to Vulnerable children and families in prioritized counties to enable them rebuild their capacities to cope with significant threats to their lives</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">MTT proposes to implement life-saving Child Protection activities in Juba County (within the former Central Equatoria state). Since the outbreak of the conflict in December 2013, children continue to bear the heaviest brunt in the prolonged and violent conflict in South Sudan. They have been abducted, maimed and killed surviving ones often exposed to rape and sexual violence, as well as recruited and used for different purposes by armed forces and groups. As reported in the CPSG Strategic Response Plan 2018, approximately, 1 million children are believed to require psychosocial support with increasingly negative coping mechanisms often observed among children who have been displaced for several years and still continue to encounter the same or similar situations. This programme intends to address the following child protection concerns: 
Family separation and unaccompanied and separated children: Displacement and conflict have resulted in high levels of family separation. Even intends to continue and improve on their current case load of over 137 unaccompanied, separated, and missing children, with 64 girls and 73 boys. These children are extremely vulnerable to all kind of violence, exploitation and abuse and require individual case management, alternative care solutions and support to be reunified with their families or primary caregivers. In this programme, MTT will identify, monitor and report urgent child protection concerns (grave violations separated or unaccompanied children etc.) as well as refer affected children to necessary services such as emergency healthcare, identification, documentation and immediate tracing of unaccompanied minors, emergency alternative care for unaccompanied children, and provision of Psychological First Aid (PFA)/ Psychosocial Support (PSS), risk mitigation, coordination and advocacy.
Psychological Distress: The conflict has severely affected the psychosocial wellbeing and mental health of children with some witnessing killings, destructions of homes, and losses of families and friends. Additionally, they and their caregivers daily experience difficulties in accessing food, water, education, livelihoods and recreation.  In this programme, MTT will administer psychosocial support to vulnerable children&#x2014;including Psychological First Aid as well as other forms of non-formal psychosocial support. We will establish at least one Child Friendly Space (CFS) to be centers of operation. 
 Exploitation: Conflict-affected and displaced children are at risk of becoming involved in the worst forms of child labour, including child trafficking, hazardous work and begging in the streets. MTT will increase the level of protection and care for children by training foster caregivers within the CFSs. This is especially necessary since children outside of parental care are more at risk of exploitation. Even as we increase the capacity of communities to identify, report, and refer children with urgent child protection concerns, we will strengthen and establish community-based child protection mechanisms, and raise awareness about existing referral pathways.
Gender Considerations: The project considers gender and age in planning and implementation. Boys and girls and those with special needs are targeted. Women and men are duly represented in all decision-making organs with to ensure maximum input from all groups. They will be encouraged to participate in every component of the project with the dynamics of the gender roles in mind. In collaboration with education and health clusters, we will emphasize the need for girl-child education provision of dignity kits to them. Feedback mechanisms will be embedded for project flexibility. One or more nearby primary schools will be identified as partners with whom a number of activities will be planned. The programme will abide by the &quot;do no harm&quot; principle.</narrative>
