   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Emergency health action for children under 5yrs through provision of ICCM by community health front line workers in Akobo County</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Save the Children aims to deliver emergency health action through a community health intervention project focusing on childhood illness and working with community health front line workers in the hot spot county of Akobo county, Jonglei state. The overall objective of this project is to contribute to the reduction of  morbidity and mortality caused by malaria, diarrhea, pneumonia and underlying malnutrition among under 5yrs children in Akobo county, Jonglei state.

The emergency project will be effective from 20th March 2018 to September 20th, 2018 total of 20,000 (15805 direct and 4195 indirect) beneficiaries will be addressed both directly amp indirectly with emergency lifesaving community health intervention to childhood illness such as malaria, pneumonia, diarrhea and malnutrition among children under 5yrs of age. 
The project will be implemented from the Save the Children field office in Akobo County and the proposed activities will complement other existing health, nutrition services in the county. Save the Children has experience in Integrated Community Case Management (ICCM) implementation in the Akobo county. With the recent  influx of IDPS  from neighboring counties of Nyirol the need for access to community health has increased, and  Save the Children will ensure that the provision of ICCM services  meet the needs of the most vulnerable children, will coordinate to ensure no duplication of services. There will be a focus on hardest to reach areas where services are not available. 

Community based management of malaria, pneumonia, diarrhea and malnutrition is an ideal lifesaving approach in emergency contexts as it helps to increase access to those areas and community groups not reached through the fixed health facilities and traditional health services, as well as an opportunity to promote key preventive health messages. 

The Rapid Response Mechanism (RRM) Strategy shall be employed to seal the gap in hard to reach areas in Akobo county. In this proposed project, Save the Children will use the existing RRM team to reach hard to reach areas and provide them with health services such as health education and promotion. 

The community based distributers (CBDs) will be provided with  refresher  training  by the CBD supervisors to allow them to build skills to identify, assess, classify and treat  children under 5, for  malaria, pneumonia and diarrhea  and screening for malnutrition with  referral of high risk cases  with  dangers signs to the nearest health facilities, pre identified. The proposed emergency iCCM project will be aligned with Boma Health initiative for comprehensive coverage of health services to wider population.

A total of 80 CBD and 4 CBD supervisors will part of the project implementation to ensure that front line services are offered to the vulnerable community in Akobo County.
This project will have two main objectives:
	Objective 1:  Improve access o essential healthcare for the  vulnerable populations by provision of quality services
	Objective 2:  Promotion of  health education, and maternal, infant and young child nutrition, (MIYCN)  messages through community volunteers and  strengthening quality and accountability to affected population</narrative>
