  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">INTERSOS will provide lifesaving shelter and NFIs in response to specific needs of 15,000 (13,043 will benefit from pipeline S/NFI distribution, and 1,965 served through Cash transfer Programming (CTP)). IDPs, returnees and conflict affected populations assessed and verified as most in need will be targeted in the counties of Nyirol, Pibor and Uror (Jonglei state), Tambura, Ezo, and Nzara, (Western Equatoria State) with Mobile front line services, Bor South, Torit and Magwi counties will be reached through static response CTP. 
The proposed project is a continuation of the ongoing SSHF standard allocation 1 (2018) Emergency Shelter and NFIs project ending 30/09/2018. INTERSOS considers carefully targeting populations who are in need of life saving NFIs and Emergency Shelter. INTERSOS will also consider the specific needs, concerns and priorities of women and girls, men and boys of different ages and disparities such as disabilities in its response, mainstreaming protection throughout the project cycle.  

As a short-term intervention, the impact on the population and the contextual dynamics is sensitive and delicate balances are at play, for this reason the team will ensure that all accountability processes to the affected population are carefully followed. The intervention must be clearly defined and protection concerns taken into consideration so that distribution respects community dynamics, does no harm and is done in a dignified meaningful way. Contextual feedback mechanisms will be established in line with the distribution method and the location dynamics.

Beneficiaries will be identified using approved South Sudan SNFIs cluster criteria of selection. In addition, INTERSOS will endeavor to give priority to child headed household, women, persons with disability, the elderly and other vulnerable people in the community who will benefit from Emergency Shelter and NFI distribution. 

Currently, the counties of Nyirol, Pibor, Uror Tambura, Ezo, Nzara, Bor South, Torit and Magwi need emergency shelter and NFIs assistance due to dire needs, where their fulfillment is crucial in saving lives Magwi and Torit are also in need of Emergency Shelter and NFIs assistance here the proposed project intends to deliver this assistance through CTP. INTERSOS assessments conducted in Magwi in June 2018 revealed that there are over 7,000 returnees who had moved into the area since September 2017. Many more are still returning on a daily basis. The assessment also revealed that the local market in and around Magwi are functioning and able to meet demand, making cash transfers an appropriate and powerful alternative to direct distributions of non-food items in the area. 200 beneficiaries will be served through restricted voucher support, whereas 765 will be served through direct cash transfers. This CTP intervention will enable most vulnerable groups such as unaccompanied elders, persons with disabilities, pregnant and lactating women and child headed families to receive Shelter/NFIs support as per their needs identified through need assessment. 

Project team will also comprise of Cash Transfer officer who will lead implementation and monitoring of cash Transfer programming activities in the proposed locations. INTERSOS has already piloted and implemented CTP programs in Torit, Bor and Kapoeta South where a combined 800 Households of more than 4,900 individuals have been served. 

INTERSOS intends to build on experience gained in the implementation of these CTP activities. In the proposed project, 1,197 people are targeted for CTP. INTERSOS proposes to use a mix of vouchers and direct cash transfer for the selected beneficiaries in order to meet the varying needs of the beneficiaries.</narrative>
