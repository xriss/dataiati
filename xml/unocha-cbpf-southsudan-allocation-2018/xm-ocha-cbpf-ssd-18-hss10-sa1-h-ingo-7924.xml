  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">These activities will provide lifesaving interventions through curative health services with mobile outreach clinical services to a total of 7,083 pastoralist communities who are scattered in the villages in hard to reach areas within Kapoeta East. We will also render services to 2,714 children of under five years of age and a total of 4,489 host community individuals. Special attention will be given to expansion of integrated community case management (iCCM) programs in Kapoeta East where the current scope only covers two Payams i.e. Narus and Katodori. We will also support community health workers and home health promoters in conducting health promotion, mobilization and preventive activities.

Due to the nomadic lifestyle of the pastoralist community and the vastness of KE with many host community living far from health facilities, suffice to the limited access to healthcare increases vulnerability of children to malaria, acute respiratory infections and diarheal diseases. iCCM interventions will aim at alleviating this by supporting CBDs to offer this service to the target population which is pastoralists and host communities with poor access to facilities.

Recent needs assessments conducted in Kapoeta have shown high levels of vulnerability and poor access to essential health care for targeted populations, The interventions selected are those that are therefore most effective in preventing and reducing excess morbidity and mortality from communicable diseases (CD) and non-communicable diseases (NCD) and include emergency responses in the following key areas 
1. Provision of lifesaving curative services, 
2. Child health, 
3. Sexual and reproductive health including for women affected by SGBV, 
4. Health care awareness and promotion.

We will have a mobile team comprising of a Clinical Officer, a nurse, a midwife, HHP and an EPI vaccinator to ensure we offer holistic services as much as possible. The mobile clinics will target entire communities and settlements visited with basic preventative and curative care, in order to meet needs of isolated and mobile populations who have limited access to health care. Access to mobile health clinics will be based on principles of equity and impartiality, ensuring equal access according to need without discrimination. Given the precarious security situation across the region coupled with their nomadic way of life, mobile clinics are the best to ensure access and coverage in those hard to reach areas.

Health education awareness campaigns undertaken by the Health and hygiene promoters at community level and during the mobile clinic operations will aim to target all the populations attending clinic sessions. Although the intervention will provide general coverage, mobile clinic services will focus on specific needs of vulnerable groups identified as particularly at risk. For example, measles vaccination coverage is known to be of low coverage and ARC will thus provide vaccination services during its clinics days specifically for children aged 6 months - 15 years, and administration of Vitamin A to children aged 6-59 months. 

For visibly pregnant women, clean delivery kits will be made available for clean home deliveries when access to skilled health providers is not possible. ARC skilled staff will also integrate SGBV services to the existing health program outreach package offered, and aim to identify women in need of SGBV assistance with utmost care and confidentiality. Such women may then be referred for further management when necessary to a hospital or PHCC with CMR services.

ARC will used in kind donations from the cluster Core pipelines. For instance, primary health care drugs (PHCU kits) will be provided via the NMoH avenues of with HPF support, UNICEF will support with iCCM drugs  for treatment of Malaria, diarrhea and ARI. UNFPA will be approached to provide the much needed clean delivery kits.</narrative>
