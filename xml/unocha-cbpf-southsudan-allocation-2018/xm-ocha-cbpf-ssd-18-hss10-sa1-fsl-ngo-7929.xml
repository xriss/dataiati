   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Integrated lifesaving support and capacity building project for the most vulnerable through provision of crop and vegetable seeds, farming tools, fishing equipment and training for 7100 households in Nyirol County</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This is an integrated program to support the most vulnerable households in Nyirol County (Classified in IPC 3amp4 in the recent January-March Projections). The project envisages to support 7,100 households (42000 beneficiaries) 21300 women, 4260 girls,  12780 men and 4260 boys practicing agriculture and fishing with Crop and vegetable seeds and farming tools (Malodas, rakes and Hoes) and fishing equipment. 
CAFAD will liaise with FAO the FSL pipeline manager for the availability of the above inputs and transport them (within three days upon notification as per FAO SOP in relation to release orders) from Juba warehouse to Bor for further shipment to the distribution points in Nyirol by the logistic cluster. 
For the purpose of project inception, CAFAD shall mobilize and sensitize the communities at County, Boma and payam level through their representatives women leaders, youth, payam administrators, commissioners and RRC to determine identification and beneficiary selection. Consultative meetings shall be carried out during inception, implementation and exit points of the project and reports submitted to relevant stakeholders. 
In collaboration with local authorities (RRC, payam administrators, boma heads) OCHA, FAO and other stakeholders CAFAD will identify and register the most vulnerable households in all the payams in Nyirol County in a format to be agreed between CAFAD and the local authorities and submitted to FSL secretariat and FAO for approval. Assistance shall be targeted in particular towards those displaced (50% of total beneficiaries) and have not been absorbed to the host community and those congregating in rural areas. Assistance will also be provided to the host communities (30%of the total beneficiaries) receiving those displaced.
During distribution, CAFAD shall provide technical information and guidance to the beneficiaries on best use of agriculture and fishing kits being distributed. This will cover handling of inputs provided with support of visual aids and captions with instructions. Also  good agronomic practices, seed production and preservation techniques, post-harvest processing and store management, family nutrition with special emphasis on food preparation, processing amp utilization will be covered in the trainings. Fisher folks will also be targeted for training on basic fishing and fish handling techniques that will be integrated with hygiene promotion WASH activities. 
The timeliness of delivery of these inputs to the beneficiaries is critical, with the setting of the rains. Furthermore, the provision of such inputs is key to increasing self-sufficiency among at target populations and decreasing their dependence on food aid (Which stands at 20% in Jonglei and its the highest in the Country FSNMS round 20), borrowing and selling of their assets.
CAFAD is committed to provide quality, accountable and dignified assistance captured under our profile with commitments which takes into account of the needs and aspirations of children, women men, people living with HIV/AIDS and chronic diseases.  This embraces the commitments on the Accountability to the Affected Populations (AAP) as to have transparent, fair representation, collaboration with peers and partners, prevent and respond to sexual exploitation and abuse (SEA) by our staff during our interventions.</narrative>
