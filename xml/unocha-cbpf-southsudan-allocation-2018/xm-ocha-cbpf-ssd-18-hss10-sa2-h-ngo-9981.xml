   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Increasing access and strengthening capacities of PHC to provide emergency lifesaving health care services in Maiwut county through the provision of  1 PHCU and 2 mobile teams</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The year 2018 will see SSHF responds to deteriorating Health situation that resulted from multiple displacements and has compounded the Health needs of an already vulnerable population across the country. Conflict and economic crisis have taken a toll on health in South Sudan. Disease outbreaks have lasted longer than ever and reached previously unaffected areas, weakening already vulnerable people&#x2019;s ability to cope with multiple shocks (UNOCHA 2018). In 2017, South Sudan has seen the longest-running cholera outbreak in its history, which began in June 2016 and is expected to continue into 2018. Destruction of health-care facilities, attacks on health workers, and shortages of drugs and skilled professionals mean access to health care is increasingly sparse. Preventable diseases like measles spread unchecked, and cases of kala-azar and meningitis are on the rise. With only 22 per cent of health facilities fully operational, the absence of services means that cases of emergency obstetric care, tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS and mental health issues go largely untreated, causing increased mortality and morbidity. 

Maiwut County is one of the counties that has been disrupted by the current civil war. The violence that erupted in December 2013 disrupted health system, farming cycle and livelihood of most people in the county. A county of over 116,244 people was seen deserted with over 280,000 individuals crossed to Ethiopia. This made the international NGO running the health services in the county to evacuate leaving the provision of health services in the hand of the CHD and some National NGO with weak capacity, and they are supporting only 2 PHCUs, that can&#x2019;t provide adequate services to the displaced and the returnees&#x2019; population in the county. 

The beneficiaries of this project are mainly the vulnerable population both host community and IDPS in Maiwut county. The project targets 12,886 individuals in Maiwut County.

The planned emergency response aims at ensuring access to essential life-saving services to targeted IDPs and vulnerable host communities through 1 PHCU and 2 Mobile teams, which is in line with the Cluster objectives. It stems from the needs, justification and findings of assessments and reports that explains the level of conflict and health risk exposure and the needs of vulnerable groups in Maiwut County.

Being a national organization, CASS has a better understanding of the local context as well as the capacity to provide the most critical services during emergencies even within limited humanitarian corridor where international agencies cannot operate. CASS hopes by doing so, will build resilience capacity of the population to cop during emergencies. Besides CASS is already implementing in the same areas and it will just be a continuation of the services.</narrative>
