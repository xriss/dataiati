   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Providing educational support and mentoring to affected youth in Malakla and Bentiu to promote their well-being and quality of education</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">INTERSOS proposes viable project that respond to the prevailing issues affecting youth in most complicated emergency zones &#x2013; using its past experiences in emergency. Young people in South Sudan exist in a precarious state. For many youth, educational attainment is abysmally low and economic participation is weak and inconsistent. As young people are the majority of the population, they are at the forefront of their country&#x2019;s violent political struggles. This project will create learning opportunities for the affected youth &#x2013; aged between 15-30 years through establishing quality ALP (Alternative Learning Programme) for the youth. The ALP will be along established drop-in-centers aimed to provide various youth services that response to their social needs.

The project will provide youth services that meet their social needs through the establishment of drop-in-center. INTERSOS will identify functional and enabling Drop-in-centers for the youth in Bentiu and Malakal. The youth will access in these Drop-in-Centers variety of youth services including: 
	Educational Support &#x2013; the drop-in-center will provide educational awareness for the youth and also make referral for the youth to the established ALP (Accelerated Learning Program) centers.
	Reading materials &#x2013; both lifesaving messages and story books for leisure and educational gaining,
	Peer support &#x2013; the youth will receive 2 hours lectures on different topics (health, security, education, etc) from professional experts (NGOs partners and community at large). This is aimed to empower the peer educators. The peer educators who benefit from this lecturing in the drop-in-centers will organize youth-led awareness where they educate the public including other youths inside and outside the PoCs on various topics including health hazards, peacebuilding, education, GBV, etc.
	Providing recreational activities including sports (football and volley ball games) and indoor games (playing cards, ladu, chess, and dubnos) for the youth inside and outside the PoCs in Bentiu and Malakal, 
	Case management - youth receiving drop in counseling from NGO partners working in protection, health, and etc. INTERSOS will use willing experts to support the drop-in-counseling for the youth with social issues. Among the activities are youth counselling, educating them, and referring them to other functional institutions in the PoCs and outside the PoCs.
	The drop-in-center will also provide youth space to refresh themselves. Such friendly environment will provide the youth an opportunity to interact and learn from each.
       Creative arts - 120 youth will be trained on art of decorations such as making bed, bed sheet and table sheet decorations, etc

The youth will receive quality literacy and numeracy learning opportunities where they receive regular classes supported by qualified teachers who are incentivized. Furthermore, the ALP (Accelerated Learning Program) will receive teaching and learning material support that enhance the quality of the teaching and learning activities. The ALP teachers will receive comprehensive literacy and numeracy training to uplift their standard of teaching. 

INTERSOS will use existing schools supported by INTERSOS for the ALP (Accelerated Learning Program) and will establish 13 ALP (Accelerated Learning Program) centers in Bentiu (3 locations: Bentiu town, Rubkona town, and Rubkona PoCs), and Malakal (2 location: Malakal PoCs and Malakal town). The establishment of these quality ALP will attract many idle youth who have no educational opportunity inside and outside the PoCs. 

INTERSOS will finally develop exit strategy where benefited communities will manage to run the ALP centers with own support. INTERSOS will build a sense of community ALP ownership. This will be started from the project entry point and will be coached benefiting communities along the project implementation</narrative>
