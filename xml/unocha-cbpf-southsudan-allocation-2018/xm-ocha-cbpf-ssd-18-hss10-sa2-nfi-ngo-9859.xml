   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Provision of emergency S-NFI and restricted cash vouchers to conflict affected population in Western and Central Equatoria States</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project will respond to the need of the most vulnerable 1,563 HHs (9,378 ind.) among the conflict-affected population of Central and Western Equatoria State. The project targets the most vulnerable newly displaced people and protracted IDPs, a small number returnees and host community, particularly focusing on people with protection concerns and most acute needs. LCED will provide life-saving emergency intervention for 340 HHs (2,040 individuals) in Mundri town where IDPs or returnees can have safe access to the market, and will continue with the provision of lifesaving emergency S-NFI for 800 HHs (2,400 individuals), including IDPs and returnees, in the remote satellite areas of Mundri West/East counties according to accessibility. LCED static presence in the area will greatly help in negotiating access and will allow flexibility of the intervention. As part of LCED regional mobile response, it will provide emergency lifesaving S-NFI including survival kits for 300 HHs (1,800 individuals) in Morobo county, and in collaboration with World Vision, LCED as part of its regionally mobile response will provide lifesaving Emergency S-NFI for 200 HHs (1,200 individuals) in Tambura county. AsseLCED estimates local procurement of framing material (wooden poles, bamboo bundles) for 300 HHs (1,800 individuals), in situations where the material is available, but not accessible by the beneficiaries. This is especially the case of women and elderly people, experiencing protection concerns on the road, including harassment and looting. The reasons for procuring material locally rather than through the cluster core pipeline are the higher quality and lower cost of local supplies and transportation, and the possibility of revitalizing the local market. The reason for not using CBI in such cases, is that the beneficiaries targeted do not have access to a market, particularly due to their vulnerabilities.
Additionally, LCED will implement a CBI targeting 200 HHs (1,200 ind.) in Mundri West and East counties (WES) with restricted, unconditional cash vouchers. It will be implemented only in areas where the population has access to the market, and it will imply a market and needs assessment beforehand, to determine the beneficiaries&#x2019; access (physical, economic, financial, socio-cultural) and the capacity of local suppliers. After defining the ES/NFI package for the targeted beneficiaries, according to their needs, LCED will engage suppliers in Mundri West/East, to set the price of the items, according to actual prices in the market for the specific areas assessed, and sign a binding contract, specifying modality of procurement and payment. In Mundri West/East it makes sense to implement a cash-for-work project, as cash vouchers in exchange for repairing community roads or helping in shelter constructions. However, such activities are performed by men, and targeting only them for the distribution of cash vouchers will undermine our aim of empowering women economically, hence LCED prefers to use unconditional cash vouchers. The CBI will be integrated by procurement of pipeline items, due to the fact that some essential S/NFI are not present in the local market. 
LCED will involve the affected population in all the phases of the project implementation, in order to promote accountability to the affected population (AAP). Considering this year&#x2019;s SSHF SA2 allocation, this project will start on the 1st of August 2017, while the previous LCED project under the SSHF SA1 will end on the 30th September 2017. LCED will coordinate the projects activities, allocating resources in areas where the needs are higher. LCED will manage to avoid overlaps in project activities, by targeting previously inaccessible areas in the same counties where it is operating (Mundri East and Mundri West) and new counties where it will start operating from the 1st of September 2018. At budget level, the salary for the LCED current staff will be considered from the 1st October</narrative>
