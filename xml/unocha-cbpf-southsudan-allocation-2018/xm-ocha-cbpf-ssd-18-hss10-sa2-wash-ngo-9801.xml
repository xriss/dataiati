   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Addressing acute Water, Sanitation and Hygiene needs of conflict affected communities through an integrated intervention in Nutrition and GBV streamlining in Leer County and Payams of Mayendit North County in Unity State is paramount due to the fact that the population using water points are more than the standard required because the functional water points are very few. Most water points have been destroyed in the persistent conflicts and the few operational water sources are also overused and this has on a great scale contributed to their breakdown. Reports from our field staffs indicate that one hand pump is serving about 1250 people which is above the sphere standards of one hand pump to serve about 500 people. This situation has led to increased queuing time at the viable water sources causing reduced per capita water consumption (under 10 L/person/day), increased consumption from unprotected surface water sources, reduced time for other essential tasks and can also be a source of conflict. This project targets 16000 (men, women, girls and boys) conflict affected communities from Leer and those of Mayendit North Counties who are settling back in their new homes where the impact of war and conflict has really been felt due to the fact that houses and WASH infrastructures that existed have been destroyed within the communities. This project aims to address the provision of safe water, improved sanitation and Hygiene promotion needs to the communities and institution centres through an integrated approach. Improved and equitable access to safe and sufficient drinking water will be achieved through rehabilitation and repairing 30 non-functioning boreholes and 4 protected hand dug wells. The rehabilitation and repairs will be done after a GBV risk analysis have been conducted in the focus groups discussion with women and girls, conducted by female staff on the safety and best location to access safe equitable and sustainable water source and thus reducing cases of GBV and risk of sexual exploitation of women and girls since they are the primary beneficiary. In schools&#x2019; rehabilitation of the water sources and sanitation facilities e.g. latrines will be done after GBV risk analysis with the focal groups i.e. girls /female staffs discussions, training on menstrual hygiene management and distribution of MHM kits to adolescent girls will be done and will contribute to their sense of dignity and ability to participate in school activities which will at long run improve their attendance and retention in school. Rehabilitated latrines will have doors and locks to enhance privacy, dignity and security and hence reducing the risk of exploitation, such as sexual exploitation and abuse. OTP/TSFP centres will also be targeted where existing water sources and latrines in or near heath facilities will be rehabilitated to improve access to safe water and improve sanitation. WASH training of nutrition teams (CNW/IYCF) will be done in order to support good hygiene practises in the household especially where there are CMAM cases have been detected. Hygiene Kits distribution will also target the mothers of SAM/MAM children and PLW in the OTP/TSFP centres, following consultation with the nutrition team who will be very vital in the process of beneficiary identification.  There will be also be distribution of Aquatab tablets and sachets of PUR all sourced from the pipeline. This project will ensure high hygiene and sanitation standards are maintained by ensuring that all the rehabilitated water sources are disinfected by super-chlorination using High Test Hypochlorite (67%) before usage, treatment of stored drinking water from suspicious sources and hand washing with soap practices emphasized by CHPs and nutrition team trained on WASH minimum package e.g. CNW/IYCF during hygiene and sanitation promotion and awareness creation campaigns and thus reducing occurrence and transmission of water borne diseases including cholera.</narrative>
