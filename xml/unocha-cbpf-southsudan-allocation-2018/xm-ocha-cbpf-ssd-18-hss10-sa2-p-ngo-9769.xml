  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project aims to enhance protection monitoring and assessment in Southern Unity especially hard-to-reach areas in Leer and Mayendit counties, targeting IDPs, host, and returnees who took refuge to Islands and others far villages. 
It aims to strengthen the community-based protection mechanism by supporting the existing structures or forming them with the help of the community where they do not exist.
 In terms of mode of delivery, MHA will in line with cluster priorities as outlined in the Humanitarian Response Plan 2018 will be delivering this through field-based intervention. MHA currently, have six protection staff on ground Thonyor/ Tochriak and two protection officers will be recruited under this project so that we have better coverage of Leer and Mayendit.
The team will work in close coordination with the protection cluster and its activities will be informed largely by the gaps identified through protection monitoring and protection assessment to the hard-to-reach areas as stated above. 
MHA will adapt the project to the specific needs of men, women, girls, and boys and respond accordingly or refer to relevant service providers in case the need cannot be cover.
This project in close coordination with the protection cluster will also explore the feasibility of returns, relocations
or integration of the IDPs and returnees if the security situation improves in the targeted location.
MHA will regularly update protection cluster on risk analysis of affected IDPs and the host community in hard-to-reach areas and advocate on their behalf so that they access humanitarian assistance and services. 
Below are the mitigation measures that shall be used to address the protection needs.
1. Routine protection monitoring to all surrounding/out-reach areas to identify individually vulnerable and to provide assistance or refer to the services provider.
2 MHA will conduct capacity building training to community leaders, local authority to use their influence within the community to help in the prevention of protection risk and human right violations. As well as local protection partners on protection mainstreaming in the field level and to Conducts community mobilization and awareness raising campaign of human right, harmful practices such early girl child marriage and global protection mainstreaming toolkit will be used our tool. Feedback from the community, reduction in the protection risk contributing factors and an increase in access to protection live-saving information will be used to measure the impact of our intervention.
3. Protection monthly report and update on the overall protection context and needs that will be shared with the cluster in Bentiu and Juba as well strengthen the existing/formation of the community-based protection networks and train them on how to claim their rights/responsibilities, coordinated protection-related concerns with MHA or other partners and help awareness-raising campaign. 
Methodologies used to identify the protection needs.
1.Involvement of the IDPS leaders to help in the identification of the needs. 2. General observation of the area and quietly observe the contributing factors to the protection risk and threats.
3. Routine house-to-house visit by protection team in hard-to-reach areas.
4. Key informant interview selected individual/group of the beneficiaries
to share their experience need and how they should be addressed.
5. Focus group discussion to provide in-depth information on the beneficiaries&#x2019;
perception and the experience.
6. Information from the other humanitarian actors on the protection gaps in
certain locations.
7. Conduct protection assessment to identify what are the protection threat
faced by the IDPs and the host community and to find out
How and why are they at risks and what are the risks factors?
Who are the population and the community at risk?
Which individual groups are particularly vulnerable putting into consideration
the gender, age, and d</narrative>
