   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The IPMT will start after closing the 1st allocation project. In coordination with the PC, regular rapid assessment amp response missions will be undertaken to hard-to-reach areas of the country with extraordinary humanitarian needs. INTERSOS will launch 1 mobile team, composed of 6 qualified experienced staff (2 GBV and 2 CP Experts, 1 General Protection/Community Protection Expert and 1 Team leader ( Protection background) s/he also acts as Security focal point. Upon arrival needs assessment will be conducted to identify  most urgent protection needs of the vulnerable population and general status of  sectors directly connected to the protection environment. Assessments will consider specific needs of women, girls and other PWSN. A rough profile of the overall PWSN breakdown will be done to understand the disaggregation of population affected and to define contextualised response based on services and assistance (within a broader scope of long term programming). Within 48 hours from the first assessment exercise a preliminary brief report will be shared with the cluster including planned response activities. Assessment and response will be informed and structured in line with CP and GBV subcluster guidelines.
The team will identify a safeampaccessible area to set up a temporary confidential space per location, used as a Listening Centre to receive survivors of GBV, women and girls at risk, persons with disabilities, UASC, other vulnerable children and caregivers, persons with severe MHPSS needs, and youth..
General protection officers will reach out to local actors, (authorities, civil society bodies or informal groups) to understand coping mechanisms of the  locality and identify services to be mapped. This will serve to identify existing referral pathways or gaps towards the establishment of consolidated referral pathways, as per specific needs of each location. Protection officers will  mobilize the local population for group discussions to launch dialogue to delve into community concerns to identify broad protection trends and capacities to respond. Identifying focal points and community strengths will support in maintaining contact with the localities to keep assessments up to date when collating for future use. Mapping aggregating points in the locations visited is also vital.
Expert staff involved in counselling will provide light case management support where referral is identified as possible or urgent. Furthermore, PFA will be done where imminent intervention is required through referral or through PFA methods which the staff will be trained in prior to deployment focusing on individual concerns, initial healing and the ability to identify and strengthen own coping mechanisms. This must be done across the whole AGD and needs spectrum, catering for under-serviced populations such as male youth.
An integral part of the intervention will include examining existing systems and pathways, placing attention to local capacities to be developed by future intervention. The full assessment will also serve to establish general protection trends across the accessed areas.
In view of broadening the protection environment the IPMT will map existing services delivered by other humanitarian actors across sectors to rapidly assess the level of protection mainstreaming of delivered services. Where possible the mobile team will prioritize the delivery of
- contextualized training of front-line organizations, CBOs key actors and community leaders in protection principles, basic methods of GP, CP and GBV , and PFA
- discussion groups to disseminate observations and launch debate on protection mainstreaming by location, ideally inclusive of the affected community (to maintain the centrality of a needs-based amp participatory approach).
The intervention plan sees 1 team operating out of one location per month to carry out an assessment and provide light response for max.3 weeks/mission with time in Juba</narrative>
