   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Emergency School Feeding Programme for improved cognitive development of school going children in Manyo and Fashoda Counties of UpperNile State</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In order to tackle the education crisis, SPEDP is proposing an integrated school feeding program in schools in Fashoda and Manyo Counties with the general objectives of contributing to reduction in cognitive underdevelopment and malnutrition, improve attendance and enrollment, and/or reduce gender disparities. This project will target school going children between 6-18 years majorly in primary schools within Fashoda and Manyo  for a period of three terms, planned to reach 10 schools with 5000 school going children, 100 teachers and 30 cooks/kitchen helpers. These 10 schools will be selected based on food security status, literacy statistics, enrollment and attendance data and/or environmental or economic measures of the emergency to determine the most affected or most in need of assistance and the programme plans to feed all children within these schools, regardless of their individual circumstances. Food procurement model will be through tendering programs linked to local suppliers. The quantities required for each selected school will be determined based on enrollment figures (monthly/as school ratios are provided.) School heads/PTAs will receive and manage the food supplies, coordinated inclusive of other stakeholders. Community participation integration approach (CPIA) will be upheld. 
SPEDP will majorly undertake the following key interventions
-provide ready made food (high energy biscuits) to selected schools for one to two weeks as an immediate response before onsite schools feeding programme kicks off
-onsite school feeding will follow after set-up of the food preparation facilities.
A child aged 6 to 18 years requires 2,000 kcal. For general populations, the daily energy requirement is 2,100 kcal. Based on this, the food commodities that will be provided at each school will include Pulses (yellow split peas), Cereals (Sorghum flour), Oil (Vegetable) and Salt. The same ration size of Pulses (30grams), Cereals (150grams), Oil (20grams) and Salt (5grams) totaling to 205 grams ( = 803 kcal or 38% of daily kcal requirements)applies for pupils of all ages in supported primary schools and for non-pupils (teachers, cooks, kitchen helpers etc.) on a daily basis for 5 schooling days a week. The selection of food commodities and nutritional considerations puts into consideration of the cultural food preferences and tastes of the schoolchildren.
SPEDP&#x2019;s primary concern for food safety lies in the secure delivery and storage of food commodities and their safe preparation. Some investment in secure on-site food storage facilities will be needed before a programme is started therefore there will be minor rehabilitation of schools stores and kitchens. Food aid will be distributed to schools on a monthly basis from SPEDP warehouse located in Renk main office for Manyo County and also another store will be within Fashoda given the long distance from Renk to Fashoda depending on the number of children and teachers plus cooks per school, a teaching staff will be selected per school to serve as a store keeper and trained in store keeping including record taking and reporting whereas 3 cooks per school will be hired and also trained in hygienic food preparation prior to initiation of onsite cooking, 2 cooks will be for food preparation while the other 1 will be fetching water and carrying out other kitchen duties like washing of plates. SPEDP will be carrying out monitoring to assess the impact of school feeding program and how it has increased enrollment, retention and improved cognitive development of learners. SPEDP will not be carrying out standard education in emergency activities but will integrate school feeding in schools where WorldVision and Intersos are implementing emergency education activities</narrative>
