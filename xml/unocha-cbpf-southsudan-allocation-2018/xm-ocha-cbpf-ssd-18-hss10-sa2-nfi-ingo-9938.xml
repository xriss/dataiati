  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project aims to provide Survival Kits /Emergency shelter/Non Food items to the most vulnerable persons specifically the displaced and some host communities. This is a proposed 7 months project starting from 1st September 2018 focusing on the distribution of Survival kits/Shelter/NFI kits using a rapid response mechanism (mobile Teams) to reach out to 27,000 beneficiaries in Jonglei state and former Unity State.
The proposed counties within the selected states are Leer, Koch, Panyijiar, Myandit and Nyirol. The exact locations within these states prioritized by the cluster will be confirmed during the assessment in the first month of the project. The project locations within the selected counties will be based on the prioritization  of cluster and the needs identified during assessment.

When blanket targeting is not the applicable, the action will target mainly lactating and pregnant women, households with malnourished children, and households with members who have certain health complications. Besides unaccompanied children, unaccompanied elderly and persons with no community linkages will also be targeted. 

The project will promote timely delivery of assistance through deployment of rapid response teams in line with humanitarian priorities for 2018 as outlined in the Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP) as well as the nature of the emergency in South Sudan. NRC&#x2019;s mobile response teams will be ready for deployment within 8 days to conduct assessments and within 14 days for full-fledged delivery of NFIs and emergency shelters and other activities per location.

The project team will work in close consultation with the Shelter cluster and its activities will be informed largely by the gaps identified through the multisector/agency assessment missions in which NRC will participate and/or carry out alone depending on the situation between September  2018 and March 2019. Through this assessment, NRC will adapt the project to the specific needs of men, women, girls and boys and respond accordingly or refer to relevant service providers in case the needs cannot be covered by the response. 

NRC also use  its check list of protection mainstreaming to complement the multi sector assessment. The distribution of Shelter and NFI kits will be done in distribution sites which will be identified together with the community and will put into consideration the minimum standards of protection. Since NRC is also working in WASH, Food security and education sectors therefore a synergy will be sought when responding to the shelter/NFI needs. 

The distribution process will ensure that women and girls  are not exposed to the risk of sex and gender based violence (SGBV) by positioning distribution points within short  walking distances from the beneficiries homes. In case drinking water is not available in nearby locations, water will be provided by the NRC team at the distribution sites. Elderly, physically incapable, pregnant women and others who require special attention will be prioritized during distribution so that they get served early and comfortably. Feedback desk will also be provided at each distribution site so that beneficiaries can share with NRC their views on the entire project processes and quality of the supplies/Kits.

NRC will complement its distribution by community awareness campaign and information sessions especially on proper usage of distributed items. Due to the nature of the distribution, NRC will conduct post distribution Monitoring (PDM ) in at least 50% of locations where distribution will have taken place.</narrative>
