   <narrative xml:lang="EN">While half of South Sudan&#x2019;s population (around six million) is in urgent need of humanitarian support, persons with disabilities, persons affected by long and chronic diseases, elderly and persons suffering from mental health issues are among the most vulnerable. They face greater risks of being caught in fighting, being left behind by their families, and getting humanitarian assistance (HRW Report, May 2017). The mental health needs of people in South Sudan are outlined in the 2018 South Sudan Humanitarian Response Plan where it states, &#x201C;Mental health and psychosocial support services will be strengthened to enhance people&#x2019;s capacity to cope with threats&#x201D;. This project addresses the urgent need of mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS) and needs of persons with disabilities in South Sudan as outlined in the Health Cluster HRP for 2018 through its 4th objective (Improve resilience among vulnerable populations by increasing access to MHPSS services), particularly in areas with acute needs due to new shocks, through a mobile and flexible response. The  Flying Team is a flexible intervention model developed with ECHO to address these needs with the objective to prioritize locations with greatest needs. As stated within the Charter on Inclusion of Persons with Disabilities in Humanitarian Action (2016), persons with disabilities are disproportionately affected in situations of risk and humanitarian emergencies, and face multiple barriers in accessing protection and humanitarian assistance, including relief and recovery support. The action targets the most vulnerable persons at risk of exclusion (including people with disabilities, people with injuries and chronic diseases, people experiencing psychosocial distress or mental health troubles, children, older persons), who are often invisible to mainstream relief organizations. This project is also based on the MHPSS and rehabilitation information gathered by the Flying Team between April 2017 and July 2018 during the team&apos;s emergency missions to Unity, Equatorias and Jonglei states. Specialized MHPSS and Rehabilitation team members collected information through: client surveys, meetings with key informants, and direct observations. The results of these assessments found that local structures were unable to meet the requirements of those with MHPSS and rehabilitation needs. By identifying specific vulnerabilities and providing targeted assistance to vulnerable groups through the deployment of a team of specialists providing MHPSS services and physical rehabilitation, the action will reduce vulnerability and mitigate the impact of the conflict. The action will strengthen positive coping mechanisms, rebuild social ties, promote wellbeing, reduce the chances of psychological distress, facilitate access to lifesaving services, improve functional capacities and independence, and eventually improve the dignity of targeted beneficiaries. In each location a mobile team of PSS workers and counselors and a mobile team of physical therapists will work to provide MHPSS and rehabilitation services to beneficiaries. The teams will serve 38322 beneficiaries in 4 locations:
-	Tambura: 6500 beneficiaries with MHPSS support and 4791 with rehabilitation support out of a population of 72161 
-	Juba: 6500 beneficiaries with MHPSS support and 4792 with rehabilitation support out of the 419540 people in Juba out of 38,874 IDPs in Juba POC sites
-	Koch: 6500 beneficiaries  with MHPSS support and 4791 with rehabilitation support out of a population of 134590 persons, 
-	Leer:  6500 beneficiaries with MHPSS support and 4792 with rehabilitation support out of 13471 people.
So the project provides MHPSS to 38,322 beneficiaries among which 19,166 beneficiaries will be provided with rehabilitation support.

All data collected on beneficiaries during the project will be disaggregated by gender, age, and disability. Each project location will require approximately 50,000 dollars of the budget.</narrative>
