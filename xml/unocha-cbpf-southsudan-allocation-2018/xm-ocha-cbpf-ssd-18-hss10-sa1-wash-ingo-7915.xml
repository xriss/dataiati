   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Emergency WASH response for IDP&#x2019;s, returnees and host community in Uror County, Jonglei State, South Sudan</narrative>

  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project aims to provide timely, equitable access to safe and sufficient water as well as increase knowledge of appropriate hygiene practices for vulnerable and conflict affected populations to prevent and mitigate WASH-related diseases.
PAH will mainstream protection, accountability to affected people and strengthening the application of cash &#x2013; based programing in conflict affected areas of Uror County, Jonglei State. As the region has a high malnutrition level with IPC 4, PAH WASH response will be coordinated and integrated with nutrition, FSL and health partners. The project will target communities with poor access to safe water supply, unsafe sanitation and hygiene practices, poor sanitation coverage and support health, education and nutrition centers with WASH facilities (i.e. GAM rates of more than 27%). 
The population to be targeted face crisis level food insecurity, interrupted markets, limited access to water, low hygiene awareness and poor sanitation. Intended beneficiaries have extremely limited access to clean water and little knowledge of hygiene best practices. The situation has been deteriorating with various conflicts spreading across the country. As a result, infrastructure such as boreholes, water systems, latrines and other facilities were destroyed by armed state and non-state actors and humanitarian access is limited. Many people have been forced to flee their houses, meaning they have less access to basic facilities. &#x2018;Hot spots&#x2019; have been identified by the humanitarian community, these areas are characterized by hunger gaps, insecurity and significant movement of returnees and IDPs. Malnutrition and food insecurity makes communities more prone to water-related diseases, especially children under five. 
Under this project, PAH will implement life-saving WASH related activities in Uror county, Jonglei State, targeting 34,000 beneficiaries suffering from inadequate access to safe drinking water and poor hygiene conditions. As WASH response has been scattered, PAH intends to target vulnerable and affected population in Uror County and payams such as Yuai, Modit, Pieri, Pulchuol, Pajut with a structured, effective emergency preparedness and response programme aimed at improving access to safe water and enhance community awareness on safe sanitation and hygiene practices in order to prevent and mitigate WASH-related diseases and through cooperation with nutrition and FSL partner to reduce malnutrition level.
The project will be implemented in coordination with health, education and nutrition programs, especially in areas of new displacement. Integration with other sectors will ensure the reduction of risk of disease and malnutrition. Water supply and latrine facilities improvement at health, nutrition and education institutions will contribute to reduction of disease transmission at these centers, and hence make health, nutrition and education centers safe for users. Feasibility of drilling 1 borehole will be revised at key location (near nutrition center or health facility).
In this project, PAH will ensure the centrality of protection and accountability to affected people, putting communities at the centre of the response. PAH will ensure that services delivered are gender-sensitive and will consider the needs of older people, children and people living with disabilities. Cash programming will be incorporated through voucher for soap provided at health and nutrition sites to groups most at risk of contamination and malnutrition. Key hygiene and nutrition messaging at these institutions will be accompanied. 
With support from monitoring and evaluation department, indicators will be put in place to track cooperation with communities through PAH beneficiary feedback form, to address GBV threats in WASH, and ensuring services provided meet the needs of the beneficiaries. Clear WASH NFI beneficiary selection criteria will be put in place and clearly presented to the community.</narrative>
