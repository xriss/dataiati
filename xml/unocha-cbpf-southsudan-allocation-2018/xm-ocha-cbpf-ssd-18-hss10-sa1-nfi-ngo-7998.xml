  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Fangak County,It is also referred to as both New and Old Fangak. According to local authorities, the intensity and ferocity of the conflict in this County dislodged over 9,450 people and forced them to flee to Wicmoun and Buom, both located at a cruising distance of some 30 minutes and one hour respectively on the Giraffe River from New Fangak. A good number of the population also moved deep into remote areas such as Koatnyakoang and Quaker to avoid the atrocities that characterized the conflict. SSRC officials noted that with calm returning to the town, some 8,000 of those displaced have returned, and many more are expected to return back to Fangak County. There is also a huge influx of IDPs from Southern and Northern Unity State are also present in Fangak County. The population of Duk County according to 22nd April 2008 Census,Duk has 655,88 individuals (30,631 female and 34,957 male)  according to Reach Resource Center report in 2017, Duk  has 50,805 individuals, 9,984 HH, 39,000 IDPs and 11,000 HC this covered 48% of the total population are IDPs,its estimated narrowly, 85% of households are headed by women, most of whom are widows, a good number of men were mainly engaged in conflict leaving behind the women with children, However, according to REACH Resource Center Report, IDPs make up about 25-35 percent of the population and over 48% of the IDPs are women and children. these target groups are the most vulnerable and in most need of support. However, both IDPs and host populations suffered extreme problems with drinking water accessibility, lack of non-food items (NFIs) and food security. an average of 70% of the IDPs are integrated into the host communities, which are congested and the sanitation is poor most of the IDPs intend to stay until the situation in their places of origin.Uror is a county in Jonglei State, South Sudan.It has nine payams: Pathai, Pieri, Pulchuol, Palouny, Motdit, Motot, Karam, Pajut, Weykol and Padiek. Before the reorganisation of states, despite the Continued displacement into Jonglei,in particular to others of part of Jonglei Counties, Uror has over 17,000 IDPs according to REACH Resource Report in 2017

This project therefore aims at providing emergency shelter and NFIs to the new IDPs in Fangak, Duk and Uror County to ensure Improved quality of life of newly displaced IDPs through provision of Emergency Sheter/NFI support. ADA will focus on the major need to target vulnerability of the women and children especially women and child headed households, the elderly, pregnant and lactating mothers, with the aim to contribute to improved protective environment of the vulnerable women, men, girls and boys, among the IDPs, returnees and host communities.This project will also ensure that the urgent shelter and NFI needs of 2,161 vulnerable households are provided. 

ADA will use the lifesaving criteria to ensure the protection and promotion of health and dignity of the vulnerable IDPs and to save the lifes of the most vulnerable including returnees and host communities.Its estimated nearly 82% of households are headed by women, most of whom are widows, as a large number of men were reportedly killed during the conflicts of December 2013 and July 2016. In Fangak County, Duk and Uror county, IDPs make up about 20-35 percent of the total population. Over 60% of the IDPs are women and children. These target groups are the most vulnerable and in most need of support. However, both IDPs and host populations suffered extreme problems with drinking water accessibility, lack of non-food items (NFIs) and food insecurity. An average of 65% of the IDPs are integrated into the host communities, which are congested and the sanitation is poor perhaps most of the IDPs intend to stay until the situations in their places of origin normalizes.
