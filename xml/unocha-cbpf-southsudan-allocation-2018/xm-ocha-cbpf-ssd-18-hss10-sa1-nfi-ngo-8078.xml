   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The 2018 Humanitarian Response Plan for South Sudan projects an increase in the number of people in need as a result of the escalation of the conflict. Nearly 1.9 million people have been internally displaced, 85% of whom are women and children. Crisis and emergency (IPC Phase 4)  outcomes and associated risk of increased mortality have persisted in the Country due to displacement that has negatively affected household food security and livelihoods. Levels of hunger and malnutrition have reached unprecedented levels, with over 5 million people severely food insecure and over 1 million children acutely malnourished. Several surveys and assessments in Central Equatoria states indicated deterioration in food security and livelihoods, nutrition,  and protection indicators, prompting SPEDP&#x2019;s strategy to scale up its operations in Kajo Keji County that is identified with arising needs due to case load of returnees coming from the Refugee camps in Uganda.
 
Against this background, SPEDP proposes a 6 months mobile response intervention to  provide emergency shelter materials, non food items and cash based intervention to affected populations in Kajo Keji County. SPEDP will engage with Joint mobile response teams including PAH and Titi foundation etc to address Shelter and NFI needs to the affected populations in assessed areas in Kajo Keji County. The activities will include needs assessment, beneficiaries&#x2019; verification and registration, cash transfers by money delivery agent and post distribution monitoring. SPEDP having a one year MoU with the shelter and NFI core pipeline managers, this will help us to acquire shelter and NFI materials from the core pipeline managers and the Shelter/NFI mobile team in collaboration with the S/NFI cluster will preposition the supplies to the distribution site and SPEDP assumes the role of distribution together with the mobile team. This project will focus on women headed households, child headed households&#x2019; etc incorporating gender dynamics and the specific needs of different groups into needs assessments and response recommendations.

On the issue of the cash based intervention,  SPEDP will form a committee that will oversee beneficiaries&#x2019; identification based on the selection criteria of women headed households, child headed households, people with disabilities and the older people. A cash based community will also be formed to oversee the cash distribution and ensure that all those targeted received their cash. Each household registered for this intervention will receive a cash equivalent to $60 put in an envelop. Before provision of the unconditional cash, market assessment and monitoring will be conducted to assess whether local traders have the capacity to provide some, most, or even all of the materials required for the shelter-upgrades.  

For the safety of the cash, SPEDP will contract money transfer agents for the cash transfers to the field location to mitigate against theft or cash being robbed by bandits.</narrative>
