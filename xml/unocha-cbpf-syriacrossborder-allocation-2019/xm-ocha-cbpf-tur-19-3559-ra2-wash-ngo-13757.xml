   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This intervention is specifically designed to address the Strategic and Cluster Objectives as outlined in the SCHF 2019 Allocation Paper, making use of the resources amp expertise, of Syria Relief and their geographic access to the targeted sites in Idleb. The selected population has been targeted in accordance with Severity Indexing provided by the WASH Cluster, which is aimed at ensuring those who are most in need of immediate and life-saving assistance are prioritized under this Intervention.  The Overall Project Objective is designed around two key Outcomes: 
1. Increased access to sanitation facilities (new construction amp rehabilitations suitable for PwD amp sex segregation, locks provided), the provision of emergency personal hygiene supplies (gender appropriate) and improved environmental living conditions (provision of waste bins, awareness raising sessions, and solid waste removal, latrine cleaning services amp desludging through Cash for Work 50/50 m/f). 
2. Increased access to safe water (25ltr/pd/pp, decreased distance to a water point, equipped the current well, chlorinated amp tested water supplier, sex segregated distribution points) for drinking (23 liters) and personal hygiene use (additional 2 liters per day per person, reaching 25 liters in total as cluster recommendation). 
To achieve these outcomes, Syria Relief will target 25 informal sites (containing 10,071 individuals) in Idleb, who have been displaced from northern Hama and southern Idlib. an overview, SR proposes to do the following: 
- Rehabilitate 100 bathing facilities  - Construct 50 ne bathing facilities and 30 PwD toilets  - Distributing 207 garbage bins  - Collect waste and dislodge waste water- Clean bathing facilities (44 workers will be contracted to perform this activity) - Equip the well in Taybet Alemam camp and operate it, - Provide the beneficiaries in Taybet Alemam with clean water though water trucking - Provide the camps with 223 water tanks of 1000 litre capacity (SR will monitor the quality of the water through applying the Sphere and Syrian standards). SR will conduct hygiene awareness sessions, contracting 15 promotors for 3 months. 
In collaboration with OCHA, SR will ensure the continuation of basic services, while also increasing access, both in terms of quantity considering needs of PwD amp women and quality (meeting Sphere standards and cluster recommendations) of essential WASH services. Increased focus will be placed on ensuring PwD have access to appropriate sanitation facilities, the Protection concerns of women and girls (see section 6 for more) are considered, and environmental health and hygiene promotion are enhanced.  An increased focus will be placed on Protection mainstreaming and Accountability (see section 6). SR has a well-established Complaint Response Mechanism in place, with a full team of staff who have been training on its use and function.  As most of our targeted locations reached to its capacity and will not be able to host new IDPs. According to CCCM cluster reports, there are currently no significant additional waves expected to the targeted camps, although we are well aware that the situation could change, and we have flexibility to deal with a nominal amount of newly displaced people. SR is already working in the same camps with CARE to provide clean water, hygiene kits and waste water desludging. If new IDPs arrive, SR will communicate with CARE to cover them with WASH assistances and IOM to cover them with shelter assistances. Additionally, SR will stay in regular contact with the CCCM cluster to make them aware of any change or escalation in beneficiaries&#x2019; needs, and will ask for their support if needed.  Aldo in responding to  the threat of flooding. With winter fast approaching, SR Turkey will increase it preparedness for the winter season by requesting additional funding from its existing partners, and its head office who are at the moment fundraising for winterization.</narrative>
