   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Providing multipurpose cash assistance to the newly IDPs in Dana sub district</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Multipurpose cash transfers provide flexibility for beneficiaries to choose priorities among the needs. The project aims to provide cash support for 4500 IDPs HHs in Dana sub-district with a value of 120 USD per household, based on the SMEB agreed by the Food Security, SNFI Clusters and Cash Working Group for Syria in 2019 and it&apos;s agreed with all IPs to adopt this amount to cover the need for the current displacement wave where the project focuses on ensuring adequate shelter as a first priority and the basic winterization needs as well. IRD will implement the project according to the IRD SoP Annex 01/11, which was updated according to the current changes in the Syrian crisis context. 
The way that IRD approaching for this project includes the following responsibilities:
&#xF0A7;             Contracting with transfer agent and arranging beneficiary payments
The procurement process to select the service supplier (for payment services) must be carried out, according to the total value of the fund&#x2019;s transfer and the value of the transfer fees. The procurement should be approved internally as part of IRD&#x2019;s approval framework. The selection of the money transfer agent should account for the agreed required by IRD in terms of delivery timing and amounts. However, IRD has a valid contract with two money transfer agents as well as USAID approved to contract these agents because they are the funding body, thus IRD will extend those contracts.
&#xF0A7;             Procurement and contracting of the voucher printing company 
Beneficiaries will receive a &#x2018;voucher&#x2019; in order to present at the money transfer agent to collect their cash distribution. Therefore, these vouchers should have a minimum level of security features and the relevant procurement process should be followed based on the value of the voucher printing. 
&#xF0A7;             Program Preparation and Planning 
IRD will inform and orient local councils and other actors in areas (out of camps). Local Councils will be informed about IRD intervention in the event of the displacement movements and provide the initial list of the BNFs to IRD field team. After that, IRD will conduct a rapid market assessment in the proposed locations that hosted IDPs and where the response will cover. This will ascertain the ability of markets to restock if demand increases, the current availability and quality of key food and non-food items and the accessibility of the markets to the local population.
&#xF0A7;             Beneficiary selection and verification
IRD will agree and orients Local Council and community stakeholders on beneficiary selection criteria and signs MOU for cooperation, setting out clearly the responsibilities of the Local Council and community, and IRD, in the beneficiary selection process, and the final agreed targeting criteria. Initially recommended targeting criteria should be agreed during the design phase of the program. Local Council then will register beneficiaries, with support from other relevant stakeholders (e.g. Relief Committee) on the beneficiary registration form. If the Local Council does not have the capacity, then IRD will work directly to register beneficiaries according to the criteria. The beneficiary registration form will include basic information on the household (head of the household name, family name, father&#x2019;s name, national ID number,
&#xF0A7;            Voucher distribution and redemption
IRD will determine the appropriate distribution point and is provided with all the necessary materials while at least 24 hours before the distribution, IRD will inform the BNFs of the date and time of the distribution and will coordinate with the hawala agent, also the cash vouchers will be distributed by IRD field staff at the same time the hawala agent in the next room will start redeeming the vouchers for cash in hands along with Ihsan representative.
&#xF0A7;             Arranging beneficiaries&#x2019; payments, confirming the paid amount of money and transferring money to a transfer agent</narrative>
