   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Life-saving assistance for the crisis-affected groups in high-density areas of IDPs through cash grants distribution for winterisation</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project at hand aims to provide emergency winterization assistance to recently displaced populations by the provision of winterization cash grants to the most vulnerable and newly displaced households who recently fled the conflict zones. The project has been designed to contribute to the winterization needs through helping the newly displaced households coping with the harsh winter conditions and secure their winterization needs in a dignified way by distributing one-off cash grant with a value of 165 $ per households. The grant amount was designed to allow beneficiaries cover their basic winterization need of stoves and fuel during the harsh winter in accordance with the SNFI cluster recommendation, where the 165$ will cover the cost of the stove that can be used for heating and cooking as well as the fuel needs for 60 days (4 liters/day for 60 days during winter 2019-2020). Moreover, the cash modality has been selected to give more flexibility for the beneficiaries to buy the stoves that suits their shelter and to avoid storing big quantities of fuel for a long time
Through this project, Violet seeks to target 2,393 newly displaced households (14,358 individuals) in the areas that have received the highest IDP influx over the last few months and have been identified with the highest needs including Idleb, Kafr Kafaldin, Ma&apos;arrat Tamasrin, Maharim and Al-Zanbaqi. The targeted locations are accessible for Violet through it&apos;s on the ground operation team
The beneficiaries will be selected in close coordination with the community representatives in the targeted areas based on the vulnerability and eligibility criteria including displacement duration criteria since the newly IDPs are the most vulnerable groups to the shocks. the project will prioritize women-headed households as well as households with children, elderlies, disabilities, pregnant, and lactating women. Furthermore, Violet will ensure close coordination with the humanitarian actors and coordination bodies to ensure the coordinated response and to avoid the potential overlapping.
Due to the lack of the banking system in northern Syria, Violet is transferring cash through the Turkish post (PTT). Moreover, Violet has a framework agreement for money transfer and distribution for the beneficiaries in place, which will be utilized under this project. the FWA is attached. The Cash transfer agent has been identified through a competitive and transparent procurement process after conducting a market and vendor assessment in the local markets. The contracted cash transfer agent will be responsible for delivering the Grants amount to the beneficiaries in their locations. Before distributing the cash grants, a rapid market assessment in terms of availability of the winterization items, prices, and the accessibility will be conducted to make sure the local markets are functioning and all beneficiaries have good and equal access to the winterization items.
Later on, the cash distribution will be conducted in two steps 1) the distribution of vouchers to the beneficiaries by Violet team, while the second step is the 2) vouchers redemption with its cash value (165 $) from the money transfer agent who is accompanying the distribution teams to all distribution points, immediately after receiving the vouchers. the Vouchers will be printed in a way that prevents the fraud and Forgery through equipping them with light thermal stickers
As per Violet SOPs for cash distributions, the project team will conduct verification as well as conducting Anti-terrorism check (ATC) for all beneficiaries to avoid the potential risks of terrorism financing and aid diversion. Additionally, Violet will communicate that cash assistance is free of charge through verbal communication with the beneficiaries as well as brochures distributions. The project will effectively contribute to market recovery through pumping financial liquidity in the market and may create new job opportunities</narrative>
