   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Maintain and improve access to formal and non-formal education for most vulnerable groups in Dana and Jandairis subdistrict.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The main aim of the project is to maintain and improve equitable access to formal and non-formal education for the most vulnerable groups in two sub-districts in Northwest Syria. The project is targeting  3,372 children aged between (5-17) years old including 1,839 boys and 1,533 girls in Dana and Jandairis subdistricts with focus on providing accessibility to children and people with disability. The project also provides job opportunities for more than 114 educational actors from both genders (69 men and 45 women).  The population in the targeted areas considered to be high severity for humanitarian assistance because of the high numbers of IDPs and returnees.  
To achieve this, project has three main components:   
1-	 Maintain and improve access to equitable formal education for 2,250 children (1,237 boys and 1,013 girls) aged between (5-17) years old in 5 schools in Dana sub-district. Academic calendar will include providing psychosocial support sessions provided by specialists and the teachers will have service maps and train on referral mechanisms to the nearest protection and GBV centers. 
2-	 enhancing access to equitable non-formal education for 1,050 out-of-school children (570 boys, 480 girls) in 7 education centers (5 in Dana) and (2 in Jandairis). Through this component remedial, literacy and numeracy classes are provided to school aged children to help them reengage in formal education and teachers are supported with incentive (28 volunteer teachers 17men,11 women).
3-	is pilot initiative providing (72 40 girls/ 32 boys) illiterate children aged between (12-17) years old, with disability and have mobility difficulties to reach educational centers with in-house literacy and numeracy courses through 2 mobile teams attached to Dana center to work in Dana and nearby locations.
The schools and education centers will be selected in coordination with directorate of education and local councils in targeted areas. This include small-scale rehabilitation to ensure accessibility for PwD to the building and all attached facilities. In the last ceremony in NFE the children will be encouraged to enroll in formal education and in selection criteria in FE the succeeded children will be prioritized. The staff who were recruited will be prioritized to be selected in the FE phase. We will have two weeks for transition between NFE and FE. Teacher recruitment and children registration activities is expected to start at beginning of the month and last for two weeks (one week for announcement and one week for interviews). We can start education and training in the second half of the month.
Educational personnel will be selected through transparent process in participation with DoE. Children and teachers with disability are encouraged to engage in education system by providing transportation cars to and from schools. Educational actors are provided with capacity building courses to ensure providing protective and effective learning through multiple training including: INEE standards-classroom management and planning-PSS&#x2013;alternatives of corporal punishment&#x2013;Public safety principles/Education patterns, active learning.
In addition to MoUs with local councils, DoE and good reputation of the presence of IHR in north and northwest Syria, we have signed agreement with ministry of Education in Turkey where they are cooperating in many areas to support education in Syrian. This make implementing the project in Afrin district is completely feasible. 
All project staff are required to sign code of conduct adhering to PSEA, do no harm principles and child protection policy and adhere to fleet Management SOP.
Plan B:
The target areas are one of the safest areas in Syria, but in case of inaccessibility, IHR will move the workplaces to safer places Aleppo (Bab and Afrin). IHR is able to implement the all project component project in these areas as it currently has offices in those areas and has agreement with Ministry of Education in Turkey</narrative>
