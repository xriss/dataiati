  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Violence in northwest Syria continues unabated since April in southern Idleb, northern Hama and western Aleppo governorates impacting civilians and impeding the delivery of assistance in many areas. As the fighting continues, the humanitarian situation continues to deteriorate
As of 14 July, the total displacements are 452,623, affecting at least 330,000 people (including secondary displacements). The majority of the newly displaced are fleeing to Northern Idleb to areas that are already densely populated mostly with IDPS having previously fled to these areas
The impact of hostilities is particularly severe on women and children who constitute 76% of the population in northwest Syria
According to the latest multi-sector Rapid Needs Assessment (RNA) conducted by REACH in July 2019, many IDPs are relying on humanitarian assistance and food aid as their main source of livelihoods. IDPs and residents have reportedly adopted negative coping strategies following a lack of food availability.

Andan community in Haritan sub-district, in the western countryside of Aleppo governorate, consider as one of these neglected localities where IDPs have been displaced are in urgent need of support. Furthermore, this area is considered a front line since it has received frequent and intensive bombardments. It has an estimated 80,000 to 100,000 population (about 30% are IDPs and increasing) and there is no similar facility in the surrounding area, the nearest surgical hospital is in Atareb town which is about 35 kilometers away.

The propsoed project aims to keep running this hospital for an additional 6 months to contribute in damage control and life stabilization support for this area and to strengthen the comperhansive of health care services that IDA is providing through its PHC in Andan city.
The propsoed project will cover the salaries and fuel costs needed for this hospital to keep running it and will coordinate with the active partners, and former supporter to this facilities to cover the drugs and medical supplies needs on monthly basis. IDA will also, support this facility with one mobile surgical unit in case of need, to improve the capacity of surgical services. IDA is aware that Islamic Relief is covering the salaries of 2 Doctors only working in this hospital. Thus, The propsoed project will only cover the uncovered salaries of the medical staff working in this hospital, and make sure to have no double funding for the same staff. 
Furthermore, IDA through its partner will aim to supply this hospital with the needed surgical supplies and consumables, and drugs to ensure the quality of health care services. 

The propsoed project will cover the salaries of 41 hospital staff ( 3 ER doctors, 2 Surgeons, 2 anesthesia tech, 6 surgeon assist, 2 Lab tech, 6 nurses, 6 nurse assistant, 1 pharmacy, 2 X-ray tech, and other support staff). in addition to the needed running costs. 

Andan Hospital is well fortified to ensure the safety of staff and beneficiaries, and equipped with 2 operation rooms ( with possibilities to add one mobile surgical unit in case of need), 14 admission beds, 4 ER beds,1 laboratory, 1 pharmacy. Currently, this hospital is providing general and orthopedic related health care surgeries. 

Funding this hospital makes it a holistic approach facility to reduce the burden on the referral systems and on the populations who will in this case receive comprehensive basic package of primary and secondary health services, when the services provided under this project will align with IDA PHC services in Andan city, and the physiotherapy and a CEmONC center seven kilometers away in Haritan town. The proposed project meets with the health cluster and the 2nd reserve allocation objectives, as well as, with IDA access to the area.</narrative>
