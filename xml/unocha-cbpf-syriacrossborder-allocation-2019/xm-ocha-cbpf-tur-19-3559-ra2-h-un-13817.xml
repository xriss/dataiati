   <narrative xml:lang="EN">As outlined in the Allocation Strategy, with the marked increase in violence on the civilian population, the need for trauma and surgical kits/supplies, anesthetics drugs has increased. The situation has been aggravated by the increase in the caseload of war-related injuries. Furthermore, the recently displaced IDP population has stretched the health services and available resources in certain arrival destinations in terms of supplementary medicines such as anti-tuberculosis drugs. 

The project aims to fill the selected/complement identified gaps for the period of the allocation in key geographical areas supported by health cluster partners in affected facilities when it comes to acute care and/or sustained life-savings care.

WHO&#x2019;s Third Party Monitoring documented stock outs of medicine: all surveyed facilities were stocked out of at least one essential medicines 30% of facilities surveyed were stocked out of more than half of essential medicines. More than half of Level 2 and Level 4 health facilities (56% and 63% respectively) were stocked out of more than half of the medicines. 16% of Secondary Healthcare (SHC) facilities were stocked out of half or more.

Stock-outs of basic core medicines were most acute for antibiotics and anesthetics at Level 4 and SHC facilities, including pain relief, diarrheal drugs and medicines to manage non-communicable diseases at Level 1, 2, and 3 facilities. Level 1 to 4 facilities showed serious deficiencies in provision of diagnostic tests. While more tests were available at SHC facilities, only four SHC facilities (13%) had all diagnostics. Almost half (44%) of Level 1, 22% of Level 2, 31% of Level 3 and 13% of Level 4 facilities were unable to conduct any of the assessed diagnostic tests.  

In order to fill the gaps in stocks of selected medicines and medical supplies and to assure continuity of care, WHO has established a cross border supply line, which covers about 20% of the needs in medicines and supplies of the implementing health cluster partners in the north western Syria.  
WHO supply line remains underfunded as needs arise every day due to the intensity of the conflict, and as documented through the Third Party Monitoring, In response to the recent in the light of the conflict escalation, WHO is seeking additional funding to support, maintain, and scale up its drug supply line for the key gaps in the north western Syria.  

This project intends to secure 40 supplementary medicines modules as part of the Interagency Emergency Health Kits (IEHK), 100 anesthesia kits, 26 trauma kits, 26 surgical kits and 13 kits of medicines to treat the most common non-communicable diseases (NCD kits). The project will provide 541,700 treatment courses.</narrative>
