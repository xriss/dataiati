   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Under ERL amp FSC, Violet is proposing an integrated and multisectoral 8-months project to improve access of the vulnerable groups to livelihood opportunities, agricultural inputs, and farming lands. The project was designed based on the need assessment conducted in Harem, Idleb, and Salqin, focusing on addressing the needs for accessing farmlands, inputs, and vocational training also with considering cluster guidance. Below are the activities
1. Distributing Agricultural input for 300 farmers in Salqin to improve their ability to cultivate 2-3 dunums of lands (modality restricted vouchers with a total value of 200$/HH distributed in two rounds). The 1st round of vouchers (100$) will be distributed in Feb to access the summer vegetable inputs (seeds, fertilizers, tools, pesticides, and dripping irrigation systems). The 2nd round of vouchers (100$) will be distributed in Apr for the same bnfs after the planting season and verifying that they planted their lands with vegetable crops to allow them to buy fertilizers and pesticides. Before distribution, Violet will consider the HLP and the right of the farmers to cultivate the land for at least the season, with the owner of the land. Written documentation will be requested. While implementing this activity,  Violet will ensure the continued monitoring of the market and prices to avoid potential harm to the markets
2. Rehabilitation of 10,550 m of roads to the farmlands in Salqin to improve the access of 1190 farmer to farmlands through road excavation, leveling, and graveling. the roads will support farmers in marketing crops transportation and marketing. Violet will ensure access by coordinating with authorities on the usage of roads and ensuring no fees are taken for road usage
- both activities (1 and 2) will be integrated through targetting the same HHs, where the 300 HHs of the restricted vouchers, will have improved access to lands through roads rehabilitation. To enhance integration, the above activities will also be linked to planned solar irrigation systems distribution which will be implemented by Violet in Jan 2020 (in partnership with FAO- SGA attached), where 80 of the farmers who will be served by both activities will be also targeted with the solar irrigation systems. So, Farmers planting summer vegetables and having lands next to the Asi river in Salqin will receive a comprehensive and integrated package of services
3. FSC related Vocational training (VT) aiming to train 230 Bnfs in Harem, Salqin, and Idleb sub-districts (selection priority: female-headed households and PWDs) on vocations such as food processing (pickles, jam, dried vegetables, and dairy products production, as well as sweets and pastry making), bees keeping, and compost production..etc, to improve their resilience by access to small-scale FSC livelihood opportunities. the trainees will be linked with vegetable crops producers (Bnfs from activities 1 and 2) to improve the vegetable marketing and processing. To encourage female-headed household participation, Violet will establish safe spaces for the children (Kindergartens) to take care of the female participants&apos; children during the training hours
4. Solar panels maintenance VT for 45 Bnfs. The trainees will be linked with the solar irrigation systems Bnfs&apos; to ensure sustainability
- the Vocations (Activities 3 and 4) will be selected based on the market assessment, needs, and the Bnfs&apos; feedback to contribute to reviving the market. Moreover, Violet will pay (2 USD/ day/ trainer) incentives for the trainees to cover their transportation and training attendance expenses. 
5. Business grants will be distributed to 72 of the VT trainees (60 grants (600$) for FSC VT and 12 grant (750$) for ERL VT trainees) based on specific criteria and Bnfs business plans. Grants will be distributed in 2 rounds the 2nd round will be distributed after ensuring bnfs have started their business</narrative>
