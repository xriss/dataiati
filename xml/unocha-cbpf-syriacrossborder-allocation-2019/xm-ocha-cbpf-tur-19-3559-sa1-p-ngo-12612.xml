   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Provide Integrated Life-Saving Community Based Protection Services (GBV  MA) with inclusion of PWDs, for both IDPs and Host Communities in North West Syria</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">WSA has been providing protection services for 4 years in south of Idleb and North of Hama, but due to the latest security developments, WSA was obliged to relocate its centers and field staff to North of Idleb, where the majority of the beneficiaries displaced to.
This new project is planning to enhance the Life-saving protection services of WSA centers to be more comprehensive and reachable for more numbers of new IDPs arrivals , in addition to the neglected and vulnerable women and girls, and marginalized persons (especially PWDs), through:
- The relocation to the areas of new displacement.
- The partnership with other Syrian NGO (NAS) for the MA component.

By this way all the experience of the field staff of WSA will be transferred to other 4 centers:
- 3 WGSS managed by WSA in Bennsh+KafrLucin+KaferTakharim (are already functioning).
- 1 field office for MA teams managed by NAS in AlMara&apos;.

The values that will be added are:

* Promoting the existing community protection mechanisms through upgrading the provided services to be more effective and comprehensive in the emergency response to the more new displacement crises.

 Integrating protection emergency services for women and girls with disabilities.

 Upgrading the activities that WSA is implementing in the 3 WGSS, which are (GBV specialized services.+ GBV emergency response activities + general case management and referral + PFA + Case Fund) to have more effective and comprehensive emergency GBV Response, and to feed in more accurate GBV cases identification, and all other protection needs identification for all IDPs. (#)

* Upgrading the activities that WSA and NAS are implementing (MRE + Referrals for victim cases) to have more effective and comprehensive emergency Humanitarian Mine Action Response.
In this regards: WSA amp NAS will coordinate during the preparation period for the project with the MASC to choose and adapt the best RE materials to be tailored mainly for IDPs and other affected population, and these materials will be printed and distributed after MASC approval.

 Increasing opportunities for more meaningful access for all vulnerable women and girls, and marginalized persons, throughout:
- The centers that will be supported are located in areas of high new IDPs influxes.
- Enhancing the services already provided for all beneficiaries.
- Developing the centers&#x2019; environment to be more convenient for WampGwDs, who will be receiving specialized activities of rehabilitation and inclusion in the ongoing Protection services.(***)
- Allocating one room as (children space) for the children of women beneficiaries and staff in each center (Activities like PSS, basic non-formal education will be conducted based on the ages).

All of the mentioned above will be for the sake of reaching the most vulnerable, neglected and marginalized categories of beneficiaries (Survivors with disabilities, widows, and adolescent girls) and giving more access for mothers with multiple young children. This can help to identify more GBV cases and increase the opportunity of providing quality Emergency Protection Services to the most vulnerable categories. WSA staff has gained a lot of experience through the emergency situation in South of Idleb and North of Hama, by dealing with new IDPs arrivals (as Madiq Castle before used to be the arrival point for the forced displaced people during the last couple of years), and also during the latest bombardment on Khan Shaykun.

WSA and its partner (NAS) are considering the teams in all the locations ready to respond urgently and provide Emergency protection services in the 4 main locations. 

Finally the refreshment sessions for WSA and its partner staff, will be tailored to develop the performance and the readiness for receiving the new IDPs arrivals and respond to their protection needs in dignity and in the best way, in locations with huge needs and gaps in emergency GBV amp MA services, and Gender Mainstreaming.</narrative>
