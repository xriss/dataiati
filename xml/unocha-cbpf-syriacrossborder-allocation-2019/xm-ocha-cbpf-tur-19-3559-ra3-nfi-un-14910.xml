   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Replenishment of SNFI Cluster contingency stock for distribution in Northwest Syria</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project aim is to replenish the Shelter and Non-Food Items (S/NFI) Cluster Emergency Contingency Stock (CS) with 6,000 full non-food items (NFIs) kits targeting approximately 36,000 individuals (6,000 men, 6,000 women, 12,000 boys, 12,000 girls) and 30,0000 Tarpaulins (plastic sheets) targeting approximately 15,000 households with 90,000 individuals (18,000 men, 18,000 women,  27,000 boys, 27,000 girls). The content of the full NFI kits will be based on the S/NFI Guidelines (Annex 1) and rapidly procured for prepositioning in the IOM Gaziantep warehouse as well as in Implementing Partners&#x2019; (IPs) warehouses in northwest Syria for S/NFI Cluster operational preparedness. IOM has a standing warehousing agreement with Muzun Humanitarian and Development (MHD) and Ataa Relief in Idleb and Aleppo governorates and will utilize these existing warehouse for the prepositioning. The release of the items from the IOM Gaziantep warehouse and/ or IP warehouses in Syria will be based on the established SNFI/ CCCM Cluster&#x2019;s Review Board (RB) mechanism. Distributions will be conducted in pre-identified cluster priority locations and target the most vulnerable affected populations. Through various monitoring mechanisms and tools such as Third-Party Monitoring (TPM), Commodity Tracking System (CTS), electronic monitoring and more, proper monitoring of the distributions will be ensured. 

During the onset of a crisis that requires the release of stock NFIs, the RB accepts or rejects IP submissions for the full coverage of all households affected in locations where the partner already operates. As is a standard practice of the CS mechanism, partner selection is documented and managed by the RB consisting of SNFI/CCCM clusters and IOM. The partner selection is based on needs assessments and the beneficiary lists and its selection criteria are mandatory to be shared by the partner with IOM prior to the release of the stock. IOM will inform the RB that NGOs responding to the needs of newly displaced persons from Maaret Al Numan and surrounding areas will be prioritized if the needs of this displacement have not been covered by other sources. SCHF funding under this Reserve Allocation will be used to meet these needs based on submitted assessments of active cluster partners and CS applicants. IOM will track the response for the purpose of SCHF&apos;s TPM being able to follow up later. The SNFI Cluster recommends, that the included plastic sheets in this Reserve Allocation could be used for newly displaced and/or winterization of protracted IDPs living in damaged tents or IDPs affected by floods during the winter.

IOM will ensure that IPs give priority to those most in need including female-headed households, people with disabilities, children, and other vulnerable groups. IOM will ensure that
selected implementing partners are accountable to affected populations. Also, to mitigate Gender-Based Violence (GBV) risks, IOM ensures that information provision and feedback mechanisms are designed to be accessible, effective, and confidential and respond to complaints, regardless of whether corrective measures can immediately be put in place.

The project further aims to provide 30,000 tarpaulins (plastic sheets) as the current tarpaulin stock will be depleted soon given the high needs to improve damaged tents and to support families living in damaged/unfinished buildings that cannot be rehabilitated immediately. In coordination with the SNFI Cluster and the CS review board, the stocks to be procured in this project will be distributed to the IDP populations and most vulnerable families affected by the recent intensification in southern Idleb particularly from Ma&#x2019;arrat An-Nu&#x2019;man, Saraqab and the surrounding towns and villages. Beneficiary selection criteria can be viewed in Annex 4. The total number of targeted beneficiaries for the project is around 126,000 individuals, which includes 36,000 NFI beneficiaries, and 90,0000 emergency shelter assistance.</narrative>
