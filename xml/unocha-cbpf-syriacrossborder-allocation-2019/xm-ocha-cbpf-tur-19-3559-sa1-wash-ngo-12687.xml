   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Integrated Emergency WASH Response to IDPs in camps and informal settlements in north Idleb, with increased consideration to the needs of disabled persons.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This intervention is specifically designed around the Strategic and Cluster Objectives as outlined in the THF 2019 Allocation Paper, in addition to the capacity (resources amp expertise) of Syria Relief and their geographic access within the targeted sites in Idleb. 

The selected populations have been targeted in accordance with the Severity Indexing provided by the WASH Cluster to help ensure those most in need of immediate and life-saving assistance are prioritized under this Intervention. Further emphasis (compared to previous interventions) has been placed on the equitable and equal access to services for People with Disability (PwD) and women.

The Overall Project Objective is designed around two key Outcomes: 

1. Increased access to sanitation facilities (new construction amp rehabilitations suitable for PwD amp sex segregation, locks provided), the provision of emergency personal hygiene supplies (gender appropriate) and improved environmental living conditions (provision of waste bins, awareness raising sessions, and solid waste removal, latrine cleaning services amp desludging through Cash for Work 50/50 m/f). 
2. Increased access to safe water (25ltr/pd/pp, decreased distance to a water point, chlorinated amp tested water supplier, sex segregated distribution points) for drinking (23 liters) and personal hygiene use (additional 2 liters per day per person, reaching 25 liters in total above Sphere Standards). 

These Outcomes, and corresponding Outputs and Activities, align with the Cluster Specific Objectives 1 amp 2 (Sanitation, Solid Waste management and live saving WASH services, supply and enhanced hygienic practices) and the Strategic Objective 1 (Provision of life saving assistance to most in need). 

SR will target 22 informal sites (23,178 individuals) in Idleb which are currently being supported the Polish Humanitarian Agency (PAH) until June 2019, after which point all WASH support will be discontinued. In early 2019 SR began communications with both WATAN and PAH regarding continued service provision for these sites. WATAN and SR agreed (funding dependent) to take over these sites once PAH had completed their intervention. Both agencies proposed an even split of these sites, where each partner agreed to provide WASH support for 22 sites. SR will coordinate with PAH, WATAN, and WASH cluster to ensure good implementation.

With the support of OCHA SR will ensure the continuation of basic services whilst also increasing access (increase quantity considering needs of PwD amp women) and quality (meeting Sphere standards) of essential WASH services. Increased focus will be placed on ensuring PwD have access to appropriate sanitation facilities, the Protection concerns of women and girls are considered, and environmental health and hygiene promotion are enhanced.

An increased focus will be placed on Protection mainstreaming and Accountability. SR has a well-established Complaint Response Mechanism in place, with a full team of staff who have been training on its use and function. The CRM operates online and offline with various communication channels available to project participants (whatsapp, phone, email, viber physical boxes and letters). During all Interventions complain boxes are provided and CRM materials are distributed which outline the CRM process and its confidentiality. In addition to the CRM, Syria Relief has PSEA and Child Safe Guarding policies and mechanisms in place to ensure every effort is made to protect all programme participants.</narrative>
