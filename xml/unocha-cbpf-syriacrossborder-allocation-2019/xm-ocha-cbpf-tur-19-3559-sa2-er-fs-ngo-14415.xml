  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Takaful in cooperation with IMMAR organization has designed this program in order to establish a network of competitive and innovative agricultural value chains in the targeted locations, (Afrin, Sheikh El-Hadid, Sharan, Atareb and Daret Azza), so that will contribute to the overall goal of sustainably increasing the level of commercialization of agriculture in the early recovery through three main interventions:
First: supporting 440 farmers (males and females), 2200 individuals (506 M, 528 W, 660 B, 506 G) who are the most vulnerable and have already a cultivated land with wheat at least 1 hectare by providing them with the needed agricultural supplies for 1 hectare (fertilizers, pesticides, supplementary irrigation support) using restricted vouchers, as well as, income generation through the marketing of all harvests of the project&apos;s beneficiaries in fair price and prevent the dealers&apos; monopoly of wheat, where We  have signed an MOU with Syrian public establishment for Grain (SPEG) which obliges SPEG to buy all harvests of the project&apos;s beneficiaries with a fair price. Further, we will conduct the related training programs &quot;the best practices in agriculture, irrigation and marketing&quot; as well as providing technical support for farmers who cultivated wheat throughout regular field visits.
Second: The rehabilitation for food community asset &#x201C;set of silo&#x201D; which will complete one value chain in the project areas and enhance food security and increasing resilience of the community, the silos consider the only a safe place to keep grain away from tampering with birds, insects and erosion factors and the percentage of loss to zero. Silos also apply the rules and health requirements that make the stock suitable for human use after the storage period, so that SPEG can buy and store the farmers&apos; harvest. the project includes also the light rehabilitation of major artery, access and feeder roads to the silos, where the difficulty of transporting goods especially the wheat continues to jeopardize the food security of the affected people in the project area. The Afrin district&#x2019;s Wheat farmers and their families, 71656 individuals out of 229667 &quot;as 60% of Afrin HHs works in agriculture and 52% of them grow wheat&quot; (16481 M, 17197 W, 21497 B, 16481 G)&#x202C; will benefit from rehab of silos set.
Third: Supporting the most vulnerable IDPs and HCs rebuild their livelihoods and restore the food security-related community assets to service to gain access to food production and lives saving of population through Cash For Work component, which will target 60 males and females of skilled and unskilled laborer (including 5 persons with disabilities) who lost their livelihoods, where we will provide 20 work opportunities for skilled labor who will work in the rehabilitation (silos, road) for 2 months, and 40 work opportunities for unskilled labor who will work in the SPEG (silos, mills, Bakeries- PWD will work in frame of office works) for three paid months, where SPEG will commit hiring those workers for at least other 3 months after closing the project.
To ensure local community support, KIs including local actors and IDPs representatives in each targeted location were interviewed to take their suggestions and will be informed about the project&apos;s goals and activities at the beginning of the project.
The project will deliver a good example for complementarity between partners Takaful and IMAAR, where IMAAR will use its experience in rehabilitation and construction to conduct the silos rehabilitation with Takaful&#x2019;s following up, while Takaful will use its experience in food security sector to conduct agriculture activities in cooperation with IMAAR.
We will coordinate with FSL and ER clusters in all implementation areas. So, in case we were not able to run project activities in the mentioned areas, we will share our updates, and the needs assessment with clusters and donor to choose another location.</narrative>
