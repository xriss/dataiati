  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Project Summary : Ahl Horan Association (AHA) in this proposal intends to enhance the living conditions of the conflict-affected population living in Daret Azze sub-district as the needs are still huge in that area based on the information provided by HNO 2019 and to the SA strategic paper for the second round. The action that AHA will take is rehabilitation of 450 shelter units in Daret Azze city and three communities near it which are Deir Samaan, Kafrantin, Qatoura and support those communities in providing a life-saving and life sustaining shelter support through rehabilitation process within 8 months.

The idea of proposing this project came from the previous implementation of shelter rehabilitation for damaged houses and shelter units in Daret Azze city by AHA where the host communities and IDPs lives in a very bad condition and due to small amount of fund AHA could only address 300 HHs while the needs assessment showed that huge needs for most vulnerable population are still there and in need of shelter rehabilitation not only in Daret Azze city but also in communities near it, where no intervention before happened.

This suggested intervention will be, as you may see in the activities in line with Shelter Rhab Guidelines (SRG) of GRADE 2 damages houses, the design of program, considering protection issues, designing the activities and engaging the community, all was designed in line with SRG.

A focus on moderate damage (Grade 2) allows a maximization of impact, in order to assist as many beneficiaries as possible especially IDPs and returnees which their shelter units were damaged as a result of aerial/land attacks or unfinished units that needs basic rehabilitation to sustain their lives, windows and doors for instance as the needs assessment done by our teams and engineers showed that many of IDPs are living in very bad condition. Units targeted in the RNA was checked for the HLP issues and no major issues checked. In addition to the repair of small damages in walls, doors, broken windows, locks and plumbing services, AHA will install one solar panel system in each targeted HHs (if not existed) to provide an alternative source of lighting in an energy scarce environment and to enhance privacy and decrease protection issues for women and children.

AHA seeks to address the needs for the most vulnerable people in targeted locations and this definition of the needs came from needs assessment done by AHA, Pictures of the damaged houses are attached in documents in addition to needs reports and calls for interventions from areas LCs. Our approach is toward more qualitative and sustainable response to Shelter repair, with the goal of improving livelihoods and promoting stability, reintegration of IDPs into host communities and a return to normalcy for all targeted HHs. In addition to enhancing physical stability and safety via Shelter repair of GRADE 2 damaged HHs.

The provision of shelter meets one of the basic survival needs of women, girls, boys and men and can strengthen protection in a physical sense this project aims to improve the shelter and living condition for approximately(Boys 594 Girls 644 Men 544 Women 693 Total 2475) of the hosts, returnees and IDPs population. For the IDPs the beneficiaries would be (Boys 333 Girls 360 Men 305 Women 388 Total 1386) while for the HC the numbers would be (Boys 244 Girls 265 Men 223 Women 284 Total 1015)

AHA will coordinate with the responsible organization of the served area to cover other needs to enhance the living condition that may include livelihood opportunities for the most vulnerable people.
