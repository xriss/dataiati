  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project will provide the primary and secondary healthcare services to cover the urgent needs of northern rural of Hama and southern rural of Idleb after the last military escalation since 28th of April 2019, the project aims to support Alsham Central Hospital which operates by AHF in Hazarin in Idleb, a central, referral and safe hospital (2 underground floors (bunkers) and one above ground) and one of the few remaining hospitals in the area and the last hospital serving rural of Hama because all hospitals in the area are suspended or even out of service as a result of attacks on them, according to GZP health cluster a total of 49 health facilities are partially or totally suspended. 
The hospital will serve over than 3,000 patients per month in the different specialized services we offer for free, the two main surgical services we currently provide are orthopedic amp general surgeries amp consultations for these surgeries, we also have one neurology specialist and one Internist doctor, who also specializes in Cardiology, provide consultations in the Emergency Department amp the follow-up with our ICU inpatients, we have 76 staff members including 8 specialized doctors and 6 resident surgeons working in the 8 sections of the hospital:
1- Operation theater with 4 rooms, 2-ICU with 4 beds and 4 ventilators, 3-Inpatient Departments has 14 beds (10 for men + 4 for women), 4-Surgical clinics (2 clinics: general + orthopedic), 5-Laboratory Department, 6-Radiology Department, 7-Emergency Department (5 beds).
Alsham Central Hospital comes under Hama Health Directorate, amp according to the Directorate, the hospital covers 75% of Hama&apos;s healthcare needs in our areas of specialty (primary care, consultations, orthopedic and general surgeries). 
Hospital beneficiaries in many cases are multiple trauma patients amp multiple trauma is a challenging task, amp every minute can make the difference between life amp death.

In the other hand our ambulance services is the first point of contact for the people when injuries occur, which then brings them into our hospital or even to other hospitals, as a result of the military escalation the medical referral network severely damaged and it is currently reorganizing the referral mechanism and relocating several of the vehicles and ambulances to the gaps, so the project will contribute in providing ambulance and referral services and filling the gaps through 5 branches in 5 different locations:
A- 3 ambulance system branches to serve the PiN in northern rural of Hama and southern rural of Idleb:
- Hazarin with 4 ambulances.
- AlM&apos;ara with 4 ambulances.
- Ariha with 3 ambulances
B- 2 ambulance system branches to serve the IDPs in the destination locations:
- Dana with 3 ambulances.
- Afrin with 3 ambulances. 
Since we started the ambulance service in 2015, we&#x2019;ve served 103,001 patients. AHF has a total of 29 ambulances 12 on loan to the Idleb Health Directorate and 17 ambulances used by AHF, amp we played a main role in establishing IHD central ambulance system and its communication network in Idleb, we provided them with all needed experience, SoPs, templates and trained staff with the 12 loaned ambulances, we are a part of this central ambulance system and our operations manager is the operations manager for all ambulances in the central ambulance system, our ambulance services are very much needed during emergencies, trauma, and referrals. If the patients aren&apos;t able to reach us, our well-equipped ambulances provide the transportation and transfer them to where they&apos;re referred to or to our hospital. This has helped in reducing the number of wounded victims who used to cross the border seeking medical care.

So the project will contribute in covering the urgent gaps in the primary and secondary healthcare services in Hazarin and the nearby areas of Rural of Hama and Rural of Idleb, also it&apos;ll covering the needs for ambulance and referral services in Hazarin, AlM&apos;ara, Ariha, Dana and Afrin.</narrative>
