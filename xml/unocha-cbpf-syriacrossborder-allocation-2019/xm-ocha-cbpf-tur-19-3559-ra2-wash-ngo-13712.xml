   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Enhance access to live-saving safe and adequate WASH services for the newly arrived IDPs in Idleb governorate</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">BINAA will provide 2274 newly arrived IDP HHs (13874 individuals) (2978 men, 3127 women, 3813 boys, 3956 girls) in 22 IDP sites in Idleb governorate (Idleb, Harim, and Ma&#x2019;arrat An&#x2019;Nu man sub-districts) with following services:
1- Provide the IDP sites residents with daily 25 liters per person per day of chlorinated water for drinking, cooking and domestic purposes for 5 months.

2- Supply the IDP sites with 82 new prefabricated latrines as per the need to align with sphere standards (1 latrine for every 35 individuals).

3- Supply and install water tanks in the IDP sites. The tanks will be sufficient to cover the daily usage needs of the residents (25 liters per person per day).

4- Supply the IDP sites with 100 waste containers as per the need and number of population, number of the containers was calculated based on 0.5 liter of waste per person per day.

5- Provide the IDP sites residents with hygiene kits (Soap, Tooth brush for adult, Tooth paste adult, Shampoo for adult, Sanitary napkins, Laundry bucket, Laundry soap (powder), Detergent for cleaning dishes, Disinfection solution for cleaning, Baby Diapers, Tooth paste child, Tooth brush for child, shampoo for babies and Jerry can). Each family will receive one kit, each hygiene kit is enough for 3 months for 1 family.

6- Provide the IDP sites residents with solid waste collection and toilets cleaning services on a daily basis along 5 months through cash for work modality. 110 daily workers from the IDPs who lives in the same camps will implement these works, and they will receive incentives for 5 months for that.

7- Provide the IDP sites residents with septic tanks desludgment services as per the plans and before they are full along 5 months.

8- Increase the awareness of the IDP sites residents about practices and behaviors for the self-hygiene, and leishmaniasis and other similar diseases. BINAA will do that through its field team activation and through distribution of awareness materials and brochures to the targeted families, on the other hand, volunteers from female staff will conduct 750 visit for about 25% of the total Families to improve their awareness and practices. 

The list of the camps with the locations and exact numbers for the interventions is attached to the proposal (Attachment 1).

To ensure winter appropriate intervention, the latrines will be ground-leveled by 25 cm. The septic tanks which are related to the latrines block are closed by concrete cover and will be desludged before they are full. In case of flooding, the frequency of desludging will be increased accordingly. Moreover, the waste containers will be covered by closing cap in order to avoid any refilling by the rain water. Furthermore, each latrine block will be provided with gutter (which dispose the rain water from the roof of block) and will be connected to the septic tank.

Binaa field team will monitor the situation of IDP movement inside targeted camps and will be reported directly to the WASH and CCCM clusters. In case of reaching the trigger either thresholds, and after the approval of the related clusters to respond and maintain the financial resources, Binaa will provide the water trucking and will increase the number of the latrines blocks accordingly. These changes on the activities will be also reflected on the 4W&#x2019;s and progress reports for the # of beneficiaries.

BINAA will improve the capacity and awareness of their field staff in terms of anti-insects to eliminate leishmaniasis and other similar diseases. BINAA will do that through providing training to their field staff on anti-insects to eliminate leishmaniasis and other diseases by specialists. We will coordinate with Mentor Initiative for this purpose.
