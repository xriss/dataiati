   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project aims at providing integrated education services to school children to better meet their diverse needs and priorities and help create a safer and more secure environment for children in the most affected locations in NW Syria including IDPs and host communities, with attention to children with special needs. 
The project will improve equitable access, capacity and quality of education services and enhance psychosocial wellbeing of children including children with special needs in Atareb subdistrict in Aleppo and Salqin subdistrict in Idleb, targeting 3 schools in Salqin subdistrict and 7 schools (5 of which have two shifts) in Atareb subdistrict. These schools were selected based on a needs assessment that showed that these schools are in need of all kinds of assistance and they are not receiving any kind of support from any side.
The project will implement comprehensive educational activities ranging from the rehabilitation of schools and equipping them with all their needs, gender-sensitive and disability-sensitive modification, to running schools, provision of education and PSS services, and provision of teacher training and supervision through the following activities:
1. Rehabilitation, light repairs and modification of classrooms and wash facilities to ensure better protective educational environment and enhance access of people with special needs and ensure gender-sensitive and disability-sensitive WASH facilities (to ensure even more integrated approach, this component will be funded Swasia Charity Foundation USA)
2. Back to learning campaign targeting children and caregivers.
3. Equipping schools with all their needs of equipment, furniture and educational means, including safety amp security equipment and solar power equipment.
4. Providing learning materials and school bags for boys and girls. 
5. Providing formal education for students in the targeted schools by running the schools until the end of the educational year, providing running and maintenance costs, teacher incentives and teaching materials and supervising the educational process, to ensure quality education.
6. Establishing 10 Parent-Teacher associations (PTAs) one in each school 
7. Providing Psychosocial Support for children in schools through 10 PSS facilitators.
