   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Enhancing the Access to Clean Water for People in Deir Hassan and Nearest Camps Through a Sustainable and Cost-effective Intervention, Link with ASO2</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Qatar Red Crescent (QRC) and Ahl Horan Association (AHA) will undertake a project together focusing on the rehabilitation of WASH infrastructure in the Deir Hassan community and the nearest camps in northern Idlib. QRC will have overall responsibility as the leading partner organization and manage the project from Gaziantep, Turkey, as well as having a small project-team inside Syria. AHA will be the implementing partner and will lead the coordination with the local councils and the water-units, camp management attached to them.
The overall aim of the project is to increase the access to safe and clean drinking water for residents of Deir Hassan community and nearest camps in northern Idlib (Abteen, Zamzam, Alrahma, Alghab, Naseem Alrahma1, Nasaem Alrahma2, and Ataa camps), Syria, and as a result of this the reduce of the dependence on water trucking and build community resilience in the face of the ongoing humanitarian crisis, 
In Deir Hassan, the damage to the WASH infrastructure in addition to the high increase of the population of the community due to the massive movement of IDPs toward it due to its location which is near to the Turkish borders has increased the reliance of local population upon water trucking as an alternative source of water. This option is sub-optimal as it creates dependency on external sources, and the water quality, as well as the means of transporting, is hygienically unreliable and can transmit water-borne diseases. Furthermore, trucked-in water, due to the lack of regulatory structures, can be subject to high price fluctuations.
The number of beneficiaries who will benefit through access to cleaner and safer water for their daily needs approximates 30,000 people 21,500 of them are IDPs that are currently residents both in the community and the nearest camps.
The intervention will focus on rehabilitating two water stations, constructing high water tank and connecting with an aim to extend the system to connect the water tanks of the targeted camps near the city to the water tank which is a step forward to deliver the water directly to the water tanks in the campsites and graveling and landing the roads where the water line will pass, and this is will put an end to the dependence of these camps on water supply by trucks. 
Moreover, the intervention will also target the sewage network by doing the necessary rehabilitation to reduce the harmful effects of the absence of the maintenance due to the limited resources of the local council
QRC and AHA discussed with the proposed intervention with the stakeholders of the project, including the local council, the IDPs in the camps and the humanitarian actors in the area, the discussion indicated that this intervention would solve a known long-term challenge in both the community and the camps.
QRC/AHA, together with the local council structures and their water-unit, will promote a tariff-based management system for the water structures. And camp management team QRC/AHA will organize training- based capacity-building in the introduction and management of these systems. Training in water quality testing will also be provided. And then QRC/AHA will mentor the application of the effective tariff system and will support the local council to apply it and solve any faced challenge with providing the operational costs for running the rehabilitated water stations at a descending rate to have a smooth transition to the full application of the cost recovery system.
QRC/AHA will coordinate with all organization of the served camps to cover the operational cost of the delivered water to these camps and this is will be a cost-effective solution as it will reduce the cost of the water, in addition, will enhance the quality of this water and will also mitigate all the negative impacts of the water trucking.
This intervention is consistent with the strategic objectives of the WASH and CCCM cluster to provide a sustainable and cost-effective solution.</narrative>
