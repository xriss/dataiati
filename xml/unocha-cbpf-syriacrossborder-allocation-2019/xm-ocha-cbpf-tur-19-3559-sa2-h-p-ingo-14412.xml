   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Improving the living conditions of vulnerable, conflict-affected men, women and children through integrated physical rehabilitation, mental health and psycho-social support and protection services</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project focuses on improving access to Physical Rehabilitation, Mental Health and Psychosocial Support (MHPSS) and Protection services for persons with disabilities (PWDs) and war-related injuries, as well as  improving their overall protective environment through the availability of these services in the areas with a high level of needs. IMC will provide Physical Rehabilitation services through its support to two Rehabilitation Centers in Al Dana and Salqin towns in the Harim district of Idleb, and through mobile rehabilitation teams in order to reduce access barriers for people with disabilities. The project activities will have a special focus on children with physical disabilities by linking different them to various services, such as the provision of psychosocial support and group activities provided under this project and through referrals to other services such as healthcare and education provided by IMC through other projects or partners. IMC will support the physical rehabilitation service for 12 months through covering staff salaries and running costs, providing assistive devices for beneficiaries, as well as capacity building for rehab staff through technical training sessions and supervision by qualified physical therapists and IMC technical specialists. IMC will also provide caregivers and parents of PWDs with training to enhance their knowledge and skills to assist them to provide quality care at home.

In order to ensure holistic service provision for rehabilitation beneficiaries, MHPSS and Protection services will be integrated and provided at the Rehabilitation Centers at Al Dana and Salqin and the mobile rehab teams. Psychosocial Workers (PSWs) will provide targeted psychosocial support for PWDs, their caregivers and family members. Psychosocial services will include emotional support, basic counselling, psychoeducation, brief psychological interventions, such as WHO&#x2019;s Problem Management Plus (PM+) and Self-Help Plus (SH+), coping skills training, relaxation sessions, awareness raising of available MHPSS and Protection services, referral mechanisms and follow-up. Psychosocial support will be provided for individuals and groups at the center, in other suitable community based locations, and through home visits. PSWs will conduct community-based awareness raising sessions, targeting all community members and IDPs, to raise awareness on disability and related social barriers and on MHPSS and Protection issues and services and to support the reduction of stigmas attached to mental health. Training in technical topics related to disability, MHPSS and Protection services will be delivered to service providers and other relevant community stakeholders, contributing to the overall aim of improving quality of and access to services for PWDs, as well as improving the overall protective environment.
