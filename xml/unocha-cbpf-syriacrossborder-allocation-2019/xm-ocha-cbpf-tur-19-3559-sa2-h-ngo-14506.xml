   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Provision of specialized health services and psychosocial support to vulnerable conflict-affected population in northern Idlib</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed project aims to contribute to establish a safer and more secure environment and to increase availability of services for conflict-affected population in northern Idlib governorate. The project will focus on service provision for the most vulnerable groups in and out of camps who have limited access to regular services through a targeted health and psychosocial support intervention. 

The project will respond to ASO1 &#x2013; Helping to create a safer and more secure environment for children and ASO2 &#x2013; Improving the living conditions of vulnerable conflict-affected people both in camps and out of camps, in line with Health Cluster Specific Objectives. 

The project will target 3 locations in Dana sub-district which have been directly affected by the recent IDP influx since April 2019: Al Dana Town, Deir Hassan Cluster and Al Jolan camp. The project will provide specialized health and psychosocial services which are currently not provided in the targeted areas, reaching a total catchment population of approximately 185,581 displaced individuals and host community residents (indirect beneficiaries). 

DDD clinics have been responding to the health needs of camp and host community residents in Dana sub-district continuously since 2012 and strong links with the local community have led DDD to develop the proposed project, responding to the priorities and needs identified by the community itself. The project has also been designed in close coordination with the Health Cluster, Protection Cluster and humanitarian actors in the area to ensure that integrated and relevant services are provided to the targeted population. 

As highlighted by the assessments conducted by the field team and as per evidence presented by the Health Cluster, health needs across Dana sub-district remain high and demand for services continue to increase with continuous arrival of new IDPs in the camp. DDD is one of the key health service providers in Al Dana Town, Deir Hassan Cluster and Al Jolan camp providing comprehensive Primary Health Care services, Sexual and Reproductive Health and Mental Health and Psychosocial Support through fixed PHC Centers. Support of these facilities in 2020 is essential to maintain availability of services to returning patients and people depending on the services, and to respond to the health needs of new IDPs arriving in the areas served by the clinics. Moreover, adaptation of services to respond to the specific needs of the most vulnerable groups severely impacted by hostilities and displacement is essential. 

The target population for the specialized services to be offered include conflict-affected children under 12 years old, high risk pregnant women, older people, people with disabilities, people living with chronic conditions and other vulnerable groups with limited access to health care. A total of 37.200 individuals are expected to directly benefit from this intervention (direct beneficiaries).

The project will provide life-saving humanitarian assistance to the most vulnerable people to alleviate suffering, in line with HRP 2019 objective 1.</narrative>
