   <narrative xml:lang="EN">BINAA will provide life-saving shelter improvement assistance to the most vulnerable IDP and host community HHs in Bazagha, Qabasin, Al Bab and Mare&apos; communities in Aleppo governorate. 

BINAA will provide shelter repair and functional upgrades valued at an average of $650 for 800 HHs (4,800 individuals) (1,030 men, 1,080 women, 1,320 boys, and 1,370 girls) as following 150 in Bazagha, 100 in Qabasin, 275 in Al Bab and 275 in Mare&apos;. The repair works will enable the target communities to use local materials and work through local contractors to improve their living conditions, fostering a sense of ownership, responsibility, and resilience while supporting local markets. 

We will also rehabilitate 4 collective centers in Al bab community, Aleppo governorate accommodated by 57 IDP HHs (232 individuals) (61 men, 54 women, 54 boys and 63 girls) providing safe and dignified housing conditions. BINAA identified the following collective center in Al bab community, Al bab subdistrict, Aleppo governorate for the intervention 
Alfaraj Center accommodated by 9 HHs Jinieh Center (16 HHs) Alsaoor 1 (24 HHs) and Alsaoor 2 (8 HHs).

In total, BINAA will provide rehabilitation and upgrading of life-saving and sustaining shelter spaces to 857 households (50% IDPs) (5,032 individuals) (1,091 men, 1,134 women, 1,374 boys and 1,433 girls).
Beneficiaries numbers for the shelter units rehabilitation calculated based on average number of HH members of 6 persons. Real beneficiaries number figures presented for collective centers.


Shelter repair beneficiaries will be IDP and host community households living in an inadequate shelter that does not meet minimum SPHERE minimum standards for square meters of covered living space per person and has inadequate privacy or protection from the elements, settlement planning and WASH facilities. We will target HHs that have light to medium damage but remain structurally sound. Works include doors and windows repair or replacement, partition installation, recaulking and sealing cracks and holes in walls, and WASH facilities repairs. The works will ensure increased privacy between male and females, host and hosted families that enhance gender sensitive response. Furthermore, for HHs with disabled persons, additional works will be included to respond to their needs by including disability friendly entrance and toilet facilities (e.g. use of a simple ramp with a handrail for using wheelchairs at the building entrance and seating provisions for toilets). 

In collective centers, BINAA prioritized the overcrowded centers and unfinished buildings with the intervention. They identified 4 collective centers as per of a community level assessment conducted by BINAA. Collective center repairs vary between replacement of doors and windows, installation of partitions to allow families privacy, sealing or repairing holes and cracks in walls and roofs, repair of WASH facilities within the center, and preparing another part (unfinished) of the building to expand the capacity of the overcrowded center. To enhance gender sensitive response, necessary adaptations that particularly affect women and girls will include appropriate lighting, separate toilets and showers for men and women, accessible facilities for people with disabilities (disability friendly entrance and toilet facilities), areas for bathing, washing of clothing, and partitions to create spaces for different households and additional partitions within households to create privacy for men and women.


To participate in the project HHs and building owners should agree on the terms of assistance and sign a contract that allows the IDP household to stay in the build for one year for free to ensure that HLP guidance are considered and utilized. To benefit from the project, all beneficiaries should present valid HLP documents that verify the ownership of properties.</narrative>
