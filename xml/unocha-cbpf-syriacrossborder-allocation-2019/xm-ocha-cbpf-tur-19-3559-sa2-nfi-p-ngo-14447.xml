   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Improve the living conditions of conflict-affected populations through the repair of 500 damaged houses while integrating protection mechanisms to ensure accessibility, privacy, and safety for persons with disabilities and vulnerable groups in NW Syria.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project will provide house repairing for 500 households (HHs) of the most vulnerable IDPs and host communities (including 969 men, 1109 women, 661 boys, 729 girls) through the repair of 500 partly damaged HH-Grade 2 in ten communities in the sub districts of Atareb and Suran, Aleppo governorate. Project rationale is based on the multisector needs assessment (MSNA) of SRD conducted in November 2019 (Attachment.1), as will be highlighted in the context and funding section below. 

The protection intervention consists of the provision of specialized and community-based protection services for beneficiaries through case management services including in kind assistance, structured psychosocial support (PSS), referrals, an integrated shelter team (i.e., construction engineers and engineer assistants) and the protection outreach team (i.e., outreach case workers and outreach workers) reaching a target of 4,522 individuals (1367 men, 2223 women, 382 boys, 550 girls) and addressing vulnerabilities that are related to disability, elderly, physical/psychological injuries, severe neglect, and lack of appropriate care.

Given SRD currently operates two community centers located in Kelly, Termanin, Idleb (supported by UNFPA and WVI) that are proximal to the target areas of shelter activities (Attachment.13), the nearest community centers&#x2019; activities will be integrated with the shelter activities to reach the same vulnerable groups of persons with disabilities (PWD), elderly and female-headed household (FHH), and child-headed households (CHH) to achieve comprehensive benefits of shelter, protection and consolidated referral services. 

The mechanism of the integrated approach will be utilized during project the implementation of the project activities as follows:

SRD shelter teams will responsible for conducting the technical assessment and prepare the Bills of Quantity (BOQs) for each house and conducting housing, land, and property (HLP) due diligence to select 500 damaged households that meet Grade-2 and HLP criteria. Contractors will then be identified who will be responsible for household repair shelter teams will visit the houses during the implementation of repairs to prepare the Works Progress Reports and quality assurance.
 
During this same time, SRD protection teams will ensure that all vulnerable groups are involved in project activities, and will train the shelter teams on detection of vulnerability cases, and accompany the shelter teams during the door to door verification visits to the beneficiaries&apos; houses to identify protection cases and refer them to SRD community centers to respond. In addition, protection teams will ensure that technical assessments conducted by shelter teams meet the demand of persons with disabilities and the elderly, as well as conducting trainings and awareness sessions throughout the life of the project at several levels, that will have targeted the local councils, contractors, construction workers and beneficiaries.

During the life of the project, the protection technical coordinator and manager in Syria and Turkey will train, mentor and supervise the field protection teams to implement their work plans, develop the training and awareness materials required. In addition, they will refer the most at-risk cases received to the near identified SRD&apos;s centers and other NGOs, that these cases need services to give them priority of selection from services of this project.</narrative>
