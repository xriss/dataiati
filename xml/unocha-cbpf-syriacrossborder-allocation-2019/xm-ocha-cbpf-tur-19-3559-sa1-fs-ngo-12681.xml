   <narrative xml:lang="EN">As a response to the needs which have been identified while conducting the needs assessment and FGD in the targeted areas and based on the THF priorities for the first allocation of 2019, this project will assist the targeted vulnerable categories through lessening the financial burdens. This will be applied by supporting 400 local farmers who own lands, but they are in need of agricultural inputs so IYD will provide them with these inputs to enable each farmer to plant 2 donum with agriculture kits which include (seeds, fertilizer, pesticide, fungicide, plowing and fuel ) to plant vegetable crops (bean, cowpea, zucchini, and cucumber), bean and cowpea crops will contribute to improving soil properties  through motivating the denitrifying bacteria to nitrogen fixation. The other crops (zucchini and cucumber) are considered economic crops because they will be harvested more than once in the season.
Planting two donum with the above- mentioned vegetable crops would produce nearly 2-3-ton vegetable crops which will cover the markets need of these vegetables at acceptable prices for HHs and IDPs as the targeted areas have been receiving a large number of IDPs for two years. Also, selling the produced vegetables in the local market will generate good profits for targeted farmers so that they would be able to plant their lands during the next seasons.
Moreover, IYD will organize training sessions on good agriculture practice GAP, which includes Correct timing of operations, Integrated Pest and Disease Management (IPM), fertilizer application, harvest and post-harvest management. In this regard, IYD will select five typical fields owned and managed by expert farmers from the benefited farmers. These five fields will be the training sites, and these expert farmers will contribute to this training based on their experience level. The 400 targeted farmers, in turn, will be able to gain the knowledge practically from the agronomists who will do real experiments in the presence of beneficiaries. Meanwhile, IYD&#x2019;s technical team will conduct regular field visits to targeted farms and provide farmers with technical consulting during the planting season.


On the other side, this project will be a part of the livestock value chain improving in Al-Bab district through supporting 100 cows&#x2019; breeders who own no more than 2 cows. Accordingly, one of these cows will receive reproductive follow-up treatment and artificial insemination (this will lead to an increase in the number of livestock). Each cow will be provided with 10 kg of pellet fodder for 5 months and 5 KG of green fodder for 3 months (produced through hydroponic barley units)green fodder will improve the health and reproductive health for the selected cows. IYD will apply and adopt modern methods to control the sheep&apos;s reproductive cycle. This will be done by implementing hormones&#x2019; program on 1000 sheep during reproductive cycle off-season. Accordingly, the application of that based on scientific foundations will lead to having 3 births in two years instead of 2, as well as giving births to twins. Also, these sheep will be supported with fodder each sheep will receive one KG of pellet per day for 5 months. It is mentionable that 40% of benefited livestock breeders will be women headed-households. The success of the reproductive process is linked to the cows and sheep&#x2019; feeding and health status since the good feeding and healthcare supports the reproductive system. 
An advisory committee will be formed from both hosts and IDPs to participate in designing, implementing, and evaluating the project phases.
IYD has good relationships with the local governance bodies and local communities in Al-Bab and Jarablus and has two offices in Al-Bab and Jarablus communities that serve three ongoing projects</narrative>
