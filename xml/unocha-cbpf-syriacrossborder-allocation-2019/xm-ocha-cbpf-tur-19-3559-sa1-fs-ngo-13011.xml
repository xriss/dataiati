  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project aims to reduce the vulnerable breeders&apos; needs in Azaz and Afrin districts Northern of Aleppo governorate. For 9 months, Ahl Horan Association (AHA) will be responsible of delivering a life-sustaining livelihood supports through implementing a project mainly related to support the livestock in the aforementioned targeted areas due to the need existed and the difficulties encountering breeders. 
activities enrolled in this proposal include
1- Assisting 1,000 livestock breeders (in district (Azaz and Afrin District) with the necessary fodders for their livestock (only sheep and goats are to be supported). 
2- Providing vaccinations and medicines through propulsion mobile clinics, where 4 veterinaries and 4 assistants in 4 mobile clinics would be ready and prepared to assist the targeted beneficiaries. Each sub-district is allocated to be assisted with 2. 
3- Additionally, extension services training and follow-up visits would be an essential part of the project that endeavors to not only supplying the targeted groups with fodders, but also empowering them, which can be done through scheduled trainings introducing the main issues encountered and the best solutions to resolve them. Apart from the fodder distribution and the trainings, the veterinaries would do follow-up visits. The objective behind these visits is to evaluate the breeders&apos; situation, support and assist them when needed. 
As for the implementation method, AHA is planning to execute these activities directly through its field team in Syria. Fodder along with other required items are going to be purchased after advertising a tender and a contract is signed between AHA on one hand and the chosen suppliers on the other hand. The tender advertisement and the whole process till signing the contract and start receiving the goods will be completely done in accordance with the internal procurement policy and guidelines. 
MoUs would be signed with the interested Local Councils (LC) within the targeted areas since they are considered to be the formal authorities and the main communication channels. LCs will provide AHA with the primary list of beneficiaries and the MampE team will be responsible of completing the verification process to ensure that all registered names in the final beneficiary list have met the project&apos;s criteria. When it comes to the targeted groups, AHA will target the most vulnerable breeders to guarantee supporting the eligible beneficiaries regardless of their gender. The eligibility criteria include the following: 
1- Poor households with no/little income below 100 USD.
2- The main source of income is livestock breeding.
3- HH has an experience with livestock breeding.
4- HH  Caring for elderly, sick, disabled or injured family members. 
5- Female-headed household.
6- Child-headed household
7- Elderly-headed household
8- HHs with pregnant/ lactating women 

Azaz and Afrin sub-districts can be reasonably deemed to be safe and secure comparing to other sub-districts in Idleb governorate. Despite this, the security situation across Syria can be rapidly deteriorated as the incidents have proved over the last years. Generally speaking, the security situation was, still and will always be the main risk of which all humanitarian projects consider. For this reason, AHA will be assessing the security situation before and during the activities implementation to secure the safety of the field team, beneficiaries, suppliers and all other involved parties. The mitigation measures include the continuous evaluation of the security situation and avoid any potential risky incident. AHA has complete access in each sub-district enabling it to accomplish the proposed project especially if MoUs are signed with authorities. AHA has. For the association capacity, the field team in Syria has shown full capacity and implemented different types of activities and among them livestock activities which were all accomplished smoothly.</narrative>
