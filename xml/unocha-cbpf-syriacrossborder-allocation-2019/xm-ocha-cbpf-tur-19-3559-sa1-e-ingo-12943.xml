QC will establish 2 Temporary Education Centers (TECs) in Azaz and Albab sub-districts by renting 2 spaces and conduct minor rehabilitation works in the means of light maintenance of doors, windows, electricity and WASH facilities. Rehab process will consider the special needs of physically disabled children (girls and boys) with physical access facilities in both of school building and WASH facilities which also gender sensitive. The 2 TECs will be beautified with age-appropriate, child-friendly designs and to be well-furnished. The project will be targeting children in two phases:
Phase one: 600 Children (girls and boys aged between 9-15) who dropped out of school due to displacement or because they lack Education skills will be targeted with ALP for two months in the summer. This period will focus on bridging the Education gap of children using Curriculum B. Children will access the TECs 5 days a week/ 4 hours a day. After two months, QC will conduct ASER test to measure the learning outcomes of children. Those who pass the test will be transferred as per the MoU with signed with ED to formal Education for the school year 2019/2020.
Phase two: 600 children who couldn&#x2019;t pass the ASER test above or passed the test but still older in age than their Educational level or those who are OOS for any period, will be targeted with in-depth ALP for 9 months (5 days a week/ 3 hours a day). Children will undergo two levels of curriculum B (one level per a semester) considering the basic literacy and Numeracy skills for those who lack it (QC will integrate the IRC curriculum for the BLN with the 1st level of curriculum B to help children gain more knowledge and learn fast). By the end of 2019/2020 school year, children will be ready to join formal Education the next 2020/2021 school year. QC will follow on the registration of children for the next school year in cooperation with Educational bodies in north of Syria.

A MoU was signed with Education Directorate (ED) state that the Education process will be accredited by the ED, and all Children will get certified and will be given a scorecard to support their transition to formal Education. During the implementation, ED will implement monitoring visits to check the education progress.
