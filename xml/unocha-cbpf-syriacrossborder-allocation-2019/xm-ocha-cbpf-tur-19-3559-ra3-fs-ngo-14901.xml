   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Rapid Response for southern Idleb displacement through distributing 2 rounds of Multi-purpose cash voucher.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The 4-months project at hand aims to provide emergency cash assistance to recently displaced populations from Southern Idleb by the provision of MPGs to the most vulnerable and newly displaced households who recently fled the conflict zones. The project has been designed to contribute to covering the food security needs through helping the newly displaced households coping with the displacement conditions and secure their emergency needs in a dignified way by distributing 2 rounds cash grant with a value of 120 $ per household. The grant amount was designed in accordance with the cluster recommendations for this THF allocation to cover the displaced households&apos; basic emergency needs. Moreover, the cash modality has been selected to give more flexibility for the beneficiaries to buy their needs. 
Through this project, Violet seeks to target 1,782 newly displaced households (8,910 individuals) in the areas that have received the highest IDP influx over the last few weeks and have been identified with the highest needs including such as Idleb, Saraqeb, Taftanaz, Sarmin, and Jisr Al Shoughour. The targeted locations are accessible for Violet through it&apos;s on the ground operation team
The beneficiaries will be selected in close coordination with the community representatives in the targeted areas based on the vulnerability and eligibility criteria including displacement duration criteria since the newly IDPs are the most vulnerable groups to the shocks. the project will prioritize women-headed households as well as households with children, elderly, disabilities, pregnant, and lactating women. Furthermore, Violet will ensure close coordination with the humanitarian actors and coordination bodies to ensure the coordinated response and to avoid the potential overlapping.
Due to the lack of the banking system in northern Syria, Violet is transferring cash through the Turkish post (PTT). Moreover, Violet has a framework agreement for money transfer and distribution for the beneficiaries in place, which will be utilized under this project. the FWA is attached. The Cash transfer agent has been identified through a competitive and transparent procurement process after conducting a market and vendor assessment in the local markets. The contracted cash transfer agent will be responsible for delivering the Grants amount to the beneficiaries in their locations. Before distributing the cash grants, a rapid market assessment in terms of availability of the food items, prices, and accessibility will be conducted to make sure the local markets are functioning and all beneficiaries have good and equal access to the food items.
Later on, the cash distribution will be conducted in two steps 1) the distribution of vouchers to the beneficiaries by Violet team, while the second step is the 2) vouchers redemption with its cash value (120 $) from the money transfer agent who is accompanying the distribution teams to all distribution points, immediately after receiving the vouchers. the Vouchers will be printed in a way that prevents the fraud and Forgery through equipping them with light thermal stickers
As per Violet SOPs for cash distributions. Additionally, Violet will communicate that cash assistance is free of charge through verbal communication with the beneficiaries as well as brochures distributions. The project will effectively contribute to market recovery through pumping financial liquidity in the market and may create new job opportunities.</narrative>
