  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project aims to address multiple Early Recovery and CCCM sector objectives, Global Communities, with partner Bonyan, will provide critically needed upgrades/rehabilitation/construction to flood-affected infrastructure as follows:

- Rehabilitation of 9 km of the main roads in and outside the camp (new asphalt layer) with all the manholes and drainage infrastructure
- Rehabilitation of 5.1 km of the sub-roads in the camp (graveling) with all the manholes and drainage infrastructure
- Expansion and improving the drainage through rehabilitating 3 main culverts in the camp
- Implementing sidewalks through cash for work approach next to the new rehabilitated roads
- Establishing and training six rescue teams during the rainy season to assist in responding to the floods risks
- Conducting regular awareness sessions regarding floods for the camp population.
- Coordinating with the Turkish authorities to conduct regular cleaning for the culverts under the wall border and/or expanding the current culverts

The project&#x2019;s objective is to provide early recovery and flood risk mitigation support to flood-affected local communities in Atmeh. The rehabilitation listed above will target damaged and neglected infrastructure to improve drainage capacity as well as the population&apos;s access to basic services. 
The improvements and provision of regular maintenance will mitigate the camp&#x2019;s susceptibility to flooding, which is common in the area during the winter months.  In addition, several gender and age groups will have their access to basic services improved in the following ways:
- Elderly, females above 18, and lactating women will be able to move easily around the camps to reach medical centers, aid distribution locations, WASH facilities, etc.
- The newly rehabilitated routes will ensure that the quickest and most accessible routes used by women and children going to schools, are cleared and open for use. As a result, the safety of access routes for the children to and from school will be improved especially for children attending a public school outside the camps.

The proposed locations of the infrastructure rehabilitation/improvement focus on those locations that were most affected during the intense flooding during the winter of 2018/2019.  Heavy rainfall had caused landslips near culverts and overflowed the sanitation and water networks, which caused deposition of sediment within the networks and culverts, distortion and erosion of the riverbed and banks, and destruction of watershed assets, camp tents, and infrastructure.  By focusing on related mitigations, GC&#x2019;s proposed intervention can prevent unnecessary flooding, and improve access so that camp residents have the option to move should the camp experience severe flooding in future winters.  

GC&#x2019;s proposed intervention takes the topography of Atmeh Camp into consideration, which recognizes that most of the two flood-affected populations are located along a river basin.  Before the Syrian crisis, and the construction of the border wall, the water along this river basin flowed down across the border unobstructed.  This natural watershed has since been interrupted by the establishment of Atmeh camp, which now experiences flooding during periods of heavy precipitation, as water flowing down the river between the two Atmeh camp sectors can breach the riverbanks, causing serious flooding to the lowest areas in the camp. Both GC and Bonyan engineering field teams explored all available solutions to mitigate the risks of future flooding, and found that establishing any new flood prevention infrastructure in the camp could negatively affect surrounding communities. Accordingly, GC is proposing activities that improve the exit roads and the drainage and sanitation conditions to minimize mud and sewage build-up and blockage, and facilitate population movement in the event of flooding resulting from heaving precipitation.</narrative>
