   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Based on Big Heart&#x2019;s approved project submission to the 2019 HPC, the proposed intervention is a 12-month program targeting 6161 students (45% female), 207 school personnel (54% female) and 590 family members (51% female) through a range of life-sustaining formal and non-formal education activities. Specifically, the project targets out-of-school and educationally at-risk children from both the IDP and host communities in the Idleb sub-districts of  Ariha, Jisr-Ash-Shugur and Saraqb&#x30FC;areas that the 2019 HNO characterizes as having critical to severe education assistance needs. Designed to reflect a recent Rapid Needs Assessment (RNA) of 17 schools in these areas, the main goals of the project are (1) to improve academic teaching and learning, (2) to promote student wellbeing and protection, and (3) to strengthen educational access and resources. 

The project will begin with a non-formal summer school program in June 2019 to reach 2100 children (45% female) through remedial and catch-up classes at 8 of the assessed schools with the highest number of out-of-school and educationally at-risk children. The aim of the three-month summer session will be to prepare these children to enter one of 10 formal schools also supported under the project, where a total of 4803 students (45% female) are expected to enroll for the 2019-20 school year beginning in September. In addition to quality academic instruction in Arabic, English, Math and Sciences following recognised curriculums, students in both formal and non-formal programs will also benefit from structured Psychosocial Support (PSS) activities to promote their social-emotional development. 

To improve educational quality, teachers for both the formal and non-formal programs will receive light trainings on remedial education, child-centered classroom pedagogy, child protection and PSS, and first aid and emergency response. Schools will also be provided with basic classroom and teaching supplies, and financial resources to cover essential operating costs and unpaid teacher incentives. Big Heart will repair school infrastructure at all sites to ensure that the learning environment is both safe and protective, including accessibility measures for disabled students and gender-sensitisation of WASH school facilities. Further to student safety and protection, an external referral mechanism will be established at each school to link students with additional support needs to outside providers, when possible. Outreach activities including Parent-Teacher School Boards and community awareness sessions will also ensure that families are actively engaged in and benefit from the intervention. 

Finally, in recognising that the lack of student school supplies was a primary barrier to educational access and quality at all assessed schools, the project will provide Student Kits and textbooks to 6161 children (45% girls) at all 17 schools. 

The proposed intervention reflects Big Hearts deep contextual knowledge and technical experience in carrying out integrated, multi-sectoral programming in Idleb and across Northwestern Syria since 2013. In Ariha, our current education portfolio includes 4 EU-supported schools that provide vulnerable IDP and host community children with quality, protective formal and non-formal learning opportunities. Through these and other education initiatives, we have built the relationships and rapport needed to carry out the proposed intervention effectively and in alignment with a Do No Harm&#x2019; approach. 

If obligated to suspend programming, Big Heart will immediately inform OCHA and work to activate an alternative modality of intervention. In addition to the range of risk and mitigation measures detailed throughout the proposal, this may include transitioning students to home-learning and self study programs during times of extended insecurity or school closure.</narrative>
