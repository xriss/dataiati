   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Provision of Life-Saving and Life-Sustaining WASH and Winterization NFI Assistance to the Most Vulnerable.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed action will provide an integrated multi-sectoral programme of life-saving and life-sustaining Water Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) and Winter Non-Food Item (NFI) assistance to acutely vulnerable Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) in Idleb City and Daret Ezza town. 

Proposed WASH activities benefit total 265,041 conflict-affected people (of which 86,602 IDP), ensuring increased access to safe and adequate water for 42,475 conflict-affected people, improving Solid Waste Management (SWM) services for 265,041 people, providing targeted upgrades to rainwater drainage systems in Daret Ezza and complementary hygiene assistance to newly displaced households living in informal settlements and unfinished buildings. Access to adequate, safe water will be increased through rehabilitation of five, existing emergency boreholes (four in Idleb City and one in Daret Ezza) while critical, unmet needs in SWM, rainwater drainage and hygiene assistance will be addressed through the integrated programme of WASH assistance described in further detail below. WASH activities will address unmet needs and gaps in the current response and have been developed in close coordination with the WASH cluster and other members. Mitigation measures for winter flooding have been considered in program design. WASH activities will be implemented in communities as opposed to camps, where drainage works to mitigate flood risk are not a priority. Assessments and Key Informant Interviews (KIIs) completed to inform the action did not identify a need for drainage or other winterization measures in Idleb City beyond clearance of rainwater drainage which will be completed by the LC. A need for improved rainwater drainage in Daret Ezza to mitigate flood risk was identified, and has been built into the program design accordingly. The implementation plan for WASH activities is as follows: Water systems: rehabilitation of two boreholes in month one, followed by support for operational materials for four months. SWM - complete procurement process during months one and two, followed by repairs of garbage compactor trucks, provision of garbage containers, followed by support for operational materials for four months. Rehabilitation and improvement to rainwater drainage will be completed in Daret Ezza during Sept and Oct in advance of the winter season. Distribution of essential Hygiene NFIs will be completed from the second month and will be supported by Hygiene Promotion activities completed during the second, fourth and sixth months of the project. Should targeted areas experience influxes of newly displaced people during the implementation period, Big Heart will coordinate with GOAL and HiH to adjust pumping schedules in Idleb City accordingly to increase water provision. For Daret Ezza, borehole pumping hours will be extended in coordination with the LC who have agreed to cover associated costs, specifically fuel for generators. 

The integrated, multi-sector action will also ensure winter NFI needs are met for 3,000 of the most vulnerable IDPs in Idleb City and Daret Ezza through highly targeted one-off cash-based winter assistance ($120 p/household) to protect thermal comfort and household well-being during the coldest months. The cash-based approach is informed by Big Heart beneficiary feedback on 2018/19 winterization assistance and our extensive cash-based programming experience. Winter assistance proposed is aligned with S/NFI cluster guidance (August 2019) and designed to increase access to essential winter NFIs including fuel, stoves, thermal blankets and winter clothing. The approach complements ECHO funding already secured for winter cash top-ups. NFI beneficiaries will also benefit from planned WASH activities and Big Heart will endeavor to provide complementary food security assistance to targeted beneficiaries to ensure cash is used for NFI needs, either through complementary Big Heart FFP funding or through coordination with other FSL members</narrative>
