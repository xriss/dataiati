   <narrative xml:lang="EN">SAMS through this project aims to sustain the provision of life-saving and life-sustaining services to host communities and the internally displaced people in rural Idelb which continue to receive high waves of displacement resulted from the continued violence in the southern regions of Idleb and northern Hama governorates. This will be achieved through the provision of health services to the vulnerable population in both Marret Mesrin hospital and Kafr Lusien PHC in Idleb and Harim districts in rural Idleb.
SAMS will prioritize the reduction of morbidity and mortality through improved access to quality-health care including primary and secondary services while focusing and maintaining protection mainstreaming, child safeguarding, PSEA.

Through this project, SAMS will sustain its response to the dire increasing need of beneficiaries through two health facilities in Idleb governorate, Ma&apos;aret Mesrin hospital and Kafr Lusien PHC of which SAMS will maintain vulnerable population groups (women, children, adolescents, elderly) access to quality health care services and support people with primary and secondary healthcare.

The proposed intervention was designed to respond to life-saving health needs in areas experiencing high severity of need. Specifically, SAMS will support Maaret Masrin Hospital and Kafr Losien PHC in Idleb, with services focusing on those most vulnerable &#x2013; specifically women, children, and persons with disabilities where approximately 82,642 direct beneficiaries, of whom 31% are women and 38% children, will have access to quality health services over a 12-month period with special focus on approx. 1,641 persons with different cases of disabilities.

The following services will be provided in Maaret Tamasrin hospital: quality primary and secondary health care trauma services, including minor and major surgeries for IDPs and host communities, it is worth mentioning here that SAMS will start supporting Maaret Tamasrin under THF from 19-06-2019, as SAMS has recently extended its project with the donor of Maaret Tamasrin until 18-06-2019.

In Kafr Losien PHC, SAMS will provide primary health consultations for IDPs and host communities. Activities will start under the THF grant from 01/06/2019

SAMS was one of the first organizations was able to provide medical aid inside Syria, since 2011, because of its strong relationship with Syrian physicians across the country. SAMS expanded this reach by establishing numerous facilities across Syria, providing financial and technical support to Syrian doctors. SAMS further extended its reach and access by collaborating with the local health directorates in various governorates to work on maintaining quality health care services to their populations and IDPs.

SAMS is perfectly suited to implement the proposed activities in terms of its demonstrated access and presence within the region in addition to its vast experience in implementing Health interventions.</narrative>
