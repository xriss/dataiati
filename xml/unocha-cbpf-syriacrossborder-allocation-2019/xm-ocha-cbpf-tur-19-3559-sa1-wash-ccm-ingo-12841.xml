  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">According to an assessment published by REACH in August 2018, Idleb governorate and surrounding areas have some of the highest population densities in Syria. The 2019 Humanitarian Needs Overview (HNO) notes that more than 910,000 are facing particularly acute needs. with 500,000 people currently living in informal settlements in rural areas in Northern Idleb governorate

It is estimated that in the case of a large scale military offensive in Northwest Syria, up to 700,000 additional people could be displaced within the Non State Armed Group (NSAG)-controlled Northwest Syria, whilst 200,000 might be fleeing into Government of Syria Arab Army (GoSAR)-controlled areas. Recent attacks in northern Hama and other southern areas of Idleb Governorate have triggered sudden displacement into north Idleb Governorate, and this trends is considered likely to continue. 
 
NRC is the inter-agency focal point for the Deir Hassan camp cluster located in Dana, Harim district and provides support to all 51,270 residents (26,148 male 25,122 female) of the 40 informal settlements/camps in the camp cluster. Since 2015 this has included WASH services (solid waste management, water trucking, desludging, latrine maintenance) WASH Infrastructure (WASH containers and water tanks) site improvements (gravelling, fencing and lighting) and Distributions (tents, hygiene kits and NFIs). Activities are funded by a range of donors including ECHO, SIDA and the French Crisis Centre.

This project is in accordance with the interagency Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP) and will target 2 THF Allocation-specific objectives. 
1.	CCCM cluster Allocation-specific objective: Restore the basic infrastructure damaged by the flood and storms and strengthen the basic infrastructure in IDP sites to reduce the impact of severe weather conditions in 2019. The main activity will be environmentally friendly tents insulation and levelling to ensure IDPs are protected against weather conditions in the priority 1 target location of Dana with the target population of IDPs living is last-resort IDP sites. Specifically, the activity be the gravelling of the floors of 2,000 tents in Deir Hassan camp cluster, covering 12,000 beneficiaries (6,120 male, 5,880 female).
2.	WASH cluster Allocation-specific objective: Provision of basic WASH services in camps hosting IDPs from previous displacements and newly arrivals who are unable to access these services and are fully dependent on the WASH services provided by INGOs/NGOs in addition, to preparation for any sudden influx of IDPs. The main activity will be solid waste collection and management through provision of adequate solid containers in the target location of Dana with the target population of IDPs. Specifically the activity will be the distribution of 2,141 garbage bins in Deir Hassan camp cluster covering all 51,270 residents (26,148 male 25,122 female).

Targeting will be based on needs analysis, inter-agency coordination, and NRC ability to maintain humanitarian safe and principled access. Beneficiary selection criteria for individual activities will vary, but always be based on needs and vulnerabilities. Gender equality will be prioritized and beneficiary engagement throughout the project cycle will ensure transparency and awareness of project activities. 

Risks are detailed in the relevant section below, but focus on two main areas. The first is interference in the project by local authorities, which will be mitigated through regular and consistent engagement with them. The second is danger to staff resulting from a deterioration of the security situation, which will be mitigated through regular monitoring and analysis of the security situation and implementation of security measures as appropriate.</narrative>
