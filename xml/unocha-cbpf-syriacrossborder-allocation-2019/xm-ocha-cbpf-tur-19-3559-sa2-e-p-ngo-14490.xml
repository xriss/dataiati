  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project is a continuation of existing education and protection activities by Maram Foundation and funded by OCHA, as well as scaling up education and protection activities in additional schools and locations. the project will contribute to HRP/ASO 1. Helping to create a safer and more secure environment for children. This priority will focus on children under the age of 18 in and out of school by providing an integrated set of services that targets the gaps and needs of the most vulnerable groups while ensuring the centrality of protection.  The project will support eight (8) schools and 16,839 total beneficiaries, including men, women and children. 53% are women and girls, 9410 are children. 118 children have disabilities or special needs. 44% of the beneficiaries are adults: teachers, parents, and community.  
The main goal of the project is to integrate protection into education to provide a safer environment for children and youth. Maram regularly integrates protection into education and other sectors, and the integration for these programs is specifically designed by guidance from the Child Protection (CP) sub-cluster. The project contributes to the quality and integrated education and CP services, as well as towards maintaining and enhancing equitable access to services for IDPs. CP is critical for education. A lack of access to education has direct negative impacts on wellbeing and development. Children out of school face greater CP risks. CP concerns can prevent children from accessing education or decrease educational outcomes. 

Maram conducted a needs assessment that identified need amp possible significant impact. The target schools include:
1)	3 OCHA-supported Maram schools: Al Hikmah school in Hibat Allah camp, Al Tawhed in Al Wafa camp, and Saed Bin Moaz in Deir hassan -Khan Shaykhun camp. These are performing well and need continued funding from OCHA.
2)	4 volunteer-based schools: Jeil AlMustakbal school in Le Ajlikom Cluster &#x2013; Al-Assi camp in Qah, AlFarouk school in Alkaramah camp cluster in Qah, Salah Aldein school in Kafer Lusin camp, Bilal Kreim school in AlBardakli camp. 
3)	1 new school in Maaret ElEkwhan camp
This project seeks to scale up safe and equitable access to formal and non-formal education for school-aged girls and boys between ages 5-17 in a safe environment, with rehabilitation of 69 classes in 8 schools. The project ensures safe, child-friendly and accessible for children of all needs and with disabilities. 
the recruitment for the remining 5 school will be through face to face interviews and the certificates will be verified with education directorate. 
Maram will increase understanding of value of education and CP principles among, teachers, students, parents, and the community. 162 educational staff will be trained on protection and education  and education activities (such as accelerated learning programs (ALP), those recommended by  (INEE), nonviolent communication, etc.). Maram will also educate parents and community on CP concerns at parent meetings at school. 
This project will cover the incentives for teachers at all 8 schools. The project will distribute teacher and student kits, with all needed stationery and teaching tools, and specified by age and gender. Children with low literacy and numeracy will be provided catch-up classes in summer.
Maram will perform rehabilitation projects for classes according to assessments, installing or rehab (whiteboards, desks, lamps, disability accessible facilities, and rehab caravans - see BoQ). This includes accessible ramp with hand support, accessible toilet with grab bars and long handle taps over a basin at an appropriate height (80 cm).
