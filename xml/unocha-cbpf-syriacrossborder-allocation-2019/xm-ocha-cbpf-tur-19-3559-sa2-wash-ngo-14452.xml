   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed actions will provide an integrated program of life-saving and life-sustaining Water Sanitation and Hygiene to acutely vulnerable (IDPs) in Aleppo, Jarabuls district, Al Jabel camp. This project supports the IDPs from previous displacements in the camp by providing life-saving WASH services to ensure they will receive safe and clean drinking water, and to improve the hygienic conditions through sanitation services which they are proposed in this project including the construction of latrines, and sewerage line rehabilitation and conducting the solid waste management activities in the targeted camp, which will improve the behavior of the affected people who have chosen the camp as their last resort. The proposed project includes the following components: In the beginning of the project and to cover the daily need of water IYD will provides the IDP&#x2019;s camp residents with daily safe and clean water through water trucking at least 25 liters per person per day of chlorinated water for drinking, cooking and domestic purposes for 3 months, during this period IYD will rehabilitate the water pumping system in the camp which will replace the water trucking method in the targeted camp, the water system will be connecting to the main pumping line from Jarabuls water station to ensure the sustainability of the water flow through the system, the system includes three horizontal water pumps, one groundwater tank, and one generator to provide the electricity to the pumps in absence of the power from the electrical grid, to give full access to the water IYD will rehabilitate the water network inside the camp by extending new polyethylene pipes over the camp, this pipe network will transfer the water from the groundwater tank to the IDPs HHs. IYD to ensure the provided water suitable to human uses, will conduct a survey on the boreholes located in the area and collect samples from the boreholes to do the water tests, the chlorination process will be under the full control from the IYD staff, daily samples from providing water  and from the point of use will be taken to do the tests, and daily visit to the IDPs to check the storage tanks and containers and ensure clean, this will be done through the water safety plan by IYD. Constructing sewerage line in the camp to replace the handmade cesspits which they were made locally by the IDPs which causes a serious effect on the IDPs&#x2019; life Construction of latrines blocks each block consists of two cells equipped with all needs to be ready to use, taking into consideration the needs for the PWD in the camp, these latrines will be connecting to the new sanitation network. Supply the IDP sites with 350 locally made waste containers as per the need and number of populations, the number of containers meets SPHERE standards. Provide the IDP site residents with hygiene kits (Soap, Toothbrush for adult, Toothpaste adult, Shampoo for adult, Sanitary napkins, Laundry bucket, Laundry soap (powder), Detergent for cleaning dishes, Disinfection solution for cleaning, Baby Diapers, Toothpaste child, Toothbrush for child, shampoo for babies and Jerry can). Each family will receive one kit, each hygiene kit is enough for 3 months for 1 family. Provide the IDP site residents with solid waste collection and toilets cleaning services on a daily basis along 6 months through cash for work modality to the IDPs. Increase the awareness of the IDPs sites residents about practices and behaviors for the self-hygiene, and leishmaniasis and other similar diseases, on the other hand, volunteers from female staff will conduct visits for about 25% of the total Families to improve their awareness and practices.
