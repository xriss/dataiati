  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">According to the World Health Report 2001 (WHO, 2001a) the three major strategies for facilitating the development of an effective network of mental health services are: shifting care away from large psychiatric hospitals developing community mental health services and integrating mental health care into general health services.
PAC is planning for the transformation of Azaz Asylum Hospital by transferring around 65 chronic inpatients (originally came from Ibn Khaldoun Mental hospital) back to Ibn Khaldoun Hospital creating of mental health center of acute inpatient carecreating of community-home based facility for the remaining 40 chronic inpatient and creating of two MHPSS mobile clinics/ Rapid Response teams for far flung unserved communities in Euphrashield areas.
With this transfer of patients, the probable number of patients that will be left at Azaz Asylum Hospital will be around 40 chronic mental patients. 

along with transferring process , the The mental health services will be provided in three levels of care, namely: 

a.Specialized Mental Care: Azaz Mental Health Center with Acute Inpatient Care.
transform Azaz Asylum Hospital into Mental Health Center with Acute Inpatient Care where has both OPD and 20 beds (male and female) to accommodate 20 acute mentally ill patients that may stay until maximum of 2 weeks , and ensure provision of community-based care by carers/families thru follow-ups, and home visits.
This will also include 24-hour crisis intervention services, patient-focused of quality care , provision of extracurricular activities for physical and mental well-being of inpatients.

b. Community home-based MHPSS Care: Azaz House of Hope for around 40 chronic mental health patients (males and females), providing a community-home based type of mental health care for the remaining 40 inpatients (residential home)  where they will all be housed in a big home with a big garden and provide support for better quality of living condition, develop nurturing relationships , providing basic responsibilities and provide self-help activities and sports/ music activities that are tailored for them.

c.Two MHPSS mobile clinics or MHPSS Rapid Response Team at the community level where these will be providing outreach services in the unserved communities in Al Bab and Ar-Ra&apos;ee in northern eastern of Aleppo governorate in the far-flung areas in Azaz and its neighboring areas
Establishing mental health mobile clinics teams/ mental health rapid response teams who will provide the quality mental health and psychosocial support services ,where access to mental health and psychosocial support services are of no existence.
This is bringing the mental health services closer to the far-flung communities and also providing immediate care and support for acutely severe mental health patients who needs to admitted to the Azaz mental health center of acute inpatient care.
MHPSS Rapid Response Team consists of MhGap doctor and two mental health rapid response workers male and female to respect the cultures of the targeted community.

The three level of MHPSS services will be delivered based on humanitarian principles from designing, implementation and finishing the project. Ensuing that the beneficiaries are providing dignity and respect his/her rights to access the said service, equal treatment for all beneficiaries from all genders and ages, not supporting nor helping either side in a conflict, and operational independence. Integrating mental health care into general health services produces positive impact as reduced stigmatization of persons with mental disorders and a more efficient use of health resources. Integration can be achieved in both primary care centers and in general hospitals

Under this three levels of care, capacity building for the staffs will be provided to ensure quality of mental health care . This helps to increase the their efficiency and efficacy of care.</narrative>
