- 2nd intervention will be protection for the purpose of mitigating the effects of war on children and providing the necessary protection interventions to continue their basic rights to education and life, we will focus on providing PSS for all students, including those who were newly displaced from areas that undergo conflicts. 
Since many children do not return to school once school are in operation, therefore they need to raise awareness ,explanation to remove their fears with their parents, so there will be a mobile team that visits families at home trying to understand their problems, providing awareness about the importance of education and the harm of early marriage and child labor, and referring children to school case workers , so that they can help them and bring them back to school.
Case management and referral service will be provided through the case worker is present in each 
school receives cases from teachers or cases referred to him by the mobile team and follow up the case either by providing the service initial PSS-catch up with education.
