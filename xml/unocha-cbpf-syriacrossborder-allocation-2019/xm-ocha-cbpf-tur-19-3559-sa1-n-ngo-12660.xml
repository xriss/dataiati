   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project aims to improve the nutritional status of children and women with attention to most vulnerable people, including the children with special needs among host communities and IDPs in northwest Syria through:
Strengthen lifesaving preventive nutrition services, by scaling up and support the optimal infant feeding and caring practices in an emergency, optimal maternal nutrition, and micronutrient interventions among the vulnerable population in Idleb and Western Aleppo including recent IDPs in 9 communities (Ma&#x2019;rat al-Numan, Ghadfa, Babilla, Western Deir, Maar Shamsheh, Hantutin, Kafruma, Thahret Telmanas, Telamnas) in Al-Marra sub-district, Idleb, and five camps (Al Ghouta and Al Farouk camps in, Maaret Elehkwan in Ma&apos;arrat Tamasrin,Idlib governorate - Samedoun camp in Hir Jamus in Salqin, Idlib governorate - Al Sinaea and Abu Zafer camps in Atareb, Aleppo governorate)  The project will provide the appropriate nutrition services to all age and sex groups boys and girls, women, men, with attention to people with special needs, without any sexual discrimination, among IDPs and host communities
Unfortunately, the escalation has increased in south Idlib and north Hama, and Syrian government forces have advanced to all of north Hama communities and some of southern Idlib communities especially Khan Shikhon located along M5 road, and the advancing still continuous. Al-Marra district is under continuous bombing, and there is a mass displacement from south Idleb and north Hama to North Idleb and Aleppo, The south and east of AlMara now are the first line of military operations between the conflicted parties.
, most of our staff were displaced to the north , now the situation is very bad in Almara and we expect it will be worse in next future, these circumstances out of our control had led us to suspend all nutrition and health activities in AlMara district.
From the beginning of the project, SDI targeted 3398 beneficiaries in 4 communities in AlMarra district(Ma&apos;arrat An Nu&apos;man ,Ghadqa , Telamnas, Western Deir ).

The new targeted locations are 5 communities ( Bhora, Batenta, Ram Hamdan, Murin, Kafr Nabi, ) in Marat Tamasrin subdistrict in Idleb governorate and 2 communities(Kafr Naseh Elatareb, Maaret Atarib) in Alatareb subdistrict in Aleppo governorate where there are increasing the number of population in these locations  because of continuous displacement influxes from south,These communities have 49250 populations, including 7880 children Under 5 and 3940 PLWs 
The activities  ( Alaterb, Big Hir jamos, Maaret Elehkwan) communities are still ongoing with increased in targeted populations to respond to new IDPs
