   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Through the proposed project, IR Syria aims at targeting three camps in Azaz District in Aleppo Governorate.  41672 people will benefit from improved access to water and sanitation facilities. The project is primarily design based on the results of the primary need assessment conducted by IR Syria team and Humanitarian Need Overview 2019.

Islamic Relief is supporting these camps in Azaz, however the current funding source will end by 30th April and hence additional funds are required to provide uninterrupted WASH services. As there are no other sources available to cover these camps.

 The project will support the established 4 camps with the following core WASH services:

1.	Adequate quality and quantity of water: Water supply will be ensured through water trucking for 3 months. IR will sign an agreement with a contractor to supply water to the targeted camps on daily basis (25 litres per person per day). This water will be sufficient to cover the drinking, bathing and household needs of the individuals. This water will be provided for 3 month only we find durable solution to the water issue in Azaz area  

2.	Water testing and treatment (chlorination): IR team will conduct water testing and chlorination before it is available for use by the beneficiaries. This will help to eliminate the risk of using contaminated water.

3.	Waste removal service (solid waste management): Through a service provider (contractor) IR will ensure to collect the garbage from the camps and remove it to the agreed dump sites. There will also be sewage desludging on daily basis. This will improve the overall environment and decrease the risk of disease spread. 

4.	Operation and maintenance of sanitation facilities: Sanitation facilities (latrines) will be gender segregated and will have protection measures included in the location and design (lockable doors, lighting of paths to facilities). IR will provide cleaning materials and members of the camp communities (hired by the contractor) will do maintenance and cleaning of the facilities. 

5.	 Hygiene awareness sessions will be and leaflets containing hygiene messages will be distributed.. 

6.	Distribution of the essential hygiene materials on the needy family this includes soap, washing powder, shampoo and sanitary napkin.

As part of the exit strategy, IR will inform all relevant stakeholders about project closure. Lessons learnt from the implementation will be recorded and shared with WASH cluster members to improve the quality of the WASH program. 

The previous IR WASH project ended in April 2019. IR handed over the project activities to ACTED for two months, to ensure uninterpreted WASH support. if this proposed project is approved IR will take over the activities and the camps from ACTED. 

in case of sudden influx of new IDP, IR can scale up the response by securing emergency funds from IR partners as well as by utilizing the proposed project resources effectively. 

Water trucking is added only for three months. This is because currently there is no other source of water in the targeted camps. IR is working in the same camps for more than one year. in consultation with the local stakeholders such as camp management, local councils, AFAD and other humanitarian partners IR is already in the process of developing a sustainable solution for water for the proposed camps. until than since the water supply can not be cut off as there is no alternate source of water for the targeted communities, thereby IR will provide water initially for three months until a more durable solution is adopted. For a possible sustainable solution, IR conducted a detailed technical study of Meydanki, Azaz and Sharran stations by hiring an external technical expert. After which technical details and complete BOQ developed to run these stations. Currently IR is networking to raise the require funds for this project. which will greatly resolve the water problem in Azaz</narrative>
