   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Emergency WASH response to provide newly displaced people with life-saving assistance in North Idleb</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project supports new IDPs  and IDPs from previous displacements in the camps of Dana subdistrict ( Swaed AlIkhaa, Khatab, Al Naser, Damaet Nazeh, Nahda1 and  Abna Al Keseir , Khaled Ibn AlWaleed, Ariha, AlFaraj and Al Farouk camps) by providing emergency life-saving WASH supplies and services in addition to six collective centers in Ariha. It aims to ensure that IDPs in the targeted camps and collective centers receive safe drinking water, and to improve the hygienic behavior of the affected people who have chosen the camps or collective centers as their last resort. It includes four main components:
1 - Providing water storage tanks and filling them with drinking water.
2 - Providing and installing sanitation facilities (latrines and septic tanks)
3 - Solid waste management and Hygiene sessions in all targeted camps.
4 - Distributing Hygiene kits every other month to HHs in the six targeted camps in addition to the collective centers in Ariha (Al Tujaar School 30 HHS, Farmers&#x2019; Association Building 25 HHS, Municipality Building 22 HHS, Old Al Shami Hospital 16 HHS, Services Building 20 HHs and Water Building 20 HHs).

In all activities of the project, gender and age will be taken into consideration. The latrine blocks are gender segregated  and will be equipped with ramps and handrail to make them accessible to all people including people with disability. In addition, the Hygiene kits components will include women sanitary items, and elderly diapers will be distributed to the elderly who cannot go to the latrines. Cleaners for the latrines and maintenance workers will be from the IDPs in the camps in order to ensure involvement of IDPs during implementation as they were also involved during the design of the project through the needs assessment.
The intervention will be based on the needs assessments by HIHFAD. Al Naser Camp,  Damaet Nazeh and Swaed Al Ikha camps ( in Kafr Kafaldin) will receive the following services (water trucking, water storage tanks desludging of septic tanks, garbage bins, hygiene promotion and hygiene kits. While Khatab Camp in Kafaldin, Abna Al Keseir camp and Nahda1 Camp in Sarmada need in addition to the above mentioned services construction of latrine blocks and septic tanks. Moreover, garbage bins will be distributed in all targeted camps and they will be discharged every other day (for every 40 people 1 garbage bin of 100 liters).
HIHFAD will distribute Hygiene kits to the HHs in the targeted camps and collective centers every other month (three times during the project duration). There will be distribution point in each camp/collective to avoid crowdedness. PDM will be conducted after each round of distribution. 
In order to mitigate the bad effects of heavy rain, the latrines are designed to be high from the ground and in this way the possibility to be affected by heavy rain will be low. Moreover, the septic tanks will be monitored closely especially during rainy days to be desludged even before its normal period. Moreover, HIHFAD has chosen prefabricated latrine blocks not building them in order to be removed and transferred to another place in the worst case.
 Two cleaners from the local community will be responsible of collecting waste and keeping its place clean by providing them with cleaning tools. Communal garbage bins with covers will be distributed and located in the camps and will be emptied three time per week in order no to have any garbage accumulation. HIHFAD will conduct hygiene promotion sessions to IDPs in the targeted camps to raise awareness of water borne diseases and personal hygiene. Water tanks will be installed in the camps that do not have enough tanks and will be filed daily. On average, every person will have 25 liters per day. (for drinking and daily use).</narrative>
