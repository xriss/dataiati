   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Empowering Small and Mid-Sized Olive Farmers and Olive Value Chain through Integrated Agricultural and Service Interventions in Afrin and Sharan Sub-districts.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This program aims at increasing the resilience and livelihood opportunities of the most vulnerable olive farmers and thus revitalization of olive value chain in some communities of Afrin and Sharan sub-districts, where various olive farming was a major pillar of providing employment and livelihood opportunities to 73 % of the populations as it mentioned in the needs assessment (Annex C). The allocated support in this project will be divided into 14 villages belonging to Sharan and Afrin sub-districts according to the total population of each village (Annex C). The target communities is located in Olive Branch operation area ( supported by Turkish government), and they are relatively stable considering the difficult operational context within the country. A large number of displaced families is closely correlated with a relatively stable security situation thereby making it favorable locations for residing in. 1000 small and mid-sized olive farmers (who own between 3-10 dunums will be prioritized according to IRD needs assessment (Annex C), and will be supported with agricultural inputs, agricultural services, harvesting, packaging, and marketing services sufficient to 3 dunums of their olive orchards. To increase the technical capacity and knowledge on the best agricultural practices and integrated olive management, the target olive farmers will receive theoretical and practical training (Farmer Field School). Furthermore, this program aims at creating short-term employment opportunities of most vulnerable women households (500 women, &#x201C;250 women of the host community and 250 women from IDPs&#x201D;) through CFW intervention for the harvesting of olive orchards owned by the target olive farmers. the BNFs of olive farming support and CFW will be selected according to clear vulnerability and eligibility criteria (Annex D). All the previous interventions will be integrated together to improve both the quality and quantity of olive tree production and revitalize of the olive value chain in the target communities. As government bodies are no longer present, the local councils are the main bodies responsible for providing services to their local communities. Usually, local councils lack the technical background necessary to ensure a sustainable presence within their communities. To increase the technical capacity for strategic and sustainable planning for the olive sector in the target location, IRD will support each local council (one member of each LC) through the provision of ToT on the strategic planning for olive, sustainable agricultural interventions and respecting environmental principles during all production cycle of the olive value chain. The knowledge gained by the olive local council members will be a sustainable resource for olive farmers after closing the project through helping them open new opportunities for olive value chain, especially for marketing, while at the same time improving the framework conditions for the olive sector overall and this would make the sector more productive and competitive. To promote marketing of olive oil produced by target olive farmers, IRD is planning to support olive oil analysis (Acid and Peroxide analysis). Each olive farmer will be provided with the Laboratory Analysis Certificate and branding labels for his/her product of olive oil. This support will revitalize the marketing and olive value chain, and helps the farmers in marketing their products in good prices comparing with other olive oil producers, as well as this initiative will promote the customers and local traders to buy reliable products characterized with certified quality.</narrative>
