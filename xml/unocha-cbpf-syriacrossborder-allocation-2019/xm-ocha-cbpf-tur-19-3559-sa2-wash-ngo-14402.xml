   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Improve the Prevention of Water-Borne Diseases for the affected-community in Atma village and its surroundings in NW Syria</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project aims to address the problems in sewerage/drainage system for wastewater and rainfall-water in Atma area including all villages and camps in the surroundings related to poor and damaged infrastructure. The system was originally designed (long time ago) as an open stream to discharge the wastewater and rainfall water. The stream pours into the wastewater channel in Turkey through culverts at the Turkish-Syrian borders. In the past years with establishment of numerous IDPs sites in the area, the open stream is used also as a sewerage system for the nearby settlements of IDPs and Host Community. This unplanned usage of the stream has led to further damages to the stream as well as has resulted in unsafe and unclear environment, especially for children. These problems have created a sever need to rehabilitate and/or upgrade the sewerage/ drainage systems which is essential to ensure regular sanitation service for the affected-population to prevent wastewater-borne diseases and to reduce public health-risks linked to water sources at community level. 

At the beginning of the project, Bonyan Organization will develop the engineering layouts, the Scope of Works (SoWs), and technical specifications of selected locations through conducting consultations with all stakeholders to collect detailed data about specific location of sewerage/drainage system during the year, especially in the winter to consider rainfall effects on sewerage/ drainage system. Bonyan will carry out needed rehabilitation/ upgrading works for the sewerage/ drainage system -using contractual approach- as listed below:
- Rehabilitation of the main sewerage network through constructing 5,000 meters of cement pipes,125 cm diameter
- Rehabilitation of the sub-main sewerage network through constructing 1,000 meters of cement pipes, 50 cm in diameter as well as constructing 1,500 meters of cement pipes, 30 cm in diameter. 
- Upgrading of the sewerage system through implementing 40 main access manholes (2 m width, 2 m length, 2.5 m depth) in the main sewerage network (125 cm diameter pipes). 
- Upgrading of the sewerage system through implementing access manholes in the sub-main sewerage network 10 manholes in the pipes with 50 cm diameter, and 30 manholes in the pipes with 30 cm diameter.
- Cleaning the open drainage stream from garbage 
Besides that, Bonyan will conduct hygiene promotion activities in form of awareness sessions with the affected-people. 
Finally, Bonyan will hand over engineering layouts/ drawings, technical specification documents, and maintenance/ expansion instructions to engineering office of Atma local council. 

The project activities aim to promote safe and clean environment and increase community resilience, for the vulnerable affected-people of IDPs in camps and out of camps as well as of Host Community, through improved sewerage/ drainage systems in Atma village and its surroundings for 267,392 vulnerable people (10,470 Host Community, 256,922 IDPs) (66,308 Men, 68,380 Women, 67,386 Boys, 65,318 Girls). Bonyan will achieve the project objective through a series of specific activities and processes, taking into account accountability to affected-people, protection mainstreaming and GBV, risk analysis and mitigation, tight monitoring and evaluation processes, and effective coordination with all stakeholders, as well as, a coherent exit strategy that contributes to sustainable results of the project.</narrative>
