   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Improving living conditions of the most vulnerable population in Idleb governorate through provision of shelter and WASH assistance</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">BINAA will provide live-saving shelter and WASH assistance to 3324 conflict affected IDPs (716 men, 747 women, 914 boys, 947 girls) with the aim to improve living conditions and increase protection.

Shelter intervention will be rehabilitating and upgrading 19 unfinished buildings (5 buildings in Sarmada, 8 in Harim and 6 in Armanaz). This component will target 563 HHs (331 HHs are already living in these buildings and 232 HHs will be moved to live in theses rehabilitated buildings). Potential beneficiaries to be moved to repaired buildings will be identified following outreach to reception centers, unstructured camps, IDPs live in open areas, IDPs pay high amounts for rent in the communities were collective center located. Consulting meetings with newly arrived IDPs living in makeshift camps, open areas and reception centers conducted in target locations (attachment 21 includes photos during meetings). As harsh winter approaches, consulted IDPs responded that moving to new shelters protect them from weather elements and ensure privacy are among their top needs. Attachment 17 and 18 include detailed info about selected buildings.

Building upgrades will vary between replacement of doors and windows, installation of partitions to allow families privacy, sealing or repairing holes and cracks in walls and roofs and repair of WASH facilities within the center. 

Communities were selected based on mapping exercise and various reports on recent IDPs influx destinations in Idleb. Buildings selected as per a pre-established selection criteria include that building should be reinforced concrete (blocks apartments), privately owned by an owner known in the community and has available and approved HLP documents as per SNFI cluster guidelines, owner accepts terms of works initially (to accommodate IDP HHs for 1 year for free), building not fully damaged and needs repair (damage level falls within cluster recommendation - Grade 2 Moderate), building was not repaired previously, and the building could accommodate at least 4 HHs.

Each building will be provided with management and activity room for recreational and social activities and meetings.
To enhance gender sensitive response, necessary adaptations will include appropriate lighting, separate toilets and showers for men and women, accessible facilities for people with disabilities, areas for bathing, washing of clothing, and partitions to create spaces for different HHs and additional partitions within HHs to create privacy for men and women. 
Also, the works will respond to people with disabilities needs by including disability friendly entrance and toilet facilities (e.g. use of simple ramp with handrail for using wheelchairs at entrance and seating provisions for toilets). 
All buildings will be connected to water network. Works will include equipping buildings with water pumping and storage equipment. This equipment will be operated via solar power systems and under supervision of collective center committees. BINAA will facilitate the establishment of committees to coordinate building affairs, mobilize required resources and resolve residents issues.
Thus, each collective center will consist of:
 Adequate amount of easy to maintain lockable latrines (special units for males and females)
 Adequate amount of hand washing facilities near the latrines.
 Facilities for drinking water with fitted water tanks
 A well-constructed buildings that protects residents from weather conditions and ensure their privacy and dignity.
To ensure integrated response and to increase the impact of our intervention on the most vulnerable IDPs, the project will provide regular life-saving safe WASH service, and enhance awareness on hygienic behavior of the rehabilitated building IDP residents. This will include provision of hygiene kits, provision of waste containers, provision of pool testers with required items and liquids to measure the FRC, HH level hygiene promotion sessions.</narrative>
