   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Logistical Support for Cross Border Operations for Humanitarian Actors Operating from Turkey into Syria in the Scope of the Emergency Response for North West Syria</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Turkish Red Crescent (TRC) has been implementing the &#x2018;Syria Humanitarian Relief Operation&#x2019; since April 29, 2011 in order to respond to the humanitarian needs arising from the conflict ongoing in the Syrian Arab Republic. An integral part of these activities include providing logistics support for the cross border operations of all humanitarian actors responding to the Syrian conflict. These support activities include but are not limited to assisting in the delivery of humanitarian relief supplies into Syria by humanitarian organizations responding to the crisis, enabling import and export activities with waivers, continuing dialogue activities with Turkish authorities to enable Value Added Tax (VAT) exemption for the delivery of humanitarian supplies through humanitarian corridors, coordination of cross-border shipments to avoid congestion and ensuring that all records of the type and amount of humanitarian relief materials delivered across the border through humanitarian channels are maintained on a real time basis. 
Since April 2019, there has been an increase in aerial bombardment as well as shelling by regime forces in Southern Idlib, Northern Hama and Western Aleppo. This has resulted in more than 450,000 IDP&#x2019;s fleeing towards the Northern parts of Idlib according to the Camp Coordination and Camp Management (CCCM) Cluster reports. The TRC camps in the Dana / Idlib region have experienced the effects of this IDP flow into especially the Dana sub-district. The already stretched resources of all IDP camps within Northern Idlib have had to respond to the needs of these additional arrivals. The majority of these newly arrived IDP&#x2019;s are women and children, thus constituting the most vulnerable segments. 
Therefore, the continuation of the Humanitarian Relief Operations has become vital for the wellbeing of those affected in the Idlib region. As it stands, the total number of border relief assistance facilitated by the TRC has reached 1.014 Billion USD since 2012, which marks the beginning of the facilitation of the Cross-Border delivery of humanitarian relief supplies by the TRC. (Cover Page Comment 4 Response) Yearly breakdown 2012 / $25.904.596,89 - 2013 / $183.399.291,55 - 2014 / $207.325.974,35 - 2015 / $155.567.248,16 - 2016 / $205.574.885,94 - 2017 / $116.961.110,32 - 2018 / $79.915.282,99 - 2019 / $45.170.775,76. 2.402 Donors since August 2012 &#x2013; (166 International NGO &#x2013; 365 Domestic NGO) have been using these services (TRC Border Crossing Facilitation services are only available for humanitarian activities. 
In terms of the humanitarian assistance provided to those in need in Idlib, there are 8 Border Relief Points utilized by the TRC in both Hatay and Kilis. Three of these are in Kilis while five are in Hatay. It is essential to ensure that the alternative border crossings in Kilis are kept active in case the security situation on the ground prevents access through Hatay. When taking into account the entire logistical support activities by the TRC, a total of 46,534 trucks of humanitarian relief supplies have been facilitated across the border into Syria. Of these we see that 38 % are Food Items, 35 % are NFI, 16 % are Health, 4 % in WASH as well as 4 % in Shelter. 
The records maintained by the TRC in terms of the delivery of humanitarian relief supplies across the border are kept confidential however, vital statistics which assist in needs and gap analyses are regularly shared with the authorities responsible for the coordination of humanitarian relief activities such as UN OCHA. The TRC access across the border relief points as well as its neutral and transparent stance in regards to any political or military factions in Syria ensures humanitarian materials are able to reach areas in Syria where the beneficiaries are in the most need. A monthly activity report with infographics will be shared with UNOCHA and the Logistics Cluster to ensure overview of operations are coordinated with each organization.</narrative>
