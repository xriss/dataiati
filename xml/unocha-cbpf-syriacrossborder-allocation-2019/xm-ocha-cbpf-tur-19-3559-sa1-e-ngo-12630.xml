   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Increase access and improve quality of formal and non-formal education to affected children (5-17 years, boys and girls) in Northern Syria.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project aims to support formal and non-formal education for 9518 dropped-out children or who are at risk of dropping out of school (aged 5-17, 4182 boys and 5336 girls, 6976 IDPs and 2542 HCs) through supporting 9 schools, which their fund will be ended during June and July 2019. The project also works on expanding those schools so that they are able to receive more displaced children, where those schools are located in concentration points for IDPs in Al Dana, A&apos;zaz and Saraqab communities.
The project will be based on three interventions in the reached schools as follows:
First intervention: provides non-formal education for 2070 children(boys and girls) through catch up classes in 9 schools. Non-formal education will be provided through a 3-months Qabas curriculum, for a new group of students who will either catch up with their peers in the formal education or will continue learning in non-formal education for one more level. This step to be determined through pre and post placement test (ASER). This intervention will start mid of June 2019, as it will be carried out in three cycles (one in summer and two during the academic year)
Second intervention is to equip schools as well as rehabilitating the unused classrooms and expanding other new rooms by establishing prefabricated classes in those schools due to the large number of displaced children in targeted locations, so that they can receive students who successfully referred to formal education after passing the non-formal education phase and absorb students who come from the areas of displacement due to floods or other reasons, as well as the rehabilitation of toilets in schools, where we will equip existed toilets in terms of taps and any other necessary maintenance taking into consideration that some of those schools have been already rehabilitated within ECW and HF projects.
This will be done during summer, so will not affect the educational process. Furthermore, special tools and toilets for disabled children will be designed and provided to help them integrate into the educational environment as well as completing the shortages in safety and security equipment.
Third intervention aims to support formal education in 9 schools for 7448 children, as there is no other source of funding for those schools which means that they won&apos;t be able to continue providing children with education or even guarantee that they avoid dropping out of school (information&apos;s about targeted schools attached). The project will provide teachers and education personnel (M/F) with incentives in Dana and Sraqab schools, as A&apos;zaz schools already receive teachers&apos; incentives from other party.
Takaful will also provide operational costs, learning and teaching materials, schools&#x2019; supplies, and heating materials in addition to providing weekly PSS sessions to overcome the harsh experience of war conditions and to motivate them continuing their studies at schools. With the presence of a case worker and a PSS provider who supports the former through handling second-degree cases such as isolation, depression, and other situations as well as referring health or psychological cases
The project will increase the access for children with disabilities who dropped out of school and aims to empower them by providing transportation and special tools that increase their access and help overcome the difficulties that they may face
Plan B would be implemented, if we weren&apos;t able to reach some schools or they received support from another NGO, by selecting schools with the same criteria in the target districts or other sub-districts, where we have full access
We have coordinated with the Protection and WASH Clusters for the provision of protection and WASH activities within our project.
The adopted curriculum for non-formal education is designed by Bonyan, as this curriculum has been adopted by several projects funded by HF. As for the formal education, education Directorate curriculum will be adopted.</narrative>
