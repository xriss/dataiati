   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Emergency response to winterization needs to the newly IDPs in the north of Idleb.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project aims to distribute winterization heating means, stoves and fuel for 1000 families in Sarmada and Dana communities which have registered highest number of severity scale, the targeted population are the newly IDPs who are living out of camps but in inappropriate shelter (unfinished/bad conditions), in addition to most vulnerable locals (20% of beneficiaries) and the targeted families are who hosting displaced persons (vulnerable groups who should have special concern as described in HNO 2019) and that will increase the social cohesion in the HC, where perceived prioritization of resources to either IDPs or hosts can impact negatively on social cohesion, the selected winterization items are the life-saving heating means in its minimum, in the areas where (-2) is the lowest registered degree with some coverage of snow in different locations and (6) the average degree in winter, the winterization heating items will be distributed in a timely manner as:

1- Diesel stoves: diesel was the main heating source in 2018 as the local authorities described, affordable and available in the markets, the diesel stoves will be distributed with its accessories according to the cluster guidelines and recommendation and by the mid of November 2019 GAN could finalize the distribution of stoves.

2- Diesel fuel for heating for 3 months using e-voucher modality: the distribution will be conducted in 6 batches, starting from 1 December 2019 to 16 Feb 2020, each batch duration is 15 days including 7 days for redeeming process and 7 days for validation the existence of the families and PDM, if the family leave the area then GAN will register another family instead, 30$ per family will be assigned in each batch which is equal to 60 Liters of high-quality diesel according to the current price of fuel, so that each family will get 180$ in total during the project period.
Some vulnerable groups will have special consideration when delivering assistance like girls and women, elderly and people with disabilities, GAN will deliver and install the stoves for these groups and also deliver the bi-weekly quantities of fuel for heating to their homes, it is expected that 20% of the targeted families will meet these criteria.
 
In term of fuel suppliers: according to the assessment result there are limited fuel stations that could support the project in Sarmada and Dana, stations are located in the surrounded areas, adding to the scale of the diesel quality is differentiate from supplier to other, so GAN should be strict in term of diesel quality and beneficiaries dignity (ensure that the distribution points not far away from their homes), so GAN will contract with fuel supplier(s) to supply the needed quantities of high-quality diesel to avoid any harm to beneficiaries health and save their dignity, as a result, the e-voucher modality will be used in distribution points (assigned by GAN team and local stakeholders)

GAN experience of using e-voucher modality:
1- GAN started using this modality in 2018 through a pilot project for the distribution of NFI items (clothes and shoes) in Maarat Al-Numan, south of Idleb, although the big challenges in vendor selection and monitoring the redeeming process but the project was great and the impact was high comparing with in-kind modality as people concern in the PDM, 334 families, about (1492) beneficiaries benefited from the emergency project for newly IDP&apos;s from Eastern Ghouta.
The following short video of the project: https://youtu.be/DIKGqyficU4 
2- Emergency response for IDPs in Afrin (Food items): funded by THF, the project support life-saving food assistance for 3months through monthly 50$ voucher for food, the impact was great and the PDM shows the benefit and satisfaction of beneficiaries.
3- using e-voucher for incentives distribution: GAN use this modality for cash distribution for teachers and education personnel in two different projects, 247 are receiving cash monthly in schools</narrative>
