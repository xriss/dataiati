IHR founded multi needs in Maaret Tamsrin sub-district. To participate infill gaps IHR designed this project aiming to revitalize the agricultural and other sectors additional to creating a kind of integration among the community members in five communities, Maaret Tamsrin sub-district, through the following activities
- Distributing 500 agriculture vouchers with cost 150 $ per HH. Each HH has to select seeds enough for cultivating two donums of summer vegetable seeds (50%)okra, cowpea, jut mallow, cucumber, tomato, zucchini, yellow corn, eggplant, parsley, pepper and Bean. And getting on fertilizer, pesticides (30%)or tools based on the value of selected seeds. This means, selecting the seeds is mandatory for all, while the remain value is optional from the other items. As well, receiving a cash irrigation voucher with cost 80 $ per HH, which is enough for ten irrigation times. 
the IHR technical team will conduct extension visits for beneficiaries&#x2019; farms for seven months. This aims to provide farmers with technical information about the best agricultural practices and follow up the progress of plants&#x2019; growing. 
- Training 100 female-headed households on food processing, HACCP system, marketing, and small project management through three months to enable them to produce a food processed of dairy products and vegetables. In addition to distributing 100 food processing kit.
However, GBV survivors, female-headed households and disabled will take priority under this intervention
The first main objective is improving the food security of 500 vulnerable HHs women, men, HC and IDPs by providing them agriculture inputs of summer vegetable crops, fertilizer, pesticide, and cash for irrigation. The crops options selected from seeds as crops less need for water, less affected by environmental conditions and highly productive. As well, the targeted area is under the second and third stability areas, which faced challenges related to the big depletion of water resources. So, the cash voucher can enable the farmers to reach for optimal irrigation times, which is one of the response plans to mitigate the impact of drought on farmers.
Moreover, the availability of vegetable products which are the basic daily needs of HHs in the targeted area will reactivate the local market and improve access, especially for women. Therefore, mitigate the burden and risk of movement to farthest areas where the markets exist. As well, availability of agriculture raw material for food processing. 
While the second objective is to empower the female-headed households and create generating-source of income, therefore, protecting women by empowering them to become self-reliant. 
Finally, this project will be integrated with education and protection project that IHR is proposing to implement. the priority of BNFs will be for HHs who have Childs in school.
