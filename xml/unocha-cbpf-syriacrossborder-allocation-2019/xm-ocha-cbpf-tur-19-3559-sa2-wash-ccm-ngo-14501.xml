  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This intervention is designed as a complementary action to WATAN&apos;s WASH assistance program in self-settlements and camps located in north Syria which started in June 2019. The organization has decided to renew its WASH intervention in the same areas, due to an increased need for WASH assistance after the influx of IDPs from north Hama and south Idleb during may, and June 2019.The arrivals in 2019 have swelled to capacity the informal sites that had already seen arrivals in the last years. Furthermore, WATAN will improve the ongoing response and scaling it up by gravilling 4000 tents, in addition to mainstreaming the safety audit of the GBV safety audit for strengthening gender-based violence (GBV) response and prevention. As well as, changing the emergency WASH intervention is three camps to sustainable system, and improving the landfill of the camps to prevent the environmental bad impact of the bad practices of the solid waste management.

WATAN will provide 5,832 households (HHs) living in self-settlements and camps in the Idleb governorate with basic WASH services, drinking water by equipping a borehole to cover three camps, and water trucking to other camps, ensuring the safety of the water by chlorination and FRC tests for every water truck before start the distribution, solid waste management at the camps level and the landfill level, desludging and safe disposal of the waste water to a functional sewage systems, in addition to operating the latrines by hiring daily workers (men, and women) from the camps residents to clean the latrines daily. Special focus on the hygiene promotion to cover (personal hygiene, food hygiene, children hygiene, and women and adolescent hygiene during menstrual, and water safety at the HH level), in addition to one time distribution of 5,832 family consumable hygiene kits to all IDP&apos;s families in the targeted camps. Furthermore, WATAN will provide gravilling to 4000 tents in the targeted camps and the approaches of the camps to facilitate the WASH services during winter. 

Additionally, WATAN is planning to implement a safety audit questionnaire on a quarterly basis in order to inform recommendations across intervention for improving the security of women and girls in the camp&apos;s context and measure general improvement in camp conditions over time. The recommended actions based on the safety audit data should be interpreted as initial engagement points for strengthening gender-based violence (GBV) response and prevention. WATAN is planning to run a community centers in area of those targeted camps, north Dana south Aqiribat. The planned community center will provide health, education, nutrition, protection consultation and outreach workers to serve the camps in this area.  

The planned intervention will mainstream protection principles throughout the project cycle by considering the different needs of men, women, boys and girls. The provision of sanitation services (desludging, cleaning the latrines), will be consulted with women/men and boys/girls to ensure that they serve the communities equitably, and take into account the specific needs of these groups. WATAN has refined the content of hygiene kits in consultation with women and teenage girls through community meetings.

WATAN will hire female staff as community mobilizer and hygiene promoters, and protection specialist will be consulted in Gaziantep office to manage the hygiene promotion and implement the safety audit of the GBV during the implementation of the planned intervention.  The female hygiene promoters will take the lead in promoting hygiene awareness among communities in target locations. WATAN will hire women and men and will provide them with cleaning tools and materials to clean latrines in each targeted camp, in order to sustain those latrines and keep them clean for use by the whole c</narrative>
