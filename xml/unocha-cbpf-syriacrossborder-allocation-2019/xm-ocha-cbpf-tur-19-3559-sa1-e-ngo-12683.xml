   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Improve the access and the quality for formal and non-formal education in north-west Syria</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project is located in three of Afrin&#x2019;s sub-districts (Janderis, Sharan and Rajo) and consists of two key component areas: preparing currently out of school children for returning to formal learning, and securing equitable access to safe, quality formal education provision for children in these areas
A &#x2018;Back to Learning&#x2019; campaign will be undertaken in all areas.This will raise awareness with community leaders, parents, children and other stakeholders about the work of the project, and will encourage enrolment with non-formal provision as well as securing retention in formal provision reminders of the advantages and opportunities of education, as well as the human rights responsibilities, will be given alongside details of the upcoming rehabilitation works, ongoing support available to children and resources provided to families. As well as giving practical details of services, this will also inform parents of the project&#x2019;s efforts to mitigate the costs of school attendance (eg: by providing books and stationery). This work also forms part of the recruitment strategy for the emerging Parent/Teacher Associations,to secure ongoing community support and participation in the provision

For children not currently in school, non-formal education provision will be made in each of the three sub-districts. An initial cycle of ALP from July-September will target those children deemed most likely (based on assessments and time out of school) to be able to transition into formal provision for the start of the academic year 2019-2020.An additional cycle of ALP will be provided (up to February 2020) to give students with larger gaps in their learning experience extended support to ensure their later transition to formal learning

Additional ongoing support will be provided throughout the academic year once children have transferred to formal schools this will support their retention in this provision through remedial classes and homework support as appropriate. Children will be identified according to needs (difficulties with learning, access to learning spaces outside of school, at risk of dropping out etc
All NFE programs will integrate Child Protection activities (through provision of PSS sessions, Child Rights briefings etc) and referrals where needed, both within Alameen&#x2019;s service network and externally to other NGOs and service providers

In the formal component, a program of rehabilitation will be undertaken in 22 schools (21 primary and 1 secondary) across the three sub-districts.  This will include appropriate remedial works to the fabric of the buildings (doors, windows, lights, toilet facilities etc). For three schools (one in each of the sub-districts), additional building works will ensure the sites are appropriate and accessible for children with disabilities

Essential materials will be supplied to the schools, including whiteboards, classroom furniture, visual aids and other teaching materials. First aid kids and fuel during the winter months will be supplied security and safety plans will be established and resourced at each location. Stationery and text books will be provided for children and staff
Professional development and capacity building activities will enhance the performance and quality of the staff.  This will include Child Protection training for all personnel. Alongside initial teacher training for newly-recruited staff, all teachers will develop their capacity for working in crisis contexts (through programmes in establishing child- and trauma-friendly environments, classroom management, effective pedagogues etc). 
The project also includes provision of incentives for the volunteer teachers (both formal and non-formal teacher)
Through all these components, the project will therefore improve the access to and the quality of formal and non-formal education in north west Syria
 The project is  designed for covering the summer months in 2019 as well as the full period of  next  academic  year.</narrative>
