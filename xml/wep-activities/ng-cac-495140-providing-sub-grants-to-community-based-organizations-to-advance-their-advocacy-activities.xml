   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In the first quarter of 2018, WEP completed the process of engaging civil society organizations who will benefit from sub-grants to carry out advocacy activities in Benue and Nasarawa State. The eight (8) organisations that emerged for sub-granting are: Environment and Climate Change Amelioration Initiative (ECCAI); Nigerian Association of Women in Agriculture (NAWIA); Initiative for Women&#x2019;s Health Development and Right Protection (WRAHI); and Community Links and Human Empowerment Initiative (CLHEI) from Benue State. While Zamfara CSOs are Life Helpers Initiative (LHI), Voluntary Aid Initiative (VAI), Millennium Development Centre (MDC) and Future Hope Foundation (FHF).
