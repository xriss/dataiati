   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project titled: &#x201C;Ensuring Effective Implementation of Programmes, Policies and Legislations, that Contribute Towards Achieving Gender Equality in Nigeria by 2030&#x201D; is aimed at contributing specifically to the attainment of gender equality in Benue and Zamfara States of Nigeria. To ensure effective implementation of policies, programmes and legislations that will see to the attainment of gender equality in Nigeria, this project aims to achieve the following objectives: objectives 1. Advocate for policies and legislations that promote women participation at all levels of decision making, and remove all obstacles (social, political, cultural and economic) hindering women&#x2019;s empowerment and participation in decision making and infringing on women&#x2019;s rights. 2. Ensure effective implementation of programmes and projects through capacity building of CSOs, budget monitoring and information sharing. 3. Raise awareness amongst stakeholders on the fundamental women&#x2019;s rights. To effectively pursue the achievement of these objectives, this project will build capacities of 50 Civil Society Organizations (CSOs) (70% women Csos and 30% others) on gender programming for SDGs and gender budget monitoring. The capacities of CSOs will also be built on advocacy skills, as well as on using Open Data tool kits to track implementation of projects. Having built their capacities, these CSOs will support advocacy and monitoring of programmes and projects to ensure that women&#x2019;s concerns are adequately incorporated. The project also aims to build capacities of legislators and states executives on gender-responsive legislation, policies and programmes. This is to ensure that both legislators and execuitves in these states consider gender concerns in the course of their work. Furthermore, the project will review state policies and laws and see how they have taken into consideration the concerns of women. This project will raise awareness of all stakeholders on gender issues around policies and legislations through policy briefs, shadow reports and the media.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">NARRATIVE REPORT OF PRE-PROJECT ADVOCACY AND SENSITIZATION IN BENUE STATE HELD AT BENUE STATE PLANNING COMMISSION&#x2019;S CONFERENCE HALL, STATE SECRETARIAT, MAKURDI, BENUE STATE ON 8TH DECEMBER, 2016 1.0 INTRODUCTION Women Environmental Programme (WEP) supported by Kingdom of Netherlands for the implementation of a project &#x201C;Ensuring Effective Implementation of Programmes, Policies and Legislations, that contribute towards Achieving Gender Equality in Nigeria by 2030, seeks to ensure effective implementation of policies, programmes and legislations that will see to the attainment of gender equality in Nigeria. As part of the project activities, advocacy visits were carried out in one of the target states to meet with and brief the stakeholders about the goal and objectives of this project. The project team convened a meeting with identified women&#x2019;s rights civil society organizations to brief them about this project and seek their support. The team also met with members of the States Legislature and Executives to brief them about the planned actions in the state and seek their cooperation. 2.0 OBJECTIVES OF THE PRE-ADVOCACY AND SENSIZATION VISIT i. To identify relevant stakeholders that influence achievement of the project objectives. ii. To inform relevant stakeholders of the project particularly objectives and expected outcomes to elicit support and buy-in for the project. iii. To clearly discuss the roles and responsibilities of relevant stakeholders. Being a project targeted at increasing Women&#x2019;s participation in governance and decision making processes and promoting women&#x2019;s rights, the Project team identified to meet with the Benue State Commissioner for Women Affairs as a relevant Ministry to engage in the implementation of the project. The meeting was also to seek the support of her office in facilitating the process of reaching other stakeholders identfied on the project. The Commisioner agreed to support WEP in reaching out to the stakeholders for a meeting with them at an agreed date and venue. The meeting was fixed for 8th December 2016 where all invited stakeholders converged for the meeting. 3.0 OPENING REMARKS 3.1 Welcome Remarks from the Hon. Commissioner of Women Affairs The Hon. Commissioner, Ministry of Women Affairs Benue State, Barrister Mwuese Mnyim welcomed all the participants and was delighted to host the meeting designed to ensure programs and projects that involve gender inclusiveness in line with the government&#x2019;s agenda. She stated that efforts to guarantee gender equality in the state can be achieved with WEP and Netherlands&#x2019; Accountability fund support. She clarified the concept of gender equality which she said is being misunderstood and misinterpreted. According to her, gender equality means giving equal opportunities to both males and females to realize their full potentials. Gender inequality, she said was prevalent as there was currently a lot of discrimination going on. Boys and girls she concluded must be given equal opportunities to fulfill their potentials to contribute positively to development. 3.2 Remarks from WEP&#x2019;s Executive Director The Executive Director of WEP, Priscilla Achakpa, started with the regret that the Equal Opportunity Bill which could solve gender inequality issues was regrettably rejected by the National Assembly. This, she emphasized was due to misconception that equality means competition between men and women instead of equal opportunities for them. She attempted to disabuse the mentality that women want to challenge men&#x2019;s roles socially. She stressed further that gender at global level as understood was not exclusively women affairs but include men, physically challenged and the generally disadvantaged. MDGs as agreed globally did not produce the needed result hence the SDGs signed last year targets to achieve 50 -50 gender equality by 2030. According to her, Nigeria signed the SDGs and so is in agreement with the global target, yet has remained almost silent to gender equity within the nation and internationally. She added that the Netherland&#x2019;s Accountability Fund has the strategic objectives of: &#x2022; Addressing the unacceptable treatment of women &#x2022; Pushing for legislations that will assist women &#x2022; Empowerment programs that support gender equality &#x2022; Agitate for laws that will be gender inclusive as done elsewhere &#x2013; 50-50 &#x2022; Encourage women to stand up for their rights She went on to say that Zamfara State the second targeted State of the project where no woman had held any political post currently has two women Commissioners in the cabinet as a result of WEP&#x2019;s advocacy which had been on for a while. She concluded by urging for the needs to safeguard the future of the younger generation through gender inclusiveness. 4.0 PROJECT OVERVIEW The Program Manager of WEP Mr. John Baaki, gave the overview of the project. First, he gave a brief introduction of WEP, the implementing CSO of the Netherlands Accountability Fund. He noted that the project is to be carried out in Benue and Zamfara states within a period of five years and is entitled &#x2013;&#x201C;Ensuring Effective Implementation of Programmes, Policies and Legislations, that Contribute Towards Achieving Gender Equality in Nigeria by 2030.&#x201D; He examined the gaps that exist within the Governing cabinets of Benue and Zamfara States with conclusion that for Nigeria to achieve the SDGs with the slogan of &#x201C;leave no one behind&#x201D;, they must consider seriously issues that hinder women&#x2019;s participation in governance. The project&#x2019;s goal is to contribute towards the achievement of gender equality in Nigeria by 2030 and has the under-listed strategic objectives: 1. Advocate for policies and legislations that promote women participation at all levels of decision making, and remove all obstacles (social, political, cultural and economic) hindering women&#x2019;s empowerment and participation in decision making and infringing on women&#x2019;s rights. 2. Ensure effective implementation of programmes and projects through capacity building of CSOs, budget monitoring and information sharing. 3. Raise awareness amongst stakeholders on the fundamental women&#x2019;s rights. He concluded by highlighting the activities schedule for the project and requesting the support of the stakeholders towards the realization of the project goal and objectives. 4.1 Comments/Questions on the Presentation The presentations made by all the speakers were issues that Benue State had been living with hence, the interactive session was very exciting as participants all agreed the project was timely and wished it will finally address women&#x2019;s problems and proffer lasting solutions that were not achieved by similar projects in the past. One suggestion was to involve the Traditional rulers in the State who are custodians and support cultures that are oppressive to women such as women battering because of the right of refusal to sex, inheritance after their husband&#x2019;s demise etc; they noted women were more abused at grassroot levels. Further suggestion was for advocacy to be extended to grassroots to promote their complete acceptance of the project and equally sensitize stakeholders on women&#x2019;s basic rights. Further comments were for WEP to adapt a holistic approach by promoting women self-worth and women support for each other as currently, these are very prevalent issues that must be handled going forward. Working on self-worth must as a matter of necessity starts from the family set up, places of worship and programs that must curb issues of sexual abuse like incest which is common in the State. There was also a suggestion that the project should advocate for policies and legislations that address in strong terms sexual abuse cases and traditional rules &amp; customs that are disadvantageous to gender. One of the participants, a Clergy man admitted that the Church had tried in her way to maintain equality through various programs that advocate for women&#x2019;s right to their sexual needs and inheritance when they loss their spouses but the basis he said must be to deal with some of Benue State&#x2019;s cultures that are gender repressive. Another point raised was that, women who came out for political posts were majorly widows which behooves on the project to sensitize not only women to compete in elections but their husbands as well to give women the needed support. This they believed can be achieved by actively involving CSOs in the state in these campaigns. Participants suggested that the project should sensitize men and women to understand each other&#x2019;s life and encourage them to participate in politics while attempting to seek an amendment to the legislation that will make provision for a good number of women to be given consideration in vying for elective positions. Another school of thought was that, the lack of women in elective positions was their own doing because women hardly give support to their own thus there was no need to agitate for an exclusive legislation that will promote women inclusiveness in elective positions. Responding to the comments raised, WEP&#x2019;s Executive Director submitted as follows: &#x2022; There is need to empower youths economically &#x2022; Parents should accept their roles as change agents &#x2022; Solicit support of traditional and religious leaders, and CSOs to advocate for change in some anti &#x2013;gender laws/policies/legislations. &#x2022; The project will support CSOs through sub grants to carry out activities that will contribute to the achievement of the project goal and objectives. &#x2022; Women in most cases pull down themselves but self-worth must be in place to actualize their desires &#x2022; CSOs should learn to collaborate and work with government. &#x2022; CSOs must work with credibility to maintain integrity and attract attention. &#x2022; WEP is open to partnership with stakeholders in line with the thematic areas of interest. Also reacting to the participant who raised the issue of the project demanding legislations that will favor women inclusiveness as out of the box demand, as women already have full rights to participate in governance, WEP&#x2019;s Programme Manager submitted that the best strategy to favour women&#x2019;s inclusiveness in decision making is to set a &#x201C;Zebra Crossing&#x201D; for women specifying exactly their percentage of participation in relation to men. 5.0 CLOSING REMARKS In closing, the Commissioner, Ministry for Women Affairs was of the opinion that tackling women self-esteem requires the retrace of detailed history to deal with the issues as this was common within us and was viewed as a norm in our society, so much so that girls are even encouraged in homes to indulge in behaviors that demean their self-worth. This she reasoned can be curbed if culture and systems that promote lack of self esteem can be dealt with. She observed that women, have been relegated to the background for so long and have seen it as part of them, to change this may not require only pressing for legislations that are skewed to promoting women participation in decision making alone but may demand pragmatic steps to spur them into actions. She expressed her appreciation to WEP/Netherlands for the partnership that will bring an impact to development in Benue State and expressed the Governor&#x2019;s personal commitment to gender inclusiveness citing her appointment into the cabinet and certain steps in governance he has taken. 5.1 Vote of Thanks The vote of thanks was given by a Director in the Ministry of Women Affairs who on behalf of the Ministry and the government of Benue State expressed appreciation to the partnership of WEP/Netherlands and all that took out time to attend to the call of gender empowerment. 5.2 Conclusion Though the Pre-Advocacy and Sensitization meeting was successful, not all the stakeholders invited attended. The members of the Benue state House of Assembly were not in attendance while other Ministries had representatives in attendance. Generally there was acceptance and support for the project by participants.
