   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Provision of Shelter and non-food items to conflict affected IDPs and forced Returnees and Host Communities in Luakpiny/Nasir County of Upper Nile State</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">South Sudan is engulfed in optimism and high hopes for lasting peace following formation of a transitional Government of National Unity in February 2020. This is likely to influence movements of displaced people to locations of their origin. Humanitarian actors are bracing for an increase in needs across S/NFI, WASH, FSL, Health and other sectors. The Shelter and Non-Food Items (NFI) sector will be faced with increasing demands to support returnees and IDPs who will start lives under trees or in public facilities like schools and churches upon arrival, because their homes were destroyed during the conflict.
Based on the SSHF 2020 first allocation to support critical needs, World Vision is proposing to provide assistance to 20,000 conflict-affected individuals, comprising  IDPs and host communities in Upper Nile State. The project will be implemented through the single sector approach of intervention. Beneficiaries will comprise 4,300 men, 4,300 women, 5,700 boys and 5,700 girls. Affirmative action will be taken to meet needs of groups with special needs, including people living with disabilities and the elderly. This project will benefit Rubkona county in Unity State, Luakpiny/Nasir County in Upper Nile State. These locations will be served through the mobile response mechanism through which the organization&#x2019;s team of seven mobile staff would reinforce the static teams and be available to serve hard-to-access locations under National Cluster&#x2019;s directives. 

WV will conduct robust needs assessments in each location of the targeted project prior to any interventions to understand the existing and involve decision-making processes with beneficiaries in line with the most pressing needs. Beneficiaries will be empowered from inception of the project by conducting various meetings, to raise awareness on various issues that affect them for instance, HLP and Gender based violence related matters. Communities would also be introduced to a complaint mechanism where help desk will be established to gather issues that are related to the project but other sectorial issues will also be attended to. Before distribution, beneficiaries verification will be done to identify critical needs. The mobile response team will use the BMR that is been used by World Vision&#x2019;s Food Assistance team to screen beneficiaries during needs verifications. These efforts are aimed at avoiding duplication of humanitarian work and extend services to the most in need people. WV will encourage participation of communities by holding meetings through focus group discussions, and individual interviews throughout the project cycle. This would be reinforced by the formation of local initiatives for instance, forming and training of local committees, these groups will be responsible of disseminating information on the use of complaint mechanisms. The committees will sensitize beneficiaries on other issues including community resilience and mobilization of resources for local projects. The project will help build community capacity on the coronavirus pandemic prevention measures. WV will conduct community awareness in regards to covid19. Sensitization messages will be incorporated in all NFI messaging activities and convergence of beneficiaries for distribution or meetings will be done in line with the preventive measures, for instance beneficiaries will keep one meter distance when queuing up to receive NFI entitlements during distributions. Local workers will wear PPEs at distribution points.
In terms of coordination under this project, WV will ensure partners are directly involved at national and field levels. The NFI cluster remains the main body where WV will seek technical guidance regarding operationalization of the project. WV will work closely with the logistics cluster and IOM to ensure that project supplies are sourced and provided on time. WV intends to work with local partners with presence in the target locations during assessments to strengthen their capa</narrative>
