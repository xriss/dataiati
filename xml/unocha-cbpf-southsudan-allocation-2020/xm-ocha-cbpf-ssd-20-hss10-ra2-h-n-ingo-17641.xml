   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Integrated response to health and nutrition consequences of flooding in Rumbek Centre, Rumbek East, Yirol East and Awerial Counties, Lakes State</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The present proposal is part of the lifesaving integrated response to flooding consequences in Lakes State. Focus will be on health in Rumbek Centre, Rumbek East and Yirol East Counties and on nutrition in Awerial County. It will complement CUAMM routine and emergency support to County Health System and Nutrition program and what proposed by other Partners under current response as per concerned Clusters orientations.
The project is aligned to the HRP 2020 strategic objectives chosen for the SSHF reserve allocation. It will contribute to &#x201C;reduce morbidity and mortality, as well as suffering from protection threats and incidents, of the most vulnerable populations in areas with severe need&#x201D; and to &#x201C;facilitate safe, equitable and dignified access to critical cross-sectoral basic services to enable populations to meet their basic needs in areas with severe need&#x201D;, with activities reflecting those suggested by both Health and Nutrition Clusters, to be implemented in the Counties most affected by flooding and their consequences and aimed to ensure continuous and wide provision of integrated health/nutrition preventive and curative services at Health Facilities and with mobile team/community based volunteers, impeding further deterioration of but improving people conditions and preventing/containing eventual outbreaks. 
Flooding have disrupted people living conditions and forced many households to migrate, looking for basic goods and services. The high demand for health and nutrition care of this seriously vulnerable population constitutes an additional burden on the already weak facilities, where assistance offer has been compromised even further by the heavy rains, which have damaged infrastructures and equipment, and it is resulting inadequate to cope with an increasing catchment population under IDPs influx. New settlements have been created in areas not served by any health care unit/center, with people risking of not accessing the needed health and nutrition attendance.
The project will restore and strengthen Health Facilities capacities of providing essential health and nutrition services due at their level of care, prioritizing those located where IDPs presence have been notified. Mobile Health and Nutrition Team will be established and deployed to the sites hosting displaced Households. Their action will be complemented by community health workers offering ICCM package and community nutrition volunteers for mass screening in the most isolated and/or crowded villages, appointed within the same targeted areas if not present or if existing network will result not sufficient to guarantee effective coverage for preventive and curative basic services. Health and nutrition services will be one the entry point for the others, for each individual to get the most comprehensive care possible. EPI boosting activities will be considered for preventing outbreaks, as well as hygiene promotion through wash and waste management enhancement at the (overcrowded) health facilities and people health education. 
CUAMM is aware displacement being a traumatic experience and displaced settlements being not conducive to  vulnerable people protection. Basic information on Mental Health and GBV and on dedicated services will be provided during health/nutrition education and Health Facilities/Mobile Team staff and community volunteers will be enabled to identify and handle eventual cases, even organizing the referral to centers providing CMR and First Line Psychosocial attendance. When intervening on health facilities infrastructures or arranging mobile health/nutrition sites, particular attention will be paid to people with disabilities exigencies, to ensure their smooth access to care.
The project will benefit 61878 individuals (12638 M, 20704 W, 14839 B, 13697 G), 55394 accessing improved health services (OPD and EPI, ie Measles) and 6484 nutrition ones (U5 screening and treatment, PLW treatment and information, staff training)</narrative>
