  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The intervention will support 28,200 individuals (4700 households) in Jur River in  Western Bahr El Ghazal state (WBeG) with livelihoods inputs (crops, vegetable and fisheries kits), to increase food production, livelihoods protection and the transition towards household self-reliance and resilience. The 4700 households from crop and fishing communities who are supported by crop and fishing kit will also receive vegetable input support.The project will utilize the humanitarian pipe line for crops, vegetables and fisheries kits from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).  These activities will be complimented by training in the specific livelihoods so as to improve the production capacities and improve yields and returns.  The fisheries training will enable target beneficiaries utilize their kits in the proper way and also improve their knowledge and skills in fish processing, preservation and marketing.  The crops and vegetable production training will be based on the production stage which includes land preparation, planting weeding, pest and disease management, harvesting, post-harvest management and marketing. Using the training of trainers approach, the project will target 3, 134 farmers (1567) and fisher folk (1567)for direct training and engage community based extension workers to provide the technical support to these farmers while they replicate the training to the other beneficiaries. The project teams will work closely with local authorities to identify persons with disabilities both men and women so that they are supported. This number is not expected to exceed 5% of the 4,700 HH targeted.

The intervention will contribute to livelihoods protection efforts for the most vulnerable internally displaced persons (IDPs), returnees and host communities in order to enable them meet their basic food and other household needs, while protecting their assets and livelihoods and resilience to shocks and stresses. Gender and age dis-aggregated information will be collected in preparation for, during implementation, monitoring and evaluation of the activities. This information will be used in designing and implementation of activities in order to provide equitable and relevant support to the different target groups. The intervention will incorporate safe programming principles in order to protect the target groups and communities from protection concerns that are related to implementation of the activities in conflict situations. This will include a good understanding of the protection risks related to the intervention and identifying the mitigation measures that should be part of the intervention. These will be monitored throughout the implementation phase. Efforts towards integrated approach both targeting same communities and target groups with a variety of food security and livelihoods interventions and with other sectors will be done to strengthen the holistic approach and enhance household and community capacities to anticipate, cope, adapt and recover from effects of conflict and environmental shocks. The proposed project will complement NRC&apos;s Food security and Resilience in Transitioning Environments (FORESITE) project being implemented in Jur River with funding from European Union targeting smallholder farmers, the Safety Net project assisting vulnerable food insecure persons in Wau county funded by African Development Bank and implemented by WFP and NRC partnership using direct cash distribution and support to livelihoods.  All agricultural and fisheries activities will be implemented in collaboration with the State Ministry of Agriculture in order to ensure that government extension workers benefit from and also contribute to the technical components that will be offered by the project by so doing building capacities that will continue to be utilized after project closure. Community based extension workers such as lead farmers will be trained to continue supporting other farmers during and after project closure</narrative>
