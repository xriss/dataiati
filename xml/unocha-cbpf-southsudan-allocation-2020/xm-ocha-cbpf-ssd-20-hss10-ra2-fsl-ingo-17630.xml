   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Enhanced Access to Emergency Food Production for Flood affected IDPs and Vulnerable Host Communities in Cueibet, Rumbek East, Yirol East and Yirol West Counties, Lakes State</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project is aimed at improving the food security situation of vulnerable flood-affected Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) and host communities in Emergency (IPC Phase 4) or Crisis (IPC Phase 3) in Cueibet, Rumbek East, Yirol East and Yirol West Counties of Lakes State. This will be achieved through provision of timely and appropriate emergency flood response kits (vegetable and fishing) to save the lives of the affected populations and avert a total collapse of livelihoods in the target Counties. Provision of vegetable and fishing kits is expected to save lives, improve food production of the target households (HHs) thus improving their food security, supporting them to recover from the crisis associated with the floods and conflicts and placing them on an accelerated path to early recovery and resilience to acute shocks. 

NPA will support 17,150 HHs (102,900 individuals) in the four target counties as follows, Cueibet-5,700 HHs (34,200 individuals), Rumbek East-7,300 HHs (43,800 individuals), Yirol East-2,500 HHs (15,000 individuals), Yirol West-1,650 HHs (9,900 individuals) with emergency vegetable and fishing kits. The kits will be provided by FAO through the FSL cluster. NPA will collect the kits at the FAO Rumbek store, transport them to the project locations and distribute them to the target beneficiaries. NPA will employ a community-based beneficiary selection in this project whereby the vulnerable IDPs and host communities will be selected based on the  agreed-on beneficiary selection criteria. Specifically, NPA will target vulnerable flood-affected HHs whose livelihoods and access to food have been destroyed as a result of the floods with a special focus on women-headed HHs, child-headed HHs, HHs with disabled members and households with malnourished children under 5 years. NPA will facilitate the establishment and training of all-inclusive Project Management Committees (PMCs) in the 26 target payams in the four counties. The PMC&#x2019;s will lead the beneficiary selection, project implementation and monitoring activities. Vulnerable flood-affected HHs experiencing severe food insecurity including female, child, disabled/chronically ill headed HHs persons living with or at risk of HIV/AIDS and survivors of Gender-Based Violence (GBV) will be targeted in this project. 

NPA will sensitize the target HHs on agronomic and fishing practices prior to the distribution of the vegetable and fishing kits to ensure that the kits are used appropriately through model farmers trained as ToT&apos;s. NPA will also advise and work hand in hand with the target communities to select higher grounds for vegetable production. Provision and use of the vegetable and fishing kits is expected to save lives and contribute to improvement of the Household Dietary Diversity Score (HDDS) and Food Consumption Score (FCS) of the targeted HHs.

The target communities will be the prime movers of the implementation process through their continuous engagement in the project. NPA will hold regular meetings with the PMCs and community members and conduct Post Distribution Monitoring (PDM) to get their feedback on project implementation. NPA will ensure that their feedback is incorporated in the implementation of this project and design of future projects. Further, to promote accountability to the affected populations, NPA will use a community-based complaints and feedback mechanism to provide a platform for beneficiaries&apos; active involvement in the project and avenues to voice any issues or concerns.

Through this project, beneficiaries will be provided with farming tools and fishing kits which they will continue to use beyond the project period to sustain food production beyond the project period. Beneficiaries will be encouraged to sell any extra produce in the local markets so as to generate income which they can use to continue with vegetable production and meet other HH needs once the project ends.</narrative>
