  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">South Sudan has been affected by flooding in areas along the White Nile since July 2020. As at 6 October, an estimated 800,000 people have been affected by the floods in 37 counties with the highest impact being in Jonglei, Lakes and Upper Nile. CARE International in collaboration with other agencies conducted needs assessments in Jonglei and Paring which revealed numerous challenges that people are facing such as the loss of their homes, assets, and access to life-saving services such as protection and health care. CARE would like to embark on a response as follows: 
Component 1: Provision of Protection Services in Bor South and Twic East
Under this component, CARE&#x2019;s aims to provide immediate life-saving GBV response and prevention services to flood affected and displaced people from Twic East and Bor. The project targets to reach out 18770 beneficiaries. To provide emergency GBV assistance, CARE will establish and run 5 temporary WGFSs and women and girls who visits temporary WGFSs will be provided with individual /group PSS along with recreational activities to overcome stress and trauma due to flood and GBV incidents. With regards to case management, to uphold the Do No Harm principle CARE will identify the GBV cases in temporary WGFSs and refer to GBV services with better data protection facilities and more sustainable. In doing so, identified GBV survivors facing financial barriers to access GBV services such as Clinical Management of Rape (CMR) and legal aid will be supported with cash for protection assistance. Two comprehensive referral pathways will be developed and disseminated. Most vulnerable women and girls will be supported with emergency materials such as dignity kit, cooking utensils and emergency cloth set. 10 safety audits will be conducted to identify the protection threats and to inform the project team on specific vulnerabilities, security risks and mitigation plan. Outreach volunteers will be hired, trained, equipped and mobilized to conduct outreach activities. Group awareness sessions and radio series and jingles will promote the preventive approach and provides correct and adequate information on GBV and referrals. Finally, front-line health workers, local authorities, service providers, will be trained on GBV, GBV guiding principles, pocket handbook and COVID prevention measures. 
Component 2: Provision of Health Services in Pariang
Under this component, we aim to provide access to high quality health services that will respond to the leading causes of morbidity and mortality among the flood affected population of Pariang County. The project will achieve by ensuring that he flood affected population has access to quality emergency health services that meet the Ministry of Health and WHO standards and is supported to access health services where challenges exist e.g. flooded roads by supporting referral services. To achieve its goal, CARE will establish 2 mobile clinics to provide health services to the displaced populations that cannot access the existing health facilities. CARE will also support 6 static health facilities to ensure that they can cope with the high number of patients that they are currently seeing. Training will be provided to all staff involved in the delivery of this project to ensure that quality standards are maintained. Furthermore, medical supplies will be procured and provided to each of the 8 supported health facilities. To ensure that the community is involved in project delivery, CARE will form health committees for each of the health facilities being supported. CARE will also use existing boma health workers, and community health volunteers, opinion leaders and community key informants to reach the most vulnerable populations in the community. CARE will also ensure that all the data generated from the project will be captured in the DHIS 2 and IDSR of the Ministry.</narrative>
