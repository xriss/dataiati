  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">SAADO&apos;s proposed project will provide emergency GBV prevention and response services for vulnerable flood and conflict affected populations in Duk County, Jonglei state, targeting 16,156 beneficiaries (6,056 Women, 5,680 Girls,2,210 Men, 2,210 Boys) and food security, livelihoods support to 30,000 beneficiaries(18000 Men12000 Women) in Juba County. SAADO proposes to implement GBV prevention, response and risk mitigation activities by providing quality and timely, age appropriate, case management and psychosocial support to GBV survivors. This project is designed to improve responses to cases of GBV and enhance the ability of survivors to recover from GBV incidences. SAADO will work with partners to provide individual and group psychosocial support for women and girls in 4 established women and girls&apos; safe spaces (4-WGFS) supporting women and girls. The project&apos;s proposed activities will also include case management for survivors, dialogue sessions, psychosocial support through group counseling sessions targeting 3500 survivors, 800 vulnerable women and girls will be engaged in skills building and IGA&apos;s activities such as embroided bedsheets, table cloths and beading, information sharing sessions on pertinent issues and topics identified by the women. SAADO also intends to strengthen the gender-based violence community-based protection mechanisms (CBPN&#x2019;s) available to reduce GBV risks on men, women, boys and girls.  
SAADO&#x2019;s proposed FSL project intervention in Juba County aims to increase food availability and access by providing emergency livelihood support kits and adaptive training to most flood affected vulnerable IDPs, subsistence farmers and fisher-folk households to increase fish and vegetable production, mainly for consumption at the household level and sale of surplus at local markets. The proposed project targets 30,000 beneficiaries in Juba with emergency fishing, livelihood and vegetable kits in Mangala payam. The location was chosen in accordance to the Food Security Outlook Update for South Sudan (FEWSNET, August and September 2020) in which Juba County which has about 42,000 people affected by the floods in IPC phase 3 amp 4.The proposed project will target 30,000 beneficiaries from Mangala Payam of Juba County who will be supported with fishing kits, crop kits and vegetable kits which avails immediate benefits by providing white meat for the HHs (fish) as well as providing an alternative source of income through the sale of surplus fish. This income will be used to supplement the HHs food requirements as well as address urgent HHs needs. To ensure maximum realization of benefits as well as ensure sustainability, HHs will be trained on improved fish production practices such as catch hygiene, fish postharvest and preservation as well as utilization and nutrition training. They also will be supported with vegetable kits to address their nutritional requirement in the short-term (early 3-weeks). Income from the sale of surplus produce will be used to purchase alternative food requirements such as (sorghum) as well as supplement the HH dietary needs. Farmers will receive basic training on improved agronomic practices with regards to small-scale vegetable production. All the 30,000 beneficiaries will be supported with vegetable kits. The emergency livelihood kits will be obtained from the FSLC-recommended/FAO pipeline to communities affected by the ongoing crisis in Juba County. SAADO will put in place a mechanism for effective and participatory community vulnerability mapping and use a comprehensive beneficiary selection criterion developed and discussed and agreed upon with the communities to include Men, Women, Boys and Girls.</narrative>
