   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Health service delivery in South Sudan has had challenges precipitated by years of civil unrest, political instability and natural Disasters. This has led to weakened health systems thus affecting health service delivery in the country and has remained having one of the worst health indicators in the world. Maternal mortality rate remains at 789/100000 live births which is far above the threshold.(UNICEF 2020).
Tonj South and East have had serious health challenges due to internal conflict among the communities which has seen displacements of communities and weakened the health systems. According to IRNA report on multispectral Needs assessment done on 12th -17th May 2020, a total of 91695 individuals were displaced due to internal conflict. This was the time preparation for planting was due thus affected the livelihoods of the populations.
Flooding has also been a major problem in the county and it affected livelihoods, Destroyed crops and also submerged health facilities leading to major Humanitarian Crisis. According to the IPC analysis done in December 2020, a total of 17991 individuals in Tonj East and a total of 13849 individuals in Tonj South are in IPC phase five. This is a very catastrophic condition which calls for holistic approach to avert loss of lives.
TADO therefore will support the health service delivery to affected populations in Tonj South and East by Providing integrated health services  through mobile health interventions and static facilities in the two counties. TADO will run 2 Mobile units one in each county and 2 PHCUs one in each county to improve access to health services to the affected populations. The Services will be offered in Paliang Payam and Wunlit Payams in Tonj East and Tonj and Wanhalel Payams in Tonj South. 
This will ensure that the affected populations have access to live saving health services like, Out patient consultations in the mobile units and in the static facilities, EPI services which will ensure that the children are vaccinated thus averting vaccine preventable infections like measles, ANC and deliveries by skilled births attendants which will greatly reduce maternal mortality and morbidity rates.
TADO will offer Integrated Nutrition services through growth monitoring, Case management of SAM with Medical Complications and referral to Nutrition centers children diagnosed with malnutrition through routine growth monitoring services in the health facilities. This will be done through collaboration with World Vision which is a Lead Nutrition partner on ground.
TADO will also ensure behavior change communication through health education which will ensure that the communities will embrace early health seeking behaviors, practice hygienic behavior and also improved nutritional status through good eating habits. COVID 19 prevention messaging will also be passed to the communities and prevention guidelines will be observed during the implementation of the project to ensure that the health facility staffs and the communities have knowledge on prevention measures.
TADO will ensure that affected and vulnerable populations are given mental health services through provision of Psychosocial support and physiological first aid during the project implementation. Referral pathways for GBV victims and case management will be done thus ensuring that Protection issues in the community are taken care of. 
TADO will target 48290 vulnerable and affected populations with 11325 Male, 16120 Female, 8915 Boys and 11930 Girls, This will be 14487 Host Communities, 24145 IDPs and 9658 returnees Out of which 28974 will be from Tonj East and 19316 From Tonj South and 6300 people with disabilities.
