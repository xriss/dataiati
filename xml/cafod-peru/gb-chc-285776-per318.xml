  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project is a direct continuation of PER313.
Peru has suffered severely during the first wave of the COVID19, with, for many months, the highest per capita death rate globally. The government&apos;s initial strict quarantine response began on 15 March 2020, and, at the beginning of February 2021 was reintroduced as the second wave of the virus hit Peru. This has exacerbated the already severe economic crisis, which has caused thousands of young people and adults to lose their jobs. In this context, the most impoverished areas continue to organise themselves in community kitchens and self-managed canteens, and seek support. Hospitals are again overwhelmed; there is no oxygen nor any available ICU beds. Medicines to alleviate CV19 symptoms, are now only available with a prescription and at vastly increased prices.

Local families and Venezuelan migrants have been identified through the parishes and pastoral workers in the two project areas, which were selected, as they are two of the worst affected districts in Lima and indeed in Peru. These are families living in poverty and extreme poverty who are not in work, nor able to earn and income, including people who are isolated due to CV19. The situation of the Venezuelan migrant population is critical, as 90% of them are in Lima and 90% of those do not have a work contract or health insurance. Nor do they have a family network around them to support them. This new project will provide 240 meals a day, 6 days a week, for two months, to people who have fallen between the cracks and who have no income. PPE will be provided as needed.

This project also seeks to enable those who cannot purchase prescribed medicines/oxygen to alleviate COVID19 symptoms or other illnesses such as diabetes due to their lack of income, to do so, with financial support. 

This project takes part alongside a nationwide response by Caritas Peru,  the diocese&apos;s own response, Bishop&apos;s Conference and in coordination with the Ministry of Health.</narrative>
