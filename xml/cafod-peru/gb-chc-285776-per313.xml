  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">To date (4/6) Peru has over 178,914 confirmed cases of COVID19 and 4894 deaths. The healthcare system is very weak, and food insecurity has increased the longer the government&apos;s strict quarantine response continues. It began on 15 March and remains in force to try to stem transmission. The quarantine rules are causing extreme hardship for migrants and local families, who have lost any source of income. Medicines to alleviate CV19 symptoms, once available for purchase without a prescription, are now only available with a prescription and at vastly increased prices due to their shortage. Local families and Venezuelan migrants have been identified through the parishes and pastoral workers in the two proposed areas of intervention. These two areas have been selected, as they are two of the worst affected districts in Lima and indeed in Peru. These are families living in poverty and extreme poverty who are not in work, nor able to earn and income, including people who are isolated due to CV19.  They are food insecure as they do not currently feature on lists to receive state support through the government grant or food basket schemes due to incomplete and inaccurate local records. This project will provide food rations to 30 people who have fallen between the cracks and who have no income, for 2 months. PPE will be provided as needed in the soup kitchens where the food will be prepared and collected from.

This project also seeks to enable those who cannot purchase prescribed medicines to alleviate COVID19 symptoms or other illnesses such as diabetes due to their lack of income, to do so, with financial support. PPE will be provided as needed to those collecting medicines for the sick from pharmacies.

This project takes part alongside a nationwide response by Caritas Peru and the diocese&apos;s own response.</narrative>
