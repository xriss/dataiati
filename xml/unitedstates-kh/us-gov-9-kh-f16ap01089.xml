   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This award strives to conserve biodiversity and manage natural resources in ways that maintain their long-term viability and preserve their potential to meet the needs of present and future generations. Activities include combating illegal and corrupt exploitation of natural resources and the control of invasive species. This includes ?The purpose of this project is to continue to fund the only environmental education team in Cambodia, and brings the plight of the Asian elephant and ivory trade to the Cambodian public. The project has expanded its reach and scope via a MoU with the Government of Cambodia to include national schools and communities in Phnom Penh and Preah Sihanouk, home to Cambodia&#x2019;s largest port. The Kouprey Express Environmental Education Program (KE) consists of a curriculum that builds the capacities of students and teachers through a national awareness campaign that highlights poaching, wildlife trade, habitat loss and habitat degradation and fragmentation. A strong anti-ivory message aims to reduce local and regional demand and complicity in the transport of ivory into, through, and out of Cambodia. Specific project activities will include: 1) delivery of education curriculum to rural schools in the Cardamom Mountains, Kompong Som and Phnom Penh, focusing on threats to flagship species; 2) improving the understanding of key environmental issues among teachers, community educators, and leaders through training, staff development, monitoring and evaluation, and provide multiple-use long lasting educational materials; 3) conduct field trips to Phnom Tamao Wildlife Rescue Center for students and community members; 4) conducting 15+ interactive hands-on Community Night Shows; 5) conduct anti-ivory and wildlife ID trainings with Customs and Excise officers at primary points of entry; 6) raise awareness on the devastating effects of the illegal wildlife trade with a focus on elephants and ivory through community outreach programs, installation of billboards, and posting hotline stickers on 10 tuk-tuks in Phnom Penh, promoting Wildlife Alliance&#x2019;s 24-hour nationwide wildlife crime hotline. This project&#x2019;s on-the-ground elephant protection and anti-ivory campaign and education and community outreach program combined with the recipient&#x2019;s on-going work in wildlife crime law enforcement will help curb the tide of ivory transiting through Cambodia and support the authorities charged with protecting Cambodia&#x2019;s wildlife. ?.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">Through partnerships with the Cambodian government, civil society, and the private sector, the United States aims to improve regional security and help the Cambodian people by addressing a broad spectrum of needs. The United States foreign policy priorities for Cambodia are to support the development of sustainable democratic institutions, foster respect for human rights, promote broad-based, sustainable economic growth, reduce food insecurity, and increase access to quality healthcare. In the run-up to the 2017 commune council elections and the 2018 parliamentary elections, the U.S. government is focusing on promoting political competition, strengthening civil society, and fostering transparency in election administration. After 20 years of economic growth, Cambodia is poised to join the ranks of the world&apos;s lower-middle income countries, but inequality and corruption still limit economic opportunities for the country&apos;s rural majority. Despite impressive achievements in reducing maternal mortality and expanding access to HIV treatment, health and nutrition challenges remain. Inadequate education and poor literacy rates are an impediment to sustainable growth. Porous borders facilitate transnational criminal activities. Programs supporting the President&apos;s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), the Global Health Initiative (GHI), the President&apos;s Malaria Initiative (PMI), Feed the Future (FTF), and the Global Climate Change Initiative (GCCI) will further reduce health and human development constraints, improve food security and resiliency, help Cambodia adapt to climate change, and conserve the country&apos;s natural resources.</narrative>
