   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This award strives to conserve biodiversity and manage natural resources in ways that maintain their long-term viability and preserve their potential to meet the needs of present and future generations. Activities include combating illegal and corrupt exploitation of natural resources and the control of invasive species. This includes &#x201C;Cambodian Crocodile Conservation Programme: Ensuring the Future of the Critically Endangered Siamese Crocodile in the Wild.&#x201D; In partnership with Fauna &amp; Flora International this project will increase the viability of Siamese crocodiles in the wild through direct protection, in situ conservation, and captive breeding and reintroduction. Specific activities include: (1) conduct annual transect-based monitoring of crocodile abundance and reproduction at key sites; (2) conduct post-release monitoring of reintroduced crocodiles; (3) strengthen management and monitoring by having community wardens patrol three crocodile wetlands and one reintroduction site on a monthly basis and will report illegal activities to the authorities; (4) develop boundaries, regulations and management plans for the newly established crocodile sanctuaries with relevant stakeholders; (5) provide livelihoods and other social support enabling communities near key sites to reduce impacts on crocodiles and their habitat; (6) release at least 25 additional Siamese crocodiles from the Phnom Tamao Breeding Facility and the Areng Sanctuary into the six preselected sites; (7) test crocodile DNA test to identify purebred individuals that could potentially be released back into the wild; (8) facilitate crocodile conservation network meetings on a quarterly basis; (9) disseminate information on the conservation and cultural importance of the Siamese crocodiles to the Crocodile Conservation Network members as well as a wider audience..</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">Through partnerships with the Cambodian government, civil society, and the private sector, the United States aims to improve regional security and help the Cambodian people by addressing a broad spectrum of needs. The United States foreign policy priorities for Cambodia are to support the development of sustainable democratic institutions, foster respect for human rights, promote broad-based, sustainable economic growth, reduce food insecurity, and increase access to quality healthcare. In the run-up to the 2017 commune council elections and the 2018 parliamentary elections, the U.S. government is focusing on promoting political competition, strengthening civil society, and fostering transparency in election administration. After 20 years of economic growth, Cambodia is poised to join the ranks of the world&apos;s lower-middle income countries, but inequality and corruption still limit economic opportunities for the country&apos;s rural majority. Despite impressive achievements in reducing maternal mortality and expanding access to HIV treatment, health and nutrition challenges remain. Inadequate education and poor literacy rates are an impediment to sustainable growth. Porous borders facilitate transnational criminal activities. Programs supporting the President&apos;s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), the Global Health Initiative (GHI), the President&apos;s Malaria Initiative (PMI), Feed the Future (FTF), and the Global Climate Change Initiative (GCCI) will further reduce health and human development constraints, improve food security and resiliency, help Cambodia adapt to climate change, and conserve the country&apos;s natural resources.</narrative>
