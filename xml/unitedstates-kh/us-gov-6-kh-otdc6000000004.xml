   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Since 2011, a team of intermittent advisors has been supporting the Budget Department and 10 pilot ministries in the full implementation of program budgeting. The advisors completed an assessment of the pilot ministries&#x2019; program budgets and developed sector program budget manuals, training materials, as well as the provision of extensive training to prepare the pilot ministries for implementation of program budgeting in 2015. Pilot ministries, as well as the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF) Budget Department, now have a core group of competent program budgeting trainers. The advisors will coach, mentor and support the MEF Budget Department in training program budgeting trainers in the remaining 29 ministries and deepening the understanding of program budgeting in these ministries. Additionally, the advisors will provide support for developing budget execution policies and procedures to ensure that budget execution flexibility is established.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">Through partnerships with the Cambodian government, civil society, and the private sector, the United States aims to improve regional security and help the Cambodian people by addressing a broad spectrum of needs. The United States foreign policy priorities for Cambodia are to support the development of sustainable democratic institutions, foster respect for human rights, promote broad-based, sustainable economic growth, reduce food insecurity, and increase access to quality healthcare. In the run-up to the 2017 commune council elections and the 2018 parliamentary elections, the U.S. government is focusing on promoting political competition, strengthening civil society, and fostering transparency in election administration. After 20 years of economic growth, Cambodia is poised to join the ranks of the world&apos;s lower-middle income countries, but inequality and corruption still limit economic opportunities for the country&apos;s rural majority. Despite impressive achievements in reducing maternal mortality and expanding access to HIV treatment, health and nutrition challenges remain. Inadequate education and poor literacy rates are an impediment to sustainable growth. Porous borders facilitate transnational criminal activities. Programs supporting the President&apos;s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), the Global Health Initiative (GHI), the President&apos;s Malaria Initiative (PMI), Feed the Future (FTF), and the Global Climate Change Initiative (GCCI) will further reduce health and human development constraints, improve food security and resiliency, help Cambodia adapt to climate change, and conserve the country&apos;s natural resources.</narrative>
