   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Armed clashes, rocket fire, shelling, and raids in Kayin State have destroyed villages and caused the recent displacement of hundreds of households to Myaing Gyi Ngu camp in Hlaingbwe township, where thousands of families have been living in protracted displacement since 2016. The extensive contamination of landmines and the escalating conflict disrupt agricultural livelihoods, and border closures due to COVID-19 have further increased the threat of food insecurity and malnutrition in the township. Hlaingbwe township is also affected by heavy monsoon floods which increase the risk of disease transmission and limit humanitarian access.
The Karen Ethnic Health Organization Consortium (KEHOC) is an Ethnic Health Organization that is experienced in multisectoral humanitarian response and trusted by conflict-affected communities in Kayin State. In partnership with KEHOC, CPI will respond to reach Myaing Gyi Ngu (MGN) I and MGN II IDP camps (5430 IDPs).     KEHOC will ensure continuous access to essential health, nutrition, WASH, and protection services in MGN II camp, where KEHOC has provided multisectoral humanitarian response with MHF support since 2018. In MGN I camp, the military coup and the participation of basic health staff in the Civil Disobedience Movement have led to a closure of the camp&#x2019;s health clinic   and severely restricted access to humanitarian services. In coordination with camp authorities and other actors (WHO, UNICEF), KEHOC will negotiate access to extend lifesaving services to people in MGN I and 8 conflict-affected villages. During 2020, the accessibility is seriously affected and mitigate with implementing local partner, KEHOC. For this project, CPI and partner will use the various ways of locally feasible approach and reach to IDPs.  
MGN Camp I IDP clinic was run by government staffs (MW, PHS II) in terms of HR, the clinic was supported by CPI and MHAA in terms of infrastructure and medicine supplies. After Feb, 2021, the clinic was shut down due to lack of MW/PHS II running on it. This project is proposed to support Ethnic Health Team to reach health care for IDPs. 


The project places affected populations at the center of the intervention to promote meaningful access, with a focus on addressing the specific vulnerabilities of different groups including women, persons with disabilities, and LGBTQI+ persons. All outreach, awareness raising, and education sessions are conducted by KEHOC health workers, who are members of the same communities they serve, in local languages. For responsive, evidence-based programming, assessments--including nutrition rapid assessments, beneficiaries satisfaction surveys, and focus group discussions--will be conducted throughout the project period to better understand the specific needs of different groups, including women, girls, boys, LGBTQI+, and persons living with disabilities, and inform adaptations to project implementation to better meet their needs.
CPI has been working with conflict-affected communities in Kayin State since 1998, with field operations based in Hpa-An and Myawaddy to enable a rapid response to changing conditions as well as continuous support to our local partners. KEHOC&#x2019;s clinic staff, mobile teams, and community-based volunteers have been trained to deliver integrated health, nutrition, WASH and protection-related services, are trusted by communities, play a key role in referral networks of ethnic and faith-based providers, and can maintain access to conflict-affected areas in Kayin State. CPI will lead the project&#x2019;s technical support, financial oversight, and quality improvement measures to ensure a principled humanitarian response. 
The project is designated to encourage community based disability care services and psychosocial supports, in which Community Based Rehabilitation (CBR) training to community volunteers, vocational training to People with Disabilities (PWD), Refer: Proposal document under &quot;document&quot; tab</narrative>
