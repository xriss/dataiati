   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The humanitarian situation in Myanmar is deteriorating especially after the militarily took over power on February 1st 2021 and the following economic decline in which the national currency (Kyat) lost more than 60% of its value . Combined with a growing upsurge in armed conflict, COVID-19 related restrictions and a restrained access for humanitarian responders increases the vulnerability of the conflict affected populations of Myanmar .

The intensity of armed conflict between the Arakan Army (AA) and the Myanmar Armed Forces (MAF) slowed down but the current displacement figure of 77.500 people stemming from this conflict remains high with a only a few people returning to the village of origin. The conflict continues to severely disrupt civilian life, reinforce existing vulnerabilities, and create unmet humanitarian needs. 

The proposed project will respond to the most urgent Shelter/NFI/CCCM and WASH needs of  20.967 IDP&#x2019;,s (4,961 men, 7,222 women, 4,284 boys, 4,509 girls)) in Kyauktaw and Sittwe townships . Using an integrated multi-sectoral approach, this intervention will contribute to the reduction of a wide range of immediate and life-threatening risks. The project will target the wider IDP population with focus on people with specific vulnerabilities. 

The intervention will build on and complement the CDN-ZOA&apos;s achievements of developed communal relationships, provided aid and established community structures under MHF funded MM-21/DDA-3415/SA1/WASH-SNFI-P-N-FS/INGO/18662, MM-20/DDA-3415/SA1/WASH-SNFI-P-FS/INGO/16842 to address needs that remain unmet. 

The WASH intervention aims to cover gaps in access to safe drinking water in the dry season. Shelter/NFI/CCCM focuses on providing critical support with shelter kits for new arrivals, but also small site improvements such as repairing walkway, drainage as well as pre-monsoon preparedness to enable access to communal facilities (latrines, bathing stations, kitchens, etc.) and shelters support to maintain accessibility for the gathering points and facilities at the displacement. The CCCM response includes training for the site committees and protection awareness raising (including GBV and PSEA).

Cross-cutting themes will be mainstreamed in the project including Covid-19 mitigation, gender equality environmental risk reduction , conflict sensitivity, inclusion as well as Duty of Care and Safeguarding. Do-no-harm principles will be prioritized throughout all activities.

Persons living with Disabilities and other vulnerable groups will be prioritized throughout all activities. The project aims to contribute to gender equality, and women&#x2019;s specific needs will be addressed to ensure equitable access to essential humanitarian services.. The CDN-ZOA gender-responsive approach will also contribute to increase women&#x2019;s role in decision-making processes such as CCCM structures, site management, protection monitoring and distribution.

Beneficiaries will be engaged in implementation and monitoring of the project and the existing Complaints Feedback Mechanism (CFM) will be used. CDN-ZOA adheres to the Core Humanitarian Standard and is the first Dutch based organization to be awarded CHS certification. Using a conflict sensitive approach, the design and preparations for this project are built on the inputs collected from regular CDN-ZOA community consultations and need assessments and is designed to allow participation of target communities throughout all phases of the project cycle. 

Using an inclusive approach, the project will contribute to remove the barriers that vulnerable groups face in order to ensure equal access to essential services., Inclusion of vulnerable groups will be ensured through the project&#x2019;s CCCM training component, site rehabilitation and site management committees. The developed MampE plan will ensure timely and quality data collection, with meaningful participation of beneficiaries</narrative>
