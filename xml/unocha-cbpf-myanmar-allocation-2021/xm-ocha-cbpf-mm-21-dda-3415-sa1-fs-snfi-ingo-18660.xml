   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Improving food security and meeting the critical humanitarian needs of vulnerable and displaced households in central Rakhine State</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Mercy Corps (MC) proposes to partner with People for People (PFP) and the Women Empowerment and Development Organization (WEDO) to expand its current agricultural interventions as well as its cash and voucher assistance (CVA) response to improve food security and meet the critical humanitarian needs of 5,450 vulnerable and displaced households (27,250 individuals) in Kyauktaw, Mrauk-U, and Sittwe townships in Rakhine State. 

The 9-months project will prioritize: 
a) vulnerable crisis-affected Rohingya, ethnic Rakhine and other ethnic minority farming households to improve their physical and economic access to food, enhance their capacity to produce and utilize diversified foods year-round, and increase their resilience to shocks
b) vulnerable crisis-affected IDPs to meet their basic needs and increase their resilience to shocks and stresses.

Specifically, MC will provide through WEDO in Sittwe and PFP in Mrauk-U and Kyauktaw:  
*1,500 HHs   (500 in Kyauktaw , 500 in Mrauk-U, 500 in Sittwe) with the means to reestablish their agricultural livelihoods through subsidized agricultural inputs (seeds, fertilizers, tools, etc) using e-vouchers. The first transfer will be in July/August of 45,000 MMK to assist the mid-to end monsoon season, followed by a second transfer in October/November of 30,000 MMK to support the winter crops farming. HHs will include female-headed households.
*750 HHs in Sittwe with value-based transfers for food security, intended as a small top-up to allow for dietary diversity in complement to WFP&#x2019;s food distribution. The first transfer will be 10,000 MMK, followed by two transfers of 10,000 MMK. 
*3,200 HH (1,332 in Kyauktaw and 1,868 in Mrauk-U) with value-based transfers based on a multisectoral package covering shelter, and fuel needs, as well as a small top-up for food to allow for dietary diversity in complement to WFP&#x2019;s food distribution. The first transfer will be 31,500 MMK, followed by two transfers of 13,000 MMK.
*All targeted HHs will additionally receive a COVID-19 prevention kit (including soap and masks) at each distribution, as well as hygiene promotion messages to contribute to ongoing efforts to curb the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic in the 3 targeted townships and to ensure proper risk mitigation measures.

A total of $US 204,876, representing 55% of the proposed budget will be directly transferred to program participants for them to make their own purchasing choices. MC will leverage its current CVA architecture and partnerships in Rakhine, its demonstrated capacity to deliver and access affected populations, and its expertise as co-lead of the cash-working group. Value-based e-vouchers will be an effective modality to support vulnerable IDPs&#x2019; access to a diverse set of goods to meet their basic needs, while empowering them to make their own choices. Mercy Corps&#x2019; ongoing agri-input e-voucher program in Rakhine suggests that agri-input vendors have been able to serve the targeted male and female farmers   despite the well-documented challenges due to conflict, the COVID-19 pandemic and political turmoil. Vouchers create demand that draws a commercial network into rural areas, increases the capacity of retailers to invest in inventory, and strengthens their offers for future clients. 

All activities align with respective cluster objectives as well as the Strategic Objectives outlined in the Myanmar Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP) 2021 of 1) improving the overall health and wellbeing and the rights of people affected by conflict or disasters and 2) improving the living standards and strengthening the resilience of people affected by conflict or disasters. The proposed project aligns with the MHF 2021 Allocation Strategy&#x2019;s priority #1 (EiE, WASH and Shelter/NFI/CCCM) and #3 (Health and Food Security).
