   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Shelter Reconstruction and Renovation in selected IDP camp of Kachin Stat</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The renewed clashes restarted in March 2021 between KIA and MAF, in Kachin, has resulted large scale of fighting happens across Kachin state. Anticipating that the conflict will not end soon, the displacement will increasingly prolong, the existing displaced people will continue to be so for some time yet. As the conflict continues, it therefore seem like these displaced people might continue to have a stay some more time and their existing shelters that they are occupying are deteriorating further because the shelters were designed to last for about four to five years, since these shelters were constructed in 2016. Therefore, KMSS has designed shelter project to support shelter reconstruction and replacement to the most vulnerable displaced families from targeted camp of Pakathawng in NGCA. Additionally, the proposed shelter project is based on the local knowledge, capacities, access and presence of current KMSS programs in this location. 

The 2021 Humanitarian Response Plan and 2021-MHF-SA1 call for proposal priorities for Kachin and Northern Shan have shown that the sectors Shelter/Non-Food Items, EiE, Protection, Food Security, WASH and Nutrition all remain priorities for IDPs in Kachin state. Among 7 sectors, KMSS has planned to provide shelter assistance because the existing shelter structures are deteriorating
According to the shelter cluster analysis report updated in May 2021, in Banmaw district there are 1719 units of shelter and Kitchen reported as need across 23 different sites in both GCA and NGCA. Only 282 units of shelter and kitchen planned to cover by different organization during 2021. Total 1437 units still remain as a gap, 60 units with kitchen attached shelter will be proposed to construct by KMSS-Banmaw in Pakahtawng camp that listed one the bigger camp, huge gap.
Shelter needs assessment has conducted with community leaders, CMCs, IRRC to access the needs of shelter in NGCA.  Women are included in community leaders and CMCs. Normally, KMSS has consulted with women and girls to understand their specific needs. Based on the needs expressed by the communities, its access and geographic presence, KMSS has designed shelter assistance project. This shelter project will target in Pakathawng camp in Moemauk,(particularly in NGCA) in Kachin where KMSS have been providing the ongoing humanitarian assistance (food, EiE, Protection, and WASH, MHF Shelter Project no. 17840 planned to construction 44 units of shelter in this Pakathawng camp) to the existing displaced population. This shelter project, at least, targets to reconstruct 60 units of single-type shelter for 60 most vulnerable households as well as strengthening capacity building for CMCs. Rapid shelter need assessment will be conducted once project proposal is approved. Once the project starts, gender assessment will be conducted to better understand about social inequalities, their specific needs, concerns and challenges faced by women and these finding will inform the design of project to address these inequalities. Regular community consultation will be happened during project implementation period so that their feedback, suggestion, concerns are incorporated to improve quality of project management. 

KMSS will ensure that this shelter project will prioritize the needs of particularly most vulnerable people and gender equality. Preferential action in selection processes will be given to female-headed households, women and widows, unaccompanied children (girls in particular), the elderly, people with disabilities, pregnant women and lactating mothers.</narrative>
