   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Urgent Education needs support for the students from NGCA- Non Government Controlled Area in Kachin State</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The humanitarian situation in Kachin State remains critical under new political armed context and outbreak of COVID pandemic especially in KIO Controlled Area. Accessing this MHF second standard allocation for 2021 will enable WPN to continue and expand our humanitarian response in non-government-controlled areas of Kachin state, as well as ensuring that WPN able to address the needs of IDPs Children&#x2019;s education support. 
The project&#x2019;s goal reflects strong commitment of WPN to address gaps and immediate needs of people facing temporary and protracted displacement under dual crisis COVID-19 Pandemic outbreak and military coup. WPN has mainly been providing humanitarian assistance to vulnerable people in the IDP camps and the hosting communities. Therefore, targeting has consistently been done on these group of people focusing on addressing the vulnerabilities. Out of many intervention activities that are required for many needs and gaps that are existing, WPN has identified only those that can be in line with the priority education activities described in MHF SA2. Therefore WPN has developed the activities aligning the needs that are currently existing with the priority education activities of MHF SA2.
Students in NGCA in Kachin State are facing education disruption mainly due to the COVID-19 outbreak and with the impacts of current new political armed conflict in 2021. Currently, KIO- COVID-19 prevention committee is planning to give vaccination to all people aged between 13 &#x2013; 65 years with the support from China Red Cross. This plan has gradually started taking effect and is expected to be supportive to schools reopening.  Some of the school in NGCA in Kachin state have already resumed from temporary school closure, and all the target schools of this project are re-opening from January 2022. A total of 7281 students from 1 elementary and 7 secondary education school (3502 boys and 3779 girls) and a total of 254 ECCD children (139 boys and 115 girls) from 8 ECCD centers are expected to be resuming their school. Out of total 40 basic education schools  in MoeMauk and Mansi townships, 86% of students attends to these 8 targeted schools . Majority of these children are from 4 different IDP camps namely Nhkawng Pa IDP camp, Pa Kahtawng IDP camp, Lana Zup Ja IDP camp 1 and 2, and Bum Tist Pa camp, and some of them are from the hosting villages and nearby villages.  All 8 target ECCD centers are from IDP camp There is no other organization that is supporting on education in this area except for WPN. WPN has no secure funding for EiE for 2022 and this project is very important for the students from this marginalized and hard-to-reach area.
Therefore, in this context, it is critical that responding to  education needs in NGCA (KCA) take place timely and efficiently. It is only through this apt responding that the children in these areas will also have access to improved learning spaces and environment, to adequate learning materials, and that they are surrounded and supported by communities that are duly strengthened and enhanced in capacity and skills in supporting children&#x2019; education and in fulfilling children&#x2019;s rights to proper protection and quality education.
The components of this response consist of implementation of EiE and WASH in School activities in four IDPs camps (Pa Kahtawng, Lana Zup Ja, Nhkawng Pa, Bumtsit Pa Camp) and in Mai Ja Yang High School,Nba High School and Mung Myit SinLi High School, in NGCA (KCA), in Mansi and Moe Mauk townships in Kachin state 
Response locations proposed for this grant is in consistency with the priority location identified in the Second Standard Allocation strategy. WPN is WASH focal for the KCA area in the cluster meeting and there is no organization implementing in our target areas, camps which are rightly put under the location category of remote and difficult to access locations.
