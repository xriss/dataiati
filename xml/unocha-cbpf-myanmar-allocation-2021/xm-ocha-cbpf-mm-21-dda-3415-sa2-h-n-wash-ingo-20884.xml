  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Armed clashes since February 1 have increased conditions of vulnerability in Northern Shan. The deterioration of social support services under military rule and the reduced service delivery capacity due to the Civil Disobedience Movement have further increased reliance on local organizations like EHOs  , at the same time that the caseload of needs is increasing due to COVID-19 and active conflict.
Ta&#x2019;ang Health Organization (THO) is one of the key implementers in IDP camps in Northern Shan and the only actor operating in some of the most remote villages in the state where health, nutrition, and WASH needs are highest. In partnership with THO, CPI will respond to strengthen health, nutrition, WASH, and resilience to the ongoing armed conflict and COVID-19 pandemic in Northern Shan. We will respond to the immediate needs of those displaced since the military coup, as well as the ongoing needs of conflict-affected communities and IDPs living in protracted displacement, with recognition that the renewed violence imposes new challenges for individuals and communities, including retraumatization and increasingly restricted access to humanitarian, protection, and essential services.

THO&#x2019;s health workers will work in 8 townships (Lashio, Tangyan, Manton, Kutkai, Namkham, Kyaukme, Hsipaw and Namtu) to provide lifesaving health and nutrition services, and 5 townships (Lashio, Manton, Kyaukme, Hsipaw, Namtu) to provide WASH services. Services will reach 22 IDP camps (7,647 IDPs) and 80 host community villages (37,726 people), with a total population of 45,373 (estimated 23,173 women and children under age 5). 
THO will deliver services based on a community-based, integrated care model with effective referrals to appropriate facilities. Humanitarian primary healthcare includes nutrition services, malnutrition screening, treatment, and referral (IMAM), IYCF counselling and support, RMNCH, MHPSS, trauma care, NCDs, infectious diseases, and COVID-19 prevention and response. THO will also revitalize health clinics and build latrines and water points to promote dignified and inclusive access. The project will address the different needs, interests, and vulnerabilities of affected populations, with special attention to inclusion and participation of women, persons with disabilities    , and other vulnerable groups. Community-based platforms for engagement, education, awareness raising, and feedback will be strengthened, with an emphasis on improving feedback for WASH and inclusion of people with disabilities.
CPI has been working with THO in NSS to provide humanitarian assistance to conflict-affected communities since 2019. THO clinic staff, mobile teams, and community-based volunteers have been trained to deliver an integrated package of services, are trusted by communities, play a key role in referral networks of ethnic and faith-based providers, and can maintain access to the most remote and conflict-affected areas of NSS. CPI will lead the project&#x2019;s technical support, financial oversight, and quality improvement measures to ensure a principled humanitarian response. In particular, CPI will guide THO to improve mainstreaming of gender, disability inclusion, protection, accountability to affected populations, and COVID-19 prevention and response across all project activities.
The project is fully aligned with the Humanitarian Response Plan, and has been designed in consultation with affected communities, THO, and other actors    (TWO &#x2013; Ta Ang Women Organization)
who are working in the proposed townships to address gaps in coverage and avoid duplication of service delivery. The THO is coordinated partner of TWO who are under the Ta&#x2019;Ang umbrella organizations.
The project will also leverage CPI&#x2019;s existing projects and resources (e.g. nutritional supplements provided by UNICEF, self-help groups for persons with disabilities) to enhance the effectiveness of service delivery. Ref: Project Proposal Document attached in Document Tab</narrative>
