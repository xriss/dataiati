   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Education and WASH response for hard to reach IDP and host communities in Rakhine State</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">CSI proposes a multisectoral project targeting education and WASH in conflict-affected communities, with a particular focus on communities of internally displaced and stateless people, in the Central Rakhine State Townships of Kyauktaw, Minbya and Mrauk-U. This project directly responds to urgent humanitarian needs of hard-to-reach and underserved communities identified in a consultative needs assessment in November 2021. It incorporates learnings from previous projects implemented in humanitarian contexts in Central and Northern Rakhine State.

Following extended nation-wide school closures, CSI will offer remedial education during the summer holidays in all targeted communities to reduce learning gaps and improve learning outcomes of primary students ahead of the upcoming school year. A dedicated non-formal education program for girls and young women will address gender inequalities in educational achievement and support women empowerment more generally. Teachers providing instructions for both of these activities will receive adequate training based on established curricula. This will be complemented by support to schools &#x2013; CSI will provide furniture to and install latrines and necessary water access in schools in five locations home to 2,725 Rohingya households.

In some of the project locations, CSI identified need for improvements to water access. Based on this assessment, CSI will implement basic interventions to improve water access infrastructure, such as pond construction and repairs, installation of wells and pumps, and other small scale activities. These will be made more sustainable by linking them with community committees charged with and equipped for maintaining this infrastructure. This will reduce the vulnerability of targeted communities to prolonged droughts in the future, increasing their resilience to the impacts of climate change. CSI will also provide hygiene kits to households in communities where access to basic hygiene and dignity items is particularly limited. All these activities will be coordinated with the WASH cluster, where CSI is member and participant to regular Rakhine State WASH Cluster Coordination meetings.

Protection is mainstreamed throughout the project, with teacher trainings incorporating safeguarding and child protection training. Non-formal education for girls and women will include contents on gender-based violence. WASH interventions will be designed and implemented explicitly recognizing the needs of women obtained through localized assessments as well as inputs from female members of the local management committees. 

This is in line with ongoing and previous projects implemented by CSI in Central Rakhine State, where we equipped schools and installed latrines in target communities. In this project, we address the need of hard-to-reach communities which to date have not been benefitted from the same level of support other communities have, while being characterized by similar needs. Throughout the project, CSI will mainstream COVID-19 prevention as well as overall protection.</narrative>
