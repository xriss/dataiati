   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Multi-sectoral assistance for conflict-affected people in Chin State</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Following the military takeover of the civilian government in Myanmar in February 2021, thousands of communities across the country have been exposed to further insecurity, poverty, and displacement, leading to a national intensification of humanitarian crisis. In Chin State, over 2,626  people (695 men, 752 women, 566 boys and 613 girls), and estimated 335 of whom are people with disabilities, have been newly displaced this year. Both the displaced population, and the host population, are now in critical need of humanitarian assistance, that most organizations are not able to provide at the moment. Humanitarian needs such as WASH, Education, Shelter/NFI and Protection, are only able to be covered in a limited manner, especially in hard-to-reach areas such as Thantlang township, with far fewer actors present compared with other townships and states. Responding to this gap, People In Need (PIN), Mines Advisory Group (MAG), and Chin Human Rights Organization (CHRO), collaborated to have a consortium for this proposal with the aim of putting forward PIN&#x2019;s long standing technical and programming capacities on Education In Emergencies (EiE), WASH, NFI/Shelter, and MHPSS/COVID19 Management, with the local operational and access capabilities of CHRO, as one of the few local actors in Chin able to continue work in the region. The consortium also has the mine-risk and protection expertise of MAG, who have been working with CHRO in Chin for a number of years, and like PIN, has been working with MHF as well. The consortium envisions a robust and holistic cooperation amongst the three partners, ensuring a comprehensive humanitarian response for Chin state. The cooperation of the three organizations aims to ultimately achieve the project objective which is to address the most urgent and unmet humanitarian needs of conflict-affected populations in Chin State through the provision of lifesaving multisectoral assistance in Education, Protection, WASH, and Shelter/NFI/CCCM. 

The Education in Emergencies interventions addresses the very much needed education gaps for both displaced and host children populations. The EiE services includes both kits provision, training of educations/care givers, and organizing of learning sessions. The WASH services will cover gaps in urgent access to safe drinking water and access to gender and disability friendly sanitation facilities, promote the application of hygienic practices with COVID19 prevention. Shelter/NFI/CCCM focuses on providing critical support with essential NFI materials which includes, but not limited to the following mugs, jerry cans, blankets, kitchen sets, mosquito nets, sleeping mats, clothes, torches/lanterns, etc. Protection services in this cooperation, covers mine risk education, protection monitoring and mainstreaming. With this integrated multi-sectoral approach, this cooperation aims to address the wide range of immediate and life-threatening risks as well as improve both the physical and mental wellbeing of vulnerable conflict-affected populations in Chin, where active conflict is escalating dangerously fast. The consortium enables the project to benefit from the sectoral expertise and geographical reach of each partner to maximize value for money, learning, and operational ability. Ensuring to reach the most vulnerable persons will be prioritized throughout all activities. Children will be engaged critically through the project&#x2019;s protection and education interventions. The project aims to contribute to addressing women&#x2019;s specific needs to ensure equitable access to essential humanitarian services. For example, having WASH facilities, specifically designed for women. Beneficiaries will be central in the implementation of this project, with their inputs being fundamental in mounting and running the different activities. This will be done through the necessary project surveys at different points in the project, as well as through PIN&#x2019;s established (see Word Doc for more)</narrative>
