   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Improving equity access to comprehensive primary health care services in a complex situation for all vulnerable community in Kachin State</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project is targeted at all vulnerable communities during this complex situation in Kachin State and will improve access to health care services in IDP Camps and Host community of Kachin State by supporting primary healthcare services to 35693 beneficiaries (Men 10277, Women12280, Boy 6184, Girl 6952, Disabilities 4569 (12.8% of population)) from 21 IDP Camps and 3 Host community in GCA and 3 most hard to reach IDP camps in NGCA (Waingmaw, Myitkyina, Bhamo and Momauk, Tanai, Sumprabum and Shwegu Townships). 
Primary health care services include men, women, girls, boys, pregnant women and under 5 years old children. Primary health care services will be provided by both existing camp-based clinics and mobile clinic teams. KBC will support medical supplies for primary health care, reproductive, maternal, neonatal and child health (RMNCH) activities. Seriously ill patients and under five and pregnant women including the patient with serious chronic diseases will be referred to the nearest hospital to receive timely health management. Trained camp clinic staff and health workers will receive on-job training to ensure effective health services provision and to understand the project activities. Moreover, KBC health teams will provide emergency health responses for any emergency, either a natural disaster or armed conflict, within Kachin State. 
KBC already has a strong and well-trained MHPSS team that is trained by JHU and has more than 3 years of experience. For those who need psychological or mental health support from the existing IDP camps and for emergency cases within coverage areas, the MHPSS team is always ready to give mental health and psychosocial support services.
KBC will regularly participate in meetings with the Health Cluster and local stakeholders to implement the project successfully. With regularly (weekly and monthly) meetings, KBC will closely collaborate with WHO and other actors to complement health services.
Through regular health partners meetings, leading by WHO, different health partners can discuss the services and work together for a complementary approach as usual. At the weekly meeting and quarterly health coordination meetings, KBC, HPA and Backpack usually discuss the services in NGCA and MMA and IRC for GCA. Moreover, KBC always discusses with KIO Health Department concerning gaps and overlapping in KIO controlled areas. KBC already discussed with CPI for complementing the services in some overlapped areas by taking responsibilities for different components between general health services and MNCH both for the medicine and referral support.
This project will not only provide humanitarian health assistance to the vulnerable community of the complex situation but also complement the existing actors and projects to be able to provide the most comprehensive health services. 
Concerning waste management, KBC could not handle it alone and therefore, KBC is now working together with the Municipal office and Save The Children for waste management.
In addition, response activities for Covid-19 third wave will be implemented. The basic package will be supported to the Covid patients. This package includes symptomatic medicines and PPE and teleconsultation 24/7.</narrative>
