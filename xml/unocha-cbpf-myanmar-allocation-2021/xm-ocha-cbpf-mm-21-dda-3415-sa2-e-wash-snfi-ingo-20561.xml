  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Internally displaced people (IDPs) and conflict-affected communities in Kachin state remain highly dependent on the sustained provision of humanitarian assistance. The military coup and renewal of intense armed conflict between the Tatmadaw and the Kachin Independence Army (KIA) has severely disrupted civilian life, already disrupted by COVID-19, reinforced existing vulnerabilities, and generated new and critically unmet humanitarian needs due to the surge in new displacements.

People in Need (PIN) and its local partners Serve the World (STW) and Diocesan Commission for Education (DCE-Banmaw) formed a consortium to address the key humanitarian needs in Kachin state. The proposed project will respond to the Education, WASH and Shelter/NFI and CCCM needs of 6,080 conflict-affected people (980 men, 1,216 women, 1,882 boys and 2,002 girls), an estimated 773 of whom are people with disabilities in Mansi, Momauk, Shwegu, Injangyang and Waigmaw townships. Using a localized multisectoral approach, this intervention will contribute to the reduction of immediate and life-threatening risks and improve both the physical and mental wellbeing of these vulnerable populations. The intervention will build on and complement PIN and STW&#x2019;s previous work under MHF funded projects, as well as projects implemented by STW and DCE-Banmaw through other external funding.

Education activities will support conflict-affected children&#x2019;s continued learning through the provision of home-based learning materials, training for teachers and night study guides and support for community education spaces and actors. WASH activities will address critical, unmet needs for water, sanitation facilities and hygiene materials and promotion, while Shelter/NFI activities will focus on the provision of safe shelter and NFIs for newly displaced people. CCCM activities will provide on-going camp management by STW in Bum Ra Yang ensuring newly displaced IDP&#x2019;s needs are supported. This integrated approach enables the scaling up of activities in new locations to address unmet needs of conflict affected populations. 

Through the PIN, STW and DCE consortium, the project will benefit from the sectoral expertise and geographical reach of each partner to maximize value for money, experience-sharing, and operational capacity. The localization approach adopted by PIN will build the capacity of the local NGO partners to identify and address unmet needs in their communities and provide contingency options given the current context in Kachin State. It will also allow mainstreaming of best practices, standards and accountability to affected persons, resulting in greater quality of project delivery. 

This project was created based on the outputs from regular community consultations and need assessments and is designed to allow participation of target communities throughout all phases of the project cycle - including women, girls and people with disabilities (estimated at 773 people &#x2013; 119 men, 146 women, 224 boys and 244 girls)- to ensure that services and assistance will meet their specific needs. Using a conflict-sensitive approach, the project will actively contribute to removing the barriers that vulnerable groups face in order to ensure equitable access to essential humanitarian services. Ensuring that assistance reaches vulnerable groups such as women , children, elderly, and persons with disabilities will be prioritized throughout all activities. Additionally, the project will offer a gender-responsive approach to the acute humanitarian needs and PIN&#x2019;s recruitment policies will ensure gender-balanced project teams. Duty of Care, PSEA, child protection, Safeguarding and Do No Harm are crosscutting elements throughout all activities of the proposed intervention. Beneficiaries will be engaged in implementation and monitoring of the project and a Complaints and Feedback Response Mechanism (CFRM) will be implemented. The developed MampE plan will (see Word Doc)</narrative>
