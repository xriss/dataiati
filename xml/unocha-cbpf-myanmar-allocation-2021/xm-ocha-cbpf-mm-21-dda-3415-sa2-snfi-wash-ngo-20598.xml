   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The majority of IDPs have been hosted in religious places such as churches and monasteries in camp settings while some are being hosted by communities. The majority of IDPs are Baptist and Roman Catholic Christian. Since the beginning of the resumed war in 2011, humanitarian assistance provided by two main Christian faith-based organizations namely KBC and KMSS. KBC provides humanitarian assistance to its Baptist Christian IDPs while KMSS provides to Catholic Christian who are living in their churches. 

Nyein is non faith-based organization, it becomes the most appropriate organization to take responsibility as a camp coordination and management agency for other Christian denomination members and Buddhist IDPs in Kachin state. And Nyein has been one of the key actors in the response to this emergency since 2012.

Nyein is one of camp management agencies since the conflict started in 2011 and has been covering  26 camps for Camp Management and Camp Coordination 5 townships (Myitkyina, Waimaw, Hpakant, Chipwi and Bhamo) and 28 camps for WASH facilities service in 4 townships Myitikyina, Waimaw, Hpakant and Chipwi. In addition, according to the Q3 4Ws Kachin WASH gap analysis, there are partial gaps in 16 Nyein covered camps. So, in this project we consider to provide WASH facilities service for all of existing Nyien covered camps so that there is no gaps in the camps.  Nyein has been proving camp running cost and WASH running cost which is essential for camp management committee to manage the camps. Return and resettlement, local integration process is stopped because of COVID 19 pandemic and 1st February event. Therefore, the existing camps still need the humanitarian such as providing camp running cost, WASH running cost and Shelter renovation activities to get living with dignity in camp side. Nyein will provide COVID 19 prevention materials to IDPs, Volunteers and staff to mitigate the COVID 19 transmission and outbreak in IDP camps. Project team regular provide update information of COVID 19 to the IDP through CMC and volunteers. 

During COVID 19 and 1st February event, IDPs are facing more difficult situation, they could not make daily income for their family and they are living in health risk (COVID 19) condition since peoples are crowded in IDP camps. WASH facility support to IDP camp is the key factor to mitigate the COVID 19 transmission. Nyein intends to implement the Shelter Construction related activities, WASH related activities including running cost and facilities and providing camp running cost through this project.</narrative>
