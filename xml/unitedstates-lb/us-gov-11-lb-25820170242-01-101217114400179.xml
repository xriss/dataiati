    <narrative xml:lang="EN">United States assistance advances the strategic objective of supporting a viable, independent, sovereign, and democratic Lebanon that is at peace with its neighbors. Internally, Lebanon faces deep sectarian divisions, which manifest in its political and economic institutions. Hizballah operates a militia beyond the control of the state and wields political influence that can paralyze national decision-making. Spillover from the Syria crisis, regional instability and the resulting influx of nearly 1.2 million registered refugees exacerbate these tensions and strain Lebanon&apos;s already overburdened economy and public services. Extremist groups, including the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) and Al-Nusra Front (ANF), threaten terrorist attacks on civilian targets inside and along its borders. The United States seeks to insulate Lebanon from the effects of the Syria crisis, bolster the authority of state institutions, and foster economic growth. The FY 2017 request for Lebanon will enable the United States to mitigate Iranian, Hizballah, and Sunni extremist threats and influence in the country. U.S. foreign assistance will build the capacity of the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) and the Internal Security Forces (ISF) to secure Lebanon&apos;s borders and disrupt and mitigate violent extremism. Non-military assistance will improve the quality and supply of public services, particularly clean water and education. Assistance will also create jobs and boost rural incomes to ensure that all people benefit from new economic opportunities. Central to these efforts, assistance will build a strong voice among civil society that promotes human rights, good governance, and constructive dialogue between opposing groups. As a designated Relief to Development Transition country, U.S. assistance to Lebanon bridges both humanitarian and longer-term development needs. Development activities will build upon humanitarian support provided through the Department of State&apos;s Bureau for Population, Migration and Refugees and United States Agency for International Development (USAID)&apos;s Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance.</narrative>
