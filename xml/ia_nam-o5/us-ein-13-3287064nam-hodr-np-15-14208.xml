   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Nepal Earthquake Recovery: Rebuilding Homes</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">On April 25, 2015, north-central Nepal was the epicenter of a 7.8 magnitude earthquake, which was accompanied by weeks of aftershocks and landslides, including a second, 7.3 magnitude earthquake. According to a recent United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) Nepal Earthquake Situation Report, 8,700 people are confirmed dead; another 100,000 have been injured. The report states that nearly 800,000 homes have been damaged or destroyed, displacing an estimated 2.8 million people. The situation is particularly urgent as disaster survivors face the monsoon season creating deadly floods and landslides causing further damage and reducing access to external aid resources. Without adequate housing, families are left to camp outside or live in tent camps where they are vulnerable to the monsoon season and diseases caused by poor hygiene, as well as and remain isolated from support networks of neighbors and family. 

The Sindhupalchok District, located in central region of Nepal, is one of the hardest-hit districts by the earthquake and aftershocks. In May 2015, the United Nations Nepal Earthquake Assessment reported that out of 64 of the 79 village development committees (VDCs) in Sindhupalchock &#x2013; an area with a population of 240,000 &#x2013; 88% of the housing was damaged or destroyed, displacing 88% of the assessed population. In Sindhupalchok, women head 12% of households. Female-led households are particularly vulnerable as women are solely responsible for childcare and income generation.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Together with its partners, Society of Nepalese Architects (&quot;SONA&quot;), the Department of Small Works, Architects Foundation, ARCASIA, and American Institute of Architects Foundation, All Hands proposes to construct permanent, earthquake- resilient  housing for displaced families in Sindhupalchok district of Nepal. The process will incorporate significant community and beneficiary input and participation. All Hands will act as lead implementing partner, and brings extensive expertise in project management, construction skills training, and volunteer mobilization in post-disaster reconstruction projects in developing countries. This contribution includes an international network of over 30,000 multi-skilled volunteers. 

This is a phased program that will be completed over two years, beginning with an assessment and design phase incorporating input from the local community, followed by a pilot phase in which homes will be built and a skilled work force developed by training beneficiaries. Input from the community will be gathered by a team of SONA and Department of Small Works designers  through workshops and meetings to address community needs and understand cultural context. SONA and All Hands will work to develop build criteria for beneficiary selection to identify the most vulnerable and urgent-care families . The criteria will account for vulnerabilities associated with female-led households and identify opportunities to train women builders and leaders. Once beneficiaries are selected, a team of project managers and construction experts will lead participants through training in building materials, building methods, and disaster risk reduction skills. Then, after evaluation and revision as needed by the collaborators, the program will be  brought to scaled, impacting a total of 10-12 villages and approximately building a total of approximately 540  homes</narrative>
