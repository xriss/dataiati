   <narrative xml:lang="EN">All Hands Volunteers has consulted with community officials and members from the beginning of this process. Members have had input into the design process, community members themselves participate in the prioritization of the neediest families, and beneficiary families can request minor changes as well as participate in construction. In this way there is beneficiary &quot;buy in&quot; to the program.
The home design adheres to Shelter Cluster guidelines for core housing and has been approved by the city of Tacloban. Disaster resilience comes from the use of the best possible materials and construction methods: the houses are constructed with grade A aged coco lumber, galvanized nails, extensive bracing and gusset plates, corrugated galvanized iron roofs with minimal overhang and tex screws. The houses are raised off the ground to prevent rot and avoid floodwaters by posts anchored inside cinderblock foundations which go a full 4.27 ft. into the earth, and stand on a wide footing. Locally sourced amakan walls (bamboo screening) make it inexpensive and easy for the families to expand or repair. The private bathroom sits over a two chamber septic tank.

Six days a week approximately 20 All Hands residential volunteers work alongside the people of barangay 83-C and half a dozen local construction workers.  In less than 6 months, 20 homes have been completed.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">On Friday, November 8, 2013 one of the most dangerous typhoons on record hit the island of Leyte and neighboring islands in the Visayas region of the Philippines. Dubbed a super typhoon, Haiyan (known locally as Yolanda) was responsible for 6,000 deaths and destroyed 1.1 million homes, displacing 4 million people.

By June of 2014, our humanitarian response had phased into recovery and rebuild projects. These include building over 300 transitional homes and two schools. 

The goal of the Disaster Resilient Home Rebuilding Program is to promote the socio-economic rehabilitation of the community of Barangay 83-c as a whole by providing secure, appropriate, disaster resilient homes to displaced families while avoiding the disruption of relocation, so that they can remain near livelihoods and in home communities. This will be accomplished by constructing disaster resilient houses with the involvement of the beneficiaries, in their home community and on the sites of the original homes. The broader goal is for the Program to serve as an example of how to build back better for the wider region.</narrative>
