   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Hurricane Harvey Recovery</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Hurricane Harvey made landfall as a category 4 hurricane, bringing unprecedented destruction to Texas. Harvey was named the most powerful hurricane to hit the US since 2005, superseding Hurricane Sandy. The recovery is going to be long and hard; that&#x2019;s why All Hands Volunteers has committed to being on the ground for at least two years, helping families recover from this disaster. We need your support, through donations and offers to volunteer.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Initially, our teams were operating in Fort Bend County, Harris County, and Aransas Pass, knee deep in mucking and gutting, mold sanitation, chainsaw work and debris removal &#x2013; the first big leaps toward getting families back into their homes. Another team worked to operate the VRC (Volunteer Reception Center) in Aransas Pass, enabling volunteers to effectively plug into the response effort.

We are currently running two programs within Texas &#x2013; Houston and Aransas Pass. Both programs have transitioned to recovery and teams will focus on ensuring disaster survivors are provided with the support needed in rebuilding their lives.

Thank you to our partner TUMI for their generous donation of $400,000 that will enable our team to rebuild The Rhodes School for the Performing Arts in Houston. This public charter school offers tuition-free education to low-income minority communities. 550 pre-K through eighth-grade students attended the Rhodes school until it became flooded during Hurricane Harvey.

All Hands Volunteers will be rebuilding the main building on the campus, as well as gutting, sanitizing, and rebuilding the five remaining mobile units and demolishing and rebuilding two handicap ramps leading up to the units.</narrative>
