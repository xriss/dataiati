   <narrative xml:lang="EN">To date, our teams&#x2019; efforts have been focused towards assisting disaster-impacted schools on the island of Tortola.

As Elmore Stoutt High School is the only high school on the island, we have worked hard to help gut the building, in order to ensure that the rebuilding process will be more effective and efficient. Efforts have included removing a large amount of damaged window as well as taking down the ceiling tiles from every classroom.

Additionally, our teams have working on 3 additional education facilities. At Wonder Years preschool, volunteers have worked to Demo an unsafe room and are in the process of rebuilding the roof for the whole building, whilst at Little Litehouse Child Learning Centre, volunteers rebuilt a wall and fence to keep the students safe. In addition to this, our volunteers have worked hard to clear debris from the basketball court and changing rooms at Joyce Samuels Primary School.

Through volunteer efforts, we have been able to move towards our mission of providing safe and resilient schools for children impacted by natural disasters.</narrative>
