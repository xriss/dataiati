    <narrative xml:lang="EN">Elections in 2014 restored constitutional rule in Guinea-Bissau following the April 2012 coup d&apos;. The new government, under the leadership of Prime Minister Domingos Sim&apos;f5es Pereira, quickly secured support from the international community and embarked on an ambitious slate of reforms. President JosMVaz dismissed Sim&apos;f5es Pereira&apos;s government in August 2015, and the subsequent political stalemate stalled progress of the reform program. The new government of Prime Minister Carlos Correia, established in October 2015, includes a number of ministers from the previous cabinet and will likely pursue the same reform objectives. Tensions between the government and President Vaz may resurface as a result of deep divisions within the ruling party. U.S. foreign policy goals are: support the development of a stable, democratic government; build effective government capacity to counter narcotics trafficking; and advance economic growth based on good governance and sound economic policy. FY 2017 U.S. foreign assistance to Guinea-Bissau focuses on professionalization of the country&apos;s military forces.</narrative>
