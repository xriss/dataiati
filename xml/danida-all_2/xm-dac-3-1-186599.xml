   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The purpose of Danish support to Basic Education and Literacy is to contribute to the burkinab&#xE8; government&apos;s strategy in the sector in order to raise the number of schools, improve the quality of education as well as the capacity of the ministry and the municipalities to make efficient use of resources for education. An innovative project for vocational training is also supported, aiming at transferring good experience from new teaching methods to the present system for vocational training. 
Burkina Faso&apos;s strategic plan for development of basic education and literacy (2011 - 2020) aims at increasing the enrollment of children in primary school to 100 per cent in 2015, increase completion rate to 75 per cent in 2015, and raise the number of children completing 7th to 10th class to 35 per cent. The Strategy&apos;s main elements are an efficient implementation of the education reform from 2007, aiming at offering all children 10 years of coherent education, and create correlation between general and vocational education; emphasize quality of education and ensure capacity building in the ministry and the municipalities, who will gradualy take over the responsibility for management of the schools. 
The targets for literacy is to improve the rate from approximately 30 to 60 per cent in 2015, with a strong emphasis on making literate young people up to 24 years of age. This support is managed by a national fund. In 2011, the government approved a strategy to accelerate literacy. 
The support to vocational training is channeled through a civil society organisation working at developing new and more practically oriented vocational training for children and young people between 13 and 25 years, who did not attend school or dropped out before 6th class. The implementation of a new national policy for vocational training was started in 2011. The educational proposals of the said organisation fit well into the policy of vocational training.</narrative>
