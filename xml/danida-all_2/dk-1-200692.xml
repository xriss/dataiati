   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In Kenya, from the research done during the Pilot project between Oticon and Getrude, one to six babies in every 1000 are born with a hearing loss in one or both ears. The aim of this project is to identify babies with hearing impairment of a severity that might lead to a potential disability. In the next project phase, the intention is to establish, a hearing care solution at Getrude with the assistance from Oticon to provide services such as hearing aid treatment, intervention from speech- and hearing therapists and on-going counselling to and inclusion of parents (family centred intervention), which will help the children to develop far better language and communication skills. 
The hearing screening test will be done within the first few weeks or months of life. Trained hearing screeners from Oticon and Getrude will carry out the test</narrative>
