  <description type="2" xml:lang="EN">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The overall objective of the Support the Agriculture and Productive Sector is to contribute to reduction of extreme poverty and hunger in accordance witht he national Plan for Development.

The immediate objective is to support the Government of Bolivia in three priority areas: 

i) Development of small-scale agriculture as well as transfer of technology and innovation for agricultural development - primarily in the highland regions.

ii) Increase value addition, in particular agro processing in micro, small and medium-sized enterprises.

iii) Improve the access to financing for growth, employment and productivity improvement for small-scale farmers, micro, small and medium-sized enterprises in rural and urban areas. 

The Bolivian National Development Plan (2006) has a strong emphasis on poverty reduction, employment and development. The Plan stresses that development in the agriculture and production sectors &#xBF; especially for poor small-scale farmers, community organisations, indigenous peoples&#xBF; organisations and micro, small and medium-sized enterprises &#xBF; are pivotal for job creation, economic growth, poverty reduction and general well being of the nation. 

Despite increasing public investments and a relatively stable and strong macroeconomy with high growth, the agriculture and productive sectors have not developed significantly. Productivity remains low, food security remains a serious problem and exports of non-primary products have stagnated or decreased. 

All activities supported are implemented in consideration of gender equality, indigenous people as well as positive environmental impacts through improved and innovative management of the scarce natural resources such as arable land and water.</narrative>
