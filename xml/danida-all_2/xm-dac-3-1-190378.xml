   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Denmark joined GGGI in 2011, and provided DKK 90 mill. during the 2011-2013 period. In 2014, Denmark renewed its engagement with GGGI and provided a contribution of DKK 90 mill. for the 2014-2016 period. Denmark&apos;s financial support is provided as a core contribution. The contribution is made available to help GGGI achieve its overall mandate and goals, rather than being available for specific elements of GGGI&apos;s work program.
GGGI&apos;s vision is that the world makes a paradigm shift to &apos;green growth&apos;, a model of economic growth that simultaneously achieves poverty reduction, job creation, social inclusion as well as environmental sustainability and resource security. GGGI&apos;s mission is to advance the practice and theory of green growth by helping to develop, implement and deepen understanding of green growth strategies. GGGI&apos;s vision and mission correspond well with the Denmark&apos;s strategic green growth priority. 
In 2014, GGGI adopted a strategic plan for 2015-2020, which operates with three main objectives: 
- strengthening national, sub-national, and local green growth plans;
- promoting green investment flows;
- knowledge sharing between countries on green growth.
In relation to developing and implementing GGGI&apos;s strategic plan, Denmark has set the following priorities: 1) Development of a focused and realistic strategic plan with a concrete results framework; 2) Poverty orientation; 3) Inclusiveness; 4) Consolidation of GGGI&apos;s activities; 5) Integration of GGGI&apos;s three work streams; 6) An organisational structure that is fit for purpose; 7) Implementation of financial and administrative policies, rules and procedures of international standards; 8) Influence at the global level.</narrative>
