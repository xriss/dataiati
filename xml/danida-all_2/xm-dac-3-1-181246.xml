   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Global Environment Facility (GEF) was established in 1991 as an independent financing mechanism for providing grants and concessional funding to cover the incremental or additional costs associated with transforming a project with national benefits into one with global environmental benefits thereby promoting environmental sustainable development. GEF is a financial mechanism for a number of key international environmental conventions such as the convention on biodiversity, the convention on climate and the convention of drought and desertification. The World Bank serves as the Trustee of the GEF Trust Fund and provides administrative services. The GEF projects are implemented by the World Bank, UNDP, UNEP and a number of multilateral development banks and other organisations. Supporting GEF contributes to the fulfillment of Danish policy recommendations. The focus on sustainable management and use of natural resources, environmental protection, innovative technological and financial solutions, sustainable energy etc. are Danish priorites. At the same time sustainability and poverty eradication are two sides of the one coin. Together with Norway, Latvia and Lithuania, Danmark has a seat in the GEF Council that are responsible for policy decisions. The total budget for GEF-5 is estimated at 4.4 billion USD comprising replenishment contributions, carryovers, payment of arrears and others.</narrative>
