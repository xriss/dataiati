   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The objective of the programme is to improve the efficiency of the water sector, hereby contributing to the improvement of public health as well as reducing poverty. The programme objectives are; 1) A more equal distribution of water and sanitation services in the country; 2) Improved maintenance and hereby more functional water installations; 3) Increased participation by the private sector, and; 4) Improved environmental administration. Monitoring of results take place in a well-functioning national system with a number of strategically indicators on water and sanitation. 

The programme builds on previous contributions and is based on three components: 1) Improve access to clean drinking water and sanitation in rural areas; 2) Capacity building in the Directorate of Water Resource Management focusing on an integrated administration of the resources and a decentralisation of service, and; 3) Support reforms and new policies in the water sector in order to increase accountability and transparency.

Five development partners contribute to the programme: Austria, Germany, The African Development Bank, EU and Denmark. The support is granted in form of sector budget support, a joint donor fund and technical assistance. This phase is expected to ensure access to clean drinking water, sanitation and hygiene for more than two million people in the rural areas. Focus is furthermore on sustainable administration of the water resources including adaptation to climate changes. Additionally, improved access to water for productive purposes, will contribute to increased economic development.</narrative>
