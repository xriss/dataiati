   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The immediate objective is to increase the number and percentage of children who have access to and complete a qualitative sound basic education. The programme covers four areas: an extension of the existing Early Childhood Education programme; improving the quality of teaching in primary schools; improving the planning, management, monitoring and evaluation in primary schools; and the education of children who have had to leave school. The logical framework in the original design document described key outcome and output level results but did not articulate the assumed causal logic in a formal Theory of Change narrative.  The programmatic &#x201C;purpose/outcome&#x201D; was defined as: &#x201C;increased number and proportion of children in QBEP targeted townships accessing and completing quality basic education.&#x201D;  There were four outputs-results: expansion of coverage of quality ECD services; Improved quality of teaching and learning practices in targeted townships in government and monastic schools; enhanced planning, management, monitoring &amp; evaluation and mentoring capacity of key education actors at all levels; enhanced coverage, quality, relevance of alternative education.</narrative>
