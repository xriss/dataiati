  </title>
  <description type="2" xml:lang="EN">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Phase II of the program consists of three components that support environmental management and climate change adaptation at state, municipal and civil society level. The overall objective is to strengthen the environmental sector capacity in Mozambique to better meet the rapidly growing environmental challenges and climate change impacts and to ensure improved environmental management in relation to poverty reduction. The program is formulated on the basis of lessons learned from Phase I, but the number of partners is considerably scaled down. Component 1 deals with institutional support to the Ministry of Environment and support for the promotion of environmental issues in national plans and strategies in other sectors. Support is provided for an inter-ministerial body CONDES. In addition, support is provided to the Ministry to deal with climate issues in collaboration with the National Institute of Disaster ( INGC ), where the Ministry is responsible for the overall policy and strategic work while INGC perform specific activities in areas threatened by the effects of climate change such as floods and cyclones. The aim from the beginning has been a transition to full sector budget support during the program period. Priority activities in order to fight the effects of climate change will be implemented. Component 2 is a continuation of support for environmental activities in 13 cities under a co &#xBF; financed program with Switzerland, Austria and, since December 2012, Ireland. This phase is carried out in closer cooperation with the Municipality Ministry to secure that environmental issues are included as part of urban development plans. Focus is on financial management, waste management and land use planning. Under Component 3 support is provided to civil organizations for information and advocacy on environmental issues, especially in relation to use of natural resources and land rights.</narrative>
