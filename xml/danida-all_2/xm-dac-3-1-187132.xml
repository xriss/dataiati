The program contributes to the achievements of the targets for reduction of poverty in Mozambique through direct funding of the state budget and support through the tax authorities for strengthening of revenue mobilization. By participating in the partnership of donors that provide general budget support to Mozambique, Denmark contributes to: I) Enhancing aid effectiveness and reduction of the transaction cost in aid management, strengthening the role of Mozambican partners in the development process and the accountability of the executive to the Parliament and citizens, increasing the transparency and accountability in public expenditure as well as the predictability of external funding and, improving public sector management including also though better supervision and evaluation; II) continuing the development of the partnership between Mozambique and the budget support donors based on an open and honest dialogue about the contents and implementation of Mozambique&apos;s poverty reduction strategy.

Aside from the direct and unearmarked contributions to the state budget, Denmark funds the reform of public financial management and the efforts to increase domestic financing of the budget through revenue mobilization. In addition, funding is also provided in support of research undertaken by the Ministry of Planning and Development to analyse policies, undertake evaluations and large periodical houshold surveys carried out to monitor progress on poverty in the country.</narrative>
