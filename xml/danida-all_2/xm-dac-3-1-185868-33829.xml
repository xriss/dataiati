   </title>
   <description>
    <narrative xml:lang="EN">HIV infection rates among young women are twice as high as among young men in some regions in sub-Saharan Africa. The indicator will track the extent to which an enhanced programmatic focus on women and adolescent girls results in a reduction in new infections in selected countries with large disparities in incident infec-tions.
This objective is closely linked to other strategic objectives focused on scale-up of programmes supporting women and girls; advancing sexual and reproductive health and rights; support to women&#x2019;s, children&#x2019;s, and adolescent health; and removing barriers to access.</narrative>

Indicator proposes to use this process to monitor and ensure alignment between funding requests and National Strategic Plans. During the current funding cycle the vast majority of concept notes were rated by the Fund&#x2019;s independent Technical Review Panel as being well aligned with national strategic plan priorities. This indicator will track whether this strong performance is maintained in the next replenishment period.

   </title>
   <description>
    <narrative xml:lang="EN">With a focus on 15-20 priority countries this indicator will measure the extent to which comprehensive programmes to reduce human rights-related barriers to access are established. The programmes will be designed around the &#x201C;7 key interventions to reduce stigma and discrimination and increase access to justice&#x201D; of UNAIDS. Where available, established WHO indicators for assessing enabling environments will be used to track progress in operationalizing the interventions. The aim is that these programmes will contribute to a meaningful reduction in human rights barriers to services and that increased access will lead to increased impact. This will be measured through in-depth evaluations as baseline in 2017, at mid-term in 2019 and at the end of the strategy period in 2022. Note that while 8 countries are the target for comprehensive programmes, all 20 countries will have active work.</narrative>
