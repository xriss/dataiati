   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Protection and conservation of Bhutan&apos;s environment is under pressure with the country&apos;s modernization and climate change. Environment is not defined as a sector in Bhutan&apos;s 10th Five-Year Plan (2008-13), but as a cross-cutting development theme. This support program with DKK 70 million aims to make local government&apos;s long-term development more sustainable and help to reduce poverty through support to the five-year plan efforts on sustainable environment and climate protection. This is done through two components: 1 (DKK 40 million) as Sector Budget Support focusing on investments in the 205 counties according to the formula-based (70% population, 25% poverty and 5% area) resource allocation from the central government to districts and counties. The component is fully aligned to the local government&apos;s investment plans and supplements other support to decentralization including Local Governance Support Programme. Component 2 (DKK 20 million) will provide complementary capacity development support to mainstream environment, climate change and poverty concerns into policies, plans and programmes of the centre and local governments with more focus on the latter. The component is a joint effort of Denmark, UNDP/UNEP, AusAID and UNCDF. The program is implemented by national and local institutions, and fully aligned to national planning, budgeting, monitoring and accounting systems. The rest of the funds of DKK 10 million are for reviews, budget margin and unallocated funds. The unallocated budget of DKK 7 million was allocated to component 2 to enable Bhutan to host the regional climate summit and develop the low-carbon development strategy and other capacity development activities. The program completed in December 2013.</narrative>
