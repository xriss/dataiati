   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The significant lending provided during the global financial crisis significantly hollowed out the capacity of the African Development Bank (AfDB) to take loans from international capital markets. Without the influx of capital, the level of activities of AfDB would have decreased dramatically by 2012. In May 2010, AfDB&apos;s Board of Governors therefore agreed upon a 200 % extension of capital, of which 6 % were to be disbursed, while the rest stands as guaranteed capital. 

The extension of capital increases the economic latitude of the Bank&apos;s &quot;hard window&quot;, where AfDB lends money to creditworthy middle-income countries and finances all of its investments in the private sector. Almost half of these investments are directed towards businesses in African low-income countries. Its strategic and operational priorities are aligned with those of the African Development Bank Group&apos;s Ten Year Strategy for 2013-2022, which two overall objectives are inclusive and green growth. The Strategy determines the AfDB&#xBF;s strategic selectivity and operational focus on infrastructure, regional integration, private sector development, governance and accountability, and skills and technology; with three areas of special emphasis namely fragile states, food security and agriculture, and gender. These objectives are well in line with overall Danish development priorities.</narrative>
