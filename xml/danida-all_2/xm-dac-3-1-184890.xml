   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The African Development Bank Group&#x2019;s independent evaluation unit publishes its &#x2018;Annual Development Effectiveness Review&#x2019; (ADER) on an annual basis. The review assesses Bank performance against targets in the Bank&#x2019;s result measurement framework. The &#x2018;Strategy for Denmark&#x2019;s Engagement with the African Development Bank 2020-2024&#x2019; sets out the most relevant indicators in relation to Danish priorities, cf. below. 
Based on the Bank&#x2019;s ADER 2020, measured against corresponding results from ADER 2019, the following results can be reported in relation to select Danish priorities* &#x2013; both for all African countries and for ADF (African Development Fund) countries only.

&#x2022;	DK priority climate change and green growth: Improvements over baseline and vis-&#xE0;-vis 2018 regarding &#x2018;access to electricity&#x2019; as well as &#x2018;installed renewable capacity&#x2019; (cf. Table 1 in ADER 2020 and Table 2 in ADER 2019), while &#x2018;Access to safely managed drinking water services&#x2019; decreased (cf. Table 9 in ADER 2020 and Table 5 in ADER 2019).
Compared to 2018, where 52 percent of the population in all African countries had &#x2018;access to electricity&#x2019;, the most recent score shows an increase to 54 percent in 2019. Access to electricity in ADF countries increased from 36 percent in 2018 to 37 percent in 2019. 
&#x2018;Installed renewable capacity&#x2019; increased from 37 GW in 2018 to 43 GW in 2019, and from 21 GW to 23 GW in ADF countries. 
&#x2018;Access to safely managed drinking water services&#x2019; decreased from 72 percent in 2018 to 66 percent in 2019, and from 66 percent in 2018 to 56 percent in 2019 in ADF countries. 

&#x2022;	DK priority inclusive development and job creation for youth: Improvements over baseline and vis-&#xE0;-vis 2018 regarding &#x2018;youth unemployment rate&#x2019; as well as corresponding rate for &#x2018;young women&#x2019;, while &#x2018;population living below the poverty line&#x2019; remained at 40 percent for all African countries and 43 percent in ADF countries (cf. Table 9 in ADER 2020 and Table 5 in ADER 2019).

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The significant lending provided during the global financial crisis significantly hollowed out the capacity of the African Development Bank (AfDB) to take loans from international capital markets. Without the influx of capital, the level of activities of AfDB would have decreased dramatically by 2012. In May 2010, AfDB&apos;s Board of Governors therefore agreed upon a 200 % extension of capital, of which 6 % were to be disbursed, while the rest stands as guaranteed capital. 

The extension of capital increases the economic latitude of the Bank&apos;s &quot;hard window&quot;, where AfDB lends money to creditworthy middle-income countries and finances all of its investments in the private sector. Almost half of these investments are directed towards businesses in African low-income countries. Its strategic and operational priorities are aligned with those of the African Development Bank Group&apos;s Ten Year Strategy for 2013-2022, which two overall objectives are inclusive and green growth. The Strategy determines the AfDB&#xBF;s strategic selectivity and operational focus on infrastructure, regional integration, private sector development, governance and accountability, and skills and technology; with three areas of special emphasis namely fragile states, food security and agriculture, and gender. These objectives are well in line with overall Danish development priorities.</narrative>
