  </title>
  <description type="2" xml:lang="EN">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Governments of Kenya and Denmark have agreed to jointly formulate and implement the Natural Resource Management (NRM) Programme in the period 01 January 2010 to 31 December 2014. Further to Danida&#xBF;s Board approval, Denmark supports the Natural Resource sector in Kenya in the amount of Danish Kroner 375 million (approximately K.Shs. 5.325 billion) over a 5 year period. 
The main focus of the NRM Programme is the reduction of poverty through the sustainable management of natural resources. The programme will support the demand from community level for technical services from both public and private service providers, and support an appropriate policy and legal framework for the management of natural resources. It will support the harnessing of opportunities from sustainable use of natural resources, while also safeguarding against the risks to livelihoods from environmental degradation and climate change. It will strengthen local governance capacities in the natural resource sectors. 
The programme&apos;s Development Objective is: 
&quot;Contribute to reduced poverty in the context of Kenya&apos;s Vision 2030 in safeguarding the state of the environment and promoting sustainable management of natural resources.&quot;
The Immediate Objectives are the objectives of the three components: 
1. Enabling policy and regulatory framework for environmental and natural resource management, including climate change, developed and implemented with a poverty orientation- 
2. Poverty reduction, enhanced food security, reduced livelihood vulnerability, and improved natural resource management systems in drought-prone and marginalised districts and communities.
3. Civil society organisations including local communities and private sector service providers are capacitated to support and influence natural resource management, as a contribution towards poverty alleviation.
To achieve these objectives support is provided to partners in the Government of Kenya, private sector and civil society.</narrative>
