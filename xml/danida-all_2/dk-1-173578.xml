   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The overall objectives of the programme are to reduce poverty through broad based economic growth and better employment opportunities for the growing population of Mozambique. These objectives are pursued through support to increased competitiveness and productivity in the private sector. Based on experience from previous sector programmes focus is on private producers, small and medium sized entrepreneurs and processing enterprises within the agricultural value chain, including production, inputs and services as well as transformation of outputs and more generally within all aspects of value creation. The programme consists of 3 components: 1) Support to membership organisations including business associations, employers organisations and trade unions to enable these to better represent the interests of their members in the ongoing dialogue with the Government about the framework conditions for doing business and working in Mozambique, as well as support to research related to improving the environment for doing business and investing in Mozambique; 2) Improved income opportunities through better access to credit to facilitate productive and sustainable investments and know-how for actors in the agro-industrial value chain at all levels with a special focus on the small and medium sized; 3) Increased integration of rural areas through easier and better access to input and output markets as a result of expanded and better maintenance of district level rural roads. The support to rural roads is implemented using national institutions, which are in charge of planning and coordinating the work.</narrative>
