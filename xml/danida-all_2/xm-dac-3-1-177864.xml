   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The program is the second phase of Danish support to combat HIV / AIDS. It seeks to reduce the number of new infections in the population and the consequences of the HIV / AIDS epidemic. The program has two components, including support for national coordination and leadership and strengthening the role of civil society in the national HIV / AIDS efforts.

Along with a number of other development partners (USA, Sweden, Ireland and the United Kingdom) Denmark seeks to support and strengthen the leading national institution on HIV / AIDS, Uganda AIDS Commission (UAC), in order to enhance coordination and effectiveness of the national response. It focuses on two strategic areas: 1) Improved coordination and utilization of operational research and generation of knowledge about the most effective action methods for prevention, especially for vulnerable populations and 2) Better integration of reproductive health and HIV / AIDS services with special focus on the different prevention needs of women and men, young and old.

The Danish support to local civil society organizations continues through the support of Civil Society Fund (CSF), which was established in 2007. The Fund supports efforts at both national and decentralized levels with a special focus on outlying areas. The aim is to disseminate services especially for marginalized communities, to support planning and coordination, to develop and build capacity of civil society organizations, and to strengthen advocacy. The component has earmarked funds to provide core funding to selected national organizations that are dedicated to the prevention and advocacy among vulnerable populations, including sexual minorities and orphans.</narrative>
