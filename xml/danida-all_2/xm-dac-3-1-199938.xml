  </title>
  <description type="2" xml:lang="EN">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The aim of the Danish Peace and Stabilization Fund is to strengthen the comprehensive approach between development and stabilization initiatives. It does so by being multi-annual, regional in its focus and merged between the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Defence. The Fund aims at enhancing both the effect and the sustainability of the Danish stabilization and reconstruction initiatives in fragile states in line with the government&apos;s New Security Policy, which focuses on stabilization, reconstruction and capacity building in conflict areas. The implementation of concrete initiatives is characterized by a realistic and flexible approach to risk elements. 
 
The Horn of Africa programme is specifically focused on building African countries&apos; own capacities to handle stabilization, conflict prevention and anti-piracy activities on the Horn of Africa. The programme consists of a total amount of 215 million DKK, i.e. around one third of the total Peace and Stabilization Fund for the period 2011-2014. The programme is composed of development aid and non-development aid and concrete projects to be funded by the programme have been chosen on the basis of their strategic importance as well as their expected impact on the ground both at the local, regional and international levels.

Individual projects to be funded under the programme have been approved by the Whole-of-Government Steering Committee for the Peace and Stabilization Fund. The three components of the Horn of Africa programme were selected on the basis of inter-ministerial missions to the region.
 
The programme is composed of the following elements:
 
Component 1: Regional stabilization and building-up of peace-supporting capacity. 
Component 2: Prevention and counter-piracy and stabilization of Somalia. 
Component 3: Prevention and combatting terrorism and radicalization.</narrative>
