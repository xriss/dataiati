   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The main objective of this Project has been to support the Government of Bangladesh in developing a regional training centre for law enforcement capacity building in South Asia. The aim of the training centre would be to promote regional cooperation and develop professional skills within security, law enforcement and criminal justice organisations to help combat and prevent serious transnational crime. The Project was part of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Ministry of Defence &quot;Whole of Government Stabilisation programme for the Afghanistan-Pakistan Region 2011-2014. Denmark in 2011 had initially committed DKK 2 million and later an additional 1.3 million DKK to the Project in December 2012 for the preparatory phase of setting up the training centre, including through the support of a Danida Advisor. A number of training activities have been carried out under the auspices of the project since 2012. It has however been a challenge to agree on the institutional framework under which the training centre could operate. Elections were held in Bangladesh on 05 January 2014. The pre-election situation was a dominating factor and took most of the government&apos;s attention in 2013, a year marred by violent disruptions and strikes. On that background it was decided in late 2013 that Danish support to the establishment of the training centre would be phased out without a clear commitment from the Bangladesh Government to take on the task of establishing the required institutional framework by end of April 2014. The commitment from the Government did not materialise before the given time and the project was phased out.</narrative>
