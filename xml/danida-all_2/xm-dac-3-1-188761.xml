  </title>
  <description type="2" xml:lang="EN">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed stove project will be implemented under the Ministry of education and World Food Programme&#xBF;s School Meals Programme which provides free hot lunches for 3,000 Kenyan Schools in marginalized areas. Currently, the provision of firewood for the meals preparation falls under the responsibility of the underprivileged parents which is a huge burden that this project intends to alleviate. 
Through community engagement, schools will be sensitized on the institutional stove project and schools that agree to cover 50% of the cost over a 2 year period will receive an energy efficient stove at no up front cost. The stoves are locally produced, known to last for more than a decade and can save up to 70% of a school&#xBF;s firewood consumption. The project will supply 300 institutional fuel efficient stoves, establish 3 large school woodlots and develop a carbon-financing component that will cover stove maintenance, follow up training of cooks and a possible further expansion of the project. 
The project&apos;s main objective will be to:
1.	Supply 300 institutional stoves
2.	Train 600 people in stove use
3.	Establish 3 school woodlots
4.	Develop carbon financing
5.	Carry baseline survey and impact assessment.</narrative>
