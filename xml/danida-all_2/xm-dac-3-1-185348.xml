  <description type="2" xml:lang="EN">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Kenya Governance Support Programme (KGSP) is implemented over a five-year period (2010-2015). Parts of the programme is being extended into the first half of 2016, as the successor Thematic Programme on Governance is being rolled out. The programme emphasises supporting institutions and organisations promoting accountability, advocating for progress or implementing key reforms aligned with National Accord Agenda and the 2010 constitution; Public Financial Management (PFM) for enhanced transparency and accountability; and reduced insecurity through the support to civil society organisations at the Coast. The support was designed in the context of the current reform efforts in Kenya, following the agreement on the National Accord and the enactment of the constitution from 2010. The development objective of KGSP is identical to the development objective of the political pillar: A democratic political system that is issue-based, people-centred, results-oriented and accountable to the public. This objective is broken down into three intermediate objectives, each corresponding to a programme component: 1) Improve Kenya&#xBF;s accountability to Kenya&#xBF;s citizens; 2) Maintaining macro-economic stability and accelerating growth; and developing transparent, accountable, ethical and results-oriented Government institutions, operationalised through the immediate objective `Strengthened PFM systems that enhance transparency, accountability and responsiveness to public expenditure policy priorities&#xBF; of the revised PFM component; and 3) Peace and security promoted as the basis for democratic development at the coastal areas of Kenya. In practice the programme supports: a) Peace, justice, human rights and rule of law; b) Credible electoral processes, including electoral reform, support to a new elections commission and voter education; c) Enhancing democratic participation; d) Transparent, accountable and results-oriented government institutions.</narrative>
