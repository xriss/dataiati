   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Culture Programme 2011-2015 is based on the good results from the earlier phase of the programme. The purpose is to continuously develop democracy and pluralism by promoting increased creativity and improving access to and participation in Vietnamese cultural life. The support is granted on several levels and within different areas where it is possible to have great results from the effort. The programme focuses on children and young, aspiring artists as well as cultural decision makers. Creative subjects in primary school will be developed concurrently with the Vietnamese national description of curriculum in arts education, which will be revised in 2015. The availability of Vietnamese children&apos;s literature and stimulating TV-programmes for children in the age of 4-14 is expected to increase. The possibilities of artistic experimenting and self-expression amongst young artists are reinforced through the Cultural Development and Exchange Fund, which also founds the basis of the cultural exchange between Vietnam and Denmark. The public space is expanded through the implementation of big cultural projects, which will be made available for the common Vietnamese. Finally the programme will support the dialogue between cultural managers and opinion makers for the purposes of enhancing the understanding and development of art and culture in Vietnam.</narrative>
