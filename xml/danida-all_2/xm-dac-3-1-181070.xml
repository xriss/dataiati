   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In August 2010, the Parliamentary Finance Committee approved commitments totalling DKK 130 million for a 3 years program of support to Pakistan (2010-2012). The aim of the project is to contribute to civilian reconstruction and stabilization in Pakistan, with particular emphasis on border areas with Afghanistan, including counter radicalization by offering an alternative approach to population which remains highly vulnerable and exposed, especially the children.
An amount of DKK 50 million has been allocated to UNICEF to support the reconstruction of destroyed schools in FATA region and the integration of children in school, particularly to ensure that girls go to school. In addition, supported the education of the internally displaced children who still live in camps as a result of the fighting against the Taliban in the northwest of the country. UNICEF&apos;s efforts to provide education to children affected by the conflict in the crisis affected districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa began with an agreement with UNICEF for a contribution of 10 million in December 2009.
The program also contributed DKK 40 million to a Multi Donor Trust Fund administered by the World Bank, which aims to support the repair of damaged infrastructure, improve public services such as education and health, capacity building and strengthening of public institutions and support for restoring economic activity and job creation in the border areas to Afghanistan on the basis of post crisis need assessment done by the Govt. of Pakistan. Denmark was the first country that pledged to the fund, which is supported by eleven other donors. The eleven donors have contributed a total of 175 million USD.
There is also DKK 35 million to strengthen democracy, human rights, equality and freedom of the media. This is done primarily through support to Pakistani civil society organizations working in these areas. Finally DKK 5 million was granted for the administration of the program and communication activities.</narrative>
