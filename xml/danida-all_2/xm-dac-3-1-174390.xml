The purpose is through the application and interconnection of already known and proven methods of intervention to activate and stimulate entrepreneurship among young Africans, so that these increasingly becoming a dynamic factor in the socio-economic development through the creation of decent work both by self-employed and by increased demand for labour. Implemented by the ILO in Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda the vision is to spread the facility to other African countries with funding from other bilateral and international donors. The program is distinguished by a comprehensive approach, where work at all levels to improve conditions for young entrepreneurs, and the ILO is carrying out many of the activities and thus contributes its expertise, experience and solid network. The strategy of the program is based on a market-based approach with interventions at three levels: Meta-level, that is, the broader cultural context that includes attitudes and values in relation to entrepreneurs and being self-employed; macro-level that includes strategies, legislation and framework conditions for young entrepreneurs and micro-level, that is, the market itself, where the young conclude agreements and exchange goods and services against payment, including education sites and other organizations providing relevant services for young entrepreneurs. There are prepared country-specific work programs with specific goals and indicators for each of the three countries. ILO has extensive experience in activities to promote youth employment in developing countries and is guided by its mandate given tripartite approach involving governments, employers and workers represented in the organization.</narrative>
