   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Danish education program in Afghanistan (Education Support Programme to Afghanistan, phase I) was a 3-year program covering the period April 2010 to March 2013. The program was harmonized with the national education strategy. The strategic vision for education is that everyone should have equal access to education as a prerequisite for economic growth and development. The Afghan Ministry of Education is working in accordance with the Afghan constitution and the UN development goal to ensure that by 2020 all children have access to complete primary education. Almost 50% of Afghan children are still not in school and there is still far to the goal of quality education for all. The Danish efforts contribute to the implementation of the national education strategy, partly through financial support to the Ministry of Education, partly through targeted technical assistance.
The aid is primarily through the Ministry of Education for the implementation of the national education strategy that includes five program areas: 1) general and Islamic education, 2) curriculum development 3) technical and vocational training, 4) literacy, and 5) administration and planning as well as construction. Denmark provides support to key areas such as school construction and text books.
Apart from supporting the Ministry of Education ESPA support projects directly with implementing partners, external consultants and other costs associated with the education support program. The projects are aimed to support and complement the activities implemented directly by the Ministry of Education, and are implemented in close coordination with the Ministry. The second phase of the programme was started in April 2014.</narrative>
