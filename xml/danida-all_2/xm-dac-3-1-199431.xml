   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project is intended to continue and strengthen the valuable work already being undertaken in Afghanistan in relation to gender based violence (GBV). The project addresses challenges faced by Afghan women due to lack of protection against violence and human rights violations in a cultural context largely endorsing violations of women&#xBF;s rights. This phase of the project is based on the lessons learned and experiences made during the project&#xBF;s two first years (2012-13), as well as the findings and recommendations of the Mid Term Review undertaken in September 2013. Based on the recommendations of the Mid Term Review, lessons learned during the first two years of the project and the current situation in the field of shelter work in Afghanistan, the project is proposed to continue into 2014 and to continue its focus on the three current partner organizations (3 Shelters for women) as well as two new organizations based in Herat and Mazar provinces.</narrative>
