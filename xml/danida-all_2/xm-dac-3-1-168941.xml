   <narrative xml:lang="EN">As part of Denmark strategic focus on fragile and conflict-affected states, the multi-donor State- and Peace-Building Fund (SPF) is supported by DKK 30 mio. from 2012-2014. The SPF was created in 2008, supports measures to improve governance, institutional performance, and reconstruction and development in countries emerging from, in, or at risk of sliding into crisis or arrears. SPF funds are available to all Bank member countries, IBRD and IDA-eligible countries, as well as countries in arrears. 

The SPF supports strategic initiatives/projects that:
&#xBF; pilot innovative initiatives that address the challenges of fragility and create a foothold for wider development involvement; 
&#xBF; assist countries that are in arrears; 
&#xBF; mpromote cross-cutting, innovative approaches to the challenges of conflict and fragility; and 
&#xBF; capture and disseminate the lessons of SPF activities to promote better understanding of the dynamics of fragility and conflict and develop effective strategic and operational approaches. 

The 2011 World Development Report: Conflict, Security, and Development, along with the Bank&#xBF;s own operationalization strategy, marked a significant shift within the Bank and across the international development system toward new and revitalized approaches for working in fragile and conflict-affected situations (FCS). SPF funding supports development of &#xBF;transformative&#xBF; strategies at the regional, country, and sub-national levels that address prevention, management, and recovery from violence, conflict, and fragility, using the World Development Report as a framework.</narrative>
