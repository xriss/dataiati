   <narrative xml:lang="EN">IPAS is among the few international CSOs that exclusively work with the promotion of the access to safe abortion for the poorest and most vulnerable women in the world. The organisation was founded in 1973 and has its headquarters in the United States. IPAS works globally and has country offices in 14 countries in Africa (among these Kenya, from where a number of African countries are covered), Asia, and Latin America. The majority of the organisation&apos;s activities are focused on Africa. IPAS cooperates with a number of partners in more than 40 countries, including national health ministries, other international CSOs, UN organisations, especially UNFPA, and local NGOs.
Danish support for the organisation is a central element in the overall Danish support for sexual and reproductive health and rights, in which the promotion of access to safe abortion is one of the most politically sensitive and underfinanced areas.
The incentive for the contribution to IPAS is the high number of unsafe abortions which take place in the developing countries, where 70,000 women die annually as a result of unsafe abortion procedures. Limited access to safe abortions in many developing countries is thus a serious barrier for women&#xBF;s health and right to decide over their own body. IPAS works to promote access to safe abortions through advocacy globally, nationally, and locally, and through capacity building in the health systems at the country level.</narrative>
