   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The main objective of the project is to contribute to the process of promoting decentralization through defined and expanded role of elected Local Government Institutions (LGIs) in Bangladesh. Due to NGO Affairs Bureau registration and fund clearance delays, the Project could not start in time. The project could not undertake some activities of which many were national level programmes due to project set up tasks in the first quarter after a delayed start. All the undone activities were being conducted in the following quarters. This is the first ever project directly implemented by Local Government Associations (LGAs) in Bangladesh. Therefore, initially it took some time to set the intervention mechanism. In Bangladesh the general perception about independent, democratic and vibrant Local Government Associations is yet not crystallized among many policymakers, government officials and local government representatives. For all these reasons the Project has been extended up to June 2015. The lessons learned from this Project would provide a solid ground for the LGAs to design and implement similar activities/projects in future. The audit report will be submitted by 30 April 2016 and the project will be closed accordingly.</narrative>
