  <description type="1" xml:lang="EN">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The overall objective of the APP II is to promote peace and security as the basis for sustainable development in Africa. Support has been provided in the area of peace and security in Africa over the period 2010-2013 to four intergovernmental African organisations: AU (continental), ECOWAS (West Africa), IGAD and EASBRICOM (Eastern Africa) and to the Kofi Annan International Peace Training Centre (KAIPTC) and United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA) as well as to civil society organisations for implementation of the Road Map for the African Peace and Security Architecture. 

The support enhances the organisations&apos; capacity to carry activities under their mandates in peace and security and enables them to take on their role as the African providers of leadership regarding peace and security issues affecting the continent. 

The APP II takes the organisations&apos; strategic priorities and development plans as its starting point. Because of the uniqueness of each of these, the APP II is fundamentally a collection of autonomous programmes guided by a continuously developing framework for African integration and cooperation in the field of peace and security. A number of cross-cutting themes are common to each of the partner programmes, namely: Support to the further development and application of the African Peace and Security Architecture; support to institutional capacity building efforts; and reducing the transaction costs of assistance through alignment and maximum use of joint approaches.
 
Support is managed by the organisations themselves in accordance with the specific funding agreements with the Danish Embassy in Addis Ababa. The Danish support has to a large extend been part of joint donor arrangements and management procedures has been aligned as much as possible to the organisations&apos; own procedures and those of the relevant joint donor arrangements.</narrative>
