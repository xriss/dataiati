   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The objective of the U-Growth programme is to support the Government of Uganda in building an export-led economy, driven by the private sector and in which the benefits of growth are shared by all Ugandans. The programme is focused on the agricultural and agribusiness sectors and includes three components: 1) Support to improved delivery of public services in the agriculture; 2) Support to rehabilitation of rural districts roads, and; 3) Support to agriculture and agro-processing development, including improved access to finance for farmers and agriculture related small and medium sized enterprises. The programme is aligned to Uganda&#xBF;s National Development Plan, which has a special focus on growth- and employment creation.

The support for the public agricultural sector has been limited to Technical Assistance. The support to the road component is expected to contribute to the rehabilitation of 500 kilometres of district roads and sealing of 300 kilometres district roads with low cost seals. The sealing of gravel roads substantially reduces the maintenance cost of the roads. The construction works are implemented using labour based methods which contributes to increased employment. 

The support to the agriculture and agro-processing development is to a high degree focused on direct support to the private sector. The component includes a value chain approach and the support will contribute to enhancing the productivity, quality and value addition in selected agricultural value chains (coffee, maize, oilseeds, pulses, dairy and horticulture for export) with the aim of increasing incomes and jobs. Moreover, the component works towards increased availability and accessibility of finance for the rural population and agro-processing industry. 

It is estimated that the component will support 250,000 agricultural families and 300 businesses directly. Indirectly, the programme will create more than 400,000 jobs and support to increase the income of 130,000 farmers.-</narrative>
