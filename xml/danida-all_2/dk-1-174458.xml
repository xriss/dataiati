  <description type="1" xml:lang="EN">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">MDBS II is the second phase of Denmark&apos;s general budget support to Ghana. The programme budget is DKK 357 million and covers the period 2010-2014. It has two components. The first component supports the implementation of Ghana&apos;s development with DKK 325 million. The second component supports Ghana&apos;s financial systems through the implementation of a system integrated management accounting information system with DKK 27 million. An additional amount of DKK 5 million has been allocated for audits, reviews and studies to support programme implementation. The annual payments to the MDBS are allocated as follows: 100 million in 2011; 90 million in 2012; 80 million in 2013 and 55 million in in 2014. Payment will be made early in the year in a single tranche and on the basis of previous year&apos;s MDBS review. The transfer will include a base and a performance-related tranche. The Danish distribution is based on an 80:20 split. This distribution is determined based on the view that overall progress in poverty reduction and economic growth is weighted higher than sector-specific indicators. The indicators of the programme are decided on an annual basis in dialogue with development partners and the government. Good financial systems are key prerequisites for budget support. The purpose of the Danish support to the Ghana Integrated Financial Management Information System (GIFMIS) is to strengthen public finances on a strategic level. Through Denmark&apos;s involvement in this, the Embassy participates in the political dialogue on reforms in public financial management.</narrative>
