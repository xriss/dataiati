   <narrative xml:lang="EN">B2B-Trio Nex&#xF8; A/S and Sun Ray Engineering Company Ltd. Pilot project.

The partnership was initiated in 2009 when Trio Nexo undertook a visit to Ghana to see a selected number of companies within the hydraulics industry. At the end of the visit, Trio Nex&#xF8; A/S was convinced that Sun Ray was the most appropriate company with the most impressive set up in Ghana to engage with in a B2B. In April 2009, Sun Ray reciprocated the visit to Denmark to see the facilities of Trio Nexo and also to develop further the concept for business cooperation under a B2B.
Product and Product Concept
The objective of the co-operation is to establish a modern service and manufacturing company catering for the hydraulic segment on the Ghanaian market. The new partnership intends service the local fishing fleet with repair and maintenance services as well as manufacture new hydraulic winches locally based on Trio Nex&#xF8; designs. 
A Winch is a mechanical device that is used to pull in (wind up) or let out (wind out) or otherwise adjust the &quot;tension&quot; of a rope or wire rope . In its simplest form it consists of a spool and attached hand crank. In larger forms, winches stand at the heart of machines as diverse as tow trucks, steam shovels and elevators. There are several winches on almost every boat or ship where they are used to pull anchor or mooring lines, halyards, and sheets. More elaborate designs have gear assemblies and can be powered by electric, hydraulic, pneumatic or internal combustion drives. 
The key project output for the partnership is to:
Create and design specialised hydraulics workshop in Tema, 
Manufacture high pressure hydraulics winches for fishing vessel
Provide ongoing support services to the fishing community which hitherto were imported services</narrative>
