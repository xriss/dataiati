   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The 12th replenishment of the African Development Fund (ADF12) covered the period 2011-13. The overall objective of the ADF12 was to contribute to poverty reduction by stimulating sustainable economic and social development in Africa. The ADF provides concessional funding for projects and programs, as well as technical assistance for studies and capacity-building activities. Administered by the African Development Bank, it comprises, to date, 27 contributing countries and benefits 40 countries. The ADF12 continued and deepened the strategic direction established during ADF11, maintaining an overall focus on infrastructure, governance, regional integration and fragile states. Private Sector Development, climate adaptation and mitigation, gender equality and agricultural productivity were the essential cross-cutting issues. During the ADF12, Denmark closely followed and supported the Bank&apos;s efforts to increase aid effectiveness and decentralization of staff and decision-making from headquarters of the Bank&apos;s country offices in African countries.

The total ADF12 replenishment amounted to approximately DKK 48 billion. The Danish contribution totaled DKK 630.36 million; where DKK 150 million were disbursed in 2011, DKK 200 million in 2012 and DKK 280.36 million in 2013.</narrative>
