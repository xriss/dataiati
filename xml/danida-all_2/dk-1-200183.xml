   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Sphere-project has been supported by the Danish government with a grant of 1,5 million in 2014. The grant is given in order to support their efforts for strengthening the humanitarian organizations&#xBF; application of the standards for humanitarian aid. 

Furthermore, the grant aims to support Sphere&#xBF;s engagement in the development of the Core Humanitarian Standard (CHS) in cooperation with relief organisations such as Humanitarian Accountability Partnership (HAP) and People in Aid (Pia)

The Sphere project was initiated in 1997 as a partnership between several international NGOs with the aim to develop new common standards for humanitarian work. The project is implemented in cooperation with more than 200 NGOs organized in an international network. The purpose of Sphere is to define and sustain a series of minimum standards for the quality and accountability of humanitarian aid. This is done i.a. through the recognised Sphere manual.

Denmark has supported Sphere in 2007-2012, but did not fund the project in 2013, because of their withdrawal from the CHS-process. However, Sphere has recently decided to resume its engagement in the process and Denmark has renewed its support. 

Sphere was one of co-organisers of the CHS-conference held in 2014 in collaboration with HAP, PIA, Steering Committee for Humanitarian response and Danida.</narrative>
