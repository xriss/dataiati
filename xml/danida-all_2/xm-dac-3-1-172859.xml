   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Support to water and sanitation, covering the period from 2010 to 2015, has 2 main areas:

1. Support to the National Programme for Integrated Water Resources Management, to strengthen governance at national level, in the five river basins , and in a number of sub-basins . The goal is that Burkina&apos;s scarce water resources are managed environmentally and economically rational and adapted to climate change. The Danish support is primarily given via multi-donor basket fund, together with Sweden.

2. Support to the National Programme for Drinking Water Supply and Sanitation.
The aim is to ensure sustainable provision of water and sanitation, evenly distributed across the country. The target for water supply is to achieve an access rate of 76 per cent in rural areas and 89 per cent in urban areas, by 2015. For sanitation, the target is a rate of access to sanitation of 54 per cent in rural areas and 57 per cent in urban areas, by 2015.
The support is primarily in the form of sector budget support (SBS), complemented by a multi-donor basket fund for capacity building, and funding for technical assistance. SBS will provide direct support to the government&apos;s budget for the implementation of the national program for water supply and sanitation. The choice of sector budget support was taken to increase aid effectiveness by strengthening government capacity and ownership activities. The aid is conditional on macroeconomic and financial stability and satisfactory implementation of the poverty reduction strategy, improvement of the overall financial management, satisfactory implementation of the program for water and sanitation, and good financial management in the sector.

There is close cooperation between the government and the three principals of sector budget support, Denmark, Sweden and the EU Commission to ensure that all conditions are met before each payment .

The support builds upon two previous phases of the water sector program .</narrative>
