   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The overall objective of the program is to strengthen African capacity to promote peace and security, democracy and regional economic integration in Southern Africa and the rest of the continent by supporting knowledge and capacity development in five think tanks / organizations. The think tanks are based in South Africa, but are working regional and continental. The partners will also support a strong and well-informed South African leadership and African involvement that is able - through the UN, the AU, NEPAD, SADC and other international forum - to play a constructive role. All five organizations work directly with regional and continental players such as SADC and the AU. The Danish support will therefore also contribute to a positive impact on the security and economic agenda in Africa. Through their activities, the organizations also contribute to capacity building of local civil society organizations and other relevant actors, parliamentarians and scientists.</narrative>
