   <narrative xml:lang="EN">ADDA and NADO have successfully implemented NADO in Focus (NIF) since 2012 in Njombe 
Region, Tanzania. NIF is ADDA and NADO&#x2019;s second project together, having implemented a pilot 
project together in 2009-2011. A total of 60 local facilitators have been trained during Training of 
Trainers (ToT), establishing a technical resource for the community in the future. 246 Farmer Field 
Schools (FFS) have been conducted focusing on both food crops and cash crops and 6,371 farmers 
have been trained, 52% of which are women. A total of 203 Farmer Interest Groups (FIGs) have 
been established during the project of which 186 are still active, composing 4100 small-scale farmers 
with 59% women. A SACCOS has been established as part of the project with capital from external 
donors due to an identification of a need for an institution to facilitate and encourage FIG businesses
and investments. An opportunity to access the international market for certified organic produce was 
identified but after successfully registering 3,265 farmers for organic certification, the process was 
dropped due to a lack of motivation to continue after the project from NADOs side.</narrative>
