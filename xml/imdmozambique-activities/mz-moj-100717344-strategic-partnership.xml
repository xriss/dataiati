   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In 2019, the Government of Mozambique, represented by the President of the Republic, Felipe Nyusi and the Renamo party, represented by their respective president, Ossufo Momade, signed a definitive peace agreement that formalized the end of military hostilities. Such an agreement served as a basis to enable the holding of general and legislative elections and for the Provincial Assemblies on 15 October 2019. These elections, like the other five, were preceded by reforms to electoral legislation. It follows that the 2019 electoral legislation brought about profound changes typical of the growth of Mozambican Young Democracy. Such changes are related to Decentralization. The new form of decentralization, materialized by the election of provincial governors, who now come from the candidacy lists of the competing parties, this being the first in the candidacy list. With the sixth Mozambican electoral process over, the National Elections Commission as well as the Constitutional Council validated the results, giving victory to the Frelimo party and its candidate. Thus, the Frelimo Party passes a qualified majority in the Assembly of the Republic and in the Provincial Assemblies. This electoral process proved to be another opportunity for the State&apos;s legal-electoral institutions, as well as the police, to show their electoral management capacity, aware that there are still several challenges to be overcome, naturally parts of the electoral process. State building. The 2019 political-electoral context was very striking, showing that the dominant party policy and the culture of impunity that was felt, as well as the absence of integrated mechanisms for reinforcing and complying with the rules, created space and fertile opportunities for the continuity committing violations of electoral laws and procedures. Currently, the Assembly of the Republic will be formed by the Frelimo bench with 184 seats, Renamo with 60 seats and MDM with 6 seats. Thus and with this scenario, Frelimo&apos;s parliamentary bench has a qualified majority, and this situation poses several challenges for the governance process as well as for the decentralization and peace agenda. With this majority, Frelimo will be able to take structural decisions, such as is to make changes to the constitution without needing the other benches.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The current parliamentary scenario, brings with it several challenges for Democracy, governance and debate of ideas, and most likely for the political and social stability of the country. In this context, it is noted that the main challenges for the next 5 years of governance are related to the fact that the political environment may be very polarized, characterized by the excessive dominance of the Frelimo party over the elected bodies as well as in the National Commission of Elections. This shows that the opposition&apos;s power is greatly reduced, which could make it difficult to express its will in Parliament. &#x2022; Weak inclusion of opposition parties in the decision-making process through the dictatorship of the majority vote, which may result in a feeling of dissatisfaction and tension among political actors; &#x2022; Slowdown in the DDR process due to weak collaboration by the Renamo party; &#x2022; Fragility and progressive fragmentation of opposition parties and consequent loss of members; &#x2022; Reduced levels of citizen confidence in institutions and governance; &#x2022; Deceleration of the decentralization process at district level. However, this composition of the Assembly of the Republic also allows for stable governance, with a government that will not need to negotiate with the opposition to transform its electoral manifesto into a governance plan and, thus, conduct its governance.</narrative>
