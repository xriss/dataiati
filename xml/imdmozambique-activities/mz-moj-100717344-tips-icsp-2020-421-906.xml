   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Despite the fact that multipartyism in Mozambique adds up to 3 decades since its establishment in the present year 2020, political pluralism still faces several challenges for its consolidation. Social inequalities, the feeling of exclusion in accessing public services, unemployment, partisanship and lack of confidence in democratic institutions and political intolerance are among the factors adverse to the consolidation of political pluralism.

This situation has placed the country and local communities in a condition of vulnerability to conflicts, particularly affecting the poorest and young people, girls and women. Indeed, in recent years, the country has been plunged into cyclical political-electoral crises that led to successive military tensions between the years 2012/14 and 2015/17, pitting the armed forces of the Renamo party against the government military forces. To aggravate the conflict situation, since 2017 the northern region of the country, precisely in the province of Cabo-Delgado, has suffered armed attacks by unknown extremist groups.</narrative>
