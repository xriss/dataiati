  <title>WaterAid Lesotho</title>
  <description type="1">WaterAid in Lesotho plans to explore and develop alternative, affordable technologies, such as composting latrines, within communities. We also hope to offer support and guidance to the government in order to develop reliable monitoring systems that will find gaps in water supply and sanitation coverage and improve attention to technical faults to ensure the longevity of services.We hope to achieve this by developing partnerships with local nongovernmental organisations and focusing research on water and sanitation coverage, water resource management and equity and inclusion issues surrounding people living with HIV/AIDS.</description>
