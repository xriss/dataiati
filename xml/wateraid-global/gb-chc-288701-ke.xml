  <title>WaterAid Kenya</title>
  <description type="1">WaterAid worked in Kenya from the mid 1980s until the early 1990s. At that time it seemed the development indicators were very strong so it was decided WaterAid&apos;s efforts could be focused elsewhere. In 2008 WaterAid conducted a scoping study in Kenya and decided that, after ten years away from the country, there were compelling reasons to return.  We have re-established WaterAid&apos;s presence in Kenya by registering, recruiting staff and setting up an office and undertaken a two year pilot phase, with the development of a programme of work based on a deeper sector analysis and thorough exploration of potential partnerships in Kenya.</description>
