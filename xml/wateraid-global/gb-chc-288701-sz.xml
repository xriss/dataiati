  <title>WaterAid Swaziland</title>
  <description type="1">WaterAid&apos;s key aims within Swaziland will be to introduce pro-poor, sustainable technologies &#x2013; particularly in rural areas &#x2013; and to influence the government on prioritising water and sanitation sector needs. We hope to strengthen and support civil society capacity in technology use and approaches. We also aim to conduct action research on appropriate, accessible water and sanitation technologies for the most vulnerable people &#x2013; particularly those living with HIV/AIDS &#x2013; and to influence the water and sanitation sector on how to reach these communities. WaterAid plans to use our knowledge of pro-poor, affordable and sustainable technologies to influence and strengthen civil society and build strong partnerships with local and international nongovernmental organisations. We also hope to support and encourage the government to prioritise water and sanitation in poverty reduction plans.</description>
