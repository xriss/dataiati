  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project delivers a strategic and integrated set of interventions to restore local economy in the war-ravaged Ariha, Idleb in the aftermath of protracted conflict. Its main objective is to create income generating opportunities for IDPs, host community members and returnees, through short-term employment opportunities and small business startup support and restoration of the impacted ones, while rehabilitating Ariha&apos;s essential basic socioeconomic infrastructures and services. The project formulation has been based in needs as identified in multi-cluster RNA/REACH data and HNAP data. Besides, firsthand consultations, conducted specifically for this project with local councils and local stakeholders, have also informed the design of this proposal. Almost half of the population of Ariha are returnees. As a result of the conflict, most of the socioeconomic infrastructures and businesses have been destroyed, but the slight improvement in the security situation has encouraged members of this once thriving location to return. Therefore, this project seeks to provide strategic support to communities in Ariha to sustainably recover in the aftermath of the protracted crisis. By pursuing the referred main objective, the project aims to achieve the following outcomes:
1. Access to short term livelihoods opportunities involving CFW approach among others provided
2. Physical access to and from markets rehabilitated for movement of people and goods
3. Essential community and public services are revived and restored
4. Local small businesses and entrepreneurs are supported are restored
5.Social cohesion among IDPs, host communities and returnees is enhanced

In particular, the project&apos;s activities include the creation of short-term work opportunities through the rehabilitation of access roads to markets, rehabilitation of two markets and a public bakery in coordination with CCCM to ensure complementarity with the rehabilitation of roads leading to camps, as well as in coordination with the FSL partners to ensure that the intervention on markets, bakery and community kitchens is synergistic with food assistance by FSL. Furthermore, the project foresees the identification of vulnerable HHs with a specific focus on severe economic vulnerability, including female-headed households and PwDs, the provision of business training linked to the small business support and the establishment of community kitchens designed to provide income opportunities for women and contribute to food security in the targeted location. Moreover, the project is specifically designed to foster social cohesion among IDPs, returnees and host communities through the establishment of a Municipal Community Committee for advising the design and implementation of the project activities, fostering local ownership and ensuring sustainability of the achievements of the project upon its completion.
