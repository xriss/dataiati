   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project aims to provide life saving food assistance to the newly displaced persons in Afrin and Dana communities that were affected by the latest conflicts and in urgent need for food assistanct as a response in line with reserved allocation 2020 emergency 

Ahl Horan Association (AHA) will be responsible of delivering a life-saving food supports through implementing a project mainly relatein the aforementioned targeted areas due to the need existed and the difficulties in accessing food for reasons mentioned in needs assessment paragraph
. 
activities enrolled in this proposal include
1- Assisting 2000 HHs with 2000 food baskets that matches cluster recommendations in Dana and Afrin communities and matches Sphere guidelines  for 3 months in row as first response to them.
2- Providing 3000 RTER for 3000 HHs for newly displaced in open areas or in camps that are most vulnerable and most in needs for RTER

  As for the implementation method, AHA is planning to execute these activities directly through its field team in Syria. baskets are going to be purchased and distributed in most effective methodology to ensure timely response to the newly displaced. 

MoUs would be signed with the Local Councils (LC) within the targeted areas since they are considered to be the formal authorities and the main communication channels. LCs will provide AHA with the primary list of beneficiaries and the MampE team will be responsible of completing the verification process to ensure that all registered names in the final beneficiary list have met the project&apos;s criteria. When it comes to the targeted groups, AHA will target the most vulnerable HHs to guarantee supporting the eligible beneficiaries regardless of their gender. The eligibility criteria include the following: 
1- Poor households with no/little income below 50 USD.
2- HH is newly displaced.
3- HH Caring for elderly, sick, disabled or injured family members. 
4- Female-headed household.
5- Child-headed household
6- Elderly-headed household
7- HHs with pregnant/ lactating women 

Afrin and Dana communities can be reasonably deemed to be safe and secure comparing to other sub-districts in Idleb governorate. Despite this, the security situation across Syria can be rapidly deteriorated as the incidents have proved over the last years. Generally speaking, the security situation was, still and will always be the main risk of which all humanitarian projects consider. For this reason, AHA will be assessing the security situation before and during the activities implementation to secure the safety of the field team, beneficiaries, suppliers and all other involved parties. The mitigation measures include the continuous evaluation of the security situation and avoid any potential risky incident. AHA has complete access in each sub-district enabling it to accomplish the proposed project especially if MoUs are signed with authorities. AHA has. For the association capacity, the field team in Syria has shown full capacity and implemented different types of activities and among them livestock activities which were all accomplished smoothly.</narrative>
