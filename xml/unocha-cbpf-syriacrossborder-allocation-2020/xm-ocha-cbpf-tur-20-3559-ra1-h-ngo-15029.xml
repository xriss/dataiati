  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project aims to provide secondary health care and surgical services, in Kafr Takharim sub-district and the random camps in the neighboring countryside, which are located in under-served area, whose people are suffering from the lack of medical services and are having difficult living conditions especially after the last escalation and the IDPs&#x2019; influx to more safe areas.
SEMA in coordination with SCHF tries to respond the critical needs of newly displaced population and to address the most urgent gaps by supporting Waseem Hsaino hospital, the two mobile clinics, and the ambulatory system.
Waseem Hsaino hospital is prioritized from the Health Directorate and the cluster&apos;s side, and it is now out of support for two months, as the last grant covering the hospital, through SCHF, has ended at 31 December 2019.
By supporting Waseem Hsaino hospital, a population of 150,000 including the most vulnerable groups (IDPs, women, children and the elderly) will have access to the following services: 
OPD (General, Orthopedic, and urology surgeries, in addition to internal, ENT and Dental clinics), emergency, IPD, surgical ward, lab, X-Ray, pharmacy, in addition to the ambulance system service through 3 ambulances.
The hospital is one of the largest hospitals in northern of Idleb, and provides its services to both host and IDPs. All introduced services are free and most of them are available 24 hours a day. The hospital serves about (7,000) patients on monthly basis, through outpatient clinics and emergency department. About 210 surgical (minor and major) operations per month.
The hospital has a capacity of 23 beds in the various departments, in addition to the pharmacy, laboratory and outpatient clinics.
The hospital is located in Kafar takharim sub-district in northern west of Idleb, which is considered relatively safe due to being near the Syrian-Turkish borders.
The project will also activate two mobile clinics in Salqin sub-district, as it is an effective way in the recent situation, to improve the access to quality health services in the camps, where more focus on the most vulnerable groups including pregnant and lactating women, neonates, children, elders, PWD and patient with chronic disease.
The mobile clinics will secure the health services to the increasing number of IDPs and will refer the needed cases to Waseem Hsaino hospital and the nearest PHCs supported by other partners.
SEMA is taking into consideration supporting the transportation of vulnerable beneficiaries in need of referral from locations covered by MCs to Wasim Hasino Hospital or any other nearest facility, using 3 ambulances related to the hospital and available under request.
Both hospital and MCs are fully accessible for people with disabilities and older people, as the building of the hospital is prepared with all the measures to facilitate the reception of these beneficiaries (Ramps, chair wheels..), in addition, mobile teams will assess the community through CHWs, and support PwDs and older people to get the healthcare services in place, or even benefit from referral and free transportation to health facilities
These clinics will provide outreach health activities to new IDPs through the community health workers who will coordinate and ensure full integrated geographic coverage of health services and referrals in priority location, in addition to introduce Mental Health and Psychosocial Services (MHPSS) at community through the PSSWs.
SEMA in line with the readiness and response plan priorities gaps and action, will stockpile, replenish medicine, and medical supplies to cope with further increased caseloads in the coming period.
Due to the very volatile environment, SEMA consider to be flexible in responding to the immediate and urgent needs on the ground, so a dynamic and strong risk management strategy and plan &quot;B&quot; is already set up (Attached) based on the security developments in the area.</narrative>
