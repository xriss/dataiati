  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project aims to continue to provide life-saving interventions for those most vulnerable and in need in Idleb Governorate by:

Provisioning essential comprehensive health care services by continuing of supporting Kelly health care center HeRAMS ID G0700008 in Kelly /Ma&apos;arrat Tammasrin sub-district /Idleb

The project is targeting 71195 people disaggregate as the following:
(Men 12225 / Women12355 /Boys 13701 /Girls 32914)
Host community (Men 1625 /Women 1642 /Boys 1821 /Girls 4375)
IDPs (Men 10600 /Women 10713 / Boys 11880 /Girls 28539)

Responding to Allocation Strategy (Continuity of essential life-saving services and efforts to ensure dignified living) and to 2020 HRP SO1.

The facility was already there and provided comprehensive health services before the Syrian crisis. It is now considered one of the most crucial facilities in NW Syria covering more than 100,000 people 
in an area crowded with IDPs and camps provides more than 350 consultations per day for children, women, men and elderly.

The facility provides gynecological services, 24Hr normal delivery, (more than 30 deliveries per month) treatment for diarrhea, respiratory tract infections and skin conditions for boys and girls under five, treatment for chronic conditions including hypertension, asthma, cardiac ailments, skin diseases, psychosocial support (PSS), and treatment of malnutrition among children and pregnant and lactating women.

The facility also comprises a pharmacy and an advanced diagnostic lab. 
To reduce the risk of spreading the COVID19 virus. We set up two tents outside the facility building to conduct triage for all incoming patients. Moreover, Infection prevention and control procedures are conducted by a dedicated and trained team in order to prevent or limit transmission in the health facility.

This project therefore aims to continue providing appropriate and impactful health services to address the urgent needs in the area.

Mercy-USA is seeking to ensure the continued operation of this health facility through:
 Sustained staffing, data management and reporting, finance, governance, training, monitoring, and oversight of project quality, and infrastructure maintenance support
 Provision of medical supplies (these supplies are intended to support the delivery of essential PHC services, RH service, essential NCD services, CD, and child health)

-We are working with Mentor Org to treat Leishmania and coordinating with EWARN to identify any outbreaks in the area
-We are coordinating with SIG (Syria immunization group) team to provide the needed vaccines for infants and pregnant women 
- Mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS) in the facility is already provided by SIMRO and Mercy-USA

Mercy-USA will apply the Essential health package to effectively and efficiently deliver comprehensive quality health services that are equitable, accessible, and sustainable. In addition, ensuring the timely delivery of cost-effective, integrated, and standardized health services tailored to meet the priority health issues faced by the majority of the population.

The quality and accountability will be monitored by Mercy-USA to ensure that the facility meets the standards furthermore, Mercy-USA will be responsible for all project reports to the donor and to the cluster (4Ws) and other related reports.
The project will be monitored by the program coordinator who will work directly from the Turkey office with the project manager and project officer to ensure the project is being correctly implemented.

Mercy-USA supply chain department in coordination with our team in Syria and turkey will ensure all needed medical equipment and operational supplies are delivered on time.

The Information Management Officer will work with data entries and our health team to produce monthly information on the progress of the program which includes caseload information desegregated cases/age, sex, gender, and disability.</narrative>
