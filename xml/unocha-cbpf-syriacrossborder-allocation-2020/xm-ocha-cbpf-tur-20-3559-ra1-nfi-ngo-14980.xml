   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Emergency Life-saving for the newly IDPs in the north Aleppo governorates by providing Multi-Purpose Cash Grants (MPGs)</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project aims to provide emergency assistance to recently displaced populations by providing Multi-Purpose Cash Grants (MPGs) to the most vulnerable HC and IDP families who displaced within the last few months due to the continuous violence in NW Syria, in 4 communities as follows:
-1500 in Afrin.
-1375 in Azaz.
-1000 in Mare&#x2019;.
- 500 in Al-Salamah.

The project is considered as a rapid response for those affected IDPs to help them cope with the harsh conditions and secure their needs in a dignified way, by distributing one-off cash grant with a total value of $120 per family (aligned with the cluster recommendations as CWG). The project and the grant amount were designed to allow the beneficiaries to cover their basic needs of NFIs (winterization, transport rent ..etc.) since this cash modality will give them flexibility in choosing items they need and to give the project an ability to meet all changes in beneficiary needs.
Through the proposed project, GAN seeks to target 4375 newly displaced families toward Aleppo governorate due to the last escalation in northern Syria as it is considered as a last resort for the population. The beneficiaries will be selected in close coordination with the local councils and civil authorities with 100 % verification from MampE team in the targeted areas based on the vulnerability and eligibility criteria including displacement duration criteria since the newly IDPs are the most vulnerable groups to the shocks, the project also will prioritize the women-headed households as well as the households with children, disabilities, pregnant, and lactating women.
GAN could cover as much as can of the geographical areas Aleppo governorate, such as Afrin, Janderis and Azaz districts that have overcrowded IDPs to reach 4375 vulnerable and newly IDP in urban, rural or even camps. Since GAN, through operation team on the ground and its prior experience in Aleppo governorate will be able to access the locations and markets during the project implementation.
Due to the lack of the banking system in northern Syria, GAN will identify the money transfer agents by conducting a competitive process after assessing the markets and the vendors&apos; capacities in the local markets. where the identified vendors will be responsible for delivering the MPG&apos;s amount to the beneficiaries in the different locations and the payment for agent will be conducted after finalizing the distribution of each few days which reduce the security risk in delivering the cash in such complex context, prior to the MPG distribution, a rapid market assessment in terms of availability of the items, prices, and the accessibility will be conducted to make sure the local markets are functioning and to ensure all beneficiaries have a good and equal accessibility to the different goods and services.
GAN will benefit from exchanging of experience through sharing the lessons learned and the solutions to overcome the challenges with SFNI cluster and CWG.

The selected modality aims to use e-cards instead of paper, beneficiary could access cash only however, GAN use e-voucher modality to essay and automate the distribution and strongly verify the beneficiaries&#x2019; ids at the distribution points, GAN could also monitor the project and outputs on time through web portal, fewer papers are used as the e-voucher system provides electronic signature, key steps:
- the system consists of three components: web portal, terminals (mobile, tabs &#x2026;etc.) and cards (either NFC cards that used for multiple distribution or plastic cards includes QR code for one-off distribution).
- when the final beneficiaries list is ready, GAN insert data to the system and print cards that include: beneficiary full name, location, complaint number amp some instructions.
- distribute cards to beneficiaries accompanied with term of use and service flyers.
- WhatsApp channel and/or Telegram will be created for each group of beneficiaries.
- redeem vouchers.</narrative>
