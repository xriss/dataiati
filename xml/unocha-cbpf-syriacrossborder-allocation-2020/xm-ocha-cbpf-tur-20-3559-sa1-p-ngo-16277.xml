  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed project will form a complementary part of HIHFAD on-going comprehensive supports to survivors of ERW and other conflict-related and nonrelated injuries  (mobile outreach service, fixed rehabilitation service, prosthetic service, inclusion mainstreaming and peers counselling) with multiple partners. In addition, the project emphasis on participation of the beneficiaries themselves and the community members to harness inclusive and protective environments in the target communities through establishment of community networks on inclusion and case management.

Building on HIHFAD&#x2019;s previous success in harnessing self-reliance and self-confidence among the most marginalized group, the proposed project aims at increasing self-resilience of the persons with disabilities and creating inclusive and protective environments through community and beneficiary participation. 
Through three inter-connected components
1) Benefiting and empowering people with amputations directly through prosthetic supports in Northwest Syria. 
2) Enhancing community-based inclusive approach and protection among the local communities and local NGOs through creating community inclusion networks.
3) Providing customized supports of their choices to the persons with functional disabilities through case managements 

1-Provison of 200 prosthesis in Albab city (8 months)
This project is a co-fund to operate Al Bab Center for additional 8 months between November 2020 and June 2021(the center is funded till Oct 2020 by HALO Trust)During 8 months, the center will install 200 prosthesis.
The beneficiaries will be selected from HIHFAD beneficiary list or through referral channels, after determining their ability to receive a prosthetic limb based on their K-level(a rating system used to indicate a person&apos;s rehabilitation potential).
The selected beneficiaries will undertake required physical rehabilitation at the HIHFAD rehabilitation centre prior to receiving prosthetics.
Transportation will be provided for the beneficiaries in need throughout the whole process.


2- Enhancing community-based inclusive approach (12 months)
The project will target 14 community, 1 inclusion network will be established in each community consisting of people with and without functional difficulties. They will first undertake inclusion training for themselves, and later, they will actively engage in planning and conducting of the following tasks:
- Plan and provide training and awareness sessions on inclusion of people with disabilities. 
- Identify and refer people with disabilities
- Become an agent of advocacy in their communities for rights of people with disabilities
-Plan and conduct community events of their choices.
In addition, the project will conduct evidence-collection activity to compile lessons learned from community-based inclusive approach.
3 - Case Management and Protection Assistance: 
300 beneficiaries and their families among the most vulnerable households will benefit through case management, offering PSS sessions, protection assistance, referrals, specialized service and access to socio-economic activities.
The beneficiaries can request their choices of supports, which will be assessed and verified by the committees (HIHFAD staff and community members). This could include items to immediately reduce constrains faced by the most vulnerable households or more resilience-focused choices such as skill training, livelihood kits accelerated education.  
An average value of 180USD per person will be allocated for multi-purpose assistance through case management.
