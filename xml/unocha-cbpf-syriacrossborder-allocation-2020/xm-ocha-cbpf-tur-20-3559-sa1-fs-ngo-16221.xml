   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed project will achieve two goals 1) Supporting the most vulnerable populations in Idleb and Mahmbal subdistricts in Idleb and Albab subdistrict in Aleppo, 2) Enhancing wheat value chain in two governorates (Idleb and Aleppo), and consequently enhancing food security in the target areas through inter-linked components. The project was built on achievements of the previous interventions of HIHFAD (irrigated farmland, a farmer association, agricultural inputs for the vulnerable households and free bread distributions) in the target areas.
4675 HHs (8,247 women, 7,461 men, 6,284 boys and 6,059 girls) will benefit from this project.

The project consists of five main components:
1) Supporting 400 vegetable farmers with the irrigation costs (Using of diesel vouchers modality), access to irrigation channels located in the Al-Rouge plain, an area of 2 Donums of vegetables agricultural land will be supported for each farmer in addition to do a light rehabilitation to 10 km of the water canals which serving a 800 hectares of agricultural lands in Alrouge plain area. The project engages cash for work scheme for the irrigation works.
2) Supporting the wheat value chain through purchasing wheat seeds from the local harvesting session, where the project is aiming to purchase 570 MT from 570 farmers (411 from Idleb and 159 from Aleppo).
3) Supporting 1800 farmers (1200 in Idleb and 600 in Aleppo) with agriculture inputs (wheat seeds purchased from the local farmers, fertilizer and pesticides) to support the wheat cultivation in the Al-Rouge plain in Idleb and Albab Subistrict in Aleppo.
4) Providing training on good agriculture practice, storing, marketing and strategic planning for 650 farmers and staff of the Water User Association in Al-Rouge plain in addition to members from the local entities at the area of Idleb and Aleppo as well.
5) Processing 150 MT of purchased wheat into 125 MT of wheat flour and distribute it as a fresh bread bundles over 2000 IDPs in camps for 3 months of distribution 26 days per month via contracting local bakeries.
GAP sessions will train BNs regarding the appropriate and recommended dosage and amount of pesticide and fertilizer to make sure they have good results and benefits of them and decrease the negative impact on the environment.
The proposed integrated activities and cash for work scheme may enhance a feeling of inequality and discrimination among different segments of the target communities. In order to avoid an escalation of any tensions and to enhance social cohesion, the project will clearly inform the selection criteria to the target communities, and let the communities understand that the vulnerable households are prioritized through the project, not only land owners. 
The worker in all of CFW activities will be selected from the IDPs and HC in coordination with the field local authorities via public registration and according to specific criteria: 
-Households with member/s with disabilities

-Host families who are hosting IDPs
also HIHFAD will build on the already existing beneficiary committee in Al Rouge plain and the agriculture offices in Albab Local council, where HIHFAD will make sure that it includes people from the host community and the IDPs in addition to women in order to reach all groups in the targeted, where the selection criteria for the farmers will be:
1. Full access to land
