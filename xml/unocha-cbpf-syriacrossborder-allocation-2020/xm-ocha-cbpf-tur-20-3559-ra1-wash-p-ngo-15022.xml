This project will provide a package of integrated Protection and WASH services in 47 communities and their surrounding informal camps (46 camps) distributed across the following sub-districts: Armanaz, Kafr Takharim, Idleb, and Maaret Tamsrin, in Harim and Idleb districts. 

Comprehensive Emergency WASH services will be provided in 46 informal camps ( established recently, during Dec 2019, January 2020) in Armanaz, Kafr Takharim, and Harim sub-districts, to offer access to WASH services for a total of 20,335 new IDP and HC individuals. The following WASH services will be provided:

a) Providing potable water to cover the needs of the 46 camps. A total of 20,335 individuals (3,340 HHs) will receive on average 30 liters per capita on daily basis through water trucks. 
b) Installment of 280 water tanks, the capacity of each is one m3, in the targeted camps.
