  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">&#xF0D8;	Based on community participation and AAP, the project is designed based on the following: 
Increasing the food security and enhancing the livelihoods of IDPs and host communities in Idleb Governorate (Salqin sub-district) through supporting the olive value chain as follows:
	1000 HHs (100% host communities) in Azmarin, Eskat, Tellemar, Kafr Hind, Ein Elbikara, Foziyeh, Saidiyeh, Kafarna, Abu Talha and Big Hir Jamus will receive agriculture inputs vouchers to enable them to care for and service 3000 dunum of olive trees as total(3 dunum each farmer). In addition, ATAA will support the marketing of olive oil through the purchase of 2000 cans of olive oil from the project beneficiaries.
	300 HHs (100%IDPs) in the same regions will benefit from cash for work for olive harvest and pruning.
	2000 families of IDPs will be supported through the distribution of one olive oil cans (16 KG) each family for one time in the project regions.
Key interventions will include: 
	Provision vouchers to buy agricultural inputs, accompanied by related extension services.
	Capacity building targeting farmers and local community members.
	Support the IDPs by creating job opportunities in harvesting and pruning olive trees.
	Support olive oil marketing by purchasing olive oil from beneficiaries to help farmers to market their products.
	Distribution of olive oil cans to vulnerable IDPs in the project areas. 
	Follow-up the project with the integrated management of olive tree service.
&#xF0D8;	ATAA is planning to implement the project by providing 1 type of compound fertilizer voucher,2 types of pesticide vouchers, 1 fuel vouchers, olive oil press voucher, as well as support olive oil marketing to:
1000 HHs for olive farmers, in addition, ATAA will provide job opportunities in the olive harvest and pruning for 300 HHs from IDPs in the ten target villages in Salqin sub-district as follows: 3331 female and 3169 males, planed 1394  men,1466 women, 1866 girls, and 1774 boys (the women and men farmers and their children).

&#xF0D8;	ATTA will hold awareness sessions with the traders and all beneficiaries to explain the voucher redeeming mechanisms make them aware of the list of authorized agricultural inputs.
&#xF0D8;	ATAA will also establish a complaint mechanism (hotline), and a participatory monitoring system through working with local authorities, and beneficiary representatives. Depending upon the good relationship and reputation that ATAA has established through the distribution of food aid in the regions, all these measures will mitigate the risks of fraud and assure that gender sensitivity is taken into consideration. Any complaint related to abuse by any humanitarian worker will result in strict measures being taken.

	Large families (more than 5).
	Families with disabled members.
	Families with low income (less than 50 USD)
