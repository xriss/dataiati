   <narrative xml:lang="EN">A multisectoral integrated approach to respond to the immediate needs of the recent crises affected groups through provision of Relocation support to safe areas and the provision of MPGs to cover the various urgent needs of newly IDPs</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The 7-months project at hand aims to provide Protection and SNFI support to the crises affected groups through the following activities:
1. &#x64D;Scaling up Violet&apos;s ongoing voluntary relocation for thus who don&apos;t have the capability to relocate (such as women-headed HHs, PWD, unaccompanied children, elderlies and people with medical emergency cases) from the areas at high risk to safe areas through the provision of transportation services either to the collective and reception centers or to the other areas based on the BNFs preferences, aiming at saving their lives. please refer to the eligibility and vulnerability criteria in the annex. Violet will ensure protection, PSEAH and DNH principles are mainstreamed in the project. the DNH will be mainstreamed through avoiding causing the extra panic among the community members and rushing others to evacuate. Therefore, Violet won&apos;t relocate the people who are requesting relocation, unless the displacement form the area starts and there are clear triggers the area will be affected. while relocating people, Violet will ensure the CP is mainstreamed in the project through maintaining social cohesion and family unity as much as possible to mitigate the family separation taking into account prioritizing the unaccompanied children. As for PSEAH, Violet will train the project team and volunteers on PSEAH and make sure they sign PSEAH policy to ensure accountability to the PSEAH measures and principles through including them in the staff contracts. Moreover, Violet had recruited 2 PSEAH focal points who is responsible for receiving the PSEAH related complaints and report the identified cases to the protection coordinator in order to take the necessary measures according to Violet&apos;s PSEAH policy. Violet will incorporate PSEAH among the community members and ensure they have equal access to Violet&apos;s accountability mechanism including the PSEAH dedicated email to report complaints. To provide a comprehensive and integrated approach, Violet will contribute to the project by allocating ambulances and medical teams to accompany the evacuees in order to ensure a smooth relocation. Moreover, the referral mechanisms for medical emergencies and unaccompanied children will be activated. To ensure the safety of the BNFs, Violet will assess the intended routes and use the routes which have indicated as safe according to the recommendation from the safety and security department
The voluntariness of movement will be ensured by transporting people upon their request through the hotline initiative and getting their signatures on the consents.
2. One-off MPGs distribution (120$ / HHs) in accordance with SNFI cluster recommendation to newly IDPs HHs in the areas with the highest IDP influx to contribute to covering the various needs of new IDPs like transport, rent, and NFIs through helping the newly IDP coping with the displacement conditions and secure their Basic needs in a flexible and dignified way. BNFs will be selected in coordination with the local councils based on the selection criteria including displacement duration. A special focus will be given to women-headed HHs, HHs with children, elderly, PWDs, pregnant, and lactating women. The cash will be transferred to Syria through PTT and the MPGs will be distributed through MTA to BNFs in their locations. Although the FWA will end by the end of Mar 20, VIolet is in the process of announcing a new FWA tender for MTA services to ensure continuous service and timely response
since the proposed project is multi-sectoral under the and SNFI and protection sectors and due to the difficulty to expect the areas where the safe relocation activity will be needed, Violet requested and got the OCHA approval for an exception to target the people on a district level to ensure the flexible and timely response. However, Violet will ensure close coordination with clusters and active actors before distribution to avoid any overlap</narrative>
