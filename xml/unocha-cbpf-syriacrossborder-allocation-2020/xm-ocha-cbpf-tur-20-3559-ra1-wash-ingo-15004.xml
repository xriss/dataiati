   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Emergency assistance to newly displaced populations from southern Idleb and western Aleppo governorates through the provision of safe reception centres and shelters in and out of camps</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Aligned with the Syria HRP 2019 first objective, the project aims to provide life-saving humanitarian assistance to the most vulnerable people affected by the escalation of violence in southern Idleb and western countryside of Aleppo, since 1 December 2019. According to UN reports, almost 520,000 people have been displaced, 80% whom are of women and children. Due to the ongoing military operations, these figures are expected to increase. Out of this, almost 62,730 individuals (or 10,455 households), have been displaced in Azaz district (based on the inter-agency update of 10 February 2020). In line with the ASO2, the action will provide safe reception centres and shelters in and out of camps in as part of SI&#x2019;s WASH response strategy in North West Syria (NWS). The needs-evidence based response strategy is built on the following key activities:
- provision of lifesaving emergency water supply by water trucking 
- distribution and installation of communal water tanks for domestic use and hygiene behaviours and
- hygiene promotion awareness campaigns iv) installation of segregated sanitation facilities (emergency latrines).

The action will target Azaz District focusing on Azaz, Akhtrein, Mare&apos; and Suran sub districts to reach informal settlements requested by local councils for humanitarian assistance to be targeted.SI will provide the &#x2018;full WASH package&#x2019; of activities to 15 informal settlements (ISs) in these sub-districts. Of these 15 ISs, 4 are located in existing buildings (school, hospital, market and reception centre), and SI&#x2019;s sanitation activity will be on maintenance rather than installation. 6,513 beneficiaries (approximately 3,322 women and 3,191 men) will benefit from these activities in the 15 ISs.

SI is recognized as one of the main WASH actors in Azaz district, justified by its long term presence in the area, over the past 7 years, and its demonstrated rapid response and contingency capacity. SI&#x2019;s technical expertise in targeted sector is coupled by an in-depth knowledge of targeted area (needs, social and cultural dynamics, lessons learnt etc.), excellent relationships with local authorities and other humanitarian actors, as well as by strong operational capacities in HR (with almost 70 staff) and logistic structures, such as existing framework agreements for emergency WASH activities.

SI currently has an ongoing project under the Syria Cross border Humanitarian Fund (TUR-19/3559/SA2/WASH/INGO/14416), but this project has no overlap in term of locations or affected persons as this proposed action. SI will also coordinate with WASH Cluster to avoid any overlap with other organizations.

SI anticipates to receive funding from OFDA from April/May 2020 to cover emergency WASH needs in Azaz. As such, the overall response under this SCHF grant is to (1) urgently response to emergency WASH needs in its targeted sub-districts (2) cover any gaps in SI&#x2019;s response plan during this negotiation period with OFDA. SI plans for these two grants to run in complement for 2-3 months to ensure that the most urgent and high priority needs are well covered through SI&#x2019;s response. Once the 1st Reserve Allocation implementation period ends, SI will continue its response through this OFDA grant.

The added value is that it allows SI to provide its holistic WASH response (water supply, sanitation and hygiene) to targeted location as part of its lifesaving emergency programming albeit for the limited time of four months due to the budgetary constraints. At the end of the project, SI will plan for the handover of activities to the local authorities, other WASH actors or the WASH Cluster, or for the continuation of activities under other funding if an emergency response is still required.
