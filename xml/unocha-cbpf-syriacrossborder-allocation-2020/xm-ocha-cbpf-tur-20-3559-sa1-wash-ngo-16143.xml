  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project is designed to respond to the WASH needs of 166592 people (Men: 27765, Women: 28321, Girls: 54975, Boys: 55531),(140876 IDPs and 25716 hosted people) with 1421 people  of them are people with disabilities, to respond to their protracted needs  by ensuring the good access to the  sanitation service 
The men, women, boys, and girls in Dana city are suffering from the poor sanitation infrastructure in the city since the sewage network is covering only 50 &#x2013; 60 % of the city and it was prepared to serve this small city with a maximum capacity of 16751 people while the  city and due to the ongoing crisis witnessed large displacement waves and the number of IDPs touched more than 140,000 IDPs which consist more than 85 % of the population of Dana 
These terrible figures increased the suffering of the people and the pressure on the already weak  infrastructure and made from Dana city one of the most affected areas of Leishmania in northern Syria according to the information of the EWARN and the statement of the medical centers in the area in addition to the notable flood of the wastewater in the public street in all the seasons and especially in the winter which is damaging any humanitarian efforts to respond to the Leishmania cases since the main cause of the problem will remain, and the treatment solutions are useless as long
The spreading of Leishmania  is not caused by the poor sewage infrastructure only but also it is by the inability of the local council to put well solid waste management in place and this is another factor can increase the threat on the vulnerable people 
SECD is aiming to solve this long-known problem in the city by undertaking the rehabilitation of the sewage network in the city and supporting the local council to activate good solid waste management which is protecting the people from the expected flood in winter, reducing and eliminating the Leishmania causes and protecting the groundwater from the pollution which considered the main resource of the drinkable water in the city 
During the project SECD will conduct the following activities:
1-Rehabilitation of the sewer system which includes but not limited to Rehabilitation and extending of Sewer system network (HDPE 30cm diameter ):1770m, - (HDPE 40cm diameter ):1330m,- (HDPE100 cm diameter ):4393m, and Conducting about 70 manholes. 
3- undertake Fast and light rehabilitation of the solid waste landfill.
4-Rehabilitation and or /providing of the solid waste truck.
5-Support SWM unit with salaries and fuel for 5 months, and Uniform for the workers, masks, gloves to protect the workers of coronavirus-2019 with ensuring the application of cost recovery system for this activity in the future to achieve the sustainability in this service with Conducting solid waste campaigns to encourage people to participate in this humanitarian effort 
7-Conducting hygiene promotion campaigns.
8-Distribution of 3000 hygiene kits (two rounds) for new IDPs  which did not receive hygiene kits during the last three months .

SECD will be in close position with the local council,  the beneficiaries, the IDPs and the host community and will involve them in all the project stages from the planning till the closure of the project to adhere to the community engagement approach by inviting them to regular FGDs and open all the channels to receive their feedback, complaints, and opinions.
the proposed project ensure that the sanitation service would be provided to 7 schools, 4 hospitals, 2 children friendly center,2 Women empowerment centers, and 7 public bakeries.
Moreover, 264792 people (188084 IDPs, 76708 Hosted people ) living in (Termanin, Tal Elkaramej, Burdaqly, Sarmada, Hezreh - Hezri, Tilaada, and Dier Hassan) could be considered as indirect beneficiaries since they will benefit from the project because the main outlet sewer of these communities discharged to the main sewer of Dana city which SECD will rehabilitate and replace it</narrative>
