   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Integrated Emergency Response to the Newly IDPs through Improving the accessibility and the drainage systems in North West Syria</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Maram aims through this project to rehabilitate the infrastructure in the targeted camps where new IDPs have accommodated by rehabilitating the campgrounds and areas surrounding the tents, building drainage systems, providing ground tents insulation, and providing ramps to ease the mobility of elderly people and people with disabilities.
These rehabilitation activities will facilitate the IDPs&apos; access to basic services including water, protect them and their property from the impact of any potential flooding, and will ensure them an appropriate and decent living environment in which the effects of rainwater and mud are minimized.
For Maram&#x2019;s technical capabilities Maram started implementing a similar project in July 2019 in 28 camps, and completed 90% of the project activities, the project is funded by HF and will be ended at the end of February 2020. Further info could be found in the annex of past experience
The project aims also to utilize Maram&#x2019;s extensive CCCM expertise to improve the quality of camp management and promote the community participation in the targeted sites. Maram will support the formation of community committees in the camps as per clear ToRs, these committees will represent all camp residents including the most vulnerable groups such as women, children, the elderly and people with disabilities. The camp committees would have substantial roles in planning, programming, monitoring and evaluating service provisions in the camps, in addition to channeling daily challenges to camps management and facilitating smooth resolving of any potential disputes within the camps.
Moreover, Maram will build the capacity of camp management and community committee members through a set of training provided by Maram staff related to the basics of camp management, humanitarian principles, facilitating the delivery of services to the camp population through organized registration of IDPs and establishing effective communication with relative stakeholders. An important part of the training will be technical training related to the technical project activities to enable the camp management and committee members to take care of the outputs of the activities after Maram completes them and withdraws from the camps.
Maram&#x2019;s extended CCCM experience is currently demonstrated by the ongoing management of Maaret Alikhwan Planned Camp which is one of the largest Planned Camps in NW Syria. Further info could be found in the annex of past experience. 
This project will support the SNFI and CCCM clusters response to the immediate needs of the most vulnerable IDPs at Idleb and Aleppo by facilitation their access to protection and mainstreamed multi-sectoral lifesaving assistance in their sought shelters, in line with the Allocation Strategic Objective (ASO) 2: Provision of safe reception centers and shelters in and out of camps.
Maram conducted a rapid needs assessment during the month of February 2020, and the assessment showed the critical need to carry out the mentioned activities in 16 IDPs sites 14 sites in Idleb and 2 sites in Aleppo.
The total number of targeted beneficiaries is 3508 households17,756 IDPs 4,272 men, 4,855women, 3,759boys, 4,870 girls. Of the total number of beneficiaries 27% are women, 49% are children.
The Identification of target beneficiaries will be decided by baseline assessment that Maram will conduct at the onset of the project to verify and confirm the needs reflected in the pre-mentioned rapid assessment and will be complemented by the ongoing vulnerability assessments and verification in the target IDPs sites for any potential new displaced families.
Priority will be given in providing services to beneficiaries according to the vulnerability assessment with highlight on pregnant and lactating women, widows, children and PLWD.
Maram obtained all consents to fulfill the HLP due diligence to ensure smooth implementation of the project activities and that IDPs are not evicted or taken advantage</narrative>
