  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The people in NWS are facing a massive displacement wave, the statistics of OCHA is mentioning that more than 800,000 people have been displaced from their homes to search for a safer place to their lives  Women, children, people with disabilities are the most vulnerable age groups that are at risk related to the inability to access the life-saving needs, not to mention the need to secure an adequate shelter.
Adequate shelter is the main concern for those IDPs, it goes without saying that the areas that receive this displacements are currently missing the adequate shelters due to the current high number of IDPs in it, also these areas are rural areas and the number of the buildings that can receive the IDPs is very limited These factors forced the IDPs to reside in self-established camps in a situation that disable them to ensure the basic needs and this was a burden on the humanitarian responsibilities to ensure providing assistance in an effective manner. 
SECD  aims to support 10678 person (3060 in the camp and 7618 person in Merimin (4589 of them are new IDPs and the others are vulnerable host community) identified a suitable place to ensure a cost-effective, sustainable intervention by establishing an environmental-friendly planned camp (No septic tanks &#x2013; Trees conservation &#x2013; using the solar power) which ensures the dignity, protection and the access to the basic needs 
The proposed land is characterized by many factors that support the establishment of the camp: 
-The location is public land, in a safe area, away from the military actions and near to the Turkish borders 
-The land is located within a picturesque natural environment, which gave Psychological comfort and the possibility of recovering from the difficult conditions that faced them.
-The host people are hospitalized and cooperative and are facing difficulty to deal with the major displacements. 
-The proposed land is near to five communities (Qirmida-Matleh-Mreimin-Alshamra-Alfauri) which enable the IDPs to access to the local market, public facilities and schools easily and gave them the opportunity to find the livelihoods which are an important factor for improving their living conditions.
The nearest community to the location is Mreimin, is hosting more than  4589 new IDPs, these high number is a burden on the local council and it is critical to ensure the access to water for those people since there is a gap in this, the intervention will focus on guaranteeing the social cohesion by supporting the community and provide the cost-effective solution for delivering the water through the network for both the camp and the community.
The intervention will be implemented as an emergency response, the priority will be given to accelerate the implementation with ensuring the quality response to support the people as quickly as possible with adhering the respective standards of CCCM cluster and SPHERE in all the activities which are:
