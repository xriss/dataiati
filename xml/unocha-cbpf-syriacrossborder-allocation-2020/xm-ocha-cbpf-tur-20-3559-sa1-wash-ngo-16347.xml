   <narrative xml:lang="EN">To improve the living conditions of vulnerable conflict-affected households and emphasize on the prevention measure to COVID 19, Saed Charity in partnership with Minber Alsham are planning to respond to 46,187 (out of which 16,426 Men, 17,519 Female, 6,046 Boys, 6,196 girls, and 412 PwD) IDPs in 20 camps and Kaften community to ensure an improved, sustainable access to WASH services and supplies.
In parallel to the WASH cluster strategy in the allocation paper, the aim is to reduce the huge reliance on the costly non-sustainable direct provision water trucking, desludging, etc. towards a more cost-effective cheaper and more efficient response, this is planned to be achieved through connecting the targeted camps and informal settlement to existing nearby water and sanitation system. Furthermore, through this project, SAED and Minber Alsham are aiming to ensure improved access of host communities and IDPs in Kaften community through rehabilitation and operational support for the water system.
The water system will be operationalized and maintained by both SAED and Minber Alsham for a period of 10 months for camps and five for Kaften.
As the number of IDPs and locations planned are high, SAED and Minber Alsham decided to partner together to ensure a better quality response, output and outcome, relying on the very good WASH knowledge and experience of both agencies taking into account that both SAED and Minber AlSham implemented a successful project together and managed to benefit from previous lessons learnt. 
During the design phase of the project, both SAED and Minber AlSham kept in mind any future influx of IDPs into the proposed locations, in a summary, we will be able to respond to any increase in numbers. If any gaps arise, SAED will officially inform the WASH cluster to assist and coordinate with other actors in the field to fill the gaps.
On average 30-35 ltp/d/ will be provided while during Summer season (July, August, and September) as recommended by the WASH Cluster, IDPs will have access up to 40 lt/p/d.

SAED will target 9 camps with a total population of 17,590 IDPs. While Minber AlSham will target 11 camps with a total population of 24,022 through the following activities:
	Rehabilitation and operational cost of four water systems
	Installing and extending water and sanitation network to the camps.
	Constructing high elevated tanks and rely on gravity distribution to the water points inside camps.
	Connecting existing sanitation facilities to installed water networks.
	Hygiene promotion campaigns (following COVID 19 WASH and health clusters recommendation including physical distancing through a mass media campaigns, street panels, WhatsApp sharing methods, etc. will be installed and shared in the premises of the camps as well as the community.
	Distribution of soap and cloth detergents

15 camps out of the 20 targeted already include an agency who are providing some activities. Therefore, this project proposal does not include a comprehensive package as some activities are covered by other agencies. All activities have been coordinated with present agencies to ensure complementarity and avoid overlaps.

In addition, Minber AlSham will target Kaften community (4,575 people) with rehabilitation and maintenance of the water station and water network in addition to degraded operational cost for 5 months in order to implement a proper cost recovery and tariff system. (Minber AlSham will work closely with the local council and beneficiaries to include them in the design and planning phase of set up. In addition, proper capacity building will take place for stakeholders involved in the tariff system to ensure better managing of resources and water system.</narrative>
