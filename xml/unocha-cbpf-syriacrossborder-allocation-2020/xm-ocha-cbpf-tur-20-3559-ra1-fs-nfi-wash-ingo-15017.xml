   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Strengthening the resilience of the displaced people in A&apos;zaz via multi-purpose voucher</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project will be directly implemented by German INGO Deutsche e.V Welthungerhilfe (WHH). This project aims to respond to the needs of conflict-affected newly IDPs by providing live-saving assistance through multi-purpose voucher to cover the basic needs of IDP households in A&apos;zaz. Then, beneficiaries will be able to redeem/exchange their vouchers from any contracted vendors. Each family will receive voucher worth of 120 USD for covering monthly basic needs in food, hygiene and non-food items. The project aims to cover the basic needs of recently displaced people from NW Syria in camps/ off camps through multi-purpose voucher modality which offers flexibility and freedom of choice while restoring some dignity and are less stigmatizing than the assistance through in kind assistance. The project shall primarily prioritize IDPs who have arrived in A&#x2019;zaz in and off camps within the last two months and along with ones who are already camp residents and have not received any humanitarian assistance over the last six months. Targeted Household (HHs) will be able to redeem food, hygiene, non-food items from the contracted vendors/shops. Each targeted HH will receive 120 $ worth of voucher per month for a duration three months period. The distribution of the voucher will be done in three rounds and the vouchers will be divided into 4 papers (30 $ per paper) by aiming to offer people a maximum degree of choice and flexibility to choose different vendors on different time to redeem items based on their preference. WHH shall be communicating with all related UN Clusters (FSL, WASH, SNFI) to ensure proper coordination and update about the activity. Additionally, the proposed project will support people to increase their income by enabling them to save up and use it in other economic activities. As this project also aims to enhance the resilience of the targeted HHs, the negative coping strategies will be mitigated. In total, 1,000 HHs will benefit from the activity. Since the activity only targets the IDPs with specific criteria in/off camps, WHH field team will clearly explain the criteria and the activity to non-BNFs, as well.The initial assessments and previous experience of WHH indicate that there is a functioning market in the area. In general, the roads are open and there is no problem of providing basic items. Hence, vendors/shops as one of the main stakeholders of the project will be selected following the vendor assessment which will be based on their proximity to the settlements, their supply capacity and price of items. Afterwards, the contract which explains both WHH and vendor&#x2019;s responsibilities clearly will be jointly signed. Thus, the targeted people can easily access to vendors/shops within the proximity to their settlements.The specific location and camps will be agreed on in a coordination with relevant clusters, AFAD and local authorities in order to avoid possible duplication. The reason of preferring to target newly arrived IDPs in/off camps is that the camps and the settlements are overloaded and residents of these settings lacking financial inputs, are in urgent need of basic life-saving goods and services especially after the recent influx of displacements. WHH has valuable gained experience in the field of voucher modality in North-West Syria by both doing self-implementation and remote management via implementing partners.  
Initially, we shall exert best effort to adapt the tools based on the needs of the targeted people. We rather accept inclusion errors rather than having exclusion errors We shall be cautious to avoid creating stigma and discrimination. Direct contact with the affected groups in the community  shall be developed. The registration process in camps shall be really problematic. Lists from local authorities and community generated household lists shall be used for independent and impartial assessment. It will be encouraged the involvement of affecting in designing the registration.</narrative>
