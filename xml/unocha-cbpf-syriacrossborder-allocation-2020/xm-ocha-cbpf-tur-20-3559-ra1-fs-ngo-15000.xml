   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Food and Cash Emergency Response for IDPs in Northwest Syria</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">IYD has been working inside Syria since 2013 in different sectors and mainly in Food Security and Livelihoods. This experience has given IYD the opportunity to build good relationships and network based on trust and transparency with both the local authorities and beneficiaries.  Being an active member of FSL cluster gave IYD a comprehensive understanding of the humanitarian situation in northwestern Syria, especially the food security issue. In addition, IYD has been WFP partner for five years. In 2020, IYD is distributing 38,465 food baskets on a monthly basis for people in Sarmada and Deir Hasan clusters (Idleb- Harim district- Dana sub-district). Besides, IYD recently distributed approximately 10,000 RTEs in Dana subdistrict. From another hand, IYD is currently distributing cash for food for 2,000 families in Aleppo governorate, Al-Bab district. An amount of $ 55 is being distributed for 2000 HHs for 11 months. 

Having extensive experience in the food and cash distribution, trained staff in northwest Syria,  good relationships with local communities, IYD will contribute to alleviating the suffering of those affected who fled their homes due to the recent military actions in the northwest.  
During the ongoing regular food distribution in Sarmada and Deir Hassan clusters (Dana sub-district), IYD realized the huge needs of food. According to the needs assessment conducted by IYD field team, more than 100,000 IDPs settled in IYD&#x2019;s area of implementation. On the other side, IYD team conducted a rapid needs assessment in Afrin district to assess the needs for food since this area is considered among the highest needs (FSL gab analysis report 05/02/2020).

IYD, throughout this proposed project, is looking forward to meeting the food needs where many vulnerable families are either receiving inadequate food assistance or not receiving at all. IYD has coordinated with WFP, FSL cluster, TAS, Shafak, Atta, and Mercy USA organizations to avoid overlapping and increase knowledge sharing. Thus, IYD will implement the following activities:

-	Distribute 1,000 regular food baskets on monthly basis for five rounds to the new IDPs who arrived to Sarmada and Dier Hassan camps-  2,250 males, 2,750 females, and 250 PWDs will be targeted in this activity. This activity will complement the ongoing project with WFP, IYD will target the newly displaced people who decided to stay in Deir-Hassan and Sarmada clusters.

-	Distribute 1,000 Ready to eat rations RTEs ( one-off) for the new IDPs (during the first days of their displacement). This stock will be stored to respond quickly to the potential waves of displacement. 2,250 males, 2,750 females, and 250 PWDs will be targeted in this activity. 
The above two activities will be conducted in Idleb, Harim district, Dana subdistrict- Sarmada and Deir Hasan clusters.

Finally, within the period of five months,  IYD will distribute five rounds of cash for food for 1,000 HHs who recently displaced to Aleppo, Afrin district, Sharan and Bulbul subdistrict. Per CWG recommendation, an amount of $ 60 will be distributed cash through Hawala agency. 2,250 males, 2,750 females, and 250 PWDs will be targeted in this activity.
According to the gap analysis announced by FSL cluster during February 2020. Afrin districts are among the top areas where IDPs headed to. To make sure that people will most likely purchase food, IYD conducted market assessment and made sure that there is enough food in the markets nearby the IDPs locations. To mitigate the risk of transfer money to Syria and within Syria, IYD will use PTT system to transfer money to Syria and use a service provider to distribute cash to IDPs. It is worth to mention that IYD has a dedicated financial system with its related tools to manage cash projects. For cash distribution, IYD developed standard operating procedure SOP, which is attached to this project.</narrative>
