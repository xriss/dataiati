  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project will provide minimum basic repairs for 700 shelter units (Grade 1) of the most vulnerable new IDPs (including 1086 men, 1255 women, 878 boys, 964 girls) through repairs the existing substandard structures with same type of windows and/or doors, closing holes in wall with similar material and basic repair to WASH facilities, in six communities in the sub-districts of Afrin and Sharan, Aleppo governorate. The project rationale is based on the needs assessment of SRD conducted in Feb 2020 (Attachment.1), as will be highlighted in the context and funding section below.
An integrated protection intervention with shelter team consists of the provision of specialized and emergency community-based protection services for beneficiaries through case management services, individual Protection Assistance (IPA), structured psychosocial support (PSS), referrals. 
The nearest community centers&#x2019; activities will be integrated with the shelter activities to reach the same vulnerable groups of persons with disabilities (PWD), elderly and female-headed household (FHH), and child-headed households (CHH) to achieve comprehensive benefits of shelter, protection, and consolidated referral services in Afrin District.    
Given SRD currently operates one Women and Girls Safe space located in Kelly, Idleb and two mobile emergency protection teams in Atmeh and  Qah (supported WVI until 30 April 2020) and through this project, SRD will continue supporting Kelly WGSS and provide integrated protection activities within the protection pre-existed system, responding through a case management approach and a solid referral pathway. A holistic and intensive model of case management inc. case management case fund will be utilized to enhance the resilience of most vulnerable women and girls. 
The protection outreach team reaching a target of 16,474 individuals (2,484 men, 7,841 women, 2,554 boys, 3,595 girls) and addressing vulnerabilities that are related to PWDs, elderly, men, women, boys and girls with high risks identified in each targeted community.
The mechanism of the integrated approach will be utilized during the project the implementation of the project activities as follows:
SRD shelter teams will responsible for conducting the technical assessment and prepare the Bill of Quantity (BoQ) for each shelter unit occupied by new IDPs, in the same time, the Contractors (who will be identified by Framework Agreement modality) will be repairing the shelters that technically assessed to save the time so the shelter team will work in parallel with the contractors. Shelter teams will visit the shelter units during the implementation of repairs to prepare the Works Progress Reports and quality assurance.
During the same time, SRD protection teams will ensure that all vulnerable groups are involved in project activities, and will train the shelter teams on detection of vulnerability cases, and accompany the shelter teams during the door to door verification visits to the beneficiaries&apos; shelters to identify protection cases and refer them to SRD community centers to respond. In addition, protection teams will ensure that technical assessments conducted by shelter teams meet the demand of persons with disabilities and the elderly, as well as conducting training and awareness sessions throughout the life of the project at several levels, that will have targeted the local councils, contractors, construction workers, and beneficiaries.
During the life of the project, the protection technical coordinator and manager in Syria and Turkey will train, mentor and supervise the field protection teams using IASC supervision tool to implement their work plans effectively. In addition, The mobile emergency teams will refer and support reaching the most at-risk cases received to the near identified SRD&apos;s centers and other NGOs, that these cases need services to give them priority of selection from services of this project.</narrative>
