  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project aims to replenish the Shelter and Non-Food Items (S/NFI) Cluster emergency pipeline stock with 8,000 full NFI kits and 5,000 tents targeting approximately 40,000 unique individuals (8,000 men, 8,000 women, 12,000 boys, 12,000 girls). The project will also provide emergency WASH services to an estimated 20,123 individuals (4,079 men, 4,899 women, 5,528 boys, 5,617 girls). In total, IOM will assist an estimated 60,123 unique individuals. 

The content of the full NFI kits will be based on the standard NFI kit (according to the S/NFI Guidelines) and the kits will be rapidly procured and initially stored in the IOM Gaziantep warehouse for S/NFI Cluster operational preparedness and response. A limited number of kits will also be stored in implementing partners&#x2019; warehouses in north-west Syria. As agreed with SCHF and the Clusters, IOM will procure tents with specifications outlined by the Turkish Red Crescent (TRC). At the onset of a crisis that requires the release of NFIs and tents, IOM will coordinate with the SNFI/CCCM Cluster Review Board for the coverage of households affected in locations where Cluster partners already operate. IOM&#x2019;s release of the items to the Cluster partners will be upon receipt of needs assessments, distribution plans, and verification and approval of the Clusters (based on the priority areas and 4Ws etc.). The IPs will distribute tents and NFI kits to the most vulnerable affected populations based on IOM&#x2019;s vulnerability scoring criteria. Through various monitoring mechanisms and tools such as Third-Party Monitoring (TPM), Commodity Tracking System (CTS), electronic monitoring and more, proper monitoring of the distributions will be ensured. 

IOM will ensure that IPs give priority to those most in need including female-headed households, people with disabilities, children, and other vulnerable groups based on a scoring on the beneficiary list provided by the IP. Through its accountability to affected populations (AAP) mechanisms, including Whatsapp hotlines and PSEA materials, the project will prioritize transparency and accountability to vulnerable beneficiaries. Also, to mitigate Gender Based Violence (GBV) risks, IOM ensures that information provision and feedback mechanisms are designed to be accessible, effective, and confidential and respond to complaints, regardless of whether corrective measures can immediately be put in place.

Further, the project will ensure continuation of WASH services delivery in 10 IDP sites in Idleb and Aleppo governorates. IOM has conducted a detailed needs assessment in January 2020 in these sites and identified 20,123 individuals in need of continuation of WASH services. These sites are currently supported by IOM (through implementing partner WATAN Foundation) under existing HF funding &#x201C;TUR-19/3559/RA2/NFI-CCM-WASH/UN/13735&#x201D;. As the on-going project ends on 31 March 2020, IOM will ensure that the life-saving emergency WASH services will continue to serve individuals for an additional six months. The caseload across these sites has considerably increased since December 2019. As such, an additional 10,125 newly displaced IDPs will benefit from the continued emergency WASH services under this project. With special considerations for improving access to persons with disabilities, the services include daily provision of safe drinking water from trucks for five months, installation of communal water points, rehabilitation/ construction of emergency latrine cells/stances, regular desludging of latrines, solid waste management through installation of garbage containers and final disposal. IOM will mitigate risks of GBV through the installation of locks and lights in latrines. The project will include the procurement and distribution of needed WASH NFIs (hygiene kits) and hygiene promotion through targeted awareness-raising sessions, which will also be conducted during the distributions. IOM&apos;s third-party engineers will regularly monitor the activities.</narrative>
