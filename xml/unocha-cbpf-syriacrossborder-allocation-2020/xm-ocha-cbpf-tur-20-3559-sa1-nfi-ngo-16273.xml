   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project aims to rehabilitate 670 partially damaged houses with an average cost of $ 800 per HH in Al-Bab city based on our previous experience in this sector. Thus, it will respond to the shelter needs of 670 families including 30% HHs of host communities and 70% HHs of IDPs, who will be hosted for one year. Moreover, 1600HHs in Al-Bab subdistrict (800 in Al-Bab city, 400 in Qabasin and 400 in Bazagha) of most vulnerable IDPs and emergency cases within the host communities (75% of IDPs and 25% host community) will be provided with 120 liters of fuel per family each month for 3 months. 480 HHs of new IDPs will also be provided with stoves.
Thus, the project will meet the needs of a total of 2225 men, 2315 women, 3325 boys and 3485 girls (roughly 51% female, 59% male total 11350 individuals this ratio is roughly made based on previous experience in this sector) in 2270 HHs (1401 IDP and 869 HC) in Aleppo governorate based on updated needs assessment and according to shelter severity (level 5) in Aleppo governorate, Al-Bab subdistrict.

The selection of beneficiaries will ensure gender mainstreaming and vulnerable groups are included, such as women and girls, the elderly, children under5 and people with special needs. protection, Gender, GBV and PSEA considerations are incorporated into all stages of the project, including having female team members, separate rows for men and women, fire risk mitigation, awareness sessions for beneficiaries, information sharing, clear, well-advertised complaint mechanism...etc. while focusing on community participation of all social groups within the community (women, elderly, youth, children and disabled, etc.). This project will be implemented by SDI&#x2019;s field team which has previous good experience, good relations with local authorities and with full access to the selected locations.
