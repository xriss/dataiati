  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">As a result of 9 years of conflict, the Wash system has been badly affected. In line with WASH cluster recommendations, it is essential to support the rehabilitation of the infrastructure and support for the restoration of sustainable WASH services. With the aim of cost recovery for self-sustainability.

The proposed project is primarily designed based on the results of the need assessment conducted by IR Syria. A total of 112,882 people will benefit from continuous access to WASH services throughout the project. 

The below is the criteria for the selection of specific work areas: High population density in the targeted areas more than other neighbouring More IDPs are present in targeted areas than in neighbouring areas Intervention of other organizations in these areas was partial and not enough to cover most of such services and Schools where there are large number of children and WASH infrastructure need improvement. 

The project will support the host and internally displaced families located in Suran, Akhtarin, Aghtrin towns in Azaz District in Aleppo Governorate.  The main project interventions include: 

	Rehabilitation of two existing water sources, installation of 1 solar power system to operate water sources to reduce the high cost of consumable support and better sustain the access to water services
	Two Water networks rehabilitation
	Sewage networks maintenance
	Operational support for three sewage pumps
	Hygiene promotion campaigns in schools and local communities to promote good hygiene practices
	Maintenance of WASH infrastructure in the 6 schools (toilets, sinks, water hoses, etc.)
	Provision of cleaning material in 35 schools
	Provision of 1000 garbage bins in communities for proper solid waste management
	Maintenance and cleaning of 6 sewage lines
	Expansion and construction of 6 drainage networks with a diameter of 60 cm at a depth of 6 meters and
	Cleaning main septic tank of 2 sewage networks. 

The project will mainstream basic principles of protection, inclusion, accessibility, security and safety as well as environmental sustainability. For example, the sanitation facilities will be gender disaggregated, proper locks and lightning will be available, access ramps and separate toilets considering the accessibility for people with disability and proper disposal of solid waste. A coordination meeting was held with humanitarian organizations operating in the area to avoid any duplication (Solidarity, World vision, Acted).


This project will be complementing the ongoing project TUR-19/3559/SA2/WASH/INGO/14482 in the same location, which will end on 30th June. This will capitalize on the gains of the previous project and graduate to the next level of shifting towards more sustainable approaches. In the ongoing WASH project, the main lines are being improved, and during the implementation of the works, there have been blockages in the sub-lines. Water network activities: Following the completing of the extension and improvement of water networks in the Ehtemlat village, the problem of contamination of the water well appeared, due to corrosion in steel casing of the well. The well in Suran town does not cover the high need, so another is needed. This will ensure that the targeted communities continue to receive critically required WASH services and water per capita recommended for communities (45/l/p/d) will be met. 

The project will be implemented in close coordination with the existing community networks, camp management, local authorities and WASH cluster. The wealth of experience gained and lessons learnt from these long-standing relationships has shaped the design of this intervention and will support in ensuring quality of implementation. The proposed project is part of Humanitarian Response Plan 2020.</narrative>
