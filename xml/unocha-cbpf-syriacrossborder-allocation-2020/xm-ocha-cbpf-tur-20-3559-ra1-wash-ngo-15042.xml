   <narrative xml:lang="EN">MF in Turkey office is remotely managing the delivery of integrated WASH assistance with main-streamed protection and advocacy in Idleb Governorate. Timely humanitarian relief and enhanced protection to vulnerable is delivered to those affected by emergency situations in the settlements.
Due to the emergency security situation that has occurred in Idleb Governorate in recent months and referring to emergency needs, Maram Foundation seeks to provide emergency needs as much as possible to help the people in need in different locations at Idleb camps with coordination and collaboration by WASH cluster and camps management in the area.
Maram Foundation is applying for SCHF emergency response to carry out a project in many locations in Idleb area as a result of the large influx of IDPs and limited access to services, there was a significant lack of the basic WASH services.
Maram Foundation designed this proposal to target 20,803 newly IDPs ( 3,646HHs ) living in Fourteen camps in Idleb governorate with basic WASH services, drinking water, solid waste removal, de-sludging latrine septic tanks, water tanks construction latrines, and Hygiene kits distribution, the project design will be according to SPHERE standards and WASH guidance in line with current SCHF allocation priorities.
Since Maram has a current WASH project to provide around 8,000 individuals (2,000 households HHs) living in seven camps in Idleb governorate including three camps in Harim- Al Dana and three camps in Idleb -Maaret Tamsrin sub-district with basic WASH services till the end of March 2020. Maram reported to WASH Cluster and SCHF Team that more than 3000 newly IDPs have been settled in the mentioned seven camps and Maram responds them through WASH services. So, MF is applying for SCHF to continue the project and provided the emergency WASH services at the same level, in addition, Maram will constantly be targeting new arrivals at all the project&apos;s phases
in addition to that, Maram will target seven new camps and informal settlements that established recently
The provided WASH activities will be drinking water, solid waste removal, de-sludging latrine septic tanks, construction latrines blocks, water tanks, Hygiene kits distribution, and hygiene awareness sessions.
Furthermore, the planned intervention will mainstream protection principles especially (Do no harm) throughout the project cycle by considering the different needs of men, women, young children, children, adolescents, young adults, middle-aged adults, and older adults. The provision of sanitation services will be consulted with the targeted camps and communities, and take into account the specific needs of each group. Maram Foundation also revised the content of hygiene kits by involving the women and girls through Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) during previews implemented projects
The Project also designed to provide disabilities, elderly and another vulnerable group with accessible handicap infrastructure too by taking these groups needs into consideration during the design phase of these infrastructures, with particular focus on vulnerable people such as &#x2018;People with Special Needs&#x2019;, in addition, to provide access to proper gender-sensitive and disability WASH facilities in camps, schools, child-friendly spaces, and health facilities.
Implementation plan:
All the activities will be implemented according to SPHERE standards and WASH cluster guidelines, through coordination with camp management and local authorities. As well as, all the technical studies (construction latrines) will be prepared after confirming the project according to the needs priorities, while the daily activities (water supply, garbage collection...etc.) all PRs will be prepared before starting the project in order to start providing the service at beginning of the project, which means all the important and urgent activities will start at the first of the project with seven months period
