   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Violence in northwest Syria continues unabated since November 2019 in southern Idleb and western Aleppo governorates. Which caused displacing hundreds of thousands of people with unprecedented levels of needs, according to OCHA reports. The need assessment that IHR conducted during February refers to a part of IDPs moved towards the closest and closest areas within Idlib Governorate, while most of them have reached to Afrin district as the frontline safe area of north Aleppo. 
Most of them hosted in formal camps and informal settlements. which have been suffered a lack of services, therefore the situation got worse in it. for that, the IHR organization through this project aims to improve the food security of the vulnerable newly IDPs in Afrin community and two other communities are surrounding it (Astaro - Tal Tawil). 
The IHR as a humanitarian organization recommended the following interventions to respond to their needs through an emergency project which is in line with Zero Hunger Strategy and it aligns with ASO3 Strategic:
- distributing 8400 RTEs for 4200 individuals (700 HHs estimation) through two batches to cover the needs for two weeks for newly IDPs in formal and non-formal/settlement camps in the Afrin area. 
- Distributing 3500 food baskets for the same 700 HHs for five months, with the possibility of targeting other IDPs in case of dropping out some of them. 
the priority will be for households with a disability, female-headed households, having a big number of family members, having a big number of children between 0 - 4 years, and other factors that show needs for those households. 

The RTEs and food baskets&#x2019; content designed to meet the FSL cluster and WFP recommendations. Each RTE is planned to cover the need per person for five days, while the food basket to cover the one family need for one month. 
All requested items of RTEs and food baskets will be purchased from Syria, so visual inspection tests will be conducted on samples of the requested items during offers evaluation and before distributing for each batch, by technical food engineer. Which aims to deliver food items achieved the minimum safety standards (non-expired, preserving their basic properties, free from any contamination or foreign materials and other characteristics that can be measured to ensure the quality of those materials), 
These two interventions aim to respond to those newly IDPs who left their houses and reached for area lacks the minimum necessities of life. The RTEs continue on food items for direct consumption, can meet their daily needs of food, since they reach recently and they desperately need food. While the food basket will provide the basic needs of the family from diversified food for one month. because a month later, the family will be stabilized in that place and be able to prepare food according to their desire.
The intervention through food baskets will be for five months, while the cluster&#x2019;s recommendations are eight months. That was due to emergency intervention recommended by a donor (SCHF) to respond for the urgent needs of newly IDPs
The IHR is going to distribute the brochure includes feedback number allow any person to contact with the organization in case complaints, and PSEA. In addition to service mapping by providing the emergency vehicle for evacuation the people with disabilities. As the brochure will include alternative distribution points, which allow any people who left the camp to reaching for those points and getting on their food baskets for a determined date by IHR within the month that we are distributing the baskets in. 
Along the project period, IHR will adhere to beneficiaries&#x2019; safety and avoiding occurrence of crowds we will distribute door to door 
Its worth to mentioned IHR will deal with all GBV survivor and mainstreaming via referral pathway in Target areas, 
Regarding contingency plan IHR had developed plan B, C to deal with all potential changing in the security situation</narrative>
