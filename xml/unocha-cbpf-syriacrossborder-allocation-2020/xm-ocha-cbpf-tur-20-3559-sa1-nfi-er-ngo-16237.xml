   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This action aims to provide integrated early recovery livelihood and NFI support directly complements currently funded SCHF project (14975) to establish 1 IDP sites in Idleb and 1 IDP site in partnership with SAMS. The establishment of the IDP sites will be finalized by Aug 2020 and this project will sustain the multisectoral services which will be provided to the sites residents that they will move to these sites.
The project will create 156 income-generating jobs for 159 most vulnerable HHs (125 males, 34 females) in the targeted camps through CFW activities which will improve the infrastructure and environment in the targeted camps. Workers will pave the pathways around the tents (21770 m2) with the stone that will be broken and shaped in nearby lands to the targeted camps, this will improve the lands which stones are taken from as it will reform the lands and make it more suitable for agricultural activities, and will strengthen the social integration between the host community&quot; landlords of surrounded lands&quot; and IDPs. Paving the pathways will improve the winterization conditions for IDPs in the targeted camps as it will allow them to walk in dry pathways, not in muddy ones, and mitigate the effects of the floods, especially that BINAA is currently establishing a rainwater drainage system in the targeted camps.
BINAA will establish two sewing workshops in the two camps in (Harbanoush, and Kafr bni), the workshop tents and sewing equipment will be provided by BINAA as they were funded by previous projects. The two workshops will include 7 sewing machines, 2 thread sewing machines, and wooden tables for cutting fabric in addition to small tools needed for sewing, and some fabric needed for sewing. The operational capacity for the two workshops is 10 in Kafr Bini and 7 in Harbanoush per shift (34 women in total). The 34 beneficiary women will be selected among the most vulnerable households in the targeted communities who will be moving to the two camps and have the ability to work and the required commitment. The selection process will be through open selection and application process. The beneficiaries will be trained on best practices for production while building their capacity, they will benefit from cash for work activities for5 months along the project period. 
BINAA and through their experienced team will handle workshops operation and beneficiaries work, in addition to purchasing primary items and then selling the produced items in contractual me methodology as per BINAA policies. For this purpose, a committee will be formed to handle workshop operations, all sewing machines and equipment ownership will go to the beneficiaries themselves at the end of the project in a contractual manner which protects their rights under camp management supervision.  
Furthermore, the project will provide life-saving services for IDP sites HHs which will be moved to the mentioned camps through provision of heating fuel and stoves during the winter season to 1,555 conflict affected IDPs HHs (7,775 individuals) (1788 women, 1555 men, 2333 girls and 2099 boys).
Each family will receive 320 liters of fuel packed in jerry cans, in addition to stove, specification is attached to the proposal.
The fuel will be distributed in 3 batches, starting in November 2020, and ending in January 2021.The distribution will be in kind, the protection measures related to the COVID will be followed in addition to gender considerations during the distribution process, please see attachment 19 (COVID Binaa guidance).
