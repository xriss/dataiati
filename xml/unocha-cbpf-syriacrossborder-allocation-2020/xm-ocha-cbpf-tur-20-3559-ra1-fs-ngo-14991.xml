  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">As a result of hostilities, tens of thousands of families fled their homes to reach safety. According to OCHA Situation Report No. 8 - As of 13 February 2020, More than 800,000 people have been displaced since 1 December. Many of these have moved to IDP camps in northwest Idleb governorate along the Turkish-Syrian border could be considered as the most vulnerable in Syria, although thousands are also moving to Afrin, A&#x2019;zaz, and Al-Bab areas in northern rural of Aleppo governorate. 
Existing camps and settlements of internally displaced persons are overcrowded, and the situation compounded by the harsh winter conditions, particularly on the women, children, elderly, people with disabilities and other vulnerable groups.
All these resulting in increasing food insecurity with poor financial and physical access to food.this project aims to improve food security by providing food assistance to newly IDPs and respond to their basic needs in Kelly and Maaret Tamsrin villages in Maaret Tamsrin sub-district. 
The IDPs are fleeing without bringing with them any cooking utensils and there is a shortage of cooking fuel, so if the humanitarian actors don&#x2019;t interfere directly there will be starvation and real crisis. Ataa is working in these camps and providing assistance in the following clusters &#x201C;WASH, NFI and shelter&#x201D; and there will complementarity if we were able to distribute food rations for these families. In addition, most of these camps are recently established and we have full information about the families due to our intervention.
Ataa will distribute 2400 food rations (in-kind) on a monthly basis for 6 months for the residents of the camps. also, distribute 15000 cooked meals and 1500 Ready to Eat Rations (RTEs) to target people fleeing their homes due to military advancement in Idlib and Aleppo.
As a contribution from ATAA, ATAA administration has decided to distribute 15000 free bread bundle for the beneficiaries from this project.
The content of the food baskets and RTEs determined according to FSL Cluster standards. Also, the cooked meal according to nutrition Cluster standards.
Based on the analysis that includes assessments of vulnerabilities related to age, sex, and diversity, priority should be given to the most food insecure, marginalized individuals and communities to ensure the equitable and inclusive provision of assistance.
