   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In line with strategic objectives of the clusters, CARE is proposing this project to support 3500 HHs through providing tents, WASH services and support the existing camp management unit to a ready built camp located in Jarablous, Zoghara Camp2. The camp was built by AFAD and is in need of tents, site maintenance, running operations and daily maintenance. CARE will partner with IYD to support the implementation. IYD has a significant experience in managing neighboring Al Zoghara camp. The proposed camp is double in size and by coordination between CARE&#x2019;s experience and IYD&#x2019;s local experience both can cover all gaps and provide a comprehensive approach. 
The Zoghara Camp 2 has the capacity to accommodate approximately 3500 HHs in a 260,105.78 m2 site. It is located 16 km from Jarablous City and is near the Turkish border. The location is considered relatively safe. The camp is located in public land and has rocky soil that is fenced and has all the infrastructure and services that are enough to accommodate 3500 HHs. It is divided into 11 sectors and each has all facilities. However, the camp hasn&#x2019;t received any IDPs so far. There are 2803 damaged tents that are in need to be replaced and additional 697 to be provided. There is a sewer system connecting the camp with the large open pit that in need for maintenance. There are 516 latrines divided to females and males, 504 laundries and bathing units and 42 dishwashing points that all have solar panels but are also in need of minor repairs. Regarding water resources, 5 equipped boreholes and water tanks serving each sector are located in the site and connected with water network that also is in need for minor repair. There is an entrance area where there are 1000m3 storage and camp management office in addition to distribution units. Also there are 12 small scale schools and a clinic. The camp is powered by solar system.
CARE and IYD will replace 2803 tents and provide new 697 tents to the camp. First, CARE will ensure an appropriate site preparation through graveling and compacting the site as needed. CARE will insulate tents with 20cm base and will distribute 3500 NFI kits to the newly IDPs. CARE will request the tents and NFIs from IOM contingency plan. The camp is designed to have an area for socializing, children area and fire breaking distance between tents of 2-15 m. between sectors. The project&#x2019;s second activity is waste collection campaigns in the camp. CARE and IYD will provide the camp with garbage bins and contract with garbage collection services. In order to provide new job opportunities for IDPs, the project is will recruit workers to clean the WASH facilities and monitor the garbage collection and provide regular maintenance. Also, CARE will rehabilitate the existing sewer system, provide desludging services for 5 months and conduct 440 hygiene sessions raising the awareness of the importance of personal hygiene and cleanliness. In addition, CARE will repair the existing WASH facilities, as needed and ensure that all latrines and bath units have locks and light to ensure the safety of the IDPs. Also, CARE and IYD will repair water systems. While rehabilitating the water network and the boreholes, CARE and IYD will provide water trucking, ensuring to distribute chlorinated water 25L p/p for one month till the water system is fully running. After rehabilitation, CARE will provide the running cost for 5 months ensuring to deliver 30-40 liter of chlorinated water p/p.
The project third activity mainly focuses on supporting the existing camp management through close coordination with AFAD. Since AFAD has already established the camp management unit, CARE will enhance its capacity through providing protection and gender mainstreaming, PSEA and safeguarding and complaints mechanism trainings in addition to any utilities needed. CARE will work with AFAD to ensure that all members of the camp committee are being trained and ready to run the camp and hand it over to AFAD.</narrative>
