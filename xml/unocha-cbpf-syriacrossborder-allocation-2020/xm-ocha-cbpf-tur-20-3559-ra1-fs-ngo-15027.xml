   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The 7-months project at hand aims to contribute to reducing the suffering of the newly displaced households who fled their homes due to the offensive launched by the GOS since December 2019. Violet through this project aims at covering the food basic needs of the newly IDPs out of the camps in underserved areas by improving food consumption, dietary diversity, and positive coping strategies.

Through the proposed project, Violet aims to contribute to covering the basic food needs of the newly displaced through the 2 following modalities
1. RTE rations distribution for 5,000 newly displaced households (25,000 inds) as follows: 
650 Hafasraja
1200 Darkosh
500 Sijer Bqesemtoh,
400 Balaa
300 Tlul
650 Thahr
500 Baliya
300 Big Hir Jamous
500 Atma

Violet will target newly IDPs within the first week of their displacement. The RTERs have been designed in accordance with the Cluster recommended package in terms of items included, energy, as well as the portion of energy, will be covered by Protein and fat. while designing the RTE, Violet took into account the beneficiaries&apos; preference and their feedback through the latest PDMs conducted regarding the RTEs distributed by Violet in partnership with a variety of organizations like SCI, CARE, DMA, and others. the designed RTE (14.7 KG) aims to cover 2109 kcal/person/day for five days 11.6% of the covered energy will be contributed by Protein, 28.9% by fat, and 60% by carbohydrates. kindly find attached BOQ (Annex 1) and (Annex 2) nutritional values of the RTE. The calculation is made on a reference family size of 5 for a period of 5 days.

2. Food baskets (FBs) provision (around 59 KG/ basket) for 1,600 food-insecure displaced HHs (8,000 inds) for 3 rounds. The 1600 kits will be distributed as follows: 
300 Hafasraja
450 Darkosh
200 Sijer Bqesemtoh,
200 Tlul
300 Thahr
150 Baliya

Violet adopted the standard WFP FBs composition since it obtained the beneficiaries&apos; satisfaction based on Violet PDMs for FBs distribution. However,  Violet has made minor changes in terms of item weights to adapt to the available items&apos; packaging in the Turkish market. The FB design is aligned with Cluster recommended package aiming at covering 1517 Kcal/person/day(72% of the daily kcal intake /person/day for 30 days). The proposed percentage breakdown of the ration is 59% of energy to be contributed by Carbohydrates, 11% from protein and 30% from fat, assuming that in general food insecure households will be able to meet the rest of the kcal/person/day from their own sources. kindly find attached BOQ (Annex3) and (Annex4) nutritional values of the FB. The calculation is made on a reference family size of 5 for a period of 30 days.
Violet will apply an eligibility and vulnerability criteria for including the IDPs in the FB distribution. please check the criteria in the documents.
During the implementation, the beneficiaries will not solely act as recipients of commodities, but also play an active role in the project design and implementation. By actively engaging the different groups of the communities in community representative boards, the beneficiaries are asked for their feedback, opinions on the implementation strategy as well as to act as a connecting point for feedback
Due to the huge displacement and rapidly increasing needs, Violet is currently in the process of announcing tenders to contract with FB suppliers in Turkey under a FrameWork Agreement to allow the Organization to rapidly respond to the needs in a timely manner. In order to ensure the transparency and competitiveness of the procurement, the items will be deeply specified with all technical specifications and the procurement will be announced widely to enable the interested suppliers to apply. The best offer will be selected by a committee based on specific criteria including supplier previous experience, the price, quality of items and delivery period</narrative>
