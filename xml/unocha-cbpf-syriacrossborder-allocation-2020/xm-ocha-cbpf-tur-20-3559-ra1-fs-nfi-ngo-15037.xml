   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Provide basic life-saving  NFIs and Food  assistance for the most vulnerable and newly IDPs in North of Syria.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Takaful through this project aims to meet the basic needs for both life-saving NFIs and food Items to the vulnerable new IDPs in Idleb and Aleppo Govs by providing them with life-saving NFIs and food assistance through restricted value E-vouchers for one-off regarding NFI and 4 repeated months regarding FSL .
The project will target 3480 HHs 20880 individuals (4510 men &#x2013; 5103 women &#x2013; 5512 boys 5755 girls ) as following ( Sarmada 1250 HHs , Azaz 1000 HHs and Afrin 1230 HHs.) these communities were selected because they include large numbers of new IDPs according to the last CCCM reports and still receiving them.
The intervention in both NFIs and FSL will target the same beneficiaries through restricted value E-voucher with total value of $280 for each HHs divided as follow:
NFIs:one-off distribution voucher with value of $120, where using of E-voucher will ease the progress of redemption and allow the beneficiaries to redeem their vouchers from different vendors with basic NFIs (Blankets-mattresses-carpets-diapers-plastic sheets-solar lamp-hygiene items- kitchen items and jerry cans).
FSL: with total value of $160 for each voucher, divided into 4 phases (one in each month), where the beneficiaries will receive basic food items for 4 months including (Rice - Bulgur Wheat - Pasta - Chickpeas - Lentils - Canned meet - Beans - Vegetables Oil - Sugar - Iodized Salt - Tomato Paste &#x2013; canned items).
- At the beginning of the project Takaful will conduct a meeting with local actors to ensure their participation in the project. 
- The vendors for both Food and NFIs will be selected according to certain criteria including geographical location , good reputation and the ability to quick supply, in the same time we will design and prepare vouchers to be used in distribution phases.
- The value of the voucher was determined to meet the required items for one family to procure their basic life-saving needs.
- Beneficiaries will be selected among the most valuable new IDPs (male and female) according to special criteria where MEAL team will assure that selected beneficiaries meet the pre-specified criteria by visiting beneficiaries&apos;&apos; locations.
- The distribution of voucher will be conducted in agreed and pre-identified dates and in safe distribution points away from military sites with easy access to all beneficiaries.
- We chose the E-voucher modality instead of in-kind because the beneficiaries will be able to obtain the NFIs and food items that actually need, thus avoiding distributing some in- kind items that may not benefit to them and also avoiding the risks of storage in these unstable situation.
It also avoids the risk of distributing cash because the amounts are not be spent on the value of the items distributed to vendors only after making sure that they deliver the items to the beneficiaries, so the beneficiaries will visit the selected vendors shops and choose the items that they prefer according to their needs (within the pre-determined items in the voucher)
-The vouchers redemption will take place within 20 days in each phase, where the project team will follow up on the redemption process in the locations of redemption
- After ensuring that the vendors have made the proper redemption, the value of the items that they delivered to the beneficiaries will be paid to them 
-We will ensure that the principle of Do No Harm is applied in all project&apos;s activities through several visits to the markets, distribution monitoring, and exit surveys. 
- After finalizing the distribution, MEAL team will conduct PDM. 
-Takaful will coordinate with FSL and NFI clusters and other organization who works in the same sector and field to avoid any duplication. 
-The project will ensure equal access for both genders with the priority for women, children headed house hold, PwD person, sick and elderly in addition the project staff will includes female and male members trained on the protection principles and gender</narrative>
