   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Provide multi-sectoral assistance in the WATAN second typical camp in Kafr Jales to improve the living conditions of the affected population / Envelope 2</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In line with the strategic envelope two and building off years of experience in the Idleb governorate, and specifically in WATAN second typical camp in Kafr Jales, WATAN is proposing to implement multisector intervention to improve living conditions for 11,207 IDPs (2,698 Men, 2,845 women, 2,882 boys, and 2,782 girls) living in WATAN second typical camp in Kafr Jales, Maaret Tamsrin sub-district.

It is WATAN &#x2019;s experience in establishing dignified shelters, that IDPs are not likely to resettle in established dignified shelters without providing them with their basic needs. Therefore, WATAN is proposing a 3 sectors intervention: FSL, CCCM, and Health. The planned activities have been informed by the recent camp assessment conducted in May 2022. Proposed activities will address the IDP&apos;s priorities in line with relevant cluster priorities, while responding to the allocation strategy.

Regarding food security, the project aims to support 2,245 IDPs families living in Kafr Jales camp (11207 individuals) with free bread distribution in an average of 250 g for each person over 6 months.
Wheat flour will be provided for bread production by purchasing it directly from farmers who are supported by SCHF partners that are currently implementing agriculture (Wheat value chain) projects funded by the previous SCHF allocation.
The total quantity of wheat to be purchased from the farmers will be 549 MT, which will be delivered to the mill to produce wheat flour and bran, according to the estimated cost of local market prices in NW Syria. Grinding 549 MT of wheat in the mill will produce 439.2 MT of flour and 109.8 MT of bran (extraction rate: 80% wheat flour and 20 % bran). Baking 439.2 MT of flour will produce 505.08 Ton of bread. The quantity of distribution bread per person per day is 250 g (survival needs).
Bread will be distributed to IDPs in the targeted camp for 6 months. Free bread distribution will enable IDPs to save this expenditure and utilize it for other critical needs. WATAN will contribute to the project by providing the bakery located in Tal Alkaramah village in Idleb. The bran which will be produced as a biproduct when producing flour will be sold and the income will be used to cover part of the operational cost of the activity.
[549 MT of wheat will be purchased directly from farmers who are supported by SCHF partners that are currently implementing agriculture (Wheat value chain) projects funded by the previous SCHF allocation. So, there is no need to purchase wheat through tendering (which generally takes a long time to implement)]

WATAN will build the capacity of camp management through relevant training. After training, the camps management will be able to identify the needs, advocate for relevant stakeholders, and manage the camp effectively. Additionally, WATAN will provide PSEA training to all its personnel involved in this action. WATAN will also implement pilot camp management software to support the camp management in documentation and decision making, through calculating the needs according to Syrian standards. 
WATAN through private project provided the mentioned site with safety system to mitigate firefighting, the extinguisher installed on site need to be refreshed every six months in the aim to strengthen the preparedness and fire response

Finally, WATAN will support an existing primary health care center in the Kafr Jales community. The center will provide general medical consultation, reproductive health care, and referrals to secondary healthcare centers. In addition, the center will integrate other essential services such as EPI, Nutrition and MHPSS through partnering with other service providers in the area. By providing essential healthcare for the targeted population, morbidity and mortality will be reduced among one of the most vulnerable groups in the area (under five years, IDPs, women, PWD).
