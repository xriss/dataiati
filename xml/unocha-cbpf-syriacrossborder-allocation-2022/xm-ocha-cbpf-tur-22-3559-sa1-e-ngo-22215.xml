  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The action aims to provide NFE in the summer to prepare the children join the FE at the start of the school year based on the endline tests yet those who achieve no progress will continue having more cycles during the school year to ensure that they improved to resume their FE. It provides as a path to the FE to 4504 IDP and HC OOSC(2094 boys,2410 girls,106  CWD) aged 6-15 in11 high-severity camps integrated with CP and WASH.The action will start in July with BTL campaigns to which education EDs, local people are invited to advocate for education and how children transition to FE and get their support.Children aged 9-12 will have baseline ASER test marked 0-4 in the summer program to identify their levels in literacy and numeracy.Children who score 0-1 will take BLN curriculum for 2.5 months in summer followed by endline ASER test at the start of the school year so if they scored 2-3-4 so they will be referred to the proper gradeif not they will have another cycle of BLN for extra 2.5 months.For children who score 2-3-4 in baseline ASER,they will have catchup sessions in the summer then transitioned to FE and have SIG curriculum recognized by EDs.Children aged 6-7 will not have ASER as they are not OOSC so they will have teaching sessions in summer and join FE directly at the start of the school year.As best prcatice,children who will receive BLN during the academic year will not be isolated in classrooms not to be stigmatized by their peers.FE children will attend the BLN sessions and help their teachers and peers in delivering the BLN curriculum and participate actively.SR will support the ED with stationery and water during the exams to help vulnerable children complete their schooling.To enhance their wellbeing,children aged 6-10 will have SEL measured by ISELA tool to ensure it had the required impactTo enhance a safe environment for an optimal access,the repairs to classrooms and separated WASH gender-sensitive facilities focusing on CWD(ramps,handrails,specific toilets) will done.1st aid kits and extinguishers will be ready for any emergency,safety checklist will be in place.Complaint boxes will be put and run by the accountability assistant to foster accountability.Desks will be supplied for absorbing the OOSC and leaving no child behindTo improve the teaching quality and build their capacities,teachers will have tailored training in TiCC,SEL,BLN,and Positive Discipline, SIR,CSG,and PSEA monitored by pre-post testsThe teachers will have classroom observation by qualified coaches and learning circles and peer-to-peer coaching .Teachers will be hired by SR after nominating the best candidates by the ED.Then SR select the best ones in line with its HR policy. For the retention of teachers and enhancing their resilience, standardized stipends will be paid to cover their basic needs which contributes to minimizing the child labor as the parent is not forced to send his/her kid to work or fall victims to early marriage.Teacher kits will be provided to teachers to help them prepare quality lessons and children will get student kits to better follow up and mitigate the economic burden posed on their parents.A book bank will be in each school as reading corners for children.Running costs will cover water,stationery,printings, records monthlyTo engage the community and maximize the accountability and ownership,11 PTAs will be set to discuss challenges ,share feedbacks in monthly meetings.As the child participation is crucial to raise the children voices and have their feedback from their view,there will be 11 child clubs represented democratically by children to participate actively.The plan B will be used in case of any escalation or pandemic which can result in suspending the activities.So homebased learning will be applied with the children tracked by SR to resume their education in their final destination if they fled to new places due to emergency.</narrative>
