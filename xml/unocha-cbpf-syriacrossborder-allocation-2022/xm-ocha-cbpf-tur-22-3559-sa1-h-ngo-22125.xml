  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The complexity of the crisis in Syria with additional layers of devastating factors has worsened the humanitarian situation for more than 12 million PiN for healthcare services in 2022. An estimated 3.3 million people have a severe need for healthcare in northwest Syria (NWS) with a high tendency to increase till the end of the year. This dire need for life-saving services was discussed with the stakeholders to be addressed in an integrated model that can improve the resilience of the area and not only focus on a short term response. 

This project will fund Alamal orthopaedic hospital which includes 4 surgical operation rooms, an emergency department, in-patient wards, 2 out-patients orthopaedic clinics, diagnostic services, medical and oxygen supplies, a blood bank, and a residency programme. In 2021, Alamal hospital served around 37,000 patients and 2400 major surgery. The hospital is located in Harim, which is the number one of the prioritized districts in the NWS based on the need. This hospital has been funded by SCHF for 3 years with successful investment in the infrastructure and a reduction in the annual operation cost. 

The outputs of the project: 
1) Provision of life-saving and specialised orthopaedic surgical intervention.
2) Building the capacity of four orthopaedic surgeons 
3) Active integration of the needed health services for trauma patients


The first output will not only have a positive impact on the morbidity and mortality of trauma patients but also will decrease the physical disability which is assumed will have an important result on the patients&apos; livelihood earning. As for the second output, it is assumed that 2 orthopaedic surgeons will be certified and be added to the local human capital pool each year starting in 2022. This will increase the capacity to provide orthopaedic consultation by more than 23K and more than a thousand major surgery each year. Moving to the last output, the active integration of the services will reduce the beneficiary cost which, with the previous investment, allowed to increase the number of beneficiaries by 20% for the same annual budget. 

As for the specific needs, the project targets trauma and orthopaedic NCD patients mainly. The incident and prevalence for both are slightly stable but tend to increase however, the service providers are decreasing as about 4 general hospitals (in Idleb governorate) with orthopaedic services were closed in the last 6 months due to the lack of funds. More specifically, in Salqin, two additional hospitals are providing orthopaedic care services, yet, because of the lack of supplies and equipment, they refer an average of 50 cases to Alamal hospital monthly making Alamal hospital the main provider for specialized orthopaedic surgery managing more than 90% of the load in Salqin (220). 

The project plan to reach about 53,000 direct beneficiaries and 222K indirect beneficiaries in Slaqin sub-district with an additional 200K from the surrounding sub-districts in Harim. Targeted by the intervention, at least 40% of direct beneficiaries will be women from the age of 18-50 and 6% will be people with permanent disabilities. This project will address the need of more than vulnerable groups and namely the 65+ elderly, Women, PWD, and IDPs. 
 
COVID19 prevention measure: 
This project included the prevention measures in all of its activities to reduce the risk for the patients and hospital staff. Based on the COVID19 task force, the triage, referral of suspected cases, PPE and IPC implementation will be all applied. (see more in the risk management section)
