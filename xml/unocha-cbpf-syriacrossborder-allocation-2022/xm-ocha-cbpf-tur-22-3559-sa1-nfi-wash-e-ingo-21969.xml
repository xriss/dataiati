   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Envelope 1: Provision of shelter support and services leading to dignified living conditions to affected communities in NW Syria</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project&apos;s goal is to help IDPs cope with the harsh conditions they&apos;ve faced since the conflict began by improving their shelter conditions, WASH facilities and access to other facilities. The project will focus on Oion Aara camp in Jisr-Ash-Shugur, using an integrated multi-sectoral approach to ensure broader coverage of people&apos;s needs and access to basic services on-site and hence easing the strain on community resources. The Project will contribute to the Shelter and NFI Cluster&apos;s priorities in regard to provision of life saving and life sustaining assistance to the most vulnerable people living in targeted areas. This will be accomplished by addressing urgent shelter needs through upgrading the sites and securing shelter units to ensure the most vulnerable households living in the camps are supported and accommodated within dignified shelter units to protect them from the harsh weather conditions especially in winter and have access to adequate and safe shelter and dignified living conditions. Considering the flood season, which can potentially cause severe damages, infrastructure-related interventions are critical to ensure minimum destruction and avoiding loss of property and assets.
Various gender and age demands, such as those of women, children, the elderly, and individuals with special needs, will be taken into consideration when the project is implemented. All project activities and interventions will be carried out in collaboration with relevant clusters and stakeholders, ensuring that the project&apos;s beneficiaries are protected and have equal access to services. QC will actively involve IDPs in decision-making to ensure that their unique and diverse needs are fulfilled and will ensure that effective complaint and referral mechanisms are available ensuring accountability to affected population. The project&apos;s operations and outcomes are integrated across the Shelter and WASH sectors, focusing on Improvements to shelter conditions and facilities in support of IDPs&apos; right to a dignified life, and providing general protection assistance focusing on the most vulnerable communities and connection to WASH infrastructure in the camp including:
a. Replacing tents with more dignified shelter from one of the ranges of dignified shelter options that are being implemented in NW Syria and approved by the SNFI Cluster and the Dignified shelter working group. This intervention will target 250 HH in Oion Aara camp.
b. Implementation of site-level improvements including flood mitigation, rain drainage channels, graveling, and road lighting in the same camp to ensure protection and equal access to livelihood, health and other existing services. Green areas in addition to child-friendly spaces will be also considered inside the camp to ensure more dignified living conditions inside the camp.
c. Provision of solar power electrical systems for all the dignified shelters.
c. Building private latrines for each family and directly connecting the new shelters with their latrines to an existing natural sewage network.
d. Providing water storage tanks to all HH in the camp
e. Full operation of the school in Oion Aara camp with formal and non formal education modalities.

Throughout the project implementation, effective liaison will me maintained with the relevant stakeholders including local council, camp management, beneficiaries, shelter cluster and with the OCHA. Necessary periodic reporting will be ensured to OCHA while submitting the 4Ws report and other updates to the shelter cluster. Compliance with the project MEAL plan will ensure that all the project activities are being regularly monitored for quality assurance, participation and ensuring planned progress on indicators. Complaint response mechanism will ensure that the feedback and concerns from the beneficiaries are confidentially received, addressed and responded in time as per the standard operating procedure</narrative>
