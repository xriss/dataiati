   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Integrated and complementary food security and early recovery intervention to increase the resilience of affected communities in Ariha, Idleb and Dana sub-districts by improving access to livelihoods and basic services (Envelope 2: SO2).</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">VO propose an integrated, complementarity 9-months project under FSL amp ERL that seeks to increase the resilience of crisis-affected communities by improving their access to livelihood and basic services through integrated multisectoral activities along with the olives value chain support through CFW and provision of small business grants to support food processing (under FSL), also creating income generation opportunities through (CFW) targeting community-relevant basic infrastructure, local markets, and socio-economic services and infrastructure rehabilitation (under ERL)
VO designed the project based on the primary data collected in the targeted areas and the secondary data. The gender-balanced and inclusive project will achieve its aspired objectives through the following activities:
FSL activities:
under SO2 &quot; Support self-reliance of affected households by protecting and building productive assets and restoring or creating income-generating opportunities to save and sustain lives&quot; and access to livelihoods, VO is planning to implement the following:
1- Following the cash for food distribution in Al Dana camps conducted by Violet previously, Violet would like to Provision of small business grants (two phases, total value of 500 US$ per HH) with technical training to support food processing with a focus on female-headed households and PWDs for (350 HHs): (25 HHs in Al Hanan (Mashhad Ruhin) camp (CP001992), 15 HHs in Kinnisrin (Alis) / Mashahda camp (	CP001790), 40 HHs in Affad camp (CP001989), and 5 HHs in Hantutin camp) in Mashhad Ruhin camps in Dana sub-district, 165 HHs in Idleb city in Idleb Governorate, and 100 HHs in Ariha community, in Ariha sub-district
The aforementioned activity aims to enhance the graduation approach for the targeted BNFs, where Violet targeted Al Dana camps with the cash for food distribution for 8 months under the SCHF fund (project 18348) and proposes the continuation with the same BNFs for the third line response
2- Improved access for 1100 HHs in 5 communities to livelihoods (income-generating activities) through CFW (100% female) for olive harvesting for 1 month (20 Days) in 5 communities ( Tab Issa - Eastern and Western, Arshani, Qminas, Ein Ship and Mastumeh) in Idleb Sub-district (1000 unskilled amp 100 skilled labour) to harvest approximately 50,000 trees (two trees/day/worker) for approx. 275 farmers. To ensure sustainability and ownership, the CFW BNFs&apos; transportation cost and harvesting tools will be covered by the contribution of farmers benefitting from olive harvesting. 
ERL activities:
under SO2 &quot; Increase access to Livelihood and job opportunities&quot; and for this project, VO is planning to implement the following activity:
3- Improved access to livelihoods (IGAs) for 385 HHs/workers in Idleb and 165 HHs/workers in Ariha communities in Idleb Governorate through CFW for 3 months (500 unskilled amp 50 skilled workers) and improved access to basic services such as daily solid waste removal and public infrastructure by conducting minor rehabilitation to roads, sewage systems, sidewalks or gardens (identified through detailed assessments, potential impact and participatory through community prioritization). VO will ensure community ownership through participation and financial contribution in all phases
The CFW activities under ERL will effectively contribute to the COVID-19 response through cleaning and disinfecting public facilities, garbage collection, and rehabilitating the sewage systems and water networks. Each CFW BNF will receive 750 grams of soap sufficient to cover the HH&#x2019;s needs of soap for 1 month is based on WASH cluster recommendations. Moreover, VO will ensure the COVID-19 mitigation measures are applied during all project phase
The project activities will result in a reduction of the reliance on the Humanitarian assistance and will have an indirect positive impact on the local markets through disposing of cash in the BNFs hand in a flexible and dignified way</narrative>
