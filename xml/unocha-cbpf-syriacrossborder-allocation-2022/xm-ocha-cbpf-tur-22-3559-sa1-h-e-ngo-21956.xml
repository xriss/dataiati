   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Shafak is proposing to implement an integrated health and education intervention, that aims at ensuring the continuity of health and education services in NWS through promoting equitable access and quality of education and health services for people and school children. An integrated approach will be ensured through linking the targeted beneficiaries from both components for instance, supported children with education will be served and/or referred as necessary to the targeted health facilities. Furthermore, this action will be complemented with other health, nutrition, education, and protection assistance services provided by Shafak and other actors operating in the same areas. 

The proposed intervention will target 85094 people (36672 IDPs, and 48422 HC) including 14321men, 30867women, 20178boys, 19728girls, including 2376 people with disabilities. The project will be implemented in Suran and Aghtrin sub-district of Azaz district, Aleppo governorate and in Dana, Qourqeena, Salqin, Idleb and Maaret Tamsrin sub-districts in Idleb governorate.

1) Education:

Shafak will provide safe equitable access to four non-formal summer learning centers and 15 formal schools (24 shifts) in and out of camps in Harim, Idleb and Azaz districts, targeting a total of 11,005 crisis-affected children (5345 boys and 5660 girls) including 226 CwDs along with 493 education personnel (273 men, 220 women) as follows:

1. Summer school learning program in 4 learning centers through classroom learning modality (with plan B to resort to distance learning modality, based on developments of COVID 19). These summer classes will run in one cycle using the Syrian Interim Government (SIG) curriculum.
2. Formal education services in 15 schools (24 shifts) at the beginning of the school year 2022/2023 through physical classroom attendance modality.
3. Psycho-social Support (PSS) sessions for school children using (I-DEAL) curriculum in formal and non-formal settings endorsed by UNICEF and CP sub-cluster, with recreation kits provided by Shafak.
4. Establishing Parent-Teacher Associations (PTAs).
5. Light maintenance and improvement of learning spaces while considering gender-sensitive and disability-friendly WASH facilities (will be provided from Shafak resources).
6. Teacher&#x2019;s Professional Development delivered to 331 teachers (170 male, 161 female) on EiE, PSEA, and PSS (will be provided from Shafak resources), along with providing monthly incentives to education personnel.
7. BTL campaigns conducted to increase awareness among parents and local communities on the importance of education. They will support enrolment, as well as sustain community support to education services in and around schools.

2) Health:

Shafak will continue supporting a comprehensive package of health and outreach services including Primary Health Care (PHC) and community health awareness services in two of the existing facilities and surrounding areas, currently supported by SCHF (TUR-21/3559/SA1/H-E/NGO/18362) until the 6th of June 22, in Azaz District. The following facilities are proposed to be supported based on Shafak assessment, updated HeRAMS, and recommendation from Aleppo Health Directorate and the health cluster.

Aghtrin PHC center (HF-Code: B0204077)
Ziadiyah PHC center (HF-Code: B0204066)

Building on the already established and equipped centers, experienced teams, Shafak will continue providing static health services, outreach, and referrals, focusing on the most vulnerable men, women, boys, girls and PwDs. The services include pediatric, reproductive health (RH), nutrition, management of communicable and non-communicable diseases, providing essential medicines and medical supplies and will be implemented in line with WHO guidelines.

The health services will target 73596 people including 14048men, 30647women, 14833boys,14068girls, of them 2,150PWDs
