  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">GOAL proposes to provide shelter support and integrated services leading to dignified, inclusive and safer living conditions in Dar Alkiram IDP camp, in Kelly community. Following assessment of six camps, Dar Alkhiram was prioritized due to the high level of unmet need, with and substandard living conditions. All households currently live in tents and have been repeatedly and recently affected by shocks such as flooding and storms, which have destroyed tents &#x2013; and further eroded the coping capacity of camp residents. Dar Alkiram is located within Maaret Tamsrin subdistrict and is home to 932 Internally Displaced People, which is listed among the prioritized locations under this allocation. Under this intervention, GOAL will facilitate the IDPs access to dignified and safer shelter solutions and living conditions. This will be complemented by GOAL&#x2019;s existing regular food security, and winterization assistance programmes funded by other donors.

GOAL will construct 170 dignified shelters units, connected to infrastructure and in close proximity to necessary services and facilities. This will be part of the site planning carried out at the target location. The dignified shelter solutions will reduce vulnerabilities to extreme weather conditions and protection risks. The infrastructure work will be implemented across Shelter and WASH sectors and complement the work of other actors delivering assistance in other sectors within the camp. It will focus on roads, drainage systems, installation of public lights, WASH networks and facilities upgrades and installation. GOAL will prioritize implementing environmental sanitation activities, including solid waste and excreta management, and hygiene promotion activities targeting camp residents and school students to raise awareness about hand washing, COVID-19 and other important hygiene messages. GOAL will also support the operation of Ataa Alkhair 1 station to provide safe water to 9,480 individuals in 6 camps in this area. 

Overall, 9,480 individuals will directly benefit from the intervention. Key activities will include: 
	Site planning and zoning to ensure upgrades reduce risks and respond to needs.
	Replace tents with dignified shelter units as per GOAL dignified shelter module illustrated in Annex 01.
	Medium-term road rehabilitation, upgrade and extension of existing roads in the camp through increasing the road width to accommodate the traffic, resurfacing with gravel and interlocking tiles, and integrating rainwater drainage systems.
	Rehabilitation and extension of existing sewage and water lines.
	Upgrading sewage holding tanks to optimize the in-site wastewater treatment process and reduce the reliance on desludging services.
	Hygiene promotion sessions at HHs and schools 
	Desludging and solid waste collection at Dar Alkiram camp 
	Provide 35 liters per person, per day (L/P/D) to 9,480 beneficiaries in six camps by supporting the operation of Atta Akhair 1 water station. 
	Establishment of a playground to facilitate children&apos;s access to areas where they can safely play and interact with other children.
	Continuation of MPCA support at this location by GOAL under another funding stream.
	Distribute Winterization cash for NFIs by GOAL under another funding stream.
GOAL is cognizant that camp residents face a wide array of needs. Following coordination with other actors present in the camp, GOAL have designed our intervention to complement and be harmonized with other projects and services. For example, within the education, another currently running the camp school, is planning to upgrade the school building. GOAL will ensure this new school building is connected to infrastructure such as water and sewage networks, and receives WASH services such as water provision, waste collection and hygiene promotion for students. Harmonization with other sectors such as nutrition is detailed within the proposal.</narrative>
