  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project delivers a strategic and integrated set of interventions to restore the local economy and increase the resilience of vulnerable communities in Suran sub-district in the aftermath of protracted conflict further aggravated by the deteriorating economic situation. The project&#x2019;s main objective is to increase the resilience and access to livelihood opportunities for vulnerable communities through diverse livelihood opportunities and rehabilitation of key infrastructure facilities in Suran sub-district. The project proposes a comprehensive, livelihood intervention where the most vulnerable households (HHs) (those referred from Protection actors and PwDs) will be directly targeted to enhance their resilience and promote their access to employment.

The project formulation is based on needs identified in  RNA/REACH/HNAP data. Consultations conducted with stakeholders have informed the design of this proposal. The project aims to achieve the following: 
Equitable access to basic services are improved through the rehabilitation of basic economic and educational infrastructures in Suran sub-district linked with the creation of short-term livelihood opportunities. 
Access to inclusive livelihoods and entrepreneurship support is enhanced through an innovative and unique three-phase scheme (one-month vocational training, one-month apprenticeship, and four-month job placement).
Local workshops owners are supported to enhance their capacities to train and host the three-phase scheme applicants (VT, apprenticeship, and job placement) as well as increase their production to sustain longer-term employment and enhance the economic cycle.
Cash-for-work opportunities linked with community-led early recovery initiatives aiming to enhance community engagement and participation and social cohesion.  


Firstly, 9 essential socioeconomic infrastructures will be rehabilitated in Suran subdistrict,  including 2 markets and 7 schools through the creation of 45 short-term work opportunities for the most vulnerable HHs, in coordination with the FSL actors in Suran to ensure that the intervention is synergistic with food assistance. Secondly, the project will identify 200 individuals with a specific focus on severe economic vulnerability to provide them with an integrated and innovative three-phase scheme encompassing: 1) vocational training at fully-functional workshops, 2) apprenticeship, and 3) job placement. The three-phase VT will be provided by local workshop owners who will be targeted in the business expansion component. Thirdly, the project will target 60 local business and workshop owners by providing a holistic approach to capacity development and business support, including business management and leadership, business expansion cash grant, labour force, business mentoring, coaching, and supervision in order to expand their business and create sustainable long-term employment opportunities that will continue to impact the local community well beyond the completion of this project. These same workshop owners will host the three-phase training scheme mentioned in the previous component. Lastly, the project is specifically designed to foster community engagement and social cohesion among IDPs and host communities through the establishment of Community Committee for leading community initiatives that are linked to the cash-for-work modality, injecting cash into the local economy while implementing community-driven initiatives

This project will directly benefit 2106 individuals, and 85,857 individuals indirectly living in 3 communities in Suran sub-district where the markets and schools will be rehabilitated.

This project in partnership with POINT is an opportunity to build upon a pre-existing partnership and combine expertise and resources towards successful outcomes. Both local NGO&#x2019;s founded and led by Syrians, SARD&#x2019;s hard component expertise and POINT&#x2019;s soft component expertise, complement each other.</narrative>
