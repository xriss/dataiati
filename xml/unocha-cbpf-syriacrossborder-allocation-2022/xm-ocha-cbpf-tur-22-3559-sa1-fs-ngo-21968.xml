   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Envelope 2: Increasing access to food security for women and men of Host Communities and IDPs in Idlib through wheat marketing support and daily free bread distributions in camps.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposal of the International Association for Relief and Development (hereafter referred to as ONSUR) seeks to complement ONSUR&#x2019;s ongoing SCHF-funded project by purchasing wheat to support the bread production and to ensure daily-free bread distributions for the vulnerable IDPs in camps in NWS.

The project intends to support the wheat value chain in the following three phases:

	Marketing Phase: At this phase, ONSUR will purchase 1,220 MT of wheat crops. 1 MT from each household of wheat farmers, in Maaret Tamsrin, Mhambal, and Idleb sub-district. Out of this 1,220 MT, ONSUR will contribute by covering the costs to purchase 320 MT (26.2% of the total amount of wheat), while the rest (900 MT/ 73.8%) will be purchased through the SCHF fund.

ONSUR will identify and verify target beneficiaries for the 1st phase of the project through two sets of criteria (eligibility and vulnerability criteria)

	Processing Phase: ONSUR will enter into a contractual agreement with a miller to grind 1,220 MT of the wheat [with 80% of extraction rate] breaking it up into 80% flour and 20% bran (976 MT of flour and 244 MT of bran). 50 % of the bran will be given to the miller as grinding cost, and the rest 50% will be sold to replace/ purchase wheat flour (each 10 MT of bran will be replaced by 5 MT of flour). In total, we will gain (976+61= 1,037 MT of flour).

ONSUR will contract with two bakeries in Salqin based on their capacities to bake 1,037 MT of flour to produce bread. The estimated weight of the bread will be 1,192.5 MT (each 1 MT of flour produced will make 1.15-ton of bread). ONSUR will cover 25% of the baking costs, and 75% of the baking costs will be covered by SCHF.

	Free-Bread Distribution Phase:

The free-bread distribution will complement ONSUR`s ongoing SCHF-funded project, which has ongoing bread distribution activities and will end on the 31st of August 2022. Through this proposed project, ONSUR will continue as of 1st of Sep 2022 to distribute 9,555 free-bread bundles (800g/ for each family of 4 people / 6 days a week (except for Fridays) for 5,107 IDP families in 32 camps in Salqin through blanket distributions that cover all IDPs in the targeted camps for six months (1st Sep 2022 to 28th Feb 2023).

Additionally, through this proposed project, ONSUR will provide work opportunities for 32 non-skilled daily workers of the IDPs (women and men) in targeted camps. The workers will be contracted to handle daily bread distribution, control, verify beneficiaries&apos; documents and undertake loading/unloading activities. They will work for 156 working days, 6 hours/ day, for 5 USD/day.

ONSUR&#x2019;s MampE team will conduct inspection visits to bakeries, mills, and daily bread distribution points to make sure wheat milling, bread production, and bread distribution meet specified requirements and standards.
Finally, the project will adhere to a do-no-harm approach, and Accountability to Affected Populations (AAP) to ensure quality livelihood services without causing any harm to the existing social system.
ONSUR will commit to the FSL cluster and WHO recommendations on prevention measures related to COVID-19, especially during the distribution of bread and conducting training. In addition, protection cluster recommendations will be taken into consideration to avoid any GBV/PSEA risk.
ONSUR will contribute financially to this project, accordingly more than 80 % of the project value proposed from the SCHF for this project will be used as direct costs.</narrative>
