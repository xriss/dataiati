  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Based on the priorities identified by the Education amp protection clusters and sub-clusters, and the findings of the needs assessments conducted during the last period, Sened seeks providing education and life-saving protection services in the following components: 
1- Supporting formal and non-formal education in 2 schools located in A&#x2019;zaz and Suran camps (Al Rayan and Al Haramin).The intervention aims at increasing the access of children with and without disabilities to the education process and minimizing the risks of dropping out and increase their access to formal and non-formal schools through removing the barriers and negative attitudes that lead to isolating this marginalized group.  Sened has signed a protocol with the Education Directorate of Kilis and A&#x2019;zaz to support schools in A&#x2019;zaz District as well as running pre-existed rehabilitation center in A&#x2019;zaz  Sub-districts. It&#x2019;s noteworthy that the directorate covers only the salaries of education personnel working in A&#x2019;zaz district including the 2 schools that Sened aims to support through this project. Therefore, Sened aims to seize this opportunity and support the schools to enhancing the inclusion of children with and without disabilities at schools and other educational spaces.  
2- CB for Education personnel:  Sened considers IASC guidelines and CRPD as a major compass towards enhancing the inclusion of persons with disabilities, therefore, the project aims at building the capacity of education personnel in the above-mentioned schools which is the second objective of IASC guidelines. Sened believes in the major role of education personnel in promoting the inclusion of children with disabilities in the educational process as well as the project sustainability. 3- Rehabilitation of schools:  Light repair in classrooms, common spaces and WASH facilities in line with Sphere Minimum Standards. The repairs will be timed so that they do not disrupt learning activities in the schools Contactors/suppliers will be engaged through a process that follows Sened&#x2019;s policies and procedures. 4- BTL Campaigns:  Sened&#x2019;s PSS teams will implement those campaigns in A&#x2019;zaz camps to raise awareness about the importance of education for children with and without disabilities through distributing leaflets and holding meeting with the stakeholders in the reached project areas.  
5- Student Kits: Students in 2 will be provided with student kits to enhance the quality of education at schools.
