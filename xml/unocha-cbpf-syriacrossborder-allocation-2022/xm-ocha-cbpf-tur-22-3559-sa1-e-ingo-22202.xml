  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Save the Children (SC) and Takaful Alsham (TAS) will implement a 12-month education intervention in Idleb and Aleppo governorates (Harim, Idleb, Azaz, and Jebel Saman districts) to remove barriers of access to quality learning opportunities. Contributing to Envelop 1, the project will work on two different levels: working with 14,889 children, their caregivers, and teaching personnel in and around school settings and engaging the wider community in supporting enrollment in schools.

The project team will provide education services for vulnerable, war-affected children in both Idleb and Aleppo governorates, primarily in camp settings. Transition from non-formal to formal education opportunities will be supported through engagement with the Education Directorate and offering certification to students. In addition, SC and TAS will roll-out Back-to-Learning (BTL) campaigns among the communities near the targeted 20 schools (including 5 schools running two shifts) to encourage caregivers to enroll their children, particularly out-of-school children and children at-risk of dropping out of school. Students and teachers will receive the necessary learning and teaching materials in order to support conducive instruction in schools. Teachers will also be offered a number of capacity-building trainings, including training on the TiCC package. Communities will be engaged throughout the project to support children&#x2019;s attendance and enrollment for those out of school where the schools will establish and support Parents Teacher Associations (PTA).

Under Objective 1: Increased safe and equitable availability and access to in-person and home-based formal and non-formal education for crisis affected children and youth, the proposed project will contribute to Specific Objective 1: Provide life-saving and life-sustaining humanitarian assistance to the most vulnerable people, with an emphasis on those in areas with high severity of needs. The project will mainly target IDPs in camps and host communities, and focus on children have their learning interrupted due to displacement or are at risk of drop out. The project aims to target locations which are not supported by other actors, particularly in Atareb, Jebel Saman, Azaz, and Dana sub-districts.
 
Save the Children will work closely with the partner to provide quality education services through the provision of a number of technical trainings (such as Safe Schools) and sharing tools and resources with the partners to enhance programming quality. Save the Children technical experts will work closely with the partner to provide their technical support and supervision on day-to-day basis. The partnership is also aligned with Save the Children&#x2019;s approach to localization and capacitating local actors for improved humanitarian service delivery. Inclusive community participation and enhancing accountability will be at the center of the intervention.</narrative>
