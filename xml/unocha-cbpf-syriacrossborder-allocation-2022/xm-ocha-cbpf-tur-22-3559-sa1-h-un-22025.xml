   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project aims to maintain access to critical lifesaving secondary and tertiary healthcare services to vulnerable IDPs and the host community by supporting Al-Sham pediatric hospital (HeRAMS code G0703097), Salqin &#x201C;Save the Soul&#x201D;  Maternity, Newborns and Children Health Hospital (Salqin MNCH, HeRAMS code G0703109), and Qah hemodialysis Centre (HeRAMS code G0703077) and provision of essential medicines, renewable medical and laboratory supplies. WHO will support key referral hospitals through its implementing partners, considered critical in integrating services provision, population coverages, and operational capacity. 

The Project is designed to address 3 Outputs:
1.1. To maintain access to critical lifesaving SHC services to vulnerable IDPs and the host community by supporting 2 Maternity, Newborn, and Children Health hospitals (Al-Sham and Salqin MNCH hospitals) and 1 Hemodialysis Centre in Idleb, while enabling the provision of essential medicines, renewable medical and laboratory supplies.
1.2. To pilot strengthening Communicable Disease Outbreaks Preparedness, Early Warning, Alert, and Response among displaced populations in northwest Syria through introducing Community-based surveillance (CBS) system capable of recording general community-based mortalities, including communicable diseases mortalities, maternal mortalities, neonatal mortalities, early trends of communicable diseases outbreaks. 
1.3. To support mental health service delivery by integrating mental health services into primary healthcare under the Essential Health Service Package delivery in northwest Syria.

Aiming to maintain health service delivery for at least three months, WHO will procure a number of medical supplies through its supply line, including 200 basic medicines and renewable interagency emergency health kits (IEHK) for 100,000 population, 50 IEHK supplementary treatments to serve 500,000 people and 40 insulin kits to support needs of 400,000 population. In addition, WHO will procure a Trauma emergency surgery kit (TESK), cold chain drugs, and dressing material burn to serve approximately 30,000 surgical interventions (see details in the budget). Moreover, the WHO will procure supplies for emergency preparedness and response antidotes by prepositioning stockpiles to serve 250 patients in case of a chemical attack. 
Community-based surveillance and outreach activities are by default services that ensure integration of the health response into conflict-affected populations&#x2019; communities from within, focusing on strengthening self-reliance, resiliency, and social cohesion and empowering the community through education and awareness. To pilot under this project aims to strengthen Communicable Disease Outbreaks Preparedness, Early Warning, Alert, and Response among displaced populations in northwest Syria through Community-based surveillance (CBS) system capable of recording general community-based mortalities, including communicable diseases mortalities, maternal mortalities, and neonatal mortalities, early trends of communicable diseases.
WHO will sustain the existing Hope Revival MHPSS center (HeRAMS G0704034) in Bdama, Jisr Al-Shugur sub-districts of Idleb, including Zof\Foz camps ensuring the provision of mental health services through mhGAP doctors, clinical psychologists using cognitive-behavioral therapy, and behavioral therapy for children while providing MHPSS services inside and outside centers and quality referrals to serve the most vulnerable population.
WHO calculated targeted beneficiaries based on the average number of services provided by the HFs per month in previous periods.</narrative>
