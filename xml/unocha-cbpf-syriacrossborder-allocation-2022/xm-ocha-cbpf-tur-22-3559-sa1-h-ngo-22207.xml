  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project aims to respond to the most urgent needs identified by the health cluster and health directorate, where the targeted intervention is built on the dire need of high severity areas in NWS.

SEMA, under the support of SCHF, will cover the gaps available in the support of two of the core facilities in northwest Syria and will ensure the provision of their services, as Waseem Hsaino is out of support since 06 Jan 2022, when it was funded through SCHF, and Arrahma hospital will be out of support after the end of August 2022.

Through this project, SEMA will continue supporting the already existing and functioning two general facilities (Waseem Hsaino hospital (HeRAMS code G0703021) at Kafrtakharim subdistrict, and Arrahma hospital (HeRAMS code: &#x201C;G0704003) in Darkosh subdistrict in Idlib governorate.

The support of the two hospitals will last for 6 months starting from 01 July 2022 (where the staff of Waseem Hsaino will be supported with their due salaries for 5 months, and some positions like ER doctors, dentist, IPC nurse and the optical technician will be covered by other sources of funding or by SEMA private fund to ensure that the hospital works in an optimum way), while the support of Arrahma hospital will start from 01 September as it is now supported by USSOM through SCHF.

The support will cover providing the working staff with their salaries, and the hospitals with the running cost, and the basic supplies.

The project will provide health services for 73296 beneficiaries (23952 men, 22152 women, 16578 boys, and 10614 girls) (21102 IDPs and 52194 HCs).

By supporting these two key hospitals, the targeted communities will have access to the following services:

1. Provision of outpatient health services, where there are seven clinics in Waseem Hsaino hospital introduces the following services (orthopedic, general, ENT, Ophthalmology, internal, urology, and dental. Those clinics are supported with lab and radiological services), while Arrahma hospital contains the following clinics: Urology, general surgery, orthopedic surgery, ENT, thoracic surgery, neurology surgery, cardiology, pulmonology, and gastroenterology.

2. Provision of Trauma and surgical procedures (minor and major surgeries) through 3 operating rooms in Waseem Hsaino hospital and six OTs in Arrahma hospital.

3. Provision of emergency health consultations through the emergency departments, where these departments are working 24 hours a day for seven days a week and contain six beds in Waseem Hsaino and 13 beds in Arrahma.

4. Provision of the inpatient services, where the IPD in Waseem Hsaino contains 20 beds while it contains 53 beds, in addition, Arrahma hospital will introduce the intensive care service through the 13 ICU beds.

Both hospitals are fully accessible for people with disabilities and older people, as their buildings are prepared with all measures to facilitate reception BwDs (Ramps, chair wheels, and handrails)

SEMA will coordinate with the referral network to refer the cases that need further investigations and services, where the two hospitals are part of the referral network, where Waseem Hsino hospital is included in the referral network supported by WHO through UDER, and Arrahma hospital has two functional and fully-equipped ambulance vehicles.</narrative>
