  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Aiming to address  the needs of IDPs in overcrowded sites which lack protection and privacy and keep children and women vulnerable in extreme weather conditions and floods,  the proposed action is integrated Shelter and WASH intervention providing IDPs with dignified shelter and WASH services to improve the protection, living and environmental health conditions of IDPs in Dana sub-district, Harim  district in Idleb governorate, reaching out to 24.900 individual (3282 men, 6720 women, 7954 girls and 6944 boys). The intervention consists of two components: 
1- Shelter:
Shafak aims to install 150 dignified shelter units with relevant infrastructure and Hygiene/cooking facilities for 150 IDP HHs (750 individuals) in Hantuteen camp in Mashhad Ruhin community in Dana sub-district. The shelter units will be replacement of old and torn tents of IDPs HHs living in substandard conditions in shared and overcrowded tents in Hantuteen camp. The 150 shelter unit including 24 ones allocated for People with Disability (PwDs) will meet the needs of IDPs in overcrowded shelter, replace the tents that are likely to be torn every 6-12 months and enhance  privacy and protection environment to mitigate the GBV risks. 

Site selection has been based on the crowdedness of IDPs in the area, availability of public, severity rank of the area, needs of the site, and approval of camp management and relevant authorities. As the number of households living in the camps of Hantuteen is 90 households, Shafak will prioritize them in the registration process for housing the shelter units and will ensure that their transfer into the units. Shafak conducted focus group discussion with the women and men from the site and surrounding site to review appropriateness of unit design to IDPs needs.
Shelter activities will be mainly: 
- Upgrading the selected site (Hantuteen) through leveling and graveling of the site to enhance access and adding lighting poles to ensure mitigating GBV and protection risks. 
- Installing the transitional dignified shelter units meeting the SPHERE standards with an area of 36 m2 per unit (total area: approx. 2,8 hectares). The units will be made from the available materials like metal frames, bricks (not exceeding 60 cm from the ground), and sandwich panels. Cement will only be added to the basement of the unit. Hygiene and cooking facilities (kitchen, toilet, and bathrooms) will be constructed using bricks as per the attached design.  The shelter units will be in total 36 m2 and will be provided with solar lighting to ensure mitigating the GBV risks and meeting the needs of IDP households. Units for PwDs will be equipped with ramps to the unit and inside the unit with relevant lavatory and handrails. 
As the proposed action is to mainly replace old and spontaneous tents in Hantuteen camp, Shafak will provide the HHs in the camp with cash for rent for 3 months (150$) through cash voucher to ensure existing HHs overcome any possible risks during construction process.
Shafak will provide a cost of HHs transfer  from and into the camp before and after the construction in addition to targeting the most vulnerable HHs from surrounding camps with a transfer costs.
