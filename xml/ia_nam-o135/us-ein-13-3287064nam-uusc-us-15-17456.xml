   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The FCWA and the UUCSJ are joining together to develop a &#x201C;train-the-trainer&#x201D; training to bring together food chain workers and consumer allies to learn about the food system and develop the necessary skills to launch effective local campaigns for the Good Food Purchasing Policy. A robust movement to heal our food system calls for partnership across all segments of the food chain, including workers and consumers. It also requires that we enlist institutions and activists already dedicated to healthy food and environmental issues to embrace fair labor conditions in the food chain as part of their battle.

Together with Labor Notes, FCWA and UUCSJ are developing a curriculum that accomplishes: 1. Deeper understanding for participants about the interconnectedness of health, environment, agriculture and labor in the food system and; 2. Clear skills to develop strategic campaigns to run and win the Good Food Purchasing Policy in their local communities.

The pilot training will take place in Chicago September 24-26, 2015, to coincide with the gathering of the Growing Food and Justice for All Initiative, a network of individuals and organizations working to dismantle racism in the food system. The next trainings in the East and West Coasts will follow (dates still to be scheduled).

After the train-the-trainer training, worker-leaders and faith-based allies will go back to their respective organizations and train their peers as well as others on the five segments of the food movement.  As part of this process, they will prepare their organizations internally as well as externally through coalition work to launch a Good Food Purchasing Policy campaign at the local level. The FCWA national staff and organizers from local FCWA member groups will provide support and leadership to bring together a local coalition to win the policy.

The FCWA is also working closely with the Center for Good Food Purchasing (CGFP), the entity that is spinning off from the Los Angeles Food Policy Council to support national adoption and implementation of the GFPP. The FCWA and the CGFP are collaborating with other national partners such as the Health, Environment, Agriculture, and Labor (HEAL) Alliance, Policy Link, and the Movement Strategy Center on this campaign. Thus, the worker leaders and UU leaders will have support from other allies in this campaign.</narrative>
