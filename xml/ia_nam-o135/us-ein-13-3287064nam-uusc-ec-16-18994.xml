   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Mision Esperanza (Mission Hope) Project seeks to secure the development of trust and faith in their own abilities and leadership capacity on the part of communities affected by the earthquake in Ecuador, providing periodic short-term urgent and strategic humanitarian support for at least the next 12 months, so that the human rights to water, food and well-being are not further impacted and affected communities are able to regain peace and tranquility in their daily lives.

The project will help to direct adequate and highly specialized donations of food, clothing, medicines and other goods to affected communities. These goods will be received directly from people in the working class districts of the city of Guayaquil and will be transported by truck from the Mi Cometa premises to the affected communities.

The project also involves building safe community water systems in affected areas, through installing water filters in wells and containers; building elevated tanks and community pools; and, so far as possible, constructing [ecologically friendly] dry communal septic wells.

The project will also support debris removal in schools, churches, health centers, and houses, so that these can serve as communal spaces. 

Rescue and emergency medical care will be provided to the injured.

The project will support the construction of community spaces such as communal houses and temporary shelters for several families.

The project will include making recreational trips, such as outings to a mime-pantomime theater collective, storytelling, and musical concerts, for groups of two to three people maximum at a time.

With an eye toward economic recovery, the project will provide training in the making of handicrafts and consumer products in these same areas.

Furthermore, psychology professionals will be included in the mission teams that move into the affected communities, in order to offer therapy, group reflection, and other specialized support.</narrative>
