   <narrative xml:lang="EN">CHRE / CEDHA project for FY &#x2019;16 ($10,000, general staff) a match to funding by Patagonia, and supports advocacy on two key program areas: fracking and glaciers. The program will produce public policy at the international, regional and local levels on fracking in the America&#x2019;s, and on glaciers and perma frost zones impacted by climate change &#x2013; and their impacts on the human rights, and the human right to water. 

FRACKING: CHRE/CEDHA published the report supported by UUSC and Patagonia on fracking in Latin America, with policy options for government, corporations and civil society to conduct due diligence under the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. (Report: http://wp.cedha.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Fracking-and-UNGPs-Draft-2-September-29-2015.pdf ). CEDHA is preparing a case to file on fracking in the OECD mechanism on a French corporation, fracking in a natural reserve in Argentina. Fracking is going on in Argentina, and is beginning in Mexico, Brazil, Columbia, Bolivia. CEDHA&#x2019;s report provides tools to develop public policy, due diligence and campaigns. There is no existing policy at the UN level on fracking and its impacts on human rights. CEDHA is targeting UN agencies (human rights mechanisms, UNEP, UN Working Group on Business and Human Rights), to develop public policy on human rights and fracking. Working with the Danish Institute on Human Rights, CHRE/CEDHA has presented the report and will staff advocacy to produce human rights policy on fracking in FY &#x2019;16. 

GLACIERS: CHRE/CEDHA&#x2019;s work on glaciers and perma frost zones impacted by climate change, and their role in providing water resources continues from the publication of the Oxford University Press book, and the inventory of glaciers developed with FY 13-15 funding.  Defreezing frozen terrain, and its implications for drinking water is the focus, in particular the impacts of the extractive industry on fragile zones. CHRE/CEDHA will support: a) local indigenous communities in their cases against mining operations in Chile (Diaguita Huasco Altino peoples); b) advocacy on implementation of the Argentine Glacier law, the first of its kind in the world; and potentially c) glacier inventory and report on and public policy development of report on rock glaciers and permafrost zones in the Sierra Nevada in California, and its public policy implications for water resources.</narrative>
