   <narrative xml:lang="EN">&quot;RAICES seeks to create a national Family Advocate Program (FAP) to address a critical, unmet need of providing legal services to Central American asylum seeking mothers and children legal services after their release from detention.

The goals of the program are as follows: (1) strengthen work with refugee families who have been released from detention or passed through Casa RAICES across; (2) alleviate the serious bottleneck in Houston experienced by legal and care providers there because they do not have the capacity to meet the needs of this population; and (3) reduce the vulnerability of these families to deportation, poor health and discrimination.

In addition to ensuring that all objectives are met, a case manager would match families with community members who can provide support and assistance as the family gets engaged in the long and complicated asylum legal process. UUSC&apos;s grant will support the base salary for this position.

Responsibility for these services rests with the full-time case manager; a host of trained volunteers who link with families; the family advocates; and a systematic effort to strengthen the working relationship with the existing collaborative of legal service providers and community-based service agencies.&quot;</narrative>
