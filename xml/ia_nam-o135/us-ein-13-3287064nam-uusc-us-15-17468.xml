   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed Disappeared project will include activities of three general types: documentation of
ongoing work on missing person cases by the Missing Migrant hotline; review of past work and existing
data collected by No More Deaths and Derechos Humanos volunteers, focusing on the three topics
identified above; and the analysis, compilation, and release of findings. The major activities to be
initiated under the proposed project will take place in the areas of review of existing data and
publication of findings, as outlined below.
7
Part 1: Deadly BP Practices and Policy in the Desert
Research Activities:
&#x2022; Documenting destruction of humanitarian aid and deadly enforcement practices witnessed in
the field by No More Deaths desert aid volunteers
&#x2022; Collecting testimonies from other humanitarian aid groups on destruction of supplies and
dangerous policing practices
&#x2022; FOIA requests for accounts of disciplinary action taken against agents identified to be
responsible for destroying humanitarian aid supplies, if existing
&#x2022; Surveying recently deported individuals at migrant shelters in Nogales and other Mexican
border cities who have experienced enforcement practices such as scattering, helicopter
dusting, being ignored while attempting to get a rescue
Analysis Activities:
&#x2022; Combing data on destruction of humanitarian aid supplies for trends revealed by location,
proximity to roads, dates and methods of destruction
&#x2022; Analyzing data of deadly enforcement practices such as scattering to reveal their connection to
trends of death, disorientation, and medical emergency
&#x2022; Mapping patterns using GIS and graphing technology
&#x2022; Comparing trends revealed through analysis with the experiences of desert aid volunteers to
enrich data and seek larger patterns
&#x2022; Overlaying destruction and deadly policing data with death data
Release Activities (Outputs):
&#x2022; Production of a short video (anticipated 5-minute) video to showcase findings
&#x2022; Production of an infographic/summary of findings in digital and hard copy formats
&#x2022; Production of a short report presenting findings and analysis in full
&#x2022; Creation of a web page highlighting the topic, within the main Abuse Documentation site
&#x2022; Dissemination of messaging through social media, including active Twitter, Facebook, etc.
&#x2022; Release of findings to appropriate officials, with demands and calls to action to constituent
bases
Indicators of Success:
&#x2022; Media coverage of findings
&#x2022; Fewer instances of these practices reported to the MMP
&#x2022; Fewer documented incidences in the field by NMD volunteers
&#x2022; Policy and protocol changes by CBP, upheld by agents in the field
Part 2: Emergency Response Crisis
Research Activities:
&#x2022; FOIA requests for information about Emergency Response Systems treatment of migrant cases
and BORSTAR/Border Patrol responses to transferred calls
&#x2022; FOIA requests for information on Rescue Beacon activations and BP responses
&#x2022; Review of existing data on the subject from previous FOIAs
&#x2022; Survey of cases of individuals who attempted to initiate a 911 or BP emergency response for
themselves
&#x2022; Survey disseminated in undocumented communities through Derechos membership and other
local networks to gather data and testimonies on the subject
&#x2022; Combing the MMP database of past cases involving BP and 911 involvement and conducting
follow-up surveys with individuals and family members
8
Analysis Activities:
&#x2022; Comparing data from surveys and testimonies with stated protocols within Emergency
Response systems and Border Patrol
&#x2022; Highlighting cases where breaks in protocols prevent emergency responses, and cases where
protocols themselves prevent emergency responses
Release Activities (Outputs):
&#x2022; Production of a short video (anticipated 5-minute) video to showcase findings
&#x2022; Production of an infographic/summary of findings in digital and hard copy formats
&#x2022; Production of a short report presenting findings and analysis in full
&#x2022; Creation of a web page highlighting the topic, within the main Abuse Documentation site
&#x2022; Dissemination of messaging through social media, including active Twitter, Facebook, etc.
&#x2022; Release of findings to appropriate officials, with demands and calls to action to constituent
bases
Indicators of Success:
&#x2022; Media coverage of findings
&#x2022; Higher response rate by BORSTAR to missing person calls
&#x2022; Change in 911 protocols to end discriminatory practices of forwarding calls from potential
undocumented border crosses to Border Patrol
Part 3: Disappeared in Detention
Research Activities:
&#x2022; FOIA requests for information on detainee treatment protocols of CBP, ICE, and US Marshals,
and review of previous FOIA requests on the subject
&#x2022; Combing the MMP database of cases for examples of denial of phone calls, failure of the
system to document individuals&apos; apprehension or current location, and failure to inform
individuals where they were and in whose custody
&#x2022; Follow-up calls with impacted individuals and family members on the subject
&#x2022; Outreach to other civilian/humanitarian search and rescue partners for testimonies on the
subject
&#x2022; Survey of recently deported individuals at migrant shelters in Nogales and other Mexican border
cities, as well as within undocumented communities through Derechos membership and other
local networks, for testimonies and data on the subject
&#x2022; Highlighting miscommunication/lack of communication between CBP and consulates through
documentation of cases where families are told by consulates that their loved ones are not
registered in the system, but MMP volunteers are able to locate them
Analysis Activities:
&#x2022; Comparing official protocols with inmate testimonials and statistics
&#x2022; Contrasting data with findings of the emergency response crisis analysis to show links and
impacts
Release Activities (Outputs):
&#x2022; Production of a short video (anticipated 5-minute) video to showcase findings
&#x2022; Production of an infographic/summary of findings in digital and hard copy formats
&#x2022; Production of a short report presenting findings and analysis in full
&#x2022; Creation of a web page highlighting the topic, within the main Abuse Documentation site
&#x2022; Dissemination of messaging through social media, including active Twitter, Facebook, etc.
&#x2022; Release of findings to appropriate officials, with demands and calls to action to constituent
bases

&#x2022; Policy change ensuring all individuals in custody receive phone calls within 24 hours
Culminating Activity: Release of all findings
