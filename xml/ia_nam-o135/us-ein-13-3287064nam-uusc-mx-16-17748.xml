   <narrative xml:lang="EN">FM4PL&apos;s CAM shelter offers an array of services to migrants, including food, clothing, temporary shelter, information about migration, and phone calls to their families and loved ones. It also provides some legal counseling.

The objective of UUSC&apos;s grant is to enable FM4 Paso Libre to add a staff member to the Center so as to offer full-day service on an extended shift. This longer shift time provides additional respite to migrants from the many deprivations of their journey, as well as protection from the dangers of harassment, abuse, extortion and ill-treatment they might otherwise suffer from gangs and authorities. Having additional staff at the Center will also allow the organization to expand existing services such as legal aid and to provide additional services such as medical assistance, psychosocial care, recreation and entertainment.

With the assistance of this grant, the shelter will also be able to provide 24/7 housing to asylum-seekers while they are navigating Mexico&apos;s asylum process. This will not only provide a vulnerable population with a safe place to stay, it will also help ensure that migrants do not give up on the asylum process before it is completed and end up in greater danger as a result, such as by returning home to the conditions they initially fled or starting their journey over again.</narrative>
