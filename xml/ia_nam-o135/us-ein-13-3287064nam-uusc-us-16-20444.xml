   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Our partners at CIVIC will support this investigation by identifying members of relevant populations in their constituent network who would be wiling to sit for an interview with UUSC. Since most immigrants in detention do not yet have regularized status, they most likely cannot now and could not in the past apply for CAM protection. However, one of the core research questions informing this investigation is that of who gets left out of the CAM program; i.e., what kinds of people with genuine protection needs are not able to access the program&apos;s vaunted protections. We would want to be able to document the stories of children who have just as serious protection needs as CAM-eligible minors, but who are not able to access the program at present because their parents lack regularized status. Interviews with ineligible families could also shed led on CAM indirectly, because the analogous experiences of their children could allow them to address such hypotheticals as: If an in-country processing program were available to your family, would you be able to make use of it? What mechanisms would need to be in place to ensure that such a program was safe?</narrative>
