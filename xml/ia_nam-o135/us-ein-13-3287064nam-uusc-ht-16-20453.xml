   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This grant will support the continued construction of the eco village school. The plans for the entire project for 2016 (funded jointly by UUSC and the Atlanta Church Group) is to construct three additional classrooms (two for students who are already enrolled in the school and an additional classroom to be able to accept 5th grade students in September 2016). 

In addition to the construction of classrooms, they would like to also build a kitchen with a cafeteria for the students and to pay for irrigation of the school garden. Funds will also be used to provide general operating support in the form of staff salaries, food for the children, teaching materials and supplies and the purchase of needed furniture (i.e., bench, chairs for teachers, desks, filing cabinets, charts, and tables). 

UUSC&apos;s grant will be used to fund the construction of one classroom, to build or finish the kitchen, to provide irrigation for the garden, staff salaries for six months and food for four months.</narrative>
