  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Record-setting tropical storm Harvey slowly flooded Houston over the last few days of August, and since then we have taken action toward safe and fair recovery for &quot;second responders.&quot;

Our project includes training, supporting, and coordinating a network of new post-disaster occupational safety and health awareness trainers, who deliver workshops for workers and volunteers performing cleanup/reconstruction work across the city.  These workshops usually happen in churches, community organizations, or at the corners with day laborers. Either way, trainers provide workers with practical information and practice skills necessary to prevent injuries and illness in the workplace. 

However, since we know one-off trainings are not enough to change workers risk behaviors, we also envision convening day laborers, construction workers, domestic workers, and their families to become connected with our network of peers and leadership development programs and reconstruct in their own communities. 

We are also envisioning a Reconstruction Works Forum this December to convene community partners, national worker centers and their supporters, to come up with principles for worker safety and fairness during recovery, and well as a Reconstruction Workers Summit before the next hurricane season to bring workers of Houston together to come up with collective plans for their role in future recoveries.</narrative>
