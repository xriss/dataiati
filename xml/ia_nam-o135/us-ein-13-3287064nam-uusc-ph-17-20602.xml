2. Specifically, 6  FGDs will be conducted with 6 groups involving  farmers, fisherfolks, women, youth, victims of violence, family members of EJK victims, senior citizens, informal sectors. They will be asked of their own concept of violence, their experience of violence (feelings, thoughts, action when it happened) and their  comments on the  various forms of violence happening  in the homes and  communities and how these can be responded to. The FGD results will be presented in a multi-stakeholder forum for more reaction and discussion and to generate collective resolutions and actions a mechanism for continuing learning towards more militant but non violent action to uphold people &apos;s right to life free from violence of all forms.
