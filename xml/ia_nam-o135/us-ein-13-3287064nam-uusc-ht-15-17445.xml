  </title>
  <description type="4">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">For the implementation of the project, the following activities are scheduled for the next 3 months:

1. Strengthen Zanmi TImoun&apos;s presence in border towns mainly Bellad&#xE8;re;

Zanmi Timoun already has a presence in three border municipalities in the lower Central Plateau (department of Haiti Centre). During periods of mass deportations, Zanmi Timoun plans to develop a work space and a space to accommodate returnees (both deported and expelled). This also implies hiring a facilitator or moderator for each municipality where people are going to be massively deported from the Dominican Republic.

2. Welcome the unaccompanied children or accompanied of the Dominican Republic;

Zanmi Timoun has already developed a registration form and information specifically for the care of children (accompanied and unaccompanied) of the Dominican Republic. Facilitators and student interns in social work and psychology will receive children at the border.

3. Reunify and reintegrate child victims of deportation;

Animators, facilitators and volunteers of the foundation &quot;Zanmi Timoun&quot; will identify unaccompanied and separated children who need reunification and reintegration into a family community. Pre-reunification and reintegration visits will be made in some cases to verify the socio-cultural environment the child will be reunited with returnees or rehabilitated.

4. Create a recreational area for children and address the psychological and social trauma of the children;

Before reunification and/or family and community reintegration, the children who were deported or repatriated are most likely traumatized, abused or have other emotional/social problems. To overcome these problems, a recreational area will be set up in each town that will accommodate returnees to realize the socio-cultural and educational activities with children.

5. Supporting families;

For children who come with their families, we will assist parents in their community of origin or destination. Training sessions are organized for these parents and other people close to the children in question.

6. Raising awareness on the problem and train peer educators at the community level;

To better assist the reintegration of children in communities across the countryside, information and awareness raising activities will be conducted with members of the population through faith and public places near the Dominican Republic and the need to support deported people and integrate them in community activities.

7. Meet with local authorities and community organizations on the issue;

Local authorities and social/community organizations are the main partners of the project both in the border areas and in the areas of family and community reintegration. They will be included at the time of reception of returnees and deportees. These organizations will also participate with the  information and awareness activities and during the family reintegration process.</narrative>
