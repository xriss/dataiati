   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The continued violence in Syria has resulted in over 4 million refugees fleeing to neighboring countries, close to half of them to Lebanon. WRF Lebanon responded to the crisis by being proactively involved in information gathering, advocacy and coordination efforts among local and international humanitarian agencies helping Syrian refugees with disabilities and persons with disabilities (PWD) in host communities in Lebanon.  With funding from the US State Department&apos;s Bureau of Population, Refugees and Migration, WRF is implementing a one-year Program throughout Lebanon that provides rehabilitation services to PWD among refugees from Syria and within the Lebanese communities.  

Refugees with disabilities face unique protection risks and posses unique capacities, which are not always identified through traditional outreach measures.  Through the generous support of the United States Government, the specific needs of persons with disabilities will get the targeted attention they deserve.  &#x201C;The U.S. government is pleased to support this program, whose goal is to enable Syrian refugees and Lebanese alike to fully participate in their communities,&#x201D; said Mark Storella, Deputy Assistant Secretary of the State Department&#x2019;s Bureau of Population, Refugees and Migration.  Persons with disabilities are often hidden from sight by their families and are unable to accept or receive the aid being distributed to the general population. Richard Drucker, Chairman of WRF, noted, &#x201C;We are honored to be partnering with the US State Department to deliver services and materials to refugees with disabilities. This greatly needed project will have life-changing impact for thousands of people in Lebanon.&#x201D;</narrative>

1-	To provide prosthetic and orthotic devices, prescription eyeglasses, and hearing aids; and related services. 
2-	To build the capacities of Lebanese civil society organizations to expand their services, and support WRF in providing Community Based Rehabilitation services to persons with disabilities.
