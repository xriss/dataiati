   <narrative xml:lang="EN">International Medical Corps (IMC) is a US-registered independent affiliate organization of International Medical Corps UK (IMC UK), with which IMC UK shares the same name and charitable objectives and mission. IMC UK and IMC work together to deliver assistance programs in an accountable and effective manner in pursuit of their commonly held charitable objectives. IMC UK will engage IMC to implement its programmes in the field, with IMC UK oversight, according to the terms and conditions of the agreement that results from this proposal and the terms of the parties&#x2019; administrative service agreement. Together with IMC Croatia, IMC provides administrative and operational support to IMC UK and to the programmes on the ground, including but not limited to financial management, banking and cash management, procurement management/international procurements and logistics.Through CHF funding, IMC proposes to continue  efforts began under CERF/IOM project, aimed at contributing to the Ministry of Health (MOH) for an effective decentralized COVID-19 response. In line with the multisectoral approach for COVID-19 isolation and care centers adopted by the HCT in July 2020, IMC has been providing COVID-19 response services, including screening, triage, medical care, psychological support, food rations for patients and risk communication activities in the above-mentioned areas. IMC proposes providing this support by reinforcing health worker capacity through  supportive supervisions and/or refresher training contributed to setting up COVID-19 isolation and treatment centres (CITC)under CERF/IOM funding in Bambari, Birao and Bria. CHF funding will enable IMC to continue providing  quality case management services to COVID-19 cases through these centers maintain screening and triage services in the supported facilities (and at the checkpoint level) and increase awareness raising and education activities in the project catchments areas. CHF funding will also contribute towards supporting MOH epidemiological surveillance through control points and entry points 3 sites. To reinforce MOH referral capacity, vehicles will be rented to transport COVID-19 cases to free District ambulances for the transport of regular patients. To reduce the risk of defaulting IMC will provide food rations to patients.CERF/IOM funds enabled IMC to  purchase pharmaceuticals, medical supplies and equipment and PPEs for the project. These supplies will be used to support the management of COVID-19 cases during the implementation of the proposed action to CHF. However, through CHF funding, IMC will purchase Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) supplies, PPEs, and sample collection supplies as part of the COVID-19 response strategy in line with the MoH guidelines. IMC proposes to continue to cover costs of human resources recruited under the CERF/IOM project who were trained to work in CITC to fill the gap linked to health care provider scarcity at MOH. Additionally, IMC proposes to recruit 1 laboratory technician to supervise, train and support MOH staff in performing COVID-19 testing services in Bria, Birao, and Bambari district laboratories.IMC will organize refresher training for these staff according to the needs and based on WHO recommendations&#x2019; have been trained to perform sensitization and COVID-19 contact tracing and referral. Through the proposed action CHWs will continue to carry out community education on COVID-19 key preventive messages and COVID-19 vaccination under the supervision of the project staff in collaboration with the MoH. IMC will liaise with MOH for IEC materials with COVID-19 messages to be used during sensitization activities. IMC will continue to coordinate its activities with the prefectural committee established under the management of the Prefet of Ouaka,Haute Kotto and Vakaga at the beginning of the pandemic in 2020.</narrative>
