   <narrative xml:lang="EN">EVHA is expected to have a strong impact for private sector development because of the companys focus on health care and innovative companies in the sector.  - Provision of health care:   EVHA is a complementing effort to support the gaps in health provision in Africa.  Sub-Saharan Africa has about 11% of the worlds people, but it carries 24% of the global disease burden in human and financial costs and commands less than one percent of global health expenditure.  The current providers of health-related goods and services in Sub-Saharan Africa  either public institutions, private institutions, NGOs, or the informal sector  do not have access to sufficient capital to efficiently address the demand for health care.   - Economic development:    Health care, like education, is a fundamental backbone to economic development and poverty alleviation.  The company is expected to invest in companies aiming to increase access to quality health-related goods and services, which in turn should lead to increased employment rates in the health sector and higher productivity among the general workforce.  - Supporting small and medium enterprises (SMEs):    EVHAs investments are expected to range between $500,000 and $5 million, which will mostly serve companies that fall within the World Bank Groups definition of SMEs.  - Private sector development:    This will be evidenced by improving the sustainability of EVHAs investee companies.  - Environmental practices:    The Investment Manager will adopt international best practices for environmental and social risk assessment and management, and improve transparency and corporate governance, thus transferring knowledge and skills to portfolio companies.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Equity Vehicle for Healthcare in Africa (EVHA or the company) is a Mauritius-domiciled investment holding company focused on providing long-term risk capital to Africas under-served healthcare market.  EVHA will consider viable investments from all parts of Africa, but will initially focus on a smaller number of priority countries, namely, Nigeria, Angola, Ghana, Tanzania, Senegal, Cameroon, Uganda, and Kenya (the Target Regions).  EVHA will expand its geographic focus once it is more established and potential investment opportunities in other relevant countries are identified.  EVHAs investments are expected to range between $500,000 and $5 million in:   - health service providers like clinics, private hospitals (existing and greenfield), diagnostic centers and laboratories;  - risk pooling and healthcare financing institutions such as HMO and health insurance companies; - distribution and retail companies such as eye clinics, pharmaceutical chains etc; and  - for-profit health care education.    The portfolio investment of the company will be managed by an independent investment management team or a fund manager chosen via an open bidding process.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">EVHA will be a Mauritius-domiciled corporate structure and will have local investment teams (collectively, the Investment Manager) based in key locations across Sub-Saharan Africa.  One location will serve as headquarters to facilitate connectivity and ensure that synergies and cross border transaction opportunities throughout the Target Regions are maximized.  The company will initially focus on Nigeria, Angola, Ghana, Tanzania, Senegal, Cameroon, Uganda, and Kenya, and expand its geographic reach once the company is more established.  The selection of countries is based on indicators such as private health care expenditure, total pre-paid health care expenditure, investor protections, and the regulatory framework for business.</narrative>
