   <narrative xml:lang="EN">- The project will reduce import dependence of Katanga on maize flour which is a staple food in the province. Imports are costly due to high logistic costs and can be unreliable due to policies in exporting countries. The project is for the development of local maize production at competitive costs and its processing in state of the art maize flour mill.  - Local production will promote competition with imports and contribute to improved food security for local populations.  - The project will demonstrate the potential to develop primary farming and food manufacturing activities to diversify the local economy from its reliance on mining.  - The project will create jobs at various levels of skills thus offering an entry point into formal employment for a significant number of job-seekers. Today, Terra has 38 local full-time employees and approximately 100 contract labors.  Terra will have about 80 local full-time employees at project completion.  In addition, it will have about 500 contract labors for land clearing.  AMCC today has 34 local full-time employees and approximately 100 contract labors for the construction.  At the project completion, it will have about 100 local full-time employees and about 60 contract labors.  - The project is expected to improve the company&apos;&apos;s ability to increase its CSR projects, where Terra already assists the local community with various infrastructure, including access to clean water (boreholes) and lighting (solar street lights).</narrative>
