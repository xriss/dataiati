   <narrative xml:lang="EN">First Quantum Minerals Ltd (FQM) is a TSX and LSE listed mining and metals company focused on Africa.  It owns 65% of Kingamyambo Musonoi Tailings SARL (&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;KMT&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;), which is the project company of the Kolwezi tailings project (the Project).     The Kolwezi project involves the construction of a copper and cobalt processing plant and associated facilities to process tailings in Katanga province of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).  These tailings were produced in the 1950s from mining operations that, due to the poor recovery rates obtained at the time, discharged valuable amounts of copper and cobalt resources into the tailings dam.  The Kolwezi tailings are located in two deposits  the Kingamyambo tailings dam and the Musunoi river tailings.  Currently, the dam consists of 112 million tonnes grading 1.49% copper and 0.29% cobalt (total metal content is estimated at 1,676,000 tonnes of copper and 363,000 tonnes of cobalt).  The Project will produce about 70,000tpa of copper metal and up to 14,000tpa of cobalt hydroxide.      IFC contributed about US$4.5 million in equity funding (for a 7.5% equity stake in KMT) during the first phase of this project which involved the preparation of a bankable feasibility study.  Other shareholders of KMT are; the DRC Government  5%, G&#xE9;camines (a State-owned entity)  12.5%, and the Industrial Development Corporation (IDC) of South Africa  10%.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Mining is a key sector in the DRC and has been the backbone of the Congolese economy since colonial times.  The Project would be one of the early ones to be developed since the re-launch of sustainable commercial mining activities in the DRC.  A successful project would likely spur significant additional mining interest in the DRC.  The World Bank Group is actively involved in supporting the development of a sustainable mining industry in the DRC.  The expected development impacts of the Project include:    Contribution to DRCs Economy:  The Project is expected to generate considerable economic benefits in the form of fiscal payments to Government (taxes, dividends and royalties).  It is expected that the DRC government would receive about US$4.5 million annually in royalties once the Project is in production.    Direct and Indirect Employment opportunities for Local Community:  The Project is expected to create over 1,300 direct jobs during the construction phase and over 660 direct full-time jobs during the operational phase of which most will go to Congolese nationals.    Development of infrastructure:  The Project will construct about 200 km of roads using its own resources including a new road from Kolwezi to Zambia to be used to transport final products for export.  This will stimulate the revival of infrastructure required for the transport of goods and services.    Improvement of Environmental and Social Practices:  The high quality Environmental and Social (E &amp; S) documentations produced during the feasibility study stage are regarded as the one of the most advanced in the Congolese mining sector.  It is expected that the Project will, with IFCs continued involvement, continue to set new benchmarks on environmental and social sustainability practices in the sector.      Linkages:  The Project will promote spending with local suppliers and contractors that will create jobs and stimulate economic activity.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">The town of Kolwezi, located in the Katanga Province, is a well-established mining town, with considerable existing infrastructure including a railway, power supply, and a small airport.  The tailings reserves are contained in tailings dams about 2km from Kolwezi town.  It is expected that the tailings will be piped as slurry to the processing plant currently under construction.</narrative>
