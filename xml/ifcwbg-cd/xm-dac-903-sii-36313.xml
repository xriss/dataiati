   <narrative xml:lang="EN">1.	Taxes and royalties: The Government of the Democratic Republic of Congo (&quot;GoDRC&quot;) will receive taxes and royalties, and will receive dividends from a 5% freely carried equity stake that is expected to be transferred to the State during 2015. The mine life is 17 years, but with currently delineated resources and other earlier stage projects, it is expected that the mine life can ultimately be doubled, thus prolonging the fiscal benefits to the GoDRC.  2.	Employment: The expansion project will create further direct and indirect employment opportunities for the local community. Tiger follows Government policy of hiring at least 90% local residents and has so far hired from the local villages of Kangambwa, Katanga, Luafi, Bungu and Lukutwe. SEK currently employs 797 staff. During the height of the construction for the expansion a total 525 contractors will additionally be hired. Once the expansion to 32.5 ktpa copper cathode has taken place, 824 people will be full-time employed at Kipoi. The SNEL/Megatron power grid improvements works and maintenance are expected to generate further employment within the community. 3.	Community investments: The Company has already made various community investments including: (i) constructing a school and a clinic in Kangambwa; (ii) managing rural waste supply in selected target villages: (iii) providing HIV/AIDS, malaria and agricultural education / training; and (iv) providing power to the local school. The company will invest annually 0.5% of its EBITDA in community improvement projects. These investments will be focused on its strategic community engagement sectors, including agricultural technical assistance, community health programs, including the development and monitoring of the Kangambwa clinic, HIV/AIDS awareness material and support, community education programs. IFC is expected to provide Advisory Services support to the company to further enhance community development impacts. 4.	In-country value addition: The Company is producing copper cathode, a high value finished copper product equivalent to LME specifications, and the financing will result in the expansion of this high value added product from 25ktpa to 32.5ktpa.</narrative>

SEK produced copper-in-concentrate from a Heavy Media Separation (HMS) plant from 2011 to 2014 and transitioned to production of high-grade copper cathode through a Solvent Extraction-Electro Winning (SX-EW) plant in May 2014. Kipoi currently produces 25,000 thousand tons per annum (ktpa) of copper cathode and a financing is being conducted to expand production to 32,500tpa.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">1.	Taxes and royalties: The Government of the Democratic Republic of Congo (&quot;GoDRC&quot;) will receive taxes and royalties, and will receive dividends from a 5% freely carried equity stake that is expected to be transferred to the State during 2015. The mine life is 17 years, but with currently delineated resources and other earlier stage projects, it is expected that the mine life can ultimately be doubled, thus prolonging the fiscal benefits to the GoDRC.  2.	Employment: The expansion project will create further direct and indirect employment opportunities for the local community. Tiger follows Government policy of hiring at least 90% local residents and has so far hired from the local villages of Kangambwa, Katanga, Luafi, Bungu and Lukutwe. SEK currently employs 797 staff. During the height of the construction for the expansion a total 525 contractors will additionally be hired. Once the expansion to 32.5 ktpa copper cathode has taken place, 824 people will be full-time employed at Kipoi. The SNEL/Megatron power grid improvements works and maintenance are expected to generate further employment within the community. 3.	Community investments: The Company has already made various community investments including: (i) constructing a school and a clinic in Kangambwa; (ii) managing rural waste supply in selected target villages: (iii) providing HIV/AIDS, malaria and agricultural education / training; and (iv) providing power to the local school. The company will invest annually 0.5% of its EBITDA in community improvement projects. These investments will be focused on its strategic community engagement sectors, including agricultural technical assistance, community health programs, including the development and monitoring of the Kangambwa clinic, HIV/AIDS awareness material and support, community education programs. IFC is expected to provide Advisory Services support to the company to further enhance community development impacts. 4.	In-country value addition: The Company is producing copper cathode, a high value finished copper product equivalent to LME specifications, and the financing will result in the expansion of this high value added product from 25ktpa to 32.5ktpa.</narrative>
