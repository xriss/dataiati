   <narrative xml:lang="EN">ISSUE: The construction contract was awarded in June 1986, with a completion period of 24 months and supervision was awarded on 5th March 1986. The work physically commenced on 1st September 1986. The contractor was suspended in 1989 in order to allow Government investigation of the course of the failed sections of the road. The contract was eventually terminated. The project remains nearly 60% completed with UA 13.44 million disbursed. There have not been any disbursements since 9th March 1989. The Government has confirmed that the dispute between the Government and Messrs. ABU and Partners has been resolved with no legal or financial obligations to the Bank. On 18th December 1997, the Government requested Bank&apos;s approval to revise the list of works and services with a view to completing the project by utilizing the remaining UA 10.23 million. The Bank approved the Government&apos;s request on 19th April 1999, with the revised deadline for final disbursement being 31st December 2002. Since the approval of the revised list of works and services, the Government has entered into contract with a consulting firm for the design review, pre-tender activities and supervision of works. The draft tender documents are currently being reviewed by the Bank. However, the pre-qualifying contractors is completed. However, the Government has been very slow in implementing the project. ACTION: The Government should speed up the procurement process. The Bank&apos;s mission that is scheduled for early March will conclude the review of the tender Documents with the Government.</narrative>
