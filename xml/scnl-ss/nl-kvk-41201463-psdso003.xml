   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Most vulnerable children (under five) affected by undernutrition.</narrative>
  </description>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Over the  past decades great  advances have been made  in reducing all forms of undernutrition in children under five (CU5). Nevertheless, almost  200 million CU5 suffer from stunting (low  height/age), wasting (low weight/height), or both, and over 340 million from vitamin and mineral deficiencies. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is putting even more CU5s at risk. The world is off-track to meet most of the SDG targets related to hunger, food security, nutrition and access to WASH, a critical precondition for good nutritional status. Right2Grow will focus on amplifying the voices of communities, their organisations and local civil society in those places and on those topics that matter.</narrative>
  </description>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Right2Grow envisions a world where all children under five (CU5) are well-nourished (long-term impact), so that every child is able to reach theirfull potential (ultimate goal).  Undernutrition will be addressed multi-sectorally to address each of the underlying determinants of malnutrition, which include:   WASH, agriculture, care practices, health, education, social protection, gender norms and household dynamics, and other socioeconomic factors.</narrative>

A National Nutrition policy and National Nutrition Strategy don&apos;t exist yet.Natural disasters such as floods and droughts not only overstretch state capacity, they also make the population more susceptible and vulnerable as a result of displacement and loss of livelihoods, exacerbating their vulnerability to COVID-19.The Public Financial Management and Accountability Act, 2011 is the institutional legal framework put in place and permits the Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development to exercise powers in ensuring effective and efficient public financial management and accountability including budget preparation, execution, management and reporting; internal audit; and public procurement among others. Planning is at the state level.South Sudan&#x2019;s Food Security Policy recognizes natural disasters as threats to food security, including droughts, floods, pests and diseases, attributing the cause of these disasters to climate change. It also points out that poor land management and insufficient application of fertilizers exacerbate these disasters. The policy counts the lack of technologies for food preparation, preservation and storage as one of the main problems. The policy gap here is that it does not explain how the food security will integrated with nutrition which is under the ministry of health, especiallycommunity-basednutrition and the food security program.Access to basic water, sanitation and hygiene facilities is vital for the health, welfare and productivity of the population. The incidence of diarrhoeal diseases associated with lack of access to safe water and adequate sanitation is a major factor underlying high infant mortality rates1, and improved access to water and sanitation facilities is particularly important for people living with HIV/AIDS. The provision of safe drinking water, basic sanitation and clean environment at household level can have a major impact on health. The Policy document for water does not include Nutrition and COVI9 -19. Hence integration of the Nutrition into WASH policy will need the Water policy to be updated.

      <narrative xml:lang="EN">&quot;CSOs conducted WASH and Nutrition community awareness in Patiak area and Bortown IDPs. &#x201C;Advocate for WASH and Nutrition was done through radio talk shows and including government authorities in Jonglei state&#x201D;, said one of the members of the civil society organization in block 7.There have been no meetings organized by civil society organizations with the private sector in relation to appropriate technologies on food processing and preservations in all the three states of Jonglei, Unity and upper Nile (see table7 in baseline report). There is effort in almost each County to ensure that awareness sessions were conducted on local production of nutritious foods affordable to the local community by the partners on ground. For example, two had been carried out in Bor, Koch and Fashioda; meanwhile 1 had been carried out in each of the Counties of Akobo, Melut Leer Mayendit and Fangank. However, no activity has been reported in Pibor to show awareness for local nutritious food production.  Three CSOs,one each in Akobo, Bor and Fashioda were reported to have carried out nutrition causal analysis to identify the potential causes of malnutrition and shared the findings with their respective line ministries.

All the 16 advocacy initiatives identified by the baseline scoping exercise were not supported by R2G project&quot;</narrative>

      <narrative xml:lang="EN">&quot;The baseline study showed that there are some relevant platforms for civil society such as the SUN movement and Ministry of Water Resources and Irrigation (MWRI). However, meetings have not been structural and have mainly had a humanitarian focus. In the previous years the MWRI has been holding annual joint WASH sector meetings which was interrupted for more than two years due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  Further, the MWRI welcomed Save the Children and its partners in supporting it to develop integrated guidelines and strategic plan for WASH and Nutrition. This shows that some mechanisms exist for WASH sector (government and humanitarian actors) exchange of knowledge on WASH service delivery. Current meetingsare often about sharing and coordination of service delivery, little is being done however, by CBOs and CSOs to lobby and advocate for quality WASH and nutrition services and stimulate multi sectoral collaboration.Even within the government budget planning document, the local government authorities and CSOs were excludedfrom the process, leaving them with limited room for negotiation to participate in the budget planning process. 

R2G did not yet create space for CSO demands during the baseline period.&quot;</narrative>

Right to Grow  consortium partners are targeting to conduct activities in creating space twice in a year at the national level and 6 at sub national level every year.  The total is 40 by 2025 for both national and sub national. The targets will be reviewed during the midterm evaluation.
