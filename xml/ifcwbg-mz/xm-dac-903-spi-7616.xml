   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Summary Of Project Information (SPI)       Project Name    Mozambique-Agrimo              Region    Sub-Saharan Africa        Sector       Project No007616   Projected Board DateSeptember 30, 1996   Company NameAgrimo Companhia Agro-Pecuaria de Mo&#xE7;ambique, Lda.   Technical Partner and/or Major Shareholders    	Agrimo is majority owned by Zamagri, S.A., a Portuguese company owned equally by Mantero, S.A. and Oceanus, S.A.    Project Cost Including proposed IFC investment    	 Total project cost is estimated at US$5.3 million and IFC is asked to provide an equity investment of US$0.5 million and a loan of US$0.8 million.    Location of project and Description of site    	Agrimo will provide agricultural extension services to smallholder farmers in the Mozambican province of Zamb&#xE9;zia and, more specifically, in the districts of Mopeia, Nicoadala and Morrumbala.  Agrimo has purchased a warehouse, an office and staff housing in the town of Morrumbala from where it will coordinate its activities.  A site for a cotton gin and for a small farm to produce cotton for seed will also be acquired in the vicinity of Morrumbala.  Extension posts will be located in small towns near where farming will be concentrated.  Corporate offices will be located in Quelimane and a representative will be based in Maputo.    Description of Company and Purpose of Project    	Agrimo will provide agricultural inputs, assistance and a guaranteed market for cotton produced by 25,000 or more smallholder farmers in central Mozambique.  The project concept is not new and has been implemented successfully by other companies in northern Mozambique. The price paid to smallholder farmers for cotton is established by the Government of Mozambique near the beginning of the growing season.  Seed cotton, purchased from smallholders by Agrimo, will be processed at a gin to be built by Agrimo in Morrumbala.  The Cotton will be sold to the local textile industry or exported, and the Cotton seed will be sold locally.                                                                                                                                             The project will have a significant impact on the region in view of the civil war that prevailed for the past two decades.  Most of the smallholder families are recent returnees from neighboring Malawi or from the safety of nearby villages and almost all live in extreme poverty.  Agrimo will provide smallholder families with the means to diversify their risk of producing only traditional food crops and add an alternative source of income.  IFC&apos;&apos;s role is to provide scarce equity and term-loan finance to make the project a reality.  The project is extremely important for the redevelopment of the area due to the large number of families that will benefit when the project is fully implemented.    Environmental Category and Issues    		This is a category B project according to IFC&apos;&apos;s environmental review procedure.  Environmental issues associated with the project include agricultural extension services, waste disposal, worker exposure to dust, general employee health and safety, and fire protection.  Mitigation measures will include provision of training in chemical handling and application procedures.    The  is  August 15, 1996 from the Public Information Center.
