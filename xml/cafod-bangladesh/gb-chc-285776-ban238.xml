  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The impact of COVID on Bangladesh has been considerable, with millions being affected and almost 30,000 dying from the virus officially. Several lockdowns had a disproportionate impact on the most marginalised, including people living with disability. Those people with disability who could work, often worked in precarious informal work which made them particularly vulnerable. One report in Bangladesh found that 74% of people living with disability had lost all income sources. Similarly, although the vaccination programme in Bangladesh has made good progress, stigma and vulnerability mean people living with disabilities in rural areas are less likely than able bodied people to receive a vaccine and COVID prevention awareness messages often do not reach people with disability who remain within their homes. 
This project will provide a small cash grant to 360 people with disabilities who have particularly been suffering from the impact of COVID pandemic. In addition, the project will support vaccination registration and support to get vaccinated to 6,480 people, as well as COVID prevention messages to 4,500 people and the distribution of fabric face masks to 1,202 people with disabilities.</narrative>
