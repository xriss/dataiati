   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project aims to improve the income, livelihoods and living conditions of the most disadvantaged and marginalised people, including women, indigenous people and people living with disabilities. The project will directly target four Unions of Kalapara sub-district in Patuakhali district, on the southern tip of Bangladesh. The project will reach a total of 200 people with vocational and entrepreneurship support benefiting a total of 900 people including their family members.

The project design follows the successful completion of a 3-year project in Bangladesh, supported by CAFOD and funded by the UK Government. Learning from this project found that many extremely poor people benefit from specific agriculture-based support, but these traditional agriculture projects often exclude extremely vulnerable groups such as people living with disabilities and those who have no access to land, such as women, some young people or indigenous groups. 

Caritas Bangladesh, with support from ADD (a specialist disability organisation), will carry out an assessment in the local community to understand suitable livelihood options for marginalised people, including people living with disabilities. This assessment will draw together the interests and abilities of people to participate in such livelihoods as well as analyse the local market potential to earn a sustainable income from the livelihood options. Following the assessment, Caritas Bangladesh will develop modular courses specially tailored to marginalised groups, such as those with disabilities and women. 

Expected results of this project are;
1. 200 disadvantaged and marginalised individuals (130 men, 70 women) are trained in technical trades of their choice.
2. 80% of trainees have increased earning capacity as a result of the training received.
3. 80% of trainees have secured employment or income generation activities:.</narrative>
