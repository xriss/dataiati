   <narrative xml:lang="EN">BELA undertakes policy/advocacy, alongside running awareness programmes for police, judges, CSOs, government officials and carrying out research on environmental governance and justice issues. It was in a BELA-initiated case in 1997 that the Supreme Court of Bangladesh recognized the concept of Public Interest Litigation (PIL) that enabled millions of voice-less people to access the formal justice system.

In this project BELA will offer legal support to 9 community groups of at least 4 districts (Savar, Gazipur, and Narayanganj), who are facing industrial pollution, river pollution, forced conversion, land grabbing of agricultural lands, and lack support for sustainable agriculture. 

The communities living in these areas face unregulated industrialization and urbanization that is further marginalizing the traditional livelihood earners. These districts are heavily populated and are victims of industrial pollution and expansion. In addition, communities face the risk of land grabbing by industrialists and realtors. The local government agencies and the environmental agencies have categorically failed to administer laws against such violations.

Through a holistic approach, BELA will support these communities with legal assistance to resist environmental pollution and land grabbing and through the sustainable agricultural NGO, ALRD, Prakritik Krishi -Natural Agriculture, participants will receive training to achieve a total green transformation in the system. The objectives of the project will be to resist environmental injustices through organizing and empowering affected communities, uphold environmental rights/entitlements of traditional livelihood earners through legal assistance, strengthen community voices and foster actions against land grabbing, unauthorised conversion of agricultural lands and pollution, follow up judgments/interim orders, and articulate demand for policy reform in favour of sustainable, organic farming. CAFOD&apos;s contribution is part of a larger project implemented by BELA.</narrative>
