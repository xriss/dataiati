   <narrative xml:lang="SV">ILO har tillsammans FAO, utarbetat ett gemensamt program med namnet Decent Jobs and Improved Food Security through Development of Sustainable Rural Enterprises. FN i Zambia, via ILO, inkom under 2013 med en ans&#xF6;kan om finansiering fr&#xE5;n Sida om motsvarande 46,075 SEK f&#xF6;r att implementera detta program under perioden 2013-17. 

Det &#xF6;vergripande m&#xE5;let med insatsen &#xE4;r att bidra till att adressera den h&#xF6;ga arbetsl&#xF6;shet som m&#xF6;ter ungdomar och d&#xE5; speciellt inom den formella sektorn.
Ambassaden tog beslut om finansiering av insatsen med villkoret att projektet delas in i tv&#xE5; faser: fas ett som en uppstartsfas p&#xE5; 12 m&#xE5;nader och med en budget p&#xE5; 17,4 MSEK. Den sammanlagda budgeten f&#xF6;r insatsen &#xE4;r 7,4 million USD, Sidas finansierar 7 MUSD av dessa, ILO bidrar med 200 000 USD och FAO bidrar med 100 000 USD, resterande 100 000 USD finansieras av andra lokala samarbetspartners.</narrative>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The International labour Organisation (ILO) together with a fellow UN agency, the Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO) developed a joint programme on &#x201C; Decent Work and Food Security through Rural Youth Entrepreneurship Development in Zambia&#x201D;. ILO as a lead agency applied to Sida for funding amounting to 46,075 MSEK (approximately $7 million USD) to implement this programme during the period 2013-17. The objective of this intervention is to contribute to addressing the high unemployment challenges faced by the youth especially in the formal sectors.

Sida approved the proposal with the condition that the project would be divided into two phases: Phase 1 was the inception and lasted 12 months with the budget of 17,4 MSEK. The second phase of the programme is the implementation phase to last 36 months. Financing of the second phase is subject to the following conditions. The intervention&#x2019;s total budget is approximately $7,4 million USD, out of which Sida&#x2019;s contribution is $7,million US dollars and the remaining $400,000 US dollars is contributed by ILO ($200,000 USD), FAO ($100,000 USD) and ($100,000) other local partners.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The interventions has three objectives as follows;
Objective 1: A more enabling business environment for young entrepreneurs to start and formalise businesses in soybean and aquaculture. This objective covers three outputs: the policy and regulatory environment; stakeholder exposure to knowledge; and awareness of business opportunities in the sectors.
Objective 2: More young people respond to economic opportunities in soybeans and aquaculture market systems
This objective also covers three outputs: Development of effective input supply systems; Increased supply of non-financial business development support services; and technical skills development for young entrepreneurs.
Objective 3: Value chain development partners along the Soy Beans and Aquaculture value chains collaborate and coordinate effectively and efficiently
This objective required Yapasa to continue to work with SoPAG (Association for Soya Beans stakeholders) and in conjunction with Food Trade East and Southern Africa. YAPASA also worked with ADAZ (Association for Fish stakeholders). ADAZA maintains stakeholder coordination forums and worked well together with Young Emerging Farmers Initiative (YEFI). Further, Yapasa worked with a small group of agro dealers, fish feed and fingerling suppliers, together with staff of the Department of Fisheries to run the series of demonstrations.</narrative>

   <description>
    <narrative xml:lang="EN">The results achieved under this intervention are summarised as follows;
1. All the planned activities aimed at influencing changes in policy, legal and regulatory provisions for soya and aquaculture value chains were achieved. ILO facilitated the formation of Aquaculture Development Association of Zambia (ADAZ) and Soybean Policy Action Group (SoPAG). These two organisations under the auspices of ILO undertook various activities that aimed at influencing policies in favour of the two value chains.
2. ILO facilitated stakeholder exposure and knowledge on international best practice in supporting young entrepreneurs in aquaculture and soybeans value chains. Several study tours were done within and outside the country to expose the stakeholders to the best practices of the two value chains. It was reported that the beneficiaries had their capacities improved because of these exposure visits.
3.ILO facilitated social marketing campaigns to disseminate information of business opportunities in soya and aquaculture value. During the period of implementation, several information dissemination activities were held. The notable activities were field days (26 field days, 2 field days per year), 13 radio and television episodes, awareness workshops on the business opportunities. There was an increase in number of target beneficiaries with improved information and knowledge toward business opportunities in rural areas. The 2017/18 market survey revealed that 51% were concerned about output markets and 58% felt they had sufficient knowledge. According to the 2018/19 impact assessment 75% of farmers bought inputs from Community Agro Dealers (CADS). The farmers indicated that they were purchasing inputs primarily for commercial reasons indicating a good attitude towards business opportunity in their local rural areas.
4. The input supply system for the two value chain was developed whereby various value chains actors were engaged by the project. For instance, there were about 12 out-grower operators (10 for soya and 2 for aquaculture), there were 4 input suppliers and 2 hatcheries established. These value chain actors provided direct services to the wider outreach in addition to the young farmers. In total there was an estimated number of 14,626 producers/enterprises who benefited from either the soya or aquaculture or other off season (e.g. horticultural) enterprises. This was done through improved local access to inputs and advice via CADs or through improving the quality of their main crop produce and easier market access through the community aggregation centres. It was estimated that 55% of these producers were youth.
5. There was an increased supply of non-financial business development services to support youth enterprises. Several individuals were trained as trainers for BDS service provision. The BDS-trainers successfully servicing young entrepreneurs in the targeted sectors. Therefore, many young entrepreneurs were reportedly attending business start-up and business management training. The 2017 impact assessment report indicates that 77% of the 2,404 Soybean farmers of which 52% youth (962 young farmers) received basic agribusiness management/ economics of production training. Similarly, in Aquaculture 105 fish farmers of which 81% youth (85 young farmers) received basic agribusiness management/ economics of production training.
6. The technical skills of young entrepreneurs to use production and processing technologies improved over the period of the project. Several young entrepreneurs receiving production skills training in soybean, aquaculture or agriculture related activities was reported to have up. By the end of 2017, it was reported that a total of 2,505 smallholder soya producers had benefited from technical training through being involved in soya out grower schemes. 53% of these were youth (1,323 of which 952 males, 371 female). A further 105 farmers were involved in fish outgrowing of which 81% were youth (85 of which 54 males, 31 female). After broadening the scope of the project beyond the specific value chains into broader market functions significantly larger numbers of producers were supported. From the CAD model alone 10,878 farmers bought inputs and received production information 61% were youth (6,649 of which 4,494 male and 2,155 female).
7. Multi-stakeholder engagement was undertaken to encourage leading industry players to support the business models and encourage additional downstream partners to adopt them. Therefore, partner and non-partner market actors leveraged their resources to adopt, adapt and expand the business innovations facilitated by the project. Private sector investment leveraged and co-created sustainable and pro-poor business models. For instance, over the life of the YAPASA project twenty eight such partnerships committed their own investment of USD 641,912 against the business practices complementing the USD 364,350 invested by the project. Generally, partner market players in general express satisfaction with the business innovations brought out in their business processes. They were optimistic that the innovations will result in profitability and will support expansion of their businesses on a sustainable basis.
8. Unemployment is not really the issue in rural Zambia, where almost everyone is involved in productive activity, rather underemployment is the issue and the ability to earn a sustainable and viable living from that productive activity. The project has contributed to increases in productive hours spent by beneficiaries, their family members and to a lesser extent neighbours (in the form of hired labour) and thus has contributed to reducing underemployment in project areas.
9. Further there is a connection between the extra hours worked using improved inputs and knowledge and some increases in income. However, the value of the increase was generally insufficient to raise a family enterprise&#x2019;s income above the basic minimum wage for rural general workers and thus it is hard to state that the extra FTE jobs generated constitute Decent work based on income alone.
10. Smallholder farmers, among them a substantial number of youth, have benefited from increased association through farmer groupings or networks, opportunities have been observed for skills development and information has been made available on the safety issues associated with use of agricultural chemicals, all of which are also elements of decent work agenda.</narrative>
