   <narrative xml:lang="SV">Insatsen avser st&#xF6;d till African Population and Health Research Center (APHRC) f&#xF6;r insatsen &quot;Understanding the context of, and addressing sensitive sexual and reproductive health and rights issues in sub-Saharan Africa&#x201D; 2018-2022.

Insatsen fokuserar p&#xE5; de mest omtvistade delarna av SRHR-agendan, s&#xE4;rskilt r&#xE4;tten och tillg&#xE5;ng till s&#xE4;ker och laglig abort, ungdomars tillg&#xE5;ng till SRHR-interventioner, inklusive sexualupplysning, och m&#xE4;nskliga r&#xE4;ttigheter inklusive, yttrandefrihet och f&#xF6;reningsfrihet, samt tillg&#xE5;ng till sexuella och reproduktiva och andra h&#xE4;lsotj&#xE4;nster f&#xF6;r hbtqi-personer. Dessa tre delar av SRHR-agendan &#xE4;r mest eftersatta och m&#xF6;ter st&#xF6;rst motst&#xE5;nd p&#xE5; kontinenten.

M&#xE5;let med programmet &#xE4;r att generera och st&#xF6;dja anv&#xE4;ndningen av lokalt f&#xF6;rankrad forskning och evidens f&#xF6;r att f&#xF6;rb&#xE4;ttra inkorporering och genomf&#xF6;randen av globala och regionala SRHR-&#xE5;taganden i nationell lagstiftning, policy och riktlinjer f&#xF6;r att p&#xE5; s&#xE5; vis &#xF6;ka tillg&#xE5;ng till s&#xE4;ker abort f&#xF6;r kvinnor, &#xF6;ka tillg&#xE5;ng till SRHR-interventioner f&#xF6;r ungdomar och motverka social exkludering av hbtqi-personer.

Programmet f&#xF6;rv&#xE4;ntats bidrag till f&#xF6;ljande &#xF6;vergripande resultat:

&#x2022; Regionalt och lokalt genererad policyrelevant forskning och evidens som kan ligga till grund f&#xF6;r st&#xE4;rkt beslutsfattande, resursf&#xF6;rdelning och implementering av policy och program f&#xF6;r SRHR, som n&#xE5;r alla populationer oavsett &#xE5;lder, k&#xF6;n, sexuell l&#xE4;ggning eller k&#xF6;nsidentitet.

&#x2022; Att kunskap och forskning i h&#xF6;gre grad anv&#xE4;nds som ett verktyg f&#xF6;r att p&#xE5;verka och informera beslut som leder till b&#xE4;ttre politik, smartare resursf&#xF6;rdelning, som m&#xF6;jligg&#xF6;r skalbara och replikerbara SRHR-l&#xF6;sningar f&#xF6;r f&#xF6;rb&#xE4;ttrad h&#xE4;lsa och v&#xE4;lbefinnande f&#xF6;r ungdomar och kvinnor som s&#xF6;ker aborttj&#xE4;nster samt hbtqi-personer.

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The contribution aims to support APHRC&#x2019;s programme titled &#x201C;Understanding the context of, and addressing sensitive sexual and reproductive health and rights issues in sub-Saharan Africa&#x201D; 2018-2022.

The contribution aims to address one of the slowest areas of progress in sub-Sarhan Africa, namely tackling the most sensitive parts of the sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) issues, particularly the right and access to safe and legal abortion, young people&#x2019;s access to SRHR interventions, including comprehensive sexuality education, and the human rights and freedom of expression and association, and access to sexual and reproductive and other health services among LGBTI people. These are the three &#x201C;most left behind&#x201D; SRHR agendas.

The overarching goal of the programme is to generate and support the use of evidence to drive change and improve domestication and implementation of policies at national and regional levels that increase access to safe abortion for women and SRHR interventions for adolescents, and mitigate exclusion of sexual minorities.
The programme aims to deliver the following three results:

&#x2022; Impact 1: An African-generated corpus of evidence is at the basis of policymaking, resource allocation and translation of policy into best practice in SRHR, reaching all populations regardless of age, sex or sexual or gender identity.
&#x2022; Impact 2: Evidence is used as a tool to influence and inform decisions that ultimately result in better policy, smarter resource allocation, scale and replication of best practice in order to improve health and wellbeing outcomes for youth, women seeking abortion services and LGBTI people.
&#x2022; Impact 3: African institutions (researcher, decision-making and CSO-institutions) are better generators, interpreters and users of research and are using those skills to achieve greater impact in policy deliberations and execution of better practices

The regional work will harness synergies with existing Sida-supported programming at the level of the Southern African Development Community, East African Community and explore entry-points to the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) in order to meet identified evidence needs for improved policy formulation, implementation and resourcing within those economic blocs. It will also explore how evidence can support the domestication and implementation of global and regional policy instruments.

At national level, APHRC will implement the program in Burkina Faso, Kenya, Liberia, Malawi, Rwanda, Sierra Leone and Zambia &#x2013; countries identified as presenting realistic opportunities to evolve the policy environment and enhance service delivery for liberal policymaking and implementation to reach adolescents with targeted SRHR services; improve access to safe abortion; and minimize the barriers that prevent LGBTI people from accessing basic services for health, education, livelihoods and well-being.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The programme goal of the intervention is to generate and support the use of evidence to drive change and improve domestication and implementation of policies at national and regional levels that increase access to safe abortion for women and SRHR services for adolescents, and mitigate exclusion of sexual minorities.
The regional work will look to harness synergies with existing Sida-supported programming at the level of the SADC and the EAC, in order to meet identified evidence needs for improved policy formulation, implementation and resourcing within those economic blocs and how evidence can support the domestication and implementation of regional and global commitments.&#xA0;The programmewill also explore opportunities to engage ECOWAS.
As noted above, at national level APHRC will implement this program in Burkina Faso, Kenya, Liberia, Malawi, Rwanda, Sierra Leone and Zambia  countries, identified as presenting realistic opportunities to evolve the policy environment and enhance service delivery for liberal policymaking and implementation to reach adolescents with targeted SRHR services; improve access to safe abortion; and minimize the barriers that prevent LGBTI people from accessing basic services for health, education, livelihoods and wellbeing.
The goal will be achieved through implementing three complementary approaches for maximum impact: policy-oriented evidence generation; collaborative advocacy with existing networks; and capacity strengthening in the use of evidence to achieve change at both the policy and practice levels. The three complementary approaches are articulated as three strategic objectives each with a corresponding impact result:
Impact 1: An African-generated corpus of evidence is at the basis of policymaking, resource allocation and translation of policy into best practice in SRHR, reaching all populations regardless of age, sex or sexual or gender identity.&#xA0;
Strategic Objective #1: By 2022, APHRC is a demonstrable leader in generating, consolidating, interpreting and sharing evidence to provide a solid foundation for improved domestication, implementation and resourcing of policy instruments that seek to overcome access barriers to contextual, appropriate and effective SRHR services to meet the needs of adolescents, sexual minorities and women seeking safe abortion services, within the context of national strategies to achieve universal health coverage.
Outcomes objective #1:

1. APHRC is go-to knowledge partner for decision-making bodies, development partners and civil society networks, meeting articulated evidence needs to achieve identified goals in enhancing delivery and increasing uptake of SRHR services2. Committed actors have a more comprehensive understanding of the bottlenecks and limitations in domesticating policy instruments to guide improved and equitable access to SRH services with a rights-based approach to their delivery
Generation of policy-oriented evidence - summary of activites: The overall objective of the research agenda is to provide a solid evidence-informed foundation for improved domestication, implementation and resourcing of policy instruments that seek to overcome access barriers to contextual, appropriate and effective SRH services to meet the needs of adolescents, sexual minorities and women seeking safe abortion services. A regional research agenda will be developed, co-created with a range of different partners at national and regional level, and informed by systematic reviews of published and grey literature.
Seven countries with a wide geographic, economic and political range (Kenya, Rwanda, Burkina Faso, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Malawi and Zambia) have been included in the programme for in-depth scoping and landscaping, to gauge the extent to which there was room to develop and drive an evidence-informed agenda to achieve change in policy and practice around each of the three issues of concern. Countries were selected based on a set criterion if they were considered to be at a tipping point: with ample civic space and possibility for political will to achieve tangible progress in ensuring access to SRH services for the populations in question within an enabling and rights-affirming environment.
The review identified countries where there is the potential to revise or rethink existing legislation to improve the protection of the rights of sexual minorities and to ensure access to quality SRH services including safe abortion  but where there is divergence between the policy environment and actual practice.&#xA0;
Impact 2: Evidence is used as a tool to influence and inform decisions that ultimately result in better policy, smarter resource allocation, scale and replication of best practice in order to improve health and wellbeing outcomes for youth, women seeking abortion services and LGBTI people.
Strategic Objective #2: By 2022, APHRC has cultivated and nurtured alliances and partnerships with critical regional audiences and stakeholders including policymakers and implementers by engaging in existing communities of practice and networks, to contribute to the co-creation and sharing of relevant and timely evidence to inspire awareness, understand perceptions and foster social and legislative change to improve the health and wellbeing of young people, women seeking abortion services and sexual and gender minorities.
Outcomes objective #2:&#xA0;
1. APHRC is an integral partner within networks of change agents, sharing knowledge and technical assistance to translate that knowledge into policy recommendations at both the grassroots and policy development level2. Civil society networks are confident users of evidence as a lever of influence in their ongoing advocacy to drive change in policy and practice3. Decision-makers seek evidence-informed arguments to enhance their deliberation and provide a way forward for the execution of strategies to domesticate and better implement policies4. Stakeholders at the demand-generation and supply-provision levels can recommend how scalable solutions can be adopted or adapted to effectively respond to SRHR needs of women, adolescents and LGBTI people
Using evidence to advocate for change - summary of activites: APHRC will strategically cultivate and nurture partnerships with critical bodies including regional economic communities, implementers, professional unions and civil society organizations through the convening of, and participation in, communities of practice to co-create, share and use evidence to stimulate awareness, understand perceptions, and foster social and legislative change. This will include, but not be limited to, ensuring a rights-based approach to mitigate the exclusion of sexual minorities; and catalyzing commitments by governments to increased and sustained investment in provision of SRHR services that are contextual, targeted and responsive to the needs of adolescents, sexual minorities and women seeking safe abortion services.
Under this objective, APHRC will also develop a rapid-response mechanism for quickly providing information for use in policy-oriented discussions at both the regional and national level, for use by the key evidence users identified during the inception period. The rapid-response platform will allow for demand-driven evidence synthesis from existing, reputable databases of health and wellbeing indicators related to the three issues, packaged in a format that is easy to use.
As a complementary adjunct to this objective, APHRC will collaborate with the Guttmacher Institute to develop an evidence-informed strategy to promote SRHR as a cornerstone of universal health coverage, using the $9 per person/year recommendation that emerged from the May 2018 report by the Guttmacher-Lancet Commission on Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights. This also links to the ongoing &quot;team Sweden&quot; policy initiative to integrate SRHR into the Universal Health Care agenda.
Impact 3: African institutions (researcher, decision-making and CSO-institutions) are better generators, interpreters and users of research and are using those skills to achieve greater impact in policy deliberations and execution of better practices
Strategic Objective #3: To strengthen the capacity of academic institutions to carry out timely, policy-relevant and translatable research that can be used by a well-grounded network of civil society actors and decision-makers to achieve change in both policy and practice that improves health and wellbeing outcomes for youth, women seeking abortion services and sexual and gender minorities.
Outcomes objective #3:
1. The quality of research emerging from African institutions is of global standard and respected as a valuable contribution to the global corpus of evidence2. The comfort with which African decision-makers uses evidence prompts demand for more policy-relevant information for debate and discussion3. Civil society advocates predicate campaigns for change on a sound base of data, knowledge and evidence that can also demonstrate the consequences of inaction
Strengthening capacity to use evidence to achieve change - summary of activites: To strengthen the capacity of SRHR advocacy organizations and policy actors in sub-Saharan Africa to identify gaps that can lead to connecting evidence to action; document learning; catalyze change at the policy and resourcing level using evidence; and promote the adaptation or adoption of scalable solutions to effectively respond to SRHR needs of women, adolescents and LGBTI people. To deliver on this objective, the APHRC team will build both internal and external capacity.
Internally, APHRC will strengthen its capacity in the monitoring and evaluation of advocacy  both at the process level as well as at the impact level. Externally, APHRC will strengthen the capacity of a cohort of researchers through hands-on training in research methodologies such as evidence reviews, economic and financial modelling, knowledge translation and evidence-driven advocacy. The researchers will be identified from the seven selected countries and will work with APHRC staff to generate some of the evidence needed by policy actors in those countries.
APHRC will also strengthen the capacity of policy actors and civil society to analyze, synthesize, interpret and use evidence for policy development and advocacy.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">In the first period of implementation, the CPSE team launched the project
with five full time staff and seven consultants. It should be noted that during the first
year, there were some significant challenges in project set up.
Collaboration between different units which is core to the project, became a challenge as
different incentives that drive the policy unit versus the research unit materialized. There
was also a change in project lead from the policy unit to the research unit. As part of the
inception, there was a reframing of the results framework around the more classic
research outputs and incentives to publish academic papers in journals, presentation and
conferences, at the expense of the more policy oriented outcomes which the CPSE
project set out to achieve in line with its overall strategy. This required extensive dialogue
between Sida and APHRC.
Sida and APHRC spent substantive time together working on the results framework of
the project to align with key inception phase deliverables in the original proposal, as key
APHRC staff who had been part of conceptualizing the programme were moved to other
functions within the organization. APHRC&apos;s capacity to develop a Monitoring, Evaluation and Learning system (MEL) based on outcome harvesting was overestimated. APHRC itself required substantive internal capacity building, which they
sourced through an external consultant.
APHRC&apos;s capacity to undertake political economy analysis was also over-estimated.
APHRC itself required substantive internal capacity building, which they sourced
through an external consultant in collaboration with HEARD.
Internal resistance to APHRC working on the more sensitive aspects of the SRHR
agenda also led to the need to focus on internal values clarification, and a strong
statement in support of CPSE was issued by their executive director.
Despite these challenges which were raised with the APHRC Executive Director and
leadership, APHRC met all inception requirements of the grant: established the project
results framework, drafted a research concept note and finalized 2020 work plans and
budget. CPSE has gone on to demonstrate its ability to influence initiate and participate
in regional research and legislative processes, a success hinged on strategic partnerships
built across the core objectives of the project described in the sections below.
CPSE has forged agreements with Eastern Africa National Networks of AIDS Service
Organizations (EANNASO), East African Community (EAC) / East African Legislative
Assembly (EALA) for specific points of collaborations to support key SRHR legislation
currently under debate in the regional bloc. Three memoranda of understandings were
signed with Southern Africa Development Cooperation Parliamentary Forum (SADCPF), Health Economics and HIV/AIDS Research Division (HEARD), and Statistics
Sierra Leone (Stats SL), and specific research work plans developed for the year 2020.
Other partners engaged include the Southern Africa Trust (SAT), and the UNFPA East
and souther Africa Regional Office (ESARO).
In all, eight regional and sub-regional policy bodies, national partners and civil society
organizations (CSOs) have agreed to establish and pursue collaborative relationships with
APHRC as an independent knowledge partner. While tangible outputs are yet to come
to fruition, the CPSE team also engaged the Network of African Parliamentary
Committees of Health (NEAPACOH), World Health Organization Africa regional
office, Economic Communities of West African States, the West African Health
Organization and the African Union sub-cluster on Sexuality Education for the
Continental Strategy on Education for Health and Well-being for adolescents and young
people in Africa.
Objective 1: Strengthening partnerships and core capacities of research
teams, advocacy and policy partners.
Internally, the CPSE project engaged other departments and staff to strengthen its
competencies in MEL and outcome harvesting, political economic analysis (PEA), and
Values Clarification and Attitude Training (VCAT) to build tolerance in APHRC
concerning attitudes and ease engaging on SRHR issues.

So far, 19 APHRC staff have completed the VCATs and demonstrated greater empathy
for the work of CPSE and ability to confidently talk about the project to APHRC staff
and externally. The training improved APHRCs human resource policy, that now
includes trainings on safety and security for researchers undertaking work on sensitive
areas.
CPSE staff in particular were also trained on problem-based political-economy analysis
(PB-PEA), a research skill needed to undertake an analysis of the opportunities and
barriers to health care access.
Trainings on outcome harvesting as an approach to MEL/outcome harvesting was
conducted for CPSE staff to enable them to identify, formulate, verify, analyze, and
interpret &apos;outcomes&apos; in programming contexts where relations of cause and effect are
complex.
Externally, CPSE has held consultations with nine partners that resulted in the
identification of mutual capacity needs and joint capacity development plans. For
instance, the CPSE team trained SADC PF researchers on quantitative and qualitative
research methods. The team also trained SADC PF researchers, legal drafters, clerks,
and other staff on the politics of SRHR terminologies.
As a result of CPSEs capacity building events, six partners used the information or skills
gained through CPSE capacity strengthening efforts, including the use of evidence. Five
policy and CSO actors sought and used relevant evidence in policy and legislative
forums/ debates on regional, sub-regional and national commitments on access to safe
abortion and Post Abortion Care (PAC), comprehensive adolescent SRHR services and
non-discrimination of LGBTI groups. These results will need to be verified via site visits
and at the mid-term review of the project.
Objective 2: Research and Evidence Generation
This pillar is anchored on the successful development of a co-created regional research
agenda in partnership with key continental and regional partners described above. A
two-day policy-civil society-research dialogue was held in October 2019, in Nairobi that
brought over 40 key government, civil society, academic, and technical partners together.
The agenda set out to pinpoint the evidence needed to catalyze positive change on
adolescent sexual and reproductive health and rights; access to safe abortion, postabortion care and the rights of sexual minorities.
As a result, three scoping reviews for LGBTI, adolescent SRHR, and abortion were
drafted by the end of 2019, and policy analyses reports for all seven countries were
initiated, with four desk reviews completed for Kenya, Malawi and Zambia, and Sierra
Leone.

However, progress under this objective was delayed due to lengthy protocol and ethics
approval processes. Much of the research was expected to be approved and initiated by
2020 at the time of reporting.
Objective 3: Supporting use of Evidence by Partners and Policy makers
In 2019, CPSE approached key partners with an initial offering on the kinds of evidence
and knowledge products it provides. As a result, and in addition to the successful
establishment with key partners in East and Southern Africa, CPSE was invited to
present findings of its early research work at key events to promote the use of evidence in
eight workshops and partner events such as deliberations to inform the East African
SRHR Bill.
For instance, CPSEs role was recognized in reconciling the current evidence with
regards to the EAC SRHR bill, identify evidence gaps (what kinds of evidence needs to
be collected, collect sufficient evidence, package the evidence well for specific groups to
inform the redrafting of the process, in a report of the EAC Roundtable Joint technical
manager&apos;s meeting for reproductive, maternal, neonatal, child, adolescent health and
nutrition, HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and sexually transmitted infections held in Nairobi on
the 24th-27th September 2019.
CPSEs support to key legislative processes is complemented by the launch of the rapid
response service. This online solution was developed and shared with partners in 2019, to
facilitate the provision, in a timely manner, of rapidly produced, high-quality, synthesized
evidence to our regional and sub-regional policy and CSO partners in the African
region. Reports on the use of the rapid response service was not available at the time of
reporting, but is expected in 2020.</narrative>
