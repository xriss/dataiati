State Mapping &#x2013; Built participants knowledge and ongoing efforts to track progressive States statements and amplify these on social media as well as tracking retrogressive positions by various States. Safety and security &#x2013; Through the creation of a WhatsApp group, there was an opportunity to keep abreast with any security threats and share among participants. The group on media and communication developed a social media strategy and used hashtag #Kenyans4ICPD to increase conversations around ICPD+25.

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">We had a session with 15 CSOs on developing key messages and shared ideas on different strategies the participating organisations used to talk about their advocacy work . In addition we held a session with 20 youth SRHR champions to understand misinformation around SRHR issues and what responses would help address the misconceptions. A community meeting with 20 participants was also held to deliberate of what IEC materials would be effective at the community level. Some of the IEC materials and strategies suggested by the community members were: (1) Branding the exercise books cover page with SRHR information to reach adolescents and young people at school. (2) Branding; Wrist bands, t-shirts, Leso, scarfs, pamphlets and reflector for boda boda riders. (3) Hosting SRHR campaign functions like football tournaments, talent shows and open forums. (4) Community radio talk shows . (5) Digital SRHR campaigns using digital platforms</narrative>

     <narrative xml:lang="EN">On Number of CSOs &amp; CBOs trained in strategy development for legal, communication &amp; Security, we engaged CSOs and by engaging the CSOs we were able to get a contextualised understanding of SRHR opposition and interventions they had developed to counter them. This helped to inform our conversations with county officials as we had a better understanding of the issues affecting the CSOs in those counties.
The aim of the meetings in the two counties were as follows:
Sensitise CSO representatives from the two counties on opposition trends and tactics.
 To build a wealth of knowledge on opposition trends and tactics in both counties and mitigation measures. 

 In Nakuru, we engaged 20 SRHR activists while in Kisumu we engaged 17 CSO representatives.</narrative>

Today the petition has collected 6035 signatures.  Femicide in particular has become very rampant with reports from the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics reporting a record 26 cases in the first 3 months of 2021.
