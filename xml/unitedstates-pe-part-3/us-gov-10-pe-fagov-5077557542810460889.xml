    <narrative xml:lang="EN">U.S. assistance builds the capacity of Peruvian institutions to combat transnational organized crime more effectively, improve citizen security and social inclusion, sustainably manage Peru&apos;s diverse and fragile environment, and expand the benefits of Peru&apos;s economic progress to more of its citizens. Peru is one of the world&apos;s largest cocaine producers, a major money laundering center, a principal source of illegally logged timber and illegally mined gold, and the largest source of counterfeit U.S. currency worldwide. While economic growth has slowed for the past two years due to a slump in international commodity prices and the failure to implement second generation reforms, successive Peruvian governments have pursued judicious, market-based economic policies yielding over a decade of economic growth averaging five percent, which has halved poverty rates, reduced infant mortality, increased lifespans, and expanded access to education. Peru is one of the United States&apos; most steadfast democratic partners in the region, and the continuation of bi-lateral assistance advances U.S. national security and economic interests.</narrative>
