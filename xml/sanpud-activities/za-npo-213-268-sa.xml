       <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Deputy Minister of Social Development, Hendrietta Bogopane-Zulu, plans to replicate the Bellhaven model in other parts of the country. The roll out will be done in partnership with SANPUD, who is formally recognised as a partner of the Ministry. There will be a separate proposal for this as part of the strategic investment fund. The model requires some explanation and have attached a brief overview. 
SANPUD continue to advise the National Department of Health and Social Development on matters affecting people who used drugs. In 2021 SANPUD provided input, leadership and support for the joint hepatitis plan for Department of Health and Department of Social Development, led the development of OST guidelines, SANPUD led on getting Methadone and Buprenorphine onto the National Essential Drugs List. The significantly changed National Drug Master Plan is being implemented, and SANPUD is regularly holding various stakeholders accountable. The National Drug Master Plan was developed over several years with inpud from communities and stakeholders. We cannot openly discuss how we ensure the five principles were included. But it involves a lot of private meetings with key stakeholders individually.</narrative>

      <narrative xml:lang="EN">South Africa has well-developed civil society and community-led organisations, with communities of sex workers and LGBTIQ+ communities displaying world-class organizing and advocacy. Approximately 10% of the organisations are youth-led and 60% refer to women-led CSOs in the country. Despite a restrictive policy environment, sex workers are well-organised. The community of people who use drugs, while more recent in their organizing, also serves as a regional leader. For example in 2017 the national network, SANPUD, was established. SANPUD has ten members of PWUD-led groups and informal organisations. Through support of Bridging the Gaps, TB HIV Care has started-up the first South African comprehensive harm reduction programme in 2016. Currently, South Africa has four harm reduction projects aimed at HIV prevention among people who inject drugs. One funded by the Global Fund operates in four cities: Cape Town, eThekwini &amp; Nelson Mandela Bay are run by TBHIV Care as the Step Up Project, the Johannesburg site is under the care of Anova Health. PEPFAR/CDC fund the HARMless project in Pretoria, and the University of Pretoria department of family medicine has secured funds to run a community oriented substance use programme (COSUP). Other organisations include Anova Health, TB HIV Care and Foundation for Professional Development.</narrative>

A total of 54 people were invited across 14 different organisations with 20 people attending across the 14 organisations. Only 3 organisations (Bellhaven (community-led), THC (community-led and PLHIV) and STAND (community-led)) that attended the training successfully obtained funding and 1 (Siyasonke) (youth and community-led) went on to be able to apply for funding from alternative sources as they were more confident in putting in proposals. However, in total 14 organisations were strengthened from this training in their ability to apply for funding. The overall result is an increase in capacity and knowledge of the networks and organisations.</narrative>
