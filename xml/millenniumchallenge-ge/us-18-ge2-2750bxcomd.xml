  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Georgia II compact sought to increase the earning potential of Georgians through improvements in the quality of education in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields, including strategic investments in general education, technical training and advanced degree programs. The compact also aimed to increase women?s participation in STEM professions. MCC?s partnership with Georgia is a strong example of how the U.S. government promotes economic growth, helps people lift themselves out of poverty and invests in future generations around the world. Through this $140 million grant, the next generation of Georgians will be enabled to enter the workforce with the skills needed to make Georgia a more prosperous and stable country.</narrative>
