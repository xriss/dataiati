   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Promoting Active Participation of Women, Men and Youths in the Electoral Process</narrative>
  </title>
  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">There is growing passive participation of women and youths in the electoral process in the country. Causes include, low awareness among women and youths of their civic rights and responsibilities in the electoral process (mainly due to low access to information); inadequate measures to ensure protection and respect of human rights of women and youths and the discriminatory practices on women and youths that promotes unfair participation in the electoral process.  Low awareness among women and youths of their civic rights and responsibilities in the electoral process has also caused abuse of women and youths in the election process and reducing their dignity. Women being objectified and used to campaign for their male counterparts, while youths are used as tools of violence against other candidates. Addressing these challenges calls for increased women and youth voices in key decision making, hence the need to enhance active participation of women and youth in the electoral process.

The proposed project will implement activities in two phases: pre; and post elections in the Lusaka Archdiocese. These activities will raise awareness on civil rights and responsibilities among women, men and youth, enhance the capacities of women, men and youth to effectively participate in the electoral process and will further build the capacities of the media to promote gender and youth responsive coverage during the electoral process respectively. Additionally, the project will build capacities of elected leaders, women, men and youth for them to effectively perform elected official duties.</narrative>
