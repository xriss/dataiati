  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project seeks to improve self-reliance and food security of 1,500 refugee households from Democratic Republic of Congo in Mantapala Refugee Settlement through provision of agriculture inputs, technical and business-skills training, extension services and improved access to market and financial services. By February 2018, Zambia had received over 18,000 refugees from the Democratic Republic of Congo since January 2017. Luapula Province has been struck by a steady influx of refugees from the DRC, specifically from the areas of Pweto in Haut Katanga, and Moba, in Tanganyika Province, fleeing increased fighting between the government forces and non-state armed groups. All recognized refugees entering into Zambia through Luapula province on an average rate of 100 per day are transported to Kenani Transit Centre. However, with just 56 hectares, the site will soon run out of absorption capacity hence a new site named Mantapala located in Nchelenge district is being developed into a permanent refugee settlement. Mantapala Settlement is 5,100 ha with capacity to host 25,000 refugees. A total of 222 refugees were relocated from Kenani to Mantapala during January. It is expected that by April another 2000 will have moved. Refugees relocated to Mantapala Refugee Settlement have no access to livelihoods and mostly rely on the food assistance which can be provided only for limited period of time. Locality is remote without any services and developed markets. Further, the Zambian host community in this location suffers high poverty rates (80% of the host community lives under the poverty line).
This project therefore aims to provide livelihood interventions to contribute to stabilization, improved food security and nutrition of refugee population who move to Mantapala Settlement from Kenani Transit Centre. Further, the project will also seek to increase resilience and self-reliance of both refugees and host communities in Mantapala Settlement in long term.</narrative>
