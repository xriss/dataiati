  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">During the 2018/2019 crop production season, the Southern region of Zambia experienced the effects of one of its worst droughts in decades. Southern Province, which was the worst affected, had late rainfall which came in mid-December 2018 instead of either late October or early November and experienced prolonged dry spells between January and March, 2019. As a result, overall crop production declined. Based on a Rapid Assessment of Crop Conditions after Prolonged Dry Spells in Selected Districts, the Disaster Management and Mitigation Unit in Zambia indicated that crop condition for the assessed districts in Southern province was deemed to be poor and estimated that over 80% of the crops was affected in the Province. Based on a similar assessment undertaken by Caritas Monze in April 2019, data collected shows that 72% (estimated 83,654) households in the operational areas of the Diocese of Monze, had complete maize crop failure despite having cultivated and planted fields averaging 3 hectares per household. 

Due to recurrent droughts prone in Southern Province which has led to a cumulative impact of declining crop production particularly from the 2016/17 and 2017/18 farming season, most of the households have depleted their livelihood asset base to secure food consumption. The proposed response therefore aims to contribute to the overall efforts to support the most affected households in Pemba, Namwala and Gwembe Districts of Southern province in recovering from the adverse effects of the drought through the provision of life-saving food assistance and access to safe water that could cover their early recovery needs. The response will complement some of the existing government responses, such as maize distribution, which has been assessed to cover less than half of the population of the target communities impacted by the drought.</narrative>
