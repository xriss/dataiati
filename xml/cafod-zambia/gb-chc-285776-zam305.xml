   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Zambia is vulnerable to the effects of climate change because of its geographic exposure, low incomes and dependence on subsistence farming. Like other sub-Saharan countries, it is already suffering from the effects of climate change. There has been a decline in rainfall and as such Zambia is experiencing more frequent and intense dry spells. These trends are expected to intensify in the future with projected temperatures expected to increase by at least 2&#xB0;C by 2070 (PPCR, 2014).  Analysis from the Pilot Programme for Climate Resilience (PPCR) shows that the climate change has a large impact on development in Zambia, and the climate variability includes low frequency-high impact, extreme weather events (e.g. droughts and floods) and high probability-low impact weather events (e.g. erratic rainfall, warmer days and nights). This has affected yields in most parts of the country and has seen an increase in the price of maize (staple food requirement in Zambia) and common vegetables such as Chinese cabbage and rape. According to the Central Statistics Office  the price of a 20 litre maize grain, 1 kg of Chinese cabbage and 1 kg of rape has increased by 20%, 15% and 29% respectively from May 2015 -May 2016. The increase in such essential foods has led to most community members on BLF project to have poorer nutrition which is a disadvantage on their health because they are living with HIV.
The project communities who were provided with agricultural inputs (maize seed and fertilizer) last year (2015), experienced erratic rainfall which led to late germination and therefore resulted into a poor yield in most sites. The poor yield on the project has resulted in reduced income for most of the communities because it now means that their yield will be for consumption at the household level and selling. If the yield was abundant, the communities would earn some income through selling the surplus. In addition, the poor yield also means a lack of surplus maize seed that can be shared with other communities, thereby inhibiting the scale-up of the livelihood intervention on the BLF project. In order to mitigate (both prevent and pre-empt) the impact of change in climate, several interventions are hereby proposed to create a more sustainable and resilient approach towards livelihood in the affected communities.</narrative>
