  </title>
  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Under the laws of Zambia, every person has a right to access justice. But the situation on the Copperbelt Province does not allow most people, especially the vulnerable poor to access justice because of the continued complicated nature of court processes. Further, access to legal services continues to be a major challenge by the vulnerable especially women and children because of high legal fees. The other obstacle is high levels of illiteracy and also ignorance of the law and legal procedures especially among women. In the rural areas of the Copperbelt, the only recourse for most rural women and children is customary law that tends to perpetuate the abuse of children and young girls. The perpetrator is fined to compensate the victim&#x2019;s family, with offences that would attract substantial sentence under statutory law receiving cursory punishment under customary law. 
The community of the Copperbelt  province therefore needs interventions to safe guard all forms of rights, particularly those of the women and girls ranging from the right for them to enjoy their youth, right to good education, right to land, protection from all forms of sexual abuse and any form of modern day slavery. The communities need to be sensitized on human rights and how communities can take part in the empowerment exercise of these victims of violations of human rights, starting at household level.
The Paralegal Support Programme has been a response to violations of women&#x2019;s and children&#x2019;s rights in households and communities on the Copperbelt province. The Programme has thus been focusing on reducing the violations of women and girls rights through free legal advice/aid, legal representation, psycho-social counseling, and mediation. The programme has also been involved in promotion of human rights, and advocacy through training of police, teachers, local authority and other concerned groups in paralegal, and raising awareness in the community through mobile legal clinics, newsletter, and publication of legal materials, media and drama. In as much as the Programme plans to continue with these activities, it also seeks to proactively involve the girls and women in the empowerment initiatives so that they grow in the awareness of their rights in households and communities. Broadly, the project will focus on the following activities to achieve impact: 
1. Promoting social justice by upholding human dignity and responsibilities for all 
2. Advocating for just policies to ensure social justice 
3. Providing checks and balances on governance issues 
4. Providing legal assistance to vulnerable women and children, whose rights are violated</narrative>
