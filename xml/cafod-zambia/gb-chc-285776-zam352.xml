   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Due to the unprecedented drought of 2019 that impacted more than half of Zambia, the price of mealie meal (Zambia&#x2019;s staple food) has been increasing every month due to the shortage of maize which was as a result of the crop failure. The rising food prices has had a particularly negative impact on the urban poor communities including those working with St. Francis. St. Francis&#x2019;s target group mainly includes people with HIV and mental health challenges and the rising price of mealie meal has had a negative impact on these families who are now failing to have a meal a day. Inadequate food is leading to non- adherence to medication which in turn is likely to lead to regression in their physical/ mental health and possibly death. In addition to this drought related situation, the COVID19 threatens to exacerbate the health of our clients due to their weakened immune system. 

This project aims to ensure that people living with HIV and Mental Health challenges have improved food security and are adhering to their drugs. The food provided is expected to help our Clients maintain proper adherence to their medication but also it will help them build a strong immunity which can help to prevent death in the event of infection from the coronavirus.</narrative>
