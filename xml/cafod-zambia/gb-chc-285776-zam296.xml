   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Reducing Stigma; Responding to HIV</narrative>
  </title>
  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In Zambia HIV and AIDS continues to be the major developmental challenge, with approximately 1 million people infected. Lusaka has a prevalence rate of approximately 22%, contributing to the national prevalence which still remains at above 20% and making Zambia one of the countries in Southern Africa hardest hit by HIV and AIDS.
This project, Reducing stigma, responding to HIV, aims to mitigate the impact of HIV by improving the quality of life of People Living with HIV and reducing vulnerability to new HIV infections in urban, peri-urban and rural Lusaka Province and the Central Province of Zambia. This project is holistic in addressing the major HIV challenges as highlighted by the communities within the Archdiocese of Lusaka, which include stigma. 
 The four specific areas of action &#x2013; reflected in the four outcomes - are:
1. Stigma and discrimination against PLHIV is measurably reduced, leading to increased health-seeking behavior
2. Improved knowledge, attitudes and practices around HIV prevention, leading to a reduction in higher-risk behaviors and reduced vulnerability to new infections and re-infections
3. An increased number of PLHIV access services and support, enabling them to live healthier and more productive lives
4. People living with and affected by HIV benefit from access to entrepreneurial training, savings and lending opportunities, resulting in improved household food security and income
The implementing partner of this project is Archdiocese of Lusaka with technical support from Network of People Living with HIV in Zambia and St Theresa Ibenga for over a period of 3 years. CAFOD will oversee the smooth running of the project with funding from the Big Lottery Fund of the UK State lotteries.</narrative>
