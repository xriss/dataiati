  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Karbala Cement Manufacturing Ltd (KCML) is an Iraqi company that entered in April 2010, into an agreement with the Government of Iraq for the leasing, rehabilitation and production-sharing of a state-owned cement plant in Karbala, southern Iraq for 15 years (starting October 2010).   The project entails a loan to support the development of KCMLs 2.3 million ton per annum (mtpa) cement plant located near Karbala, Iraq. This is a follow-on investment to KCML, with an earlier IFC investment made in 2012. The IFC loan will help KCML complete the rehabilitation of the cement plant. The rehabilitation work is being undertaken jointly by the original equipment supplier Polysius and Sinoma, an experienced Chinese EPC contractor.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The development impact of the Project is expected to include: (i) helping an existing client through a difficult time to ensure completion of the cement plant rehabilitation; (ii) increased supply of quality cement to meet Iraq&apos;&apos;s needs for reconstruction, and a corresponding reduction in the current domestic supply gap, which will help substitute imports and lead to foreign exchange savings; (iii) modernization and standard-setting of the cement sector in Iraq, which has historically been dominated by state-owned plants; (iv) demonstration effect of attracting other potential foreign investors who could help bring much-needed FDI into Iraq; (v) increased business opportunities for local small and medium enterprises (SMEs) involved along the supply chain, particularly in the areas of logistics and distribution.</narrative>
