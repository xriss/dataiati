  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Following more than fifty years of conflict between Government forces and Non-State Armed Groups (NSAGs), the country has finally reached a historic peace agreement. In this context, Humanitarian Mine Action (HMA) becomes central to the implementation of the peace process in order to facilitate improved security conditions, land restitution, IDP return, illicit crop substitution and sustainable rural socioeconomic development. This project has been developped against this background and in line with the Dutch Government policy on Security and Rule of Law (SRoL) in fragile states and its goal to improve human security. Cauca and Valle del Cauca are of particular interest due to their social vulnerability; they are home to the greatest Afro-Colombian and indigenous populations in the country which have been particularly affected over the last 50 years of conflict, suffering from weak land ownership rights, higher than average poverty rates and limited access to socio-economic facilities. Together, the four municipalities contain eight indigenous reservations and as a result, they have been included on the list of 44 municipalities selected for immediate post-conflict rapid response intervention in DAICMA&#x2019;s (the national HMA authority) Strategic Plan for 2016 - 2021.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The main strategic objective of HALO&#x2019;s proposed project is to protect the civilian population by saving lives and preventing injury from landmines and Explosive Remnants of War (ERW). This will create safe conditions that allow 152 outstanding land restitution requests to be processed and 4,945 IDPs to safely return to their homes. Dutch-funded HMA intervention will also facilitate socioeconomic growth and sustainable development by returning rural land to productive use and providing a source of employment to residents from mine-impacted communities. Additionally, the project will support peacebuilding and improve human security at a local level by involving both victims of the conflict and ex-combatants in community reconstruction and reconciliation processes, while also significantly empowering women in traditionally conservative rural areas of Colombia. Landmines and other ERW have posed a threat to local people and blocked vital resources in Cauca and Valle del Cauca for many years. It is vital for communities that they can use their own land without the risk of landmines or other ERW. Demining not only allows local people safe access and use of their land for agriculture, but also opens up the way for development projects, infrastructure and access to public services, all of which help to build local economies. By Colombian law, victims of the conflict cannot knowingly be put in danger, meaning that displaced people cannot return to places where there is a suspicion of landmines. HALO&#x2019;s work makes possible the return of displaced people, and restitution to those who have lost their land due to the conflict, by confirming the presence or absence of landmines in an area; once an area is reported to be free of the suspicion of landmines, these processes can go ahead. The demographic and social situation in Cauca and Valle del Cauca departments is one of the most diverse in Colombia, and poses specific challenges for HALO and this project. The municipalities of Miranda and Caloto both have large &#x201C;indigenous reserve&#x201D; areas, which are protected as autonomous areas by Colombian law. Equally, there are Community Councils (&#x201C;Consejos Comunitarios&#x201D;) which are made up of afro-colombian communities, indigenous communities, and palenqueras in the area, as well as Peasant Agricultural Reserves (Reservas Campesinas). Each of these communities has certain autonomous powers, individual cultures, and distinct histories of and attitudes towards the Colombian conflict.</narrative>
  </description>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project will generate 12,851 beneficiaries by releasing 548km2 of high-impact land, of which 36,000 m2 will be cleared manually. The intervention aims to provide HMA across 80 veredas in four municipalities, in the Cauca and Valle del Cauca departments in Colombia through clearance, survey, Risk Education (RE) and Victim Assistance (VA). ### Update July &apos;17: The demographic and social situation in the departments of Cauca and Valle del Cauca is one of the most diverse in Colombia, and poses specific challenges for HALO and this project. Throughout the region there are large &#x2018;indigenous reserve&#x2019; areas, which as autonomous areas are protected under Colombian law. Equally, there are Community Councils (Consejos Comunitarios) which are made up of Afro-Colombian communities, indigenous communities, as well as Peasant Agricultural Reserves (Reservas Campesinas). Each of these communities has certain autonomous powers, individual cultures, and distinct histories of and attitudes towards the Colombian conflict and HALO has had to secure permission to work in these different areas by community leaders. Given these social complexities in HALO&#x2019;s area of operation in the region, the approach to intervention has been cautious as not to upset the social and cultural balance. Since the beginning of operations in the area, community liaison has been essential to HALO establishing a presence and building trust with the local community, without which it would be impossible to work in the region. HALO is working hard to reinforce its neutrality and provide in depth explanation the work planned in the area. Given the history of fierce conflict and concentration of illicit crops in the region (marijuana and coca plantations), security has also been a crucial factor in the progress of this project. With rumours of newly formed Non-State Armed Groups in the region, looking to exploit drug trafficking routes, continued liaison with communities has been vital to ensure the safety of teams working out in the field.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">Cauca and Valle del Cauca departments are located in the Pacific region of Colombia, which is geographically extremely varied, ranging from coast to mountains. HALO&apos;s area of operations is located in the municipalities of Caloto, Corinto, Miranda, and Pradera, which are mostly plains and mountainous areas. Cauca and Valle del Cauca have generally good infrastructure, although there will be some walking and mules required for access to hazardous areas.</narrative>

   <activity-description>
    <narrative xml:lang="EN">Initially, HALO liaison staff contact local communities to build recognition for HALO as an organisation and to build relationships, which are vital for future deployment of operational staff. Following this, survey teams will be deployed across the region, collecting information from local communities on the local ERW threat and socioeconomic data. They will identify safe areas for future land restitution and return of displaced people through cooperation with the national authority DAICMA, and map and mark suspected hazardous areas for future manual clearance. Once hazardous areas have been identified for work and approval acquired, HALO clearance teams will begin work according to the national authority&apos;s prioritisation matrix, clearing hazardous land and safely destroying landmines and other ERW in the process. Throughout this process, HALO will deploy its specialized MRE and Victim Assistance staff as advised as a result of the organisation&apos;s liaison and survey, providing Risk Education and supporting ERW in getting support.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">HALO will conduct non-technical survey, landmine clearance, and mine risk education under this project. At least 20% of the deminers employed by HALO during this project will be former combatants, selected through HALO&apos;s collaboration with the National Agency for Reintegration (ACR). HALO has found through experience that employing former combatants to work with local people, including victims of the conflict, supports their reintegration and builds a positive attitude towards the peace process.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In 2016, HALO had an important achievement in being the first civilian organisation to declare a municipality free of the suspicion of mines in Colombia (Nari&#xF1;o and La Uni&#xF3;n municipalities, in Antioquia department). President Juan Manuel Santos was present at the handover ceremony and confirmed his government&apos;s dedication to mine action as part of the peace process; in his speech on receiving the Nobel Peace Prize, he reaffirmed this dedication. Through the return of displaced people, making land safe for local people, and reintegration of former combatants, mine action is a vital step in support of the implementation of the peace process in Colombia.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">111 women directly benefited from MRE sessions in the municipalities assigned in Cauca and Valle del Cauca areas, exceeding the target by 11%. As social-participation tends to be male-dominated in these regions, HALO ensured that women actively participated in the sessions. Over the entire contract, HALO reached a higher number of women (by 89%) through MRE than anticipated in the intial proposal process. This has been duly noted and will be taken forward as a lesson learnt to future projects</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Numbers of direct and indirect beneficiaries of the new Hazardous Area &quot;La Margarita&quot; (municipality of Argelia, Antioquia province) are lower than the average rates. The reason is that the inhabitants of this area have moved to other municipalities as a consequence of the internal conflict. Direct and indirect male and female beneficiaries recorded in this area are Internally Displaced People (IDP) who are now returning back to these veredas with no children for the time being.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">154 men directly benefited from MRE sessions in the municipalities assigned in Cauca and Valle del Cauca, surpassing the annual target by 23.5%. HALO teams focused on raising awareness among civilian men as mines/ERW have caused more victims among this group (82% of the victims in the two areas are men) and are more at risk of possible mine accidents due to their direct work with land. Over the entire contract, HALO reached 81% more men through MRE than anticipated in the intial proposal process. This has been duly noted and will be taken forward as a lesson learnt to future projects</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">467 children directly benefited from MRE sessions in the municipalities assigned in Cauca department, exceeding the target by 134%. Teams had a specific focus in conducting MRE sessions with young children in schools as they are usually unaware and uninformed of the dangers that mines represent, increasing their vulnerability. Methods and tools were adapted to the targeted population, ensuring that children understood the message and their mine/EWR risks were reduced. Over the entire contract, HALO reached 131% more children through MRE than anticipated in the intial proposal process. This has been duly noted and will be taken forward as a lesson learnt to future projects</narrative>
