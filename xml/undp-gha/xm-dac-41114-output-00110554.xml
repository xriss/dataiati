       <narrative xml:lang="EN">1.	100 people engaged. 
This initiative was launched on 12 July 2018 in Accra with more than 100 participants from the private sector, NGOs, academic institutions, government bodies, development agencies and the media. Information on the initiative was widely circulated in the media with high interest from stakeholders in the sector generated. See article from UNDP Africa: http://www.africa.undp.org/content/rba/en/home/presscenter/articles/2018/undp-ghana-launches-multi-stakeholder-waste-resource-platform-in.html 
Key result achieved at the launch is the commitment by all key stakeholders to partner with UNDP on this initiative and co-design its various features in order to provide a lasting solution to the waste situation in Ghana, whiles creating opportunities for economic development (particularly investment and jobs). In this respect, stakeholders volunteered to form five Technical Working Groups to partner with UNDP in the co-designing processes. These are: Data and Policy, Communications and Advocacy, Website and App, National Competitions, Sustainability and Finance. Given the general interest generated by this initiative, UNDP has been invited to present the concept of the platform in various technical and high-level fora, e.g.  at a roundtable discussion on plastic management on the occasion of the visit to Ghana of the Prince of Wales and at the recent Accra SDG Investment Fair organized by the Ministry of Finance where there was interest from the SDG Secretariat at the Office of the President and the Ghana Investment Promotion Center. These events and were a great opportunity for UNDP to extend its reach to a wider number of stakeholders, many of who are gradually joining the platform.

2.	Technical Working Groups formed. 
The project is still going through the co-designing process. The Technical Working Groups (TWG) have made progress in defining the various features of the initiative, which have been validated by stakeholders during a plenary meeting in November. Specifically:
&#x2022;	The Data and Policy TWG has broadly defined the parameters for the methodology for data collection, responsibilities, and other key data issues that will need to be further discussed in 2019.
&#x2022;	The National Competition TWG presented the process for the selection of the waste recovery projects to be supported by the initiative. The process will be launched in January 2019.
&#x2022;	The Website and App TWG has discussed recommendations for the design, structure and functionalities of the digital platform and outlined the timeline for the development of digital tools (including prototyping). To ensure that this system will be robust, fit for purpose and meet stakeholders&#x2019; needs, a user profile survey is currently being undertaken (December 2018) to understand the operations and needs of the stakeholders in the value chain.
&#x2022;	The Communication and Awareness TWG has identified target groups and strategies for a communication campaign that will be developed in 2019.
&#x2022;	The Sustainability and Financing TWG has proposed a governance structure for the platform (Operational Board and Advisory Board) and shared some ideas on how to deal with various sustainability factors (finance, market, eco-factors, M&amp;E).</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">2. UNDP has created Ghana&#x2019;s largest space for connecting ideas, people and resources for waste recovery. Its relevance has been recognized by key partners including the President of the Republic. The development of the digital components of the Platform (website, waste resource map, &#x201C;Uber for Waste&#x201D; mobile app) is at an advanced stage. Ghana Statistical Service has expressed interest in mainstreaming this in their data collection system.

3. 6. In partnership with the Netherlands Embassy, UNDP conducted the &#x2018;Waste&#x2019; Recovery Innovation Challenge to provide technical and financial support to 10 innovative business, research and advocacy projects to demonstrate resource recovery opportunities in Ghana.

4. 450. The business projects are expected to create about 450 direct jobs.

5. 0. Activity could not take place in 2019.</narrative>
