       <narrative xml:lang="EN">1.	As part of the Initiation Plan to develop a full project to promote South-South Cooperation between China and Ghana for the development of the solar PV industry in Ghana, UNDP organized field visits between the two countries for appropriate consultations and knowledge exchange to ensure technical soundness of the project and adequate buy-in by key stakeholders. Specifically:
-	During the mission to China, the Ghanaian partners had the opportunity to improve their understanding of the process for manufacturing solar PV panels, by having a visual experience of a factory already built and in full operation. In the spirit of further expanding this South-South Cooperation partnership to other clean technologies in future, they also visited a factory producing electric cars and learnt key facts about this industry and its growing potential. More importantly, the Chinese and Ghanaian partners conducted a first negotiation (mediated by UNDP) of the business terms. This led to the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding, in which partners agreed (but not in a binding manner) to partner on the establishment of a 500MW solar PV factory in Ghana. The MOU also outlines key parameters for the Joint Venture (e.g. shares, export targets, estimated profits) and states that 1% of the project turn out will be devolved to UNDP as seed funding for other projects. Partners also agreed on the next steps leading towards the mission to Ghana and the signing of a binding shareholder agreement.
-	During the mission Ghana, the Chinese partners had the opportunity to visit potential sites for the establishment of the factory and to become more familiar with the Ghanaian enabling environment for the development of renewable energy technologies. The focus of the mission was on the negotiation of the binding shareholder agreement (mediated by UNDP), which allowed partners to advance discussions on the business terms of the joint venture. It was agreed that the signing of the agreement would be pending an export test (to be conducted in the first half of 2019) to determine the export related fees for solar PV products manufactured in Ghana with raw materials from abroad. UNDP provided advice to and facilitated a series of discussions between the two Ghanaian partners in preparation for the two missions reported above, but also to make progress with all the tasks required to establish the joint venture, including the identification of the land, JV registration etcetera. UNDP also facilitated discussions with key Ministries, Departments and Agencies (e.g. Ministry of Energy, Energy Commission, Ghana Investment Promotion Centre, One District One Factory Secretariat) to secure government support to the initiative.

3.	UNDP conducted background technical and market studies to explore the feasibility and the potential of the solar PV industry in Ghana and the West African sub-region. The reports outline key technical issues to be dealt with in order to successfully set up the factory and provide recommendations for opening up the market for solar PVs and related products in the country and the sub-region.

4.	The full project document (final output for the initiation plan) was not finalized in 2018, due to the prolonged interactions among the various partners which were not concluded before the end of the year. However, the various consultations held among private and governments stakeholders in the two countries, and the studies conducted, provide a good basis for the development of the project document (now slated for 2019) and give clear indications on the role that UNDP can play to: promote an ecosystem approach for the development of a full value chain to allow greater adoption of solar technology in Ghana; develop a comprehensive package for skills development on solar PV value chain; and promote knowledge sharing and linkages with other markets in West Africa and beyond.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">3. No. In 2018, the Ghanaian and Chinese companies had agreed to form a joint venture to establish a 500MW solar PV plant in Ghana, mainly targeting export to the US market. However, due to new developments in the international market for solar PV equipment, in 2019 partners agreed to change the scope of the partnership from manufacturing solar PV modules to producing the various components of the PV modules, such as sealant, aluminum frames, etc. This was seen as an opportunity to better develop the value chain and to create more jobs. The solar PV factory could still be considered in a second phase. This arrangement was recorded in a new MOU signed in Accra in May. Despite several engagements facilitated by UNDP and the Energy Commission, the Ghanaian partners failed to complete the company registration process by the deadline provided by the Chinese partner. The Chinese partner therefore decided to withdraw from the partnership with Tobinco and Reroy, but still expressed interest in forming a joint venture with the Ghanaian private sector. This is expected to materialize in 2020.

4. No (for same reasons).</narrative>
