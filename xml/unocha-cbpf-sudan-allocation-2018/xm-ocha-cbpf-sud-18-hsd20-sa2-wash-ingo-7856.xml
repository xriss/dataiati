  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">GOAL proposes to deliver integrated WASH services targeting the most vulnerable populations affected by the conflict in Kutum and Al Waha localities, North Darfur, who are not receiving other comparable assistance, with an emphasis placed on the needs of Internally Displaced pople (IDPs), women and children. The proposed programing will support 74,166 direct beneficiaries (168,671 indirect beneficiaries) comprising of IDPs, rural underserved communities, nomadic pastoralists and host communities experiencing protracted crisis. 

In Kassab and Fata borno IDP camps, building on its success in transitioning the water systems to communities, GOAL will continue to provide technical support to the water committees to ensure access to improved safe drinking water to 30,226 IDPs. GOAL&#x2019;s continued support to the water committee will ensure that the water committees in the two IDP camps will not fail from delivering sustained access to safe drinking water. A lot has been accomplished in 2017 and with focused technical support (in 2018) on operation and maintenance, linkage with local technicians and supply chain and strengthen cost recovery scheme - the water supply systems managed by the IDP&#x2019;s water committees will have strong success rate. As part of promoting learnings and scaling up similar intervention elsewhere, GOAL Plans to produce one thorough case study on the two-community managed water supply systems from the two IDP camps and share with the sector/cluster and partners.  

In line with the humanitarian-Peace-development nexus, GOAL will construct a solar pumping water supply system (mini water yard) for communities in Salmai village (West of Kassab IDP camp) benefiting 3,500 peoples. Salmai village hosts Kassab IDP camp. Communities in Salmai village are currently depending on 2 open/unprotected hand dug wells. This intervention will solidify the collaboration between the 25,510 IDP and the host communities. This could even be the best entry point to facilitate further integration between the two communities and open new opportunities for the IDPs to access other natural resources such as farming land, pasture land etc.    

As part of integrated WASH response, GOAL will undertake ground water monitoring, water quality testing and water committees training in all targeted areas in Kutum.  

In 2018, building on its previous successful pilot project, GOAL proposes to partner with local NGO (FPDO) to implement Community Led Total Sanitation programming in 10 communities in the conflict affected rural areas surrounding GOAL supported health facilities to address the high levels of open defecation in this area, reaching 6000 individuals. In addition, GOAL will construct a sanitation facility/latrine in Abdushikur health facility creating access to latrine and handwashing facilities for a total catchment population of 6,304 people. GOAL also plans to construct 3 garbage disposal areas and equip the locality environmental health department with basic tools to improve solid waste management benefiting a total catchment population of 22,517. Considering massive disease outbreak potential in Kutum, this intervention could significantly contribute to prevent any potential outbreaks such as AWD.

Although this application is for WASH intervention, it is important to note that GOAL currently has a Health and Nutrition intervention in Kutum and Al waha localities of North Darfur. And Hence, the proposed WASH interventions under this action will complement the ongoing Health and Nutrition interventions and therefore, holistically address the ongoing critical situation in Kutum and Al Waha localities, where high levels of morbidity, the inability of the government to provide adequate Health and WASH services, and limited safe water sources and sanitation remain a challenge.</narrative>
