   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Integrated Livelihoods Recovery, Health, and Nutrition in Um Dukhun Locality, Central Darfur</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">For years, Um Dukhun locality in Central Darfur has been affected by pastoralist/farmer conflict, exacerbated by ethnic conflict among the Salamat and Misseriya tribes. Protracted conflict led to two waves of mass displacement in 2003 and 2013, sending IDPs/refugees into surrounding areas within Sudan and into Chad (Recovery, Return amp Reintegration Sector Mission Report). As the security situation stabilized in 2017, the locality has faced a new challenge: a returnee influx that is straining capacity of social and health systems. The population of Um Dukhun has increased exponentially, reaching 40,000-60,000 inhabitants. This trend of return is expected to continue in 2018, further straining vital public services. Under the Sudan Multiyear Humanitarian Strategy 2017-2019, partners are called to support affected populations through integrated, multi-sector programs. 

CRS is currently providing such support to the vulnerable communities of Garaaya, Magan and Beltebei. CRS works with under two SHF allocations: (1) Protecting and Promoting Livelihoods Recovery in Um Dukhun Locality, with local partner Trust Rehabilitation and Development Organization (TDO) and (2) Integrated Health and Nutrition Services for Um Dukhun Locality, with local partner Solidarity for Community Development Organization (SDO). CRS has supported food security and livelihoods activities, including animal health services and training of Community Animal Health Workers (CAHWs) as well as creating Savings and Internal Lending Communities (SILC) that open access to financial services, and Generating Activities (IGAs) that build resilience in the local community. CRS has also been active in Health by providing medical consultations, health amp hygiene education and training of volunteers on integrated management of childhood illnesses. Nutrition services are being provided through training of SDO staff in Community Management of Acute Malnutrition (CMAM), training of Community Health Promoters (CHPs) in coordination with Ministry of Health (MoH), establishing Mother Support Groups (MtMSGs), and screening, active case finding, referral and reporting of Severe Acute malnutrition (SAM) and Moderate Acute Malnutrition (MAM). Identified cases have been referred to Outpatient Therapeutic Programs (OTP) and Targeted Supplementary Feeding Programs (TSFP) for further treatment, with a cross-cutting focus on protection. 

In line with the Multiyear Humanitarian Strategy priority to integrate humanitarian and development workstreams, CRS proposes combining these efforts into an integrated relief and development program to meet the immediate and medium-term livelihood development, food security, health, and nutrition needs of 36,392 Internally Displaced People (IDPs), returnees, and host populations across Garaaya, Magan, and Beltebei, Um Dukhun Locality. In coordination with the relevant government line ministries, the project will be implemented over a period of one year, from 1st April 2018 until 31st March 2019, delivering integrated health, nutrition, livelihoods development, food security and livelihoods interventions. Through this project, CRS will build the technical capacity of local MoH staff to provide access to and continuity of basic primary health services, as well as support identification and treatment of malnourished children and PLWs through CMAM interventions and defaulter tracing, community mobilization, and hygiene and nutrition promotion. CRS will also promote food security and livelihood development and resilience through strengthening of existing CAHWs, their networks, and the supply chain for veterinary services and drugs, which will contribute to productivity in local livestock-based livelihoods. The program will also train existing SILC members in business development and marketing to strengthen nascent IGAs, and expand SILC into neighboring areas to improve access to basic financial services for the target population.</narrative>
