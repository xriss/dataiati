   <narrative xml:lang="EN">International Medical Corps (IMC) is proposing the implementation of an integrated health and nutrition project in 4 health facilities in South Darfur, serving an estimated catchment population of 210,340 affected by conflict and disaster, including internally displaced persons and host populations.Communicable diseases continue to cause high level mortality and morbidity in Darfur.Communicable diseases are the most common cause of outpatient consultations.    In 2017, there were 87,314 OPD consultations at clinics supported by International Medical Corps in South Darfur. Out of the total consultations, 33,273(38%) were children under five and 47,531(54%) were women. Acute respiratory infections, diarrheal diseases and malaria continue to be the leading causes of morbidity. The GAM and SAM rates for South Darfur State are 15.9% and 3.5% (MICS 2014), above the critical thresholds. In January 2017 IMC also conducted a SMART survey, which showed a GAM and SAM rate of 16% and 4.2% in El Serif Camp. Exclusive feeding was reported to be 42.7%. Exclusive breastfeeding rates remain low at 50.4% in South Darfur. In South Darfur, complementary foods were introduced in timely fashion for 60.9% of children 6-8 months of age. 
 The proposed health and nutrition project will be implemented in Kalma, Alsalaam1, Alsalaam 2 and ElSerif. The health facilities will provide the following primary health and reproductive health services: outpatient consultations, routine vaccinations, disease surveillance,   Reproductive health services (antenatal care (ANC), postnatal care (PNC), family planning and skilled deliveries), integrated management of childhood illnesses (IMCI), health education and the support for referrals to ensure patients receive the management of critical complications at the next level of health care. Furthermore, IMC will continue to strengthen basic obstetric services in these clinics, as these are the only options for women that require advanced reproductive health services in the locality. IMC will provide support of the Ministry of Health in epidemic disease surveillance and response, immunization campaigns, and national immunization days. During this proposed project, IMC is also planning to conduct minor rehabilitation on targeted clinics to ensure self reliance, quality, patient safety, infection prevention and continuity of services. IMC also intends to continue to provide short-term and on the job training to health facility staff.

In addition to the activities proposed above, International Medical Corps will provide life-saving services to eligible pregnant and lactating women (PLW) and children (6-59 months of age) with moderate acute malnutrition through SFPs running at health facility. The health facilities will also provide treatment for children (6-59 months) with severe acute malnutrition (SAM). Those cases with severe acute malnutrition and medical complication will be referred to stabilization centers.  Nutrition education and   counseling will be provided for caretakers of children under-two years of age as a component of infant and young child feeding (IYCF) practices. Selected training will be provided for health facility staff on CMAM, IYCF and Monitoring and reporting.  Community screenings, defaulter tracing and necessary follow-up will also be part of the intervention.
This project expects to reach a total of 192,707 direct beneficiaries including both health and nutrition beneficiaries. These beneficiaries include women, men, girls and boys who are eligible for medical and nutrition services. The targeted locality is Bileil (South Darfur). It hosts IMC supported clinics, which provide essential curative and preventive services through primary health care and nutrition support. Direct beneficiaries include men and women, boys and girls, children under-five years of age, elderly and disabled people who will receive health care service at the cl</narrative>
