   <narrative xml:lang="EN">International Medical Corps (IMC) is proposing the implementation of an integrated health and nutrition project in 7 health facilities in Central and West Jabal Mara Localities of Central Darfur, serving an estimated catchment population of 187694 affected by conflict and disaster, including internally displaced persons and host populations. Communicable diseases continue to cause high level mortality and morbidity in Darfur. Communicable diseases are the most common cause of outpatient consultations.    In 2017, there were 392,136 OPD consultations at clinics supported by International Medical Corps in Central Darfur. Out of the total consultations, 161,797 (41%) were children under five and 211,074 (53.8%) were women. Acute respiratory infections, diarrheal diseases and malaria continue to be the leading causes of morbidity. The GAM and SAM rates for Central Darfur are 17.8% and 4.3% (MICS 2014), above the critical thresholds of more than 15% GAM. In February, 2017, A SMART survey in Guildo found crude mortality and under five mortality rates (per 10000/day) 2.43 and 4.32 respectively, while the GAM and SAM rates were 15.8% and 5.4%. The proposed health and nutrition project will be implemented in Katee, Kurifal,Guildo and Nertiti (West Jebel Mara),, Golo, Bori and  Jokosty (Central Jebel Mara) . In Golo, the health part of the project supports only the OPD, reproductive health and preventive care. The health facilities will provide the following primary health and reproductive health services: outpatient consultations, EPI, disease surveillance, reproductive health services (antenatal care (ANC), postnatal care (PNC), family planning and delivery care) and  integrated management of childhood illnesses (IMCI). Health education will also be a component of the project. This project will support referrals of patients to the next level of health care. Furthermore, IMC will continue to strengthen basic obstetric services in these clinics, as these are the only options for women that require reproductive health services in the camps. IMC will provide support  Ministry of Health in epidemic disease surveillance, outbreak response and  immunization campaigns. During this proposed project, IMC is also planning to conduct minor rehabilitation on targeted clinics to ensure quality, patient safety, infection prevention and continuity of services. IMC also intends to continue to provide short-term and on the job training to health facility staff. Drugs and medical supplies will also be procured and delivered to the clinics.

In addition to the activities proposed above, International Medical Corps will provide life-saving services to eligible pregnant and lactating women (PLW) and children (6-59 months of age) with moderate acute malnutrition through SFPs programs at health facilities. The health facilities will also provide treatment for children (6-59 months) with severe acute malnutrition (SAM). All 7 health facilities will have OTPs and SFPs. Those cases with severe acute malnutrition and medical complication will be referred to stabilization centers. The project supports 3 SCs at Nertiti, Golo and Guildo. Nutrition education and counseling will be provided for caretakers of children under-two years of age as a component of infant and young child feeding (IYCF) practices. Selected training will be provided for health facility staff on CMAM, IYCF and Monitoring and reporting. Community screenings, defaulter tracing and necessary follow-up will also be part of the intervention. International Medical Corps has the required operational structure and technical capacity to deliver, implement and monitor this project in Central Darfur State. It also coordinates with communities, agencies and government authorities to enhance the performance of this project. This project expects to reach a total of 139,954 direct beneficiaries. These beneficiaries include women, men, girls and boys who are eligible for medical and nutrition serv</narrative>
