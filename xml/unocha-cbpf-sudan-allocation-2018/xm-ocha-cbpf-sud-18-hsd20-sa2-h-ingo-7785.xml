   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Kuwaiti patients Helping Fund (KPHF) proposes to assist protracted displacement population affected by the conflict by supporting two PHC clinics in Draij and Otash IDPs camps in Nyala North, South Darfur State. Project will support provision of quality, high impact lifesaving primary health care interventions to communities affected by protracted displacement in Otash and Draij IDPs camps, Nyala North locality in South Darfur state. The proposed programming will support 125,117 direct beneficiaries including men(24,887),women(69,589),boys(14,704),girls(15,937 ) comprising of protracted IDPs, returnees and host communities experiencing protracted crisis. People living in Draij amp Otash IDPs camps suffer from low coverage and access to health care, high disease prevalence and mortality rates and frequent disease outbreaks. The current situation of Otash amp Draij IDPs camps predisposes the population to ill health, due to high burden of diseases among the target population. Essential medicines forecast indicates that there will be lack of drug supply in the near future, low EPI coverage especially among some IDPs for example penta3 and measles coverage according to KPHF health facility data this poses a serious risk and could result in an outbreak of measles, low uptake of reproductive health services, increased number of outbreaks prevention and control of epidemics, crowding, poor sanitary conditions. The situation requires urgent intervention to fill this gap.  KPHF will intervention through provision of basic primary health care services under these activities which include outpatient consultations and referrals of severe cases to secondary care level as well as improve access to maternal health care services and strengthened child health services which will be achieved by providing routine EPI and IMCI services and comprehensive reproductive health services such as ANC, clean delivery and EmOC. As a key part of providing health care services and as apart of the sector&#x2019;s identified priorities, KPHF will provide essential drugs, medical supplies and medical equipment to 2 health facilities. KPHF will also strengthen the capacity of project and SMoH staff through medley and intensive trainings and on-the-job trainings related to management and delivery of primary health care services. Also KPHF will contribute in early detection, preparedness and response to emergencies and public health threats and make sure that surveillance system is in place and that epidemics are prevented, reported and controlled. In the same context, the above mentioned staff will be trained on disease surveillance , prevention and control. Accordingly, they will send weekly EWARS reports to the SMoH and WHO and report any outbreaks within 72 hours. KPHF along with SMoH will conduct community awareness campaigns in these targeted camps and surrounding areas on different topic such as AWD, STIs, RH and others to promote good health and hygiene practices and to reduce the risk of outbreaks of communicable diseases. KPHF has taken into account men, women, boy and girls in assessing the needs for and design of this project, and will continue to do so throughout its implementation. KPHF is very cognizant of the importance of gender equality and will provide equal access for men, women, boys and girls to health care services at the clinics and ensure that health education is provided to both genders. As women and children are considered the most vulnerable ,KPHF will prioritize maternal and child health services KPHF strongly believes in shared responsibilities, strong linkage and communication among partners including SMOH, national and international NGOs and the community. To find common solutions to problems, and exchange ideas and experiences, KPHF will continue to participate in the weekly health coordination meeting chaired by WHO and SMoH at national and state levels.</narrative>
