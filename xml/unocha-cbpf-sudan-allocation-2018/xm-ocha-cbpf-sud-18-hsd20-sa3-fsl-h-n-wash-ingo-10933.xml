   <narrative xml:lang="EN">There are 5.5 million people in need of humanitarian assistance in Sudan. Disturbingly, this includes 2.3 million children affected by GAM (September 2018, OCHA). The humanitarian situation in Sudan in general, and South Kordofan in particular, remains complex. Chronic under development and widespread poverty, exacerbated by various shocks, are also negatively impacting on vulnerable populations&#x2019; coping capacities. Access to basic services remain largely insufficient. External shocks (conflict and natural disasters) as well as poverty, eroded livelihoods and lack of access to essential resources and basic services have also led to a critical nutrition situation and poor health outcomes in general. Despite the improving security situation in South Kordofan State, households continue to experience unacceptable levels of food insecurity and malnutrition. A review of the IPC levels in Rashad, Kadugli and Al Reif Al Shargi from 2015-2018 reveal a consistent pattern of IPC 3 (Crisis) and IPC 4 (Emergency) outcomes during the annual lean season. The persistent macroeconomic challenges in the form of high inflation and local currency devaluation coupled with fuel shortage have resulted in reduced purchasing power for many households in Sudan, particularly poor households who lack a source of livelihoods in South Kordofan. Based on the consultation that was conducted by Mercy Corps regarding the FSL situation in the targeted area together with  HAC, the Ministry of Agriculture (MoA), and IOM,  the findings shows that the majority of households are dependent on agriculture as their primary livelihood activity. Furthermore, the consultation that was conduct by Mercy Corp in Abu karshola in March 2018  found that an estimated 90 percent of households surveyed in the target locations are unable to meet their food consumption needs during the lean season and are forced to rely on negative coping mechanisms. Examples of negative coping mechanisms employed by the target population included a reduction in the number of meals consumed per day, withdrawal of children from education, and increased child labour in rural areas and towns.The impact of the conflict on access to basic services such as health, nutrition and WASH services in South Kordofan has been enormous &#x2013; as such, for instance, in the target locality of Abu karshola out of the total 13 health facilities, only 50% are functional and almost none of them are linked to Early Warning Reporting System networks (EWARS). According to the nation wide S3M that was conducted in august 2018, shows the GAM and SAM rates for under 5 children to be  7.67% and 3.12% respectively.Therefore, South Kordofan State in general and the target localities of Abu karshola, Kadugli and Reif-Alshargi in particular, are characterized by chronic poverty and under nutrition poor access to Health, Nutrition and WASH services, disrupted livelihoods systems ongoing conflict and displacement and disease outbreaks such as Acute Watery Diarhea (AWD). And hence, the humanitarian situation in these target localities calls for an integrated intervention that provides essential humanitarian services while at the same time addressing the root causes and building community resilience. In view of all the above interlinked and complex situation, Four National and International organizations International Medical Corps, Mercy Corps, GOAL and  Almanar Voluntary Organization with experience in food security, livelihood, Health, Nutrition and WASH joined together as a consortium propose 12 months action targeting three localities Kadugli, Reif-Alshergi and Abukarshola with an integrated Food Security and Livelihood(FSL), Health, Nutrition and WASH intervention by responding directly to  food security and nutrition, health and WASH needs and linking activities across each sectors to bring change to the livelihood of conflict affected and vulnerable individuals in the targeted three localities in South Kordofan state.</narrative>
