   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Malnutrition (under-nutrition) is the underlying contributing factor in about 45% of all child deaths, making children more vulnerable to severe diseases (WHO-World Health Organization fact sheet No.178). The epidemiological profile of Sudan is dominated by under-nutrition (and communicable diseases) underscoring the nutrition status in the country as being of humanitarian concern. In 2014, UNICEF state of the world&#x2019;s children reported Sudan as having the highest prevalence of wasting in the region (Middle East and North Africa). One third (S3M 2013) of localities in the country has a GAM (Global Acute Malnutrition) prevalence above the emergency threshold of 15%. Younger children are more likely to be malnourished mainly due to poor Infant and Young Child Feeding (IYCF) practices. Chronic malnutrition is also of concern with one of every three children aged below five being already stunted (SHHS 2010) and unlikely to ever reach their full growth potential.  and subsequently health and productivity in adulthood is permanently compromised. According to the Sudan S3M survey (2013), North Darfur state (where this project is proposed) is one of five states that carry highest (45%) the national burden of SAM (Second highest after Red Sea) with GAM (Weight for Height) prevalence of 28.3% and Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM using MUAC) of 7.8%. Within the state Ailliet locality has highest SAM out of 18 localities. The most recent Nutrition survey (2013 S3M) shows Ailliet has average GAM (Weight for Height) prevalence of 40.5% and Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM using MUAC) of 9.7%. These are above the WHO emergency thresholds of 15% and 2% for GAM and SAM respectively. All of these facts will affect the population health and food security so as leading to increase the rate of SAM. 
Ailliet locality is one of the most vulnerable localities in North Darfur, Ailleit locality located in the eastern southern part of North Darfur bordered to the north by El Tawiesha locality, , to the east by West Kordofan state, to the south by East Darfur state, and to the west by South Darfur state and El Tawiesha locality because of its border location Ailliet became a magnet to displaced people especially from South Sudan Since June 2016, Refugees from South Sudan started to arrive to Ailliet locality seeking for security, food and health and Nutrition as a result of conflicts in South Sudan, and up to now more than 10,443 refugees has been reported in Ailliet locality based on UNHCR 2017 Biometric Registration Report .additionally the locality has received approximately based on IOM  final verified figures are: total displaced households are 1,246 (7,554 individuals), distributed in the 4 villages, Futaha 574 HHs (3,595 individuals), Dalil Babikir 583 HHs (3,499 individuals), Fajakh 67 HHs (355 individuals), Dalil Dokhri 22 HHs (105 individuals). They did not receive assistance they were sharing the existing service facilities with the host community.
This project will be implemented in 8 sites in Ailliet locality mainly in: Khamsat, Hillat Ali, Um Ghoghaya , Shig Ellayoon, Dalil Dukhri, El Mashroot, Habib Darma and Hajar) providing curing and preventable nutrition services. This project will treat at least 2450 children suffering from severe acute malnutrition as well as carry out interventions to prevent malnutrition in the same populations mainly C-IYCF and micro-nutrient through provision training and Capacity builiding Health Nutrition Technical staff and Community outreach workers in CMAM component including: improving the treatment coverage and quality of services for 2450 SAM include referral of SAM children with medical complication to the inpatient care at the SMOH stabilization centers in Al lait Locality  provision of preventive activities including health and nutrition education especially for 8803 women of child-bearing age through Community Infant and Young Child Feeding program, Women support group</narrative>
