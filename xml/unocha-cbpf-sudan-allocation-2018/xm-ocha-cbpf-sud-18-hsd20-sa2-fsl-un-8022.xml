   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The main objective of this project is to improve the food and nutrition security and save lives of the vulnerable drought affected pastoralists, agro-pastoralists and farmers in more than 7 main villages in Hamashkoraib locality in Kassala state. According to the IPC report of October 2017 and FAO Early Warning Early Action assessment in November 2017, Hamashkoraib is one of the most affected localities by drought because of the poor rainfall observed by the locality during 2017 rainy season and it was ranked as the first most drought affected in Kassala. The drought resulted into poor pasture condition, the water sources such as hafirs and natural ponds were not filled during the rainy season, and those, which stored some water dried up very early. Livestock conditions were mostly very bad to worse due to lack of pasture and insufficient as was reported by 80% of the respondents during FAO EWEA assessment conducted in November 2017. As for agricultural production, it was reported only 5-20 percent of farmers cultivated during the main season with extremely low or no production most of the cultivated crops dried at the early stages of the plant growth. To address the negative impact of the 2017 drought in the affected localities including Hamashkoraib, Kassala State Government has issued a Decree calling for urgent response to the grave situation, including from humanitarian partners operating in the state. According to the IPC projection January- March 2018, about 148,117 persons (24,686 HHs) are food insecure population in Hmashkoraib locality i.e. in IPC phase 3 and phase 4 based on its initiative on Early warning Early Action, and in line with the call of Kassala state government, FAO responded with livestock based livelihood interventions, targeted 1,000 households (6,000 persons) there is gap of about 23,686 vulnerable  HHs, in need of livelihood support, about 4,500 HHs (27,000 persons plus 400 women) from the this gap will be targeted under this project, complementing the FAO EWEA livestock activities in addition to agriculture, women training on IGA and emergency water intervention for livestock. The proposed activities under this project include: i) Emergency livestock support services, which include supplementary animal feed, veterinary inputs /services (vaccination, deworming, and refresher trainings for CAHWs), promoting merits of destocking as a coping mechanism within pastoral and agro pastoral communities  . ii) Emergency agriculture inputs and support services will be provided include distribution of nutritious crop seeds composed of cereals, legumes, nutritious vegetable seeds (okra, water melon and tomato) and hand tools (digging hoes, axes and spades) the implementation of the agricultural activities will be strengthened through package of agricultural extension support services. iii) 10 women groups/association composed of 400 women  will be provided with livelihoods trainings that support income-generating opportunities. iv) The affected pastoralists and agro-pastoralists&#x2019; communities will be provided with access to water for their  livestock through rehabilitation of 4 water  wells and procurement and distribution of 10 inflatable water tanks (water bladders) to be used for storing water for livestock consumption.</narrative>
