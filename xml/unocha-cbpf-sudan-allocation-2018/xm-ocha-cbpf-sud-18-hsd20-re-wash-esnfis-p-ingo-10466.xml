  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This is an emergency lifesaving project aims to alleviate sufferings of El Nuhud civilians of West Kordofan State, whom were affected by heavy rains and flash floods on 23rd July 2018.
West Kordofan is one of the 18 States of Sudan. It had a total area of 111,373 km&#xB2; and an estimated population of approximately 1,320,405. El Fulla is the capital of the state. The State is comprising of 14 Localities being as: El Nuhud, El Salam, El Khoway, Wad Banda, Ghebbaish, El Odaiya, Lagawa, Abu Zabad, Kailak, Muglad, El Mairam, El Sunut, Babanousa and El Dibab.
EL Nuhud is the biggest town lies on the northern part of the State between coordinates N: 12.41.33, 50 and E: 28.25.37, 12 and about 120 kilometers from El Fulla the capital of the State. The total population of the town  are 318,234 persons comprises of 162,299 female and 155,935 male with annual increment of 2.7% according to last statistical figures presented by Planning Department of the State. 
The town has known of flooding history dated back to 1946 and 1951, since then the area suffered from consecutive drought in different years.  This has made the population susceptible and couldn&#x2019;t cope with such flash floods.  
 During last July, heavy rains and flash floods hit El Nuhud town, and resulted in disastrous situation, where about 30% of the town inhabitants, approximately 70,000 individuals were affected. 
According to information provided by State HAC and verified by the locally  formed taskforce, a total of 4,776 houses have been destroyed by flash floods 2,538 houses  completely  destroyed  and  other  2,238  partially  destroyed,  and  2,538  household  latrines  collapsed. Almost all belongings of the affected families were either been buried under the ruins of the collapsed houses or washed away by the massive torrents. Some affected households became homeless, part of families&#x2019; members move temporary to their relative houses in non&#x2010;affected areas during night times and return in the morning times. Few families are currently accommodated in schools. The current level of crises in El Nuhud is very big including the market and neighborhood areas.  
Furthermore, the floods destroyed 33 public facilities including schools, health clinics and public services including WASH facilities.

Through this intervention, Islamic Relief Worldwide intends to deliver integrated package of WASH, NFIs and protection activities to address the disastrous situation and contribute with other humanitarian efforts in reducing the sufferings of target populations to save their lives and maintain human dignity.
For WASH and in terms of water facilities, the planned project aims to rehabilitate two nonfunctioning boreholes to ensure adequate and sufficient water supply, as well as rehabilitating some damaged water pipelines as a result of the floods. The water tanks in the main water plant will also rehabilitated in addition to performing continuous chlorination activities to assure safe water for human consumption. Youth volunteers, both boys and girls will be mobilized and trained on simple water purification using chlorination methods, to contribute in chlorinating the main water sources and encourage the vast community to adopt the method at household levels. The trained volunteers will also assist in collection of water samples from main water plants and send to laboratory for quality and chemical tests on intervals during project lifetime. 
Four schools will be targeted by the project and supported by plastic water storage containers to ensure access to drinking water. 
In regard to hygiene and sanitation, and due to poor solid waste management that resulted from the floods which impacting negative consequences on affected communities and adversely affecting their health and the wider environment, the project plans to set immediate actions for collection and disposing this waste. This will be through availing required tools for cleaning and collection of waste and then mana</narrative>
