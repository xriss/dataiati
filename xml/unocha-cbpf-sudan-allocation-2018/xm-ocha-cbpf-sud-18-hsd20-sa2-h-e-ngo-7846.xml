   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Integrated Community Based Health and Protection Intervention for the Conflict affected communities in Abyei North area (Envelope 2)</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">GAH through funding from SHF and several other partners including UNICEF, UNISFA, IOM  etc. has been supporting the only 4 operating health clinics in Northern Abyei for the last 3 years in addition to other interventions in WASH and Education. Abyei is a complex scenario and lacks support from the state government systems as it is controlled by Abyei Joint Oversight Committee (AJOC) however since our interventions we now have support from SMOH and this project would like to strengthen this relation and thus ensure communities get services and support. It is only after GAH initiated activities in these facilities that they started working to optimal capacity, especially that serious renovations and rehabilitation were done. In addition we managed to retain full time staff who are motivated to stay due to the incentives paid by the project. With this support, Mekennis and Diffra clinics can now receive referrals from the other clinics Umkair and Alradaya and 
due to advocacy with MOH and AJOC 2 medical doctors are now residing in the area since early 2017.

Now that GAH has established grounds with the host community, MOH and AJOC, GAH is planning in this new project to expand its reach to cover a larger geographical area and provide health services to more than 80,000 PoC&apos;s, operating 5 HF&apos;s (Difraa, Mekennis, Umkair,  Alradya and Gole)  and 2 outreach centers (Amiet Market and Dumboloya).  GAH would also like to include protection of vulnerable communities in this project and create a referral and case management system and work with partners delivering other services to mainstream protection in their interventions.  Abyei being a conflict prone area has many cases of underlying issues of protection, child protection remains a key challenge with no response mechanism in place, GBV cases remain unreported with lack of a referral system and complement the work in Health, WASH, NFI  and Education.  

This project would like to strengthen the services of the two main clinics Difraa and Mekinnes to expand their services for referral one such way is to equip the already constructed theater room at Diffraa making it a full referral for obstetrics. All the the clinics will continue offering PHC services to cater for the health needs of the people in this areas increasing morbidity and reducing mortality. IMCI services and vaccination. The clinics will also be points for health education and anchors to nutrition and WASH projects in the area. We would also like to furnish and equip the newly constructed clinic at Gole (with support from UNISFA) 
The project will establish and strengthen community based structures to support the implementation of the protection actions in this project, a rapid needs analysis through FGDs is planned to further inform protection issues in the community meanwhile child protection and GBV actions will be conducted in this project and further funding identified to implement a robust protection intervention.

We would also like to use a community based system working with community change agents to increase  knowledge of communities on all issues affecting them and change their attitude towards seeking timely medication in order to reduce preventable morbidity and mortality, reduce harmful practices to women and children, encourage school enrollment and proper hygiene and develop livelihoods for vulnerable communities. This unique approach of using one community advocate to contact community members in most issues at the basic level is best suited for Abyei where targeted actions are done around needs and GAH would like to use it for this project as it ensures integrated approach to service 
GAH will work with IOM to fill the other gaps identified by SHF in WASH and NFI and assist IOM to deliver WASH services that are protection mainstreamed and  gender sensitive, ensure access for the most vulnerable including SUAC and their foster families, refugees, IDPs and host communities.</narrative>
