   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Ensuring access to safe, protective learning spaces and services for conflict-affected children in Central, West and North Jebel Marra localities of Central Darfur (Envelope 1)</narrative>

  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This intervention is two-pronged, interlinking Education and Protection components to provide a comprehensive support to displaced communities.
The target locations of Nertiti, Golo, and Rokero localities were significantly impacted by the Darfur crisis. As a result of the war in Golo, schools and other infrastructure in the community were damaged. With the displacement, social networks and bonds were broken, exposing women and children, the elderly, and other PSNs to protection risks. Upon return, children are out of school due to a lack of space in the few remaining classrooms, there is a scarcity of teachers that are trained, and school PTAs are not fully aware of their role in school management. Children separated during the displacement and return process currently lack parental care and attention and are exposed to risks of abuse, exploitation, and recruitment by warring factions.
Nertiti has remained stable through most of the Darfur crisis and has been a receiving area for people displaced from the mountains where the conflict was most fierce. Some displaced people in Nertiti have been there since the first displacement in 2004. The last major displacement to Nertiti was in January of 2016. Nertiti has, therefore, had to accommodate and share the available resources with the IDPs resulting in a shortage in learning spaces in schools. Children of school going age in Nertiti, both from IDP and vulnerable host HHs, are out of school for reasons including overcrowding in the available schools. These children lack access to essential services including health, and are at risk of exploitation, abuse and physical harm. The conflict also left UXO in most parts of Darfur including Nertiti, Golo, and Rokero and this presents a particular risk for children as they play and walk about.
In 2017, DRC implemented protection and education activities in Nertiti, Golo, and Rokero. This proposed project will continue the work DRC has done, and seek to adopt an integrated strategy to ensure that children receive better protection and access to both formal education and alternative learning processes.
To achieve this, DRC proposes to implement lifesaving and protection activities such as rehabilitation of classrooms and construction of semi-permanent learning spaces construction of gender-sensitive latrines provision of handwashing facilities teacher training on methodologies for teaching conflict-affected children and risk education (creating a synergy with Child Protection components and facilitating identification of critical needs across a wider network) and training of PTA on school management, child safety and protection. 
DRC will encourage teachers and PTA members trained in protection to join and be active members of CBCPNs in their areas. CFS staff / volunteers will also be encouraged to ensure that children are not at the CFS when they are supposed to be in school and to also actively seek to refer children of school going age to schools for admission when possible. Activities across both sectors will be focused on the same target communities, supporting and strengthening synergies and reinforcing lifesaving and protection outcomes. DRC will work in close coordination with the State Ministry of Education.
The intervention will also address (i) Emergency humanitarian protection needs of newly displaced persons, particularly children and (ii) prevent and mitigate protection risks for children. This is in line with and contributes to the 2018 HRP outcome: &quot;Populations affected by natural or manmade disasters receive timely assistance during and in the aftermath of the shock&quot;. DRC will achieve this through support to CBCPNs, Providing Operational Support for child friendly spaces in Golo and Nertiti, provision of PSS, and training of animators, CBCPN members, and Social Workers.
