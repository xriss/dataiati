   <narrative xml:lang="EN">To reduce acute food and livelihoods insecurity of people affected by conflict in Golo town and surrounding under allocation envelope 1.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In Jebel Mara, the conflict between the Sudanese Armed forces and the Abdul Wahid faction of the Sudan Liberation Army resulted in important and repetitive movement of population, especially in 2016.
According to OCHA timesheet, between 160,000 and 195,000 civilians have been displaced because of the hostilities since that date (&#x201C;Jebel Marra crisis &#x2013; Fact Sheet&#x201D;, OCHA Sudan, October 2016). Returnees started coming back to their land since the calming of the conflict throughout 2017. The movement of returnees is still ongoing and the influx has increased from November 2017.

TGH&#x2019;s strong presence in Golo since the opening of a base with permanent WASH team in 2017, as well as its longstanding presence in Central Darfur, particularly as WASH actor, presents all skills required to address the needs of conflict affected of this area. Indeed, this presence has enabled TGH to learn a lot about FSL in the area, to observe what is relevant and what is not.

The organization conducted several assessments within 2017in order to follow the situation of IDPs and returnees, quickly evolving in this volatile context. Other assessments were conducted in December 2017 and a monitoring mission and assessment took place in January 2018 as well.

The main findings of TGH needs assessments are high rates of malnutrition and food insecurity, poor access to land, good quality seeds and tools and opportunities of livelihood close to none (especially for IDPs and returnees, who are displaced or returning with little or no personal belongings). The proportion of vulnerable individuals in Golo town is extremely high and will increase in the coming months because of the high inflation rate that has been observed since the beginning of 2018. Moreover, IDPs and returnees declared during TGH assessment having difficulties accessing to income generating activities. It means that not only they cannot cover their needs in terms of food, but they also cannot purchase any other essential items.

In order to address vulnerable people&#x2019;s most acute needs, TGH has designed an adapted response with the strategy of maximizing beneficiaries&#x2019; role and choice in the support they receive. This approach is crucial in a context where vulnerable households have seen their living conditions and dignity jeopardized.  Several response mechanisms will be implemented, including multi-purpose cash through an innovative approach. Beneficiaries will be able to cover their multi-sectorial needs according to their own prioritization. Regarding agricultural inputs, this project aims at improving access to good quality seeds, tools, water access for irrigation as well as trainings to strengthen the skills of community members. Moreover, vulnerable HH unable to cultivate land (either because of specific vulnerabilities or because of a lack of access to land) will benefit from home gardening activities. Both these actions will allow beneficiaries to provide their households with food and, on the longer-term, to provide them with an income that will help reducing the dependency on humanitarian assistance. The other long-term impacts of the projects are linked to the capacity building of community and to the cash approach (for tools vouchers and multi-purpose cash) which has proven positive impacts on local economy.

The beneficiaries of this project are conflict affected population, IDPs, returnees and host community in Golo town as well as in surrounding rural villages.</narrative>
