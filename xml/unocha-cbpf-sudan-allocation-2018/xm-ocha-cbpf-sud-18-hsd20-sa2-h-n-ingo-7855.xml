   <narrative xml:lang="EN">GOAL proposes to deliver an integrated, muti-sectoral response (health, and nutrition) targeting the most vulnerable populations affected by the conflict in Kutum and Al Waha localities, North Darfur, who are not receiving other comparable assistance, with an emphasis placed on the needs of women and children. The proposed programing will support 181,671 beneficiaries comprising of IDPs, rural underserved communities, nomadic pastoralists and host communities experiencing protracted crisis. 
With SHF funding GOAL will continue to support 17 health facilities to provide the basic package of primary health care, preventative and emergency response community health activities deliver Outpatient Therapeutic Programmes and support participatory nutrition education activities using the Nutrition Impact and Positive Practice (NIPP) approach to manage moderate acute malnutrition and address the underlying causes of malnutrition. In 2018, as part of the continued effort to increase coverage, GOAL plans to roll out the &apos;Mothers understand can and do MUAC&apos; - also known as &#x2018;MUAC by Mothers&#x2019; approach and train mothers and caregivers to improve screening at community level. Shifting the screening for acute malnutrition from health workers to community members themselves, has the potential to improve health as children arrive at health centers in a less critical state. Early case detection also means more children are treated successfully in less time, with a positive knock on effect reducing cost and the burden on resources. It also has the potential to improve Programme compliance, whereby self-referrals tend to be coupled with improved attendance, as people better understand that their children are ill and families with children who are not as critically ill have lower defaulter rates.

In 2018 &#x2013; 2019 GOAL will increase OTP centers (integrated in the Primary Health Care facilities) from 14 to 17 and aims to increase % of births assisted by skilled birth attendants from 88% to 90% and increase coverage of measles vaccine in children lt 1 from 67% to 80%.

Under this action and with alternative funding from other sources, GOAL plans to provide support to North Darfur State Ministry of Health and WHO to roll out the much needed and long-awaited District Health Information System (DHIS) in 9 localities. GOAL Aims to collaborate with SMoH, WHO and the HIS Directorate at FMoH to enable 9 (out of the 18) localities in North Darfur start monitoring, planning and reporting using DHIS with the objective of enlacing accountability, quality of services, monitoring and planning. This could the best entry point to effectively pilot the humanitarian-development nexus. In 2018 &#x2013; with alternative funding, GOAL in collaboration with FMoH also plans to setup a NIPP Technical and Advisory Services (NTAS) to create demand and serve as a technical hub that will provide assistance in designing, implementing as well as monitoring of the NIPP approach. 

The proposed SHF funding will holistically address the ongoing critical situation in Kutum and Al Waha localities, where high levels of morbidity, the inability of the government to provide adequate health and nutrition services remain a challenge.</narrative>
