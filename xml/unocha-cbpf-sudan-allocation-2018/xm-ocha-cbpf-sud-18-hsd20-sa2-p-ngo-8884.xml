   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Comprehensive Protection Services for Conflict affected  Women and Girls in South Darfur, Bielel Locality (Bielel and El Salam IDP Camps)   Envelope 2</narrative>

  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">GAH is seeking funding to support women and girls activities in Beliel South Darfur through interventions in two IDP camps Bielel and El Salam.  The project aims to build capacity of community to better support their members  and especially those affected by GBV through community based gender sensitive and culturally appropriate interventions that built community resilience, multiplier effect and sustained results . Darfur has the highest number of conflict affected people in Sudan in all categories, Host Communities, IDPs and Refugees, protection of individuals is still at the core of humanitarian aid to South Darfur.  This project offers to tackle a very sensitive neglected area of protection that of Gender Based Violence (GBV) including Sex and Gender Based Violence (SGBV) and  would like to try innovations and practices to reach out to communities to achieve its goals. Women and children bear the greatest brunt in any conflict and more so with GBV where communities settle their scores using women, are still practicing harmful cultural practices and are not open to discussion on women rights and empowerment. 

GAH working in South Darfur has been using activities at women and adolescent girls spaces to create awareness and support vulnerable women and girls  at risk  including risk of GBV and survivors of SGBV to recollect their lives and continue living in dignity, GAH would like to continue/ restart this activities at Bielel working through two women centers ( Bielel and El Salam). The project envisions that giving women  a safe space where they can meet, learn interact. conduct thresh hold activities  and have psycho-social support from trained and experience protection workers has far reaching results in ensuring women and girls get support from each other and from the communities. The safe spaces will also provide a place for further support to S/GBV. We would also like to build community based structures that support the frameworks created and ensure longer term impacts, safety and security for women and girls through advocacy to tackle issues like female genital mutilation (FGM) early marriage, girl child education, women voices and rights recognition and participation of women in communities. 

The project will re- construct one center at Beliel and do rehabilitation and fixtures in another at El Salam (Constructed by GAH in 2015). The activities of the project will be based in these two centers that will have a schedule to allow women attend Tea time Talk, get training on issues of their safety as they conduct their activities going out of the encampments to collect water, wood fire and other livelihood activities. The establishment of the girl power clubs and their activities afterwards will enable project to develop skills of communication assertiveness and enhance leadership among gilrs and thus future women empowerment . The project will also work with men through Dara to Dara sessions (DTD) to not only sensitize them on the issues affecting women but to also garner their support for women in fighting negative traditional practices like FGM, early marriage and S/GBV. 

Other interventions include capacity building of GBV actors and other Community development actors  including those  working in government line ministries in GBV and protection of vulnerable community members this will have a multiple and sustainable effect. Given the many new arrivals and their continued suffering project would like to work with SRCS to develop community based capacity in Psychological First Aid (PFA). Finally in understanding that empowered girls grow into empowered communities the work with the adolescent girts in the girl power club to build their communication leadership and other skills will ensure we have a new generation of women that is empowered to carry on forward long after the project.  Gilrs and women will get an opportunity to engage in Income Generation Activities, Role modelling and recreation.</narrative>
