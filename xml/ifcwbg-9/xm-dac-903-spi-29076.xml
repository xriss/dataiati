   <narrative xml:lang="EN">African countries have agreed to switch their analogue television transmission to Digital Television broadcasting. Government plans call for a total shutdown of analog networks by year 2015. The switch to digital TV will not only make the use of spectrum more efficient but will also expand the possibilities for distribution of content over the airwaves at a very low cost.

NGB Africa AB (the Company) is focused on providing affordable Digital Terrestrial Television (DTT) services across multiple African countries. NGB Africa has already established subsidiaries in 4 countries (Ghana, Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda); the subsidiaries will distribute content from local and global TV channels under a very low cost pay-TV operation. The service is modeled after the mobile prepay business  contracted distributors will sell prepaid cards in fixed denominations that can be loaded onto the STBs and that will allow consumers to subscribe to the different packages for a month.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Project is expected to have the following important development impacts:  

(i)	By increasing the reach of TV broadcasting services to the broader population, the Project will increase access to information for the poor. Increased access to information means increased access to knowledge, increased access to knowledge means increase in opportunities.   
(ii)	The Project will contribute to the development of more competitive media in Africa through supporting the expansion of a private TV broadcaster to new cities that are currently either serviced by national public broadcasting or unserviced at all. 
(iii)	The Project will contribute to the growth of the African advertising industry by providing an additional outlet on which enterprises can promote their services and products thereby increasing awareness and sales.  Studies have shown that a thriving advertising sector is correlated with overall economic advancement, increased competition, enhanced quality and expanded quantity of product and service offerings, local job creation, and poverty reduction.
(iv)	NGB is expected to broadcast world-class, high quality and relevant content. 
(v)	Through the Project, additional jobs will be created and technical and sales capabilities will be nurtured.
(vi)	The Project will help the company put in place a best practices guideline for operating in the media sector. The guideline is currently being prepared by GICT. 
(vii)	The Project will not only have a significant direct positive employment effect as the Company grows, but will also create important upstream and downstream employment opportunities.  NGB growth will create additional demand for labor in technical fields, in the advertising sector and in the creative industries sector. The latter sector, in particular, is one which has not been addressed by IFC financing and trust fund activities in the past, despite the fact that more than 60% of the sector is comprised of SMEs and individuals.</narrative>
