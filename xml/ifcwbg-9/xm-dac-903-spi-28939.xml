   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Supplemented by IFCs and other investors commitments, ECP will have the resources in place to immediately deploy capital across Africa in a manner which will allow companies with proven track records to strengthen their competitive positions, provide jobs through growth and improve corporate governance.   Taking ECP Africa Fund II as an example, 93% of the portfolio companies achieved sales growth in 2008. For the same period, these companies paid a total of about $166 million in taxes and retained close to 28,000 employees, of which about 25% were females. On average, about 90% of the employees were Africans and also served in positions ranging from management teams to board of directors.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed Project is a $25 million investment in ECP Africa Fund III PCC (ECP III), which represents 5.6% of the current fund size.  After the proposed funding, IFCs investment may represent 5.2% of the fund size.  Prior to the global financial crisis, IFC had declined investing in ECP III as no additionality was evident.  However, given the effect that the current global credit crisis has had on PE fundraising, IFC now has a catalytic role and IFCs support to ECP III is considered appropriate.  The Fund Manager has also welcomed IFCs help in updating its Social and Environmental Management System (SEMS), Integrity Due diligence (IDD) and technical expertise. 

The proposed $25 million equity investment in ECP III is expected to catalyze additional $215 million from equity investors and $100 million in debt, and promote responsibility and sustainability by improving Environmental, Social and Governance Standards of the Fund Manager. The proposed Project is also expected to facilitate development of the Integrity Due Diligence Process of the Fund Manager and indirectly, its investee companies.  Furthermore, the Project will assist in mobilizing part of the much needed capital and expertise required to continue steering African economies on a path of sustainable growth. The Fund Manager has demonstrated through its past performance in favorable and unfavorable investment conditions that it has the capacity to help companies grow at above average rates and expand regionally.</narrative>
