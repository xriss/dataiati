   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Project will contribute to the increased capacity of broadband networks and increased access,&#xA0; to IT services for businesses, potentially resulting in improved quality of broadband internet for end-users and enhanced productivity growth for businesses. The Project will also lead to increased competitiveness of the broadband market in selected countries, e.g., Ghana, via competition channels, and stronger economic integration in selected countries, e.g., South Africa and Kenya, by improving connectivity across value chains via the development of cloud/IT services. A successful expansion of submarine or terrestrial cable capacity under open access principles is expected to drop the wholesale price and level the playing field among retail   operators, thereby improving the competitiveness of retail markets with a market-wide&#xA0; improvement in affordability and quality of connectivity in the relevant target countries.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed project involves a senior debt package of up to USD260 million to Seacom Limited (Seacom or the Company), a leading diversified, integrated digital infrastructure company with extensive broadband infrastructure across Africa. Seacom seeks to diversify from its subsea cable operations into the enterprise service provider market across the continent and refinance its short term debt with new longer-term debt (the Project). Through the Project, IFC will help one of the important digital infrastructure companies to increase its enterprise services capabilities to SMEs, medium and large corporates in South Africa, East Africa, and West Africa; leveraging its fiber network spanning 21,000 km (including 17,000 km on its submarine cable) as well as its strategic alliances on the 2Africa Cable and Equiano Cable. Seacoms growth strategy will be achieved through strategic acquisitions and organic growth initiatives across its markets.</narrative>
