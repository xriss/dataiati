   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project outcomes rating is composed of two claims: (i) Stakeholder Effect via increased access to healthcare products. The global shortage of healthcare supplies has led to worldwide competition for these supplies, making it difficult  particularly in developing countries  to purchase  quality medical products at affordable prices. The Project will support operations in the Africa region, that will increase the distribution and sales of healthcare products that are needed in the response to COVID-19 and other diseases. The Project responds to the large need for improved healthcare logistics in Africa. This includes the need to improve cold-storage logistics as part of the roll out of COVID-19 and other vaccines; and (ii) Economy-wide effect via direct jobs created and gross value added. The project will help scale the production, distribution, and delivery of healthcare supplies that is likely to result in the creation of new jobs and/or economic linkages to the rest of the economy. To measure progress against this outcome, IFC will track direct jobs created.</narrative>
