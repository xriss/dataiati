   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Project Outcomes: Stakeholders

Access to Transaction Accounts: The project will support Famoco&apos;s efforts to grow its clients&apos; agent networks across emerging markets in Africa and Asia. Compared to existing solutions, Famoco addresses important sustainability challenges for payment schemes and mobile money networks, to meet increasingly stringent KYC requirements and enables more data security. The number of devices deployed is projected to grow significantly as a result.

Access to Payment Services: The project will support Famoco&apos;s plans to expand services for the digitization and management of humanitarian payments on behalf of the World Food Program (WFP) and others. This includes facilitation of government payments (salaries, subsidies, etc.), and to work with payment service providers to expand their networks enabled with POS devices to accept digital payments. The number of POS-enabled merchants is expected to grow significantly as a result.

Contribution to Market Creation: Integration

IFC anticipates that the project will enhance market integration by promoting linkages across payments networks and digital service providers through an open loop payment system, from the existing usage of services that is limited to P2P transfers using closed loop payment schemes which are non-interoperable and limit the opportunity for growth and delivering value to users.
Networks of agents using Famoco solutions would be leveraged to integrate additional services ranging from simple transactions, such as bill and mobile payments, to more complex ones, such as micro-credit and disbursing government payments. The hardware component would enable the provision of these services, while Famoco will customize its software solution as a platform to deliver them, enabling the integration of payment and data flows across financial and non-financial services and leading to a growth in the services accessible to users, and value to merchants and service providers in the market.</narrative>
