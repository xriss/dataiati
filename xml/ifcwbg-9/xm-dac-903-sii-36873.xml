   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed investment involves IFCs participation in the establishment of and the first capital raise for the Africa Real Estate Platform (AREP), an investment platform, which will acquire (and in certain instances develop) and manage a portfolio of income producing commercial properties in Africa. It is expected that, after several rounds of capital raising and deployment, AREP will reach an optimal size for an initial public offering (IPO) on a major stock exchange and convert into a form analogous to a real estate investment trust (REIT), which will achieve liquidity within 5-7 years. AREP is conceived to become one of the first REITs in SSA and the first Africa-focused collective investment vehicle designed to ramp up to a size feasible for a major stock exchange listing. AREP will target multiple countries in the Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) region and will provide institutional investors, including African pension funds, with an opportunity for diversification. AREP will comprise: (i) an investment holding company (HoldCo), which will pool investors funds and use them to acquire income producing commercial properties in target African countries; and (ii) an asset management company (ManCo), which will manage HoldCos assets on commercial terms. Investors returns will come from rental cash flows of the property portfolio, as well as from capital appreciation.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed project is expected to have strong development impacts. AREP will contribute to the development of capital markets in SSA and bring about positive effects on its clients in target countries. Specifically, the creation of AREP and its eventual conversion into a REIT listed on a major stock exchange will encourage capital inflows from international and regional institutional investors into SSA, as well as overall development of more liquid, diversified and sophisticated financial markets in the region. Further, through improving management practices at its properties and through developing new properties in SSA, AREP will contribute to improving the quality of business infrastructure in the region. The limited availability of high quality business infrastructure has been identified as a constraint to private sector and economic development throughout the African continent, and the modern efficient business infrastructure developed with AREP&apos;&apos;s support in its target countries will (a) serve as a catalyst for local urban development; (b) result in improved business efficiencies, reduced operational costs and waste in the supply chain; and (c) cultivate linkages with a broad range of local businesses.</narrative>
