   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Globally, infrastructure is central to economic growth, improved living standards, and broader development. Investments in infrastructure projects, such as power, water and transport, have direct impacts on improving quality of life and enabling local economic development.  

In the last 15 years, on average about $10 billion a year has been spent on infrastructure in sub Saharan Africa, of which only about 30% was private sector investment and half of that was in the telecommunications sector. It is widely recognized that in order to achieve a reasonable growth rate Africa should be spending at least $20 billion a year. This additional investment cannot all be funded by the public sector and for this reason emphasis is being placed by the WBG and other donors on developing Public Private Partnerships (PPPs).  If the development of a larger number of PPPs is successful, very large amounts of additional long term private sector debt will be required.   The project is another of the building blocks necessary to achieve increased involvement of the private sector in the development of infrastructure projects. Higher private sector financing catalyzed will free public sector capital for investment in other priority sectors.  The project also supports the expansion of a highly successful Fund which has already demonstrated its ability to originate and book commitments for projects in Africa, not only alongside existing DFIs in larger projects, but more recently and increasingly on a sole mandate basis with smaller clients.

The development impact of the project is thus captured in terms of the amount of private investment mobilized into productive infrastructure, the expansion of access to infrastructure made available by project investments, and the quality of those investments and the role of the Fund in extending appropriate environmental and social standards.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Emerging Africa Infrastructure Fund Limited (EAIF or the Fund) is a Public Private Partnership able to provide long-term USD or EUR denominated debt or mezzanine finance on commercial terms to finance the construction and development of private infrastructure in 45 countries across sub-Saharan Africa. 

The Fund was initially structured in 2002 in three tranches with total capitalization of $305 million:

- an equity tranche consisting of $100 million which was contributed by the Private Infrastructure Development Group (PIDG); 
- a subordinated tranche of $85 million, contributed by Development Financial Institutions (DFIs); and 
- a senior tranche of $120 million contributed by DFIs and commercial banks. The senior tranche was refinanced and increased to $180 million in 2006 creating a Fund size of $365 million.

The project entails increasing the size of the Fund from $365 million to $600 million, which EAIF proposes to finance with $50 million of additional equity from PIDG Trust and $185 million of additional debt to be provided by IFC, commercial banks and other DFIs.</narrative>
