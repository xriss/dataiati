   <narrative xml:lang="EN">IFCs investment in ETI is expected to deliver strong development impact mainly by stabilizing ETI and selected banking subsidiaries and thus speeding up economic recovery and maintaining and/or creating jobs in many of the IDA countries where the Group operates.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed project will be carried out through the IFC Capitalization (Equity) Fund L.P. and the IFC Capitalization (Subordinated Debt) Fund L.P (collectively, the Fund), unless the project is rejected by the Funds Investment Committee, in which case IFC may proceed with it on its own.  

The proposed project consists of two facilities to Ecobank Transnational Incorporated (ETI or the Group) or to selected subsidiaries of ETI totaling up to $137.2 million: (i) an up to 10-year (with up to 2 years grace) subordinated convertible loan of up to $58.8 million through the IFC Capitalization (Equity) Fund L.P., and (ii) an up to 10-year (with up to 2 years grace) subordinated non-convertible loan of up to $78.4 million through the IFC Capitalization (Subordinated Debt) Fund L.P.  The purpose of the proposed project is to strengthen the Groups capital base by providing it with subordinated loans having the characteristics of Tier II capital.  If the investment is at the level of the holding company, IFC will require that the funds be invested in up to 17 ETI subsidiaries that meet the eligibility criteria of the Fund.  

IFC, on its own account, is also supporting the capital base of Ecobank Kenya Limited (EBK) and Ecobank Liberia Limited (EBL) by investing directly in both subsidiaries as follows:

an up to 8-year (with up to 5 years grace) subordinated convertible loan, having Tier 2 characteristics, of up to US$12.5 million to EBK; and 
an up to 8-year (with up to 5 years grace) subordinated loan, having Tier 2 characteristics, of up to US$3.0 million to EBL.</narrative>
