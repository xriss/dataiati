   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Africa suffers from significant investments deficits in infrastructure (transport, power, and utility) that are hampering the regions ability to grow, compete, and reduce poverty. These infrastructure needs are expected to become even more significant in the context of further regional economic growth. Private sector involvement is required in order to address the infrastructure challenge and to assist in maintaining critical aviation infrastructure.   Safe, efficient, good quality and affordable airline service is vital to Africa, given the substantial distances between urban centers, and inadequate rail and road infrastructure. Once fully operational, the Divisions aviation activities will be an important part of Africas aviation infrastructure, providing essential, safe, reliable commercially scheduled air transport services in the region. Moreover, the Divisions wide network and coverage of cities throughout East and West Africa will further enhance access to remote areas, thereby aiding in their economic development.    The proposed Project is expected to promote inter-regional and international trade in the region. Additionally, the Project is also expected to provide a boost to tourism.  Continued trade and economic growth in Africa is contingent on further investments and improvements in regional transport infrastructure and services. The Divisions operation will fill the service gap that exists today and will result in increased frequencies for existing destinations as well as the addition of new destinations, better passenger service and improved efficiency and safety. Such improvements will increase the connectivity, competitiveness and attractiveness of these countries economies. Moreover, the proposed Project will support regional integration by assisting the development and expansion of a group of regional airlines.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Aga Khan Fund for Economic Development (AKFED), through its Aviation Services division (the Division), is currently expanding its activities in both East and West Africa.  The aim of the Division is to assist in maintaining the critical aviation infrastructure in support of economic development and to provide much needed regional airline services in Africa.  The Project would consist of a corporate loan of up to $25 million to AKFED for on-lending to its three airlines: Air Burkina, Air Mali and Air Uganda, to allow AKFED to consolidate all of the Divisions airline and aviation activities and optimize routing, synergies and overall effectiveness across the groups airline operations.</narrative>
