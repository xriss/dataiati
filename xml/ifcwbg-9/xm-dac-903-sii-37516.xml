   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Metier Capital Growth Fund II is expected to deliver strong development impact in the following areas:  (i) Job Creation: The growth of the Fund&apos;s portfolio companies is expected to result in strong job creation. Mid-cap growth equity investments, which the Fund is focusing on, have significant reach to SMEs, the largest impact on job creation, and the potential for IFC to develop direct relationships with the underlying companies. IFC&apos;s portfolio experience has been that non-SME&apos;s in the growth equity space create more jobs than SMEs at a lower capital commitment per job created.  (ii) IDA countries:  The Fund will target 50% outside South Africa, which will cover companies located in IDA/frontier countries.   (iii) Private sector development: The Fund will employ hands-on management in its portfolio companies. The Fund Mananger&apos;s structuring know-how will be leveraged on, and value-add and growth strategies incorporated by investee companies, leading to improved competitiveness and sustainability.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed project entails an IFC equity investment for the lesser of ZAR300.0 million or US$22 million, not to exceed 20% of total commitments, in Metier Capital Growth Fund II (Metier II or the Fund), a 10 year closed-end fund seeking to raise up to ZAR 3 billion. The key objective of Metier II is to construct a portfolio of investments diversified by sector and deal type, which collectively capture the attractive mid-market growth opportunity in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). The Fund will invest in 8 to 12 control or significant minority investments in mid-market growth and replacement capital transactions. Consistent with the investment strategy deployed by its previous funds, Metier II will seek to invest in high-growth opportunities, some of which may offer cross-border expansion throughout the region. The Fund will seek 50% exposure outside South Africa (SA).  Metiers investment themes build upon the strategy employed in the predecessor fund focusing on sectors that are set to benefit from positive demographic trends, rising investment in infrastructure services, and intra-regional trade. The strategy will have a SSA geographic focus, using SA as a gateway, and moving outside into the rest of Africa in concentric circles. The SSA strategy will thus be primarily buy-and-build with bolt-ons rather than individual standalone investments. The Manager sees opportunities in Southern African companies partnering with local companies in SSA to provide capital, industry expertise, customer relationships and management skills, to take advantage of the market growth opportunities. Metiers focus remains on a similar fund size to their predecessor fund, and remains focused on mid-market opportunities.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">Metier II will be structured as two sub-funds: Metier Capital Growth Fund II, an en commandite partnership to be established in South Africa (the SA fund) and the Metier Capital Growth International Fund II LP (the international fund), a limited partnership registered under the Mauritian Limited Partnership Act of 2011. The two sub-funds will have similar terms and conditions, and will co-invest at the same time and on the same terms in all investments pro rata based on the aggregate capital commitments of each partnership.   The Project team is currently based in South Africa but has plans to open offices outside the country post Final Close. The Funds investment geography will look at making 50% of its investments outside South Africa on a look-through basis.</narrative>
