   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Action Against Hunger proposes to continue the delivery of nutrition services in these areas during 2018 for the prevention and treatment of malnutrition in compliance with CMAM existing national guidelines. The organization will continue the running of 2 stabilization centers, 16 OTP/TSFP sites in Aweil East, and 12 OTP/TSFP sites in Gogrial West, alongside 3 nutrition sites in Old Fangak. MIYCN activities, including sensitization, will take place at nutrition sites and at community level during screening and come visits by community volunteers. Mother to Mother Support Groups, composed mainly of PLW and caregivers, will be created in the catchment area of each of the nutrition sites.  

The project will support Action Against Hunger&#x2019;s ongoing Multi-Sector Emergency Team (MET) in responding to crises around South Sudan and supporting partners on the ground in launching a humanitarian and developmental response. Action Against Hunger will also continue to monitor the nutrition situation of these high burden states through SMART survey assessments.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Over 1.1 million children are estimated to be acutely malnourished in South Sudan in 2017, as food security has further deteriorated due to armed conflict, economic crisis, and below-average harvests that were exhausted well before the lean season. The ongoing conflict, displacement and poor access to services, disease outbreaks, extremely poor diets (in terms of both quality and quantity), low coverage of sanitation facilities and poor hygiene practices are the key drivers of the high levels of acute malnutrition across South Sudan. Large scale flooding in Fangak and fighting around Ronga and Kaldak has restricted humanitarian access to those in need.</narrative>
