   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project will procure a stock of malaria test and treatment to ensure that its nutrition sites across the states of Warrap and NBeG are covered for 12 months. Additionally, Action Against Hunger proposes to employ specialty nurses to train and follow up with the nutrition site staff to ensure quality standards are maintained. The organization operates 28 nutrition sites, which offers an opportunity to improve coverage and support public health structures in the identification and referral of malnourished children with medical complications. The integration of malaria testing and treatment at nutrition site level offers the chance to have a significant impact with relatively little additional funds, as well as mitigating the negative malnutrition-malaria cycle. Additionally, the project will invest in the improvement of infrastructure in its two stabilization centers to ensure that they are able to cope with an increased caseload as referrals to the centers of malnourished children with severe malaria are expected to increase.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project supports Action Against Hunger&apos;s nutrition programming for children under five suffering from severe acute malnutrition related to the food security emergency situation in Northers Bahr el Ghazal and Warrap States, South Sudan. South Sudan is experiencing a humanitarian crisis that peaked in the middle of 2016. More than 3 million have fled their homes since the beginning of the conflict in 2013. Approximately six million people remained severely food insecure at the height of the lean season in July. Warrap and NBeG states have become increasingly dependent on external food sources, yet food supply in local markets has been seriously limited due to the Sudan/South Sudan border closing and increasing conflict in the Equatorias. Much of the population of South Sudan&#x2019;s northern states has been displaced to Sudan. Malaria is one of the leading causes of sickness and death in South Sudan, particularly for children. Preventable and treatable diseases like malaria can further deteriorate the status of children already suffering from acute or chronic undernutrition. With the onset of the rains in June, malaria case increased exponentially, particularly between the months of July, August and September.</narrative>
