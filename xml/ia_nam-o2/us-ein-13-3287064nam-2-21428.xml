   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Addressing WaSH Needs of Vulnerable Populations in Yobe</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Since 2009, northeast Nigeria has been affected by insecurity as a result of armed conflict-related violence. The resulting humanitarian crisis has impacted over 14.8 million people, left 7 million in need of humanitarian assistance and displaced 1.8 million people, 135,422 of whom currently reside in Yobe state. GAC granted Action Against Hunger a cost extension after dire needs in newly accessible areas such as Gujba (Yobe) and Moguno and Kukawa LGAs (Borno) were identified as even more severe among both IDPs and returnees. Access to safe water and sanitation is extremely limited, and malnutrition remains extremely difficult to identify and treat. Lacking proper WaSH facilities, populations are at risk of contracting waterborne diseases which, in turn, exacerbates malnutrition. Action Against Hunger will address immediate needs for vulnerable, crisis-affected populations through improving access to safe water, sanitation facilities and improving hygiene.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The WASH activities will be integrated with current ACF nutrition and food security and livelihoods programs in the same geographic areas to provide comprehensive assistance. Activities under this proposed intervention will target health facilities where ACF is supporting Community Management of Acute Malnutrition (CMAM) and will include the construction and/or rehabilitation of water points, the construction and/or rehabilitation of gender-appropriate sanitation facilities and the promotion of proper hygiene practices through Community Led Total Sanitation (CLTS), Participatory Hygiene and Sanitation Transformation (PHAST) and hygiene promotion sessions.
Through prioritizing health facilities, mothers/caretakers and malnourished children will be supported. Women and girls will be consulted during all stages of activity design and implementation and will be integral agents of change for improving safe hygiene practices.

Through coordinating with other actors in Yobe and Borno states on gaps in needed coverage, ACF is proposing for this intervention to target the most vulnerable, conflict-affected individuals in communities in Nangere, Tarmuwa and Gujba LGAs in Yobe state and Mongunu and Kukawa LGA in Borno state. Since ACF will be working in most affected and newly accessible areas, it is expected that the intervention will primarily reach returnees, internally displaced persons and vulnerable host community members. Through strengthening these services at health facilities and promoting improved practices at home, ACF will disrupt the vicious circle of diarrhoea/nematodes/enteropathy leading to malnutrition.</narrative>
