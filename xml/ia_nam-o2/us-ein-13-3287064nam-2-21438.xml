   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Integrated Preventive Health Care and Nutrition Response to South Sudanese Refugees in Uganda</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The escalation of conflict in South Sudan has resulted in a mass displacement of people both internally and to neighboring countries. Uganda is South Sudan&#x2019;s neighbor to the south and has received the highest number of refugees with over 510,965 refugee men, women and children seeking international protection as refugees since July 2016. The government of Uganda, in partnership with the humanitarian community, has since launched a humanitarian response to address the needs of the displaced persons; however, the unprecedented refugee influx has put enormous pressure on the country&#x2019;s resources, in particular on land, basic service delivery systems, on humanitarian and development partners&#x2019; capacity to respond to the crisis, and on the ability to maintain Uganda&#x2019;s generous refugee policy. A 2016 survey indicated high rates of anemia among children under 5 and pregnant and lactating women, and the nutrition situation in Bidibidi remains poor relative to nearby regions. Reports put program coverage under 60% and reveal low awareness among caregivers on malnutrition as well as challenges in the approach to active case finding with weak linkages between the health system and the community.

The project&apos;s objectives are:

1. Strengthen the capacity of the district health systems to supervise, monitor, evaluate and provide curative approaches against disease and acute malnutrition.

2. Strengthen the linkages between community based health structures for early case identification, referral and management of acute malnutrition and common childhood illnesses.

3. Support capacity of the district health systems to provide preventive services against malnutrition

4. Support district capacity to prevent anemia among children 6 - 59 months.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project will continue to support the district health systems to provide equitable nutrition and health services to both refugee and host communities. At community level, Action Against Hunger will aspire to reach the most vulnerable segments of the population by strengthening the capacities of community based Village Health Teams (VHTs) in each of the refugee settlements. To maximize the impact of the proposed interventions Action Against Hunger will foster linkages between the PRM funded interventions and other actions funded with support of other donors in the WASH and livelihood sector. During this period, the key program priorities for Action Against Hunger are: management of acute malnutrition, promotion of essential nutrition actions, disease outbreak mitigation and response and prevention of micronutrient deficiencies. Activities include trainings for health workers, logistical support to health facilities for identification and treatment of malnutrition, community mobilizations efforts, and the provision of multivitamin powders to children under five.</narrative>
