   <narrative xml:lang="EN">SET and MET: An Integrated Response in South Sudan</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Action Against Hunger has been operational in what is now South Sudan since 1985 responding to both chronic and acute needs through a multi-sectoral strategy where nutrition, FSL and WASH activities are integrated to have a meaningful impact on communities&apos; resilience. The magnitude of food insecurity in South Sudan is unprecedented, and acute malnutrition remains a major public health emergency. In response, since 2014, Action Against Hunger has been leading an emergency response to malnutrition in different areas through its Multi-Sectoral Emergency Team (MET) and Surveillance and Evaluation Team (SET).

The SET is a roving team that guarantees the collection, analysis and availability of reliable data to understand the extent of nutritional needs in a certain area. Moreover, by providing accurate data about SAM and GAM rates, it contributes to the formulation and design of nutrition programs tailored to those needs. The lack of sufficient accurate data on the nutrition situation within South Sudan has been identified as one of the key weaknesses in facilitating the nutrition cluster to appropriately coordinate responses. Through the SET, Action Against Hunger contributes by strengthening the South Sudan Nutrition Information Working Group (NIWG), as well as by building technical capacities related to SMART methodology of implementing partners.

Through the MET, Action Against Hunger integrates Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH) and Food Security and Livelihoods (FSL) components into nutrition emergency activities to treat and better prevent under-nutrition in South Sudan. The MET team is one of the two leading partners of the Rapid Response Mechanism (RRM) of the Nutrition cluster, contributing to providing emergency nutrition capacity throughout South Sudan and specifically in hard to reach locations. In order to ensure that mothers and children have access to critical nutrition and life-saving services, the MET will strengthen existing health facilities in partnership with the Ministry of Health, run outreach sites in hard to reach locations, distribute hygiene in tandem with hygiene promotion sessions for caregivers, establish Mother-to-Mother Support Groups, and deliver food security and livelihoods kits alongside livelihoods trainings.</narrative>
