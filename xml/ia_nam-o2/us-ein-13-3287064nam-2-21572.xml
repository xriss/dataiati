  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The on&#x2010;going crisis, including the most recent fighting in Juba in July 2016, continues to affect the livelihood groups of concern, fisher folk, farmers and urban populations. Access to sources of food for displaced and food&#x2010;insecure households has been a priority across the country to combat malnutrition, disease and destitution.&#x202F; 

The conflict has led to increased insecurity along commercial supply corridors, flight of private sector actors, market fragmentation, food and fuel price inflation, risks of cattle raiding, limitations or changes on mobility for livestock, fishing and hunting migrations and conflict-related displacement. It has also seen the establishment of IDP camps or the absorption of IDPs within host communities, placing an additional burden on their already weakened livelihoods.&#x202F;Local communities have put in place coping mechanisms that have further depleted their livelihood. The affected population, IDPs, host communities and vulnerable people, need livelihood support in order to sustain their livelihood, cope with the existing situation and be less dependent on food assistance.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Therefore FAO, in partnership with other actors including Action Against Hunger, will provide Livelihood support to ensure assistance reach the most at-risk populations according to the IPC acute or emergency phase classification.&#x202F;FAO will contribute to improved food security, income and dietary diversification by improving access of vulnerable farmers to quality seeds, either through direct distribution of emergency kits or voucher based seed fairs (SFs). The programme will target all 78 counties in the country (as per OCHA definition). 

The first responsibility of Action Against Hunger will be the identification and registration of beneficiaries. Where possible, crop seeds will be distributed through seed fairs using vouchers to procure 10kg to 15kg of seeds. Where this is not possible, crop kits, vegetable kits, and/or fishing kits will be distributed instead.</narrative>
