   <narrative xml:lang="EN">As a result of the 2016 drought, food security dramatically deteriorated and 6.2 million people face acute food insecurity through June 2017. 439,000 remain on the brink of famine, a condition ultimately indicated by a poor wet season, declining purchasing power, and a lack of humanitarian access. In response to the drought, the Food Agriculture Organization is implement extensive Cash for Work (CfW) and unconditional cash transfer programs for Somalia, for which Action Against Hunger will be the service provider (SP). The short-term objective of this project is to increase food availability and food access for drought affected communities in selected locations of Somalia. In the medium and in the long-term and in synergy with other FAO interventions in support of the agriculture and livestock sectors, the project aims at strengthening resilience to drought and improve livelihoods sustainability of pastoral, agro-pastoral and riverine communities (as applicable) targeted by the project.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project will provide 1,200 beneficiaries with unconditional cash transfers on a monthly basis for a period of three months in Jariban and Burtinle Districts. The amount provided will be 80% of the Minimum Expenditure Basket, or the money a household needs to cover fully or partially, a set of basic and/or recover needs. While the percentage represents an unusually high percentage, it is appropriate for the severity of the crisis in Somalia and the level of resource scarcity. Action Against Hunger will work with community elders to identify and register the most vulnerable households, using indicators for vulnerability such as the food consumption score, which considers dietary diversity, food frequency, and relative nutritional importance of different food groups. The organization will coordinate the cash intervention with all other implementing actors in the region, and mobilize and sensitize regional and district authorities on all project aspects. The first beneficiary payment will be released upon approval of the gender report/analysis, which details the process for incorporating women as beneficiaries.</narrative>
