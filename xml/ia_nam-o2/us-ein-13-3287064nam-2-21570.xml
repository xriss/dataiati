   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Action Against Hunger will conduct cash for assets activities to utilize food and cash aid resources to pay for community, public works programs, or income generating activities and human skill development. The cash or food would not only be used as a means of creating work, but also to transform the output into assets and build resilience of vulnerable communities in the wake of future shocks. Activities include restoration of productive capacity of arable lands through cultivation; development of community assets through the construction of ponds and roads; and the construction of dykes and flood control dilates to improve climate adaptation. Women in girls will be targeted specifically for livelihoods activities, representation in committees, and participation in trainings, and community members will be involved at all levels of project implementation.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In 2016, more than half of South Sudan&#x2019;s population needed humanitarian assistance. July fighting in Juba exacerbated instability and 4.3 million people need emergency assistance.  The food security and nutritional situation is severe across the country, and is particularly critical in the North in states such as Northern Bar el Ghazal and Warrap, where Action Against Hunger is working. Although these areas have not seen direct fighting, they have been heavily affected by the conflict due to the challenges of agricultural production in these areas and their resulting reliance on external food sources to support the population. Food supply in these areas has been affected by the closure of the Sudan/South Sudan border and insecurity in other areas of South Sudan, which has impacted southern supply routes.</narrative>
