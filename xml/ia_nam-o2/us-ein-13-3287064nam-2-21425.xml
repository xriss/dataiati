   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Action Against Hunger aims to extend and scale-up its current FFP intervention to continue to increase short-term purchasing power to meet immediate food needs, increase dietary diversity, support the restoration of livelihoods and increase complementary nutrition programming. The organization also intends to cover the existing 3,000 households targeted during the phase I, and an additional 1,600HH being targeted in response to the nearly 200,000 people in Yobe classified in an emergency; to minimize gaps with the closure of the current program in February 2016 and to ensure coverage through the predicted crisis period; to use the care group model, IYCF and hygiene messaging that will indirectly reach a larger number of beneficiaries through mothers improving practices that affect the entire household; to address emergency needs and to minimize gaps with the closure of the current FFP-funded program; to provide monthly unconditional cash transfers and electronic food vouchers to 4,600 households for ten months.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The intervention is built to respond to priority needs: access to nonfood items, access to water and sanitation and increasing purchasing power, protecting and restoring livelihoods trough the replacement of lost assets. Action Against Hunger will deliver health, psychosocial and nutrition services. The health activities of this project will strengthen primary healthcare and reproductive services and the treatment of communicable diseases through the provision of inputs along with training for health workers. The project will deliver training to community volunteers to improve health, hygiene, psychosocial, and nutrition awareness. AAH will support nutritional services at health facilities through training and promotion of Infant and Young Child Feeding (IYCF) practices and support for Community-based Management of Acute Malnutrition (CMAM). WaSH activities will improve access to safe water and adequate sanitation facilities at the same health facilities/sites and in their surrounding communities through construction and rehabilitation of boreholes and latrines, along with hygiene promotion. Non-food items, such as hygiene kits, will provide for the immediate non-food item needs of vulnerable households in the affected areas and enable the recipients to adopt improved hygiene practices.</narrative>
