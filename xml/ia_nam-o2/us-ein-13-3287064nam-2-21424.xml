   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The intervention is built to respond to priority needs: access to nonfood items, access to water and sanitation and increasing purchasing power, protecting and restoring livelihoods trough the replacement of lost assets. Action Against Hunger will deliver health, psychosocial and nutrition services. The health activities of this project will strengthen primary healthcare and reproductive services and the treatment of communicable diseases through the provision of inputs along with training for health workers. The project will deliver training to community volunteers to improve health, hygiene, psychosocial, and nutrition awareness. AAH will support nutritional services at health facilities through training and promotion of Infant and Young Child Feeding (IYCF) practices and support for Community-based Management of Acute Malnutrition (CMAM). WaSH activities will improve access to safe water and adequate sanitation facilities at the same health facilities/sites and in their surrounding communities through construction and rehabilitation of boreholes and latrines, along with hygiene promotion. Non-food items, such as hygiene kits, will provide for the immediate non-food item needs of vulnerable households in the affected areas and enable the recipients to adopt improved hygiene practices.</narrative>
