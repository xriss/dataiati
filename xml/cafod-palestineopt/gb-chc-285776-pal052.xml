   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Fatalities and casualties caused by a renewed round of violence in the Israeli/Palestinian conflict starting May 10, 2021 has resulted in 253 reported Gazan Palestinian fatalities including 66 children, 39 women and 17 elderly. Moreover, 1,948 Gazan Palestinians have been injured, (MoH, May 24, 2021); placing considerable strain on a health system already overwhelmed by the strains of the global COVID-19 pandemic.   Most persons displaced during hostilities in the Gaza Strip are returning home but about 1,000 are  homeless due to destruction of their homes.  Health care has been affected by extensive damage and destruction to infrastructure including health facilities, lack of electricity and the scarcity of fuel for generators (resulting in the closure of a hospital providing essential care to cancer patients).  Water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) infrastructure was also severely affected during the escalation, and according to the WASH Cluster, due to lack of power supply, three main desalination plants providing drinking water for more than 400,000 people have suspended operation and so have sewage treatment facilities.  As a result more than 100,000 cubic metres of untreated or partially treated wastewater are being discharged to the sea daily. In total, an estimated 800,000 people lack regular access to piped water (OCHA, May 20, 2021).

Caritas Jerusalem reopened its main clinic in Gaza City as soon as a ceasefire allowed safe resumption of activity, and can deploy 5 mobile medical teams each with 2 doctors (1 m/ 1 f), 2 nurses, a pharmacist, lab technician and health educator to provide health services in Beit Hanoun, Beit Lahia, Al Shijaea, Al Bureij refugee camp and Beach camp (all in North and East of the Gaza Strip which was particularly heavily impacted).  Teams will receive upgraded training on management of mass casualties, basic emergency care, trauma management and infection prevention and control in order to provide a wide range of primary health services to sick children, older people and those with disabilities or chronic conditions, expectant mothers and others, also first aid to injured, and COVID-19 awareness with delivery of hygiene kits and PPE.</narrative>
