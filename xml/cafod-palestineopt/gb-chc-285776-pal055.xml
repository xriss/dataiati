  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The most severe escalation of hostilities against Gaza since 2014 took place 10-21 May 2021 with Israeli
forces carrying out over 1,500 air, land and sea strikes on Gaza. These resulted in significant loss of life and human suffering, and the humanitarian consequences have been devastating, exacerbating the impact of almost 14 years of an Israeli blockade and recurrent escalations.  A health system already on the verge of collapse due to supply shortages was further overstretched to cope with COVID-19, and is now struggling to meet the needs of those injured during the hostilities. It should be noted that efforts to contain the pandemic have undermined the delivery of other essential healthcare services as healthcare centres were converted into quarantine and isolation centres and some 400 doctors, nurses, and administrative staff mobilised to support their operation, and an estimated 64,000 people have been affected by the deprioritisation of treatment for non-communicable diseases and palliative care. Caritas Jerusalem will provide a wide range of health services (primary healthcare, maternal and child health, management of communicable and non-communicable diseases) and psychosocial support for traumatised individuals.  Additionally 400 very poor and vulnerable families will be assisted through small cash transfers to enable them to meet other needs.</narrative>
