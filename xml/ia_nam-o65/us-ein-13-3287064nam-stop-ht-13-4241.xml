   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The YouthBuild Haiti Rebuilding Academy (YHRA) is a five-year initiative designed to improve the livelihood prospects of Haitian youth and mobilize young people in Haiti to play a significant leadership role in rebuilding the earthquake devastated country. The program is carried out by the Initiative for the Development of Young People Outside of School (IDEJEN), Haiti&apos;s largest youth-serving NGO. During the five-year implementation period, YHRA will reach at least 9,000 young people and engage them in post-earthquake rebuilding projects focused on the rebuilding and building of homes, schools, health clinics, sanitation blocks, and green infrastructure. The program includes six months of intensive on-site skills training, leadership development and basic education, followed by six months of follow-up support as young people seek viable opportunities for employment and self employment. Project activities are delivered out of centers built by YouthBuild and IDEJEN students. 

For eight years, IDEJEN has been successfully reaching out-of-school, disconnected and needy young people across Haiti and providing them with hope through basic education, skills training, and a range of job and self-employment preparation to position them for productive livelihoods. The addition of Stop Hunger Now meals enables Youthbuild and IDEJEN to provide for the nutritional needs of the students enrolled in their development program.
