   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Stop Hunger Now works to support the development efforts of Reach Now&apos;s partner organizations by providing food aid to two of their partners in Haiti.

Reach Now International Inc. is a non-profit international Evangelistic Missions organization committed to reaching the desperate and devastated worldwide with the gospel and practical help. Reach Now believes in &quot;Strategic Partnership for Strategic Impact,&quot; simply meaning they do everything through joint projects with other organizations in the US and overseas. They aim to &quot;Empower Organizations to Multiply their Impact.&quot;

Fishers of Men Ministries feeds more than 2600 needy children though 12 school feeding programs in Haiti. The school feeding program helps the nation of Haiti greatly by building up responsible, educated citizens who contribute to the improvement of their country.  According to Miranda Threadgill, Haiti Coordinator for Fishers of Men Ministries, &quot;Stop hunger Now has given these children the ability to stay healthy by eating nutritious meals on a constant basis but also has given the children the ability to live again with hope for a brighter future. &quot;

World Harvest Missions in Haiti is an organization that utilizes the meals to feed over 2000 Haitians in 10 schools, 4 orphanages, and 6 medical facilities. &quot;Our programs save lives. They bring help to children that would normally not have access to good meals that sustain them and build their immune systems. [These people] are literally neglected. They all have high disease rates, high death rates, there is little or no assistance available.&quot; They are also working on many sustainability initiatives, including clean water and agriculture development.</narrative>
