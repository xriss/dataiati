  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Hopestart International Inc. is a 501(C)(3) tax exempt organization founded shortly after the disastrous earthquake of January 2010 that resulted in the loss of over 300,000 lives in the already impoverished country of Haiti. The work of Hopestart began with the drilling of deep water wells to alleviate the dual scourge of high infant mortality and adult water-borne diseases both of which are caused by drinking contaminated water. That work quickly expanded with the opening of the Hopestart Children&#x2019;s Home to provide a safe and healthy living environment for children orphaned by AIDS, cholera and natural disasters like hurricanes and earthquakes. Hopestart also runs a center for babies abandoned by single mothers who already have one or more children for whom they are not able to provide. In addition to these children, Hopestart provides nutritious meals for children who attend public primary schools but are so malnourished they are not able to learn much - if anything - of what they are being taught. For the past three years, Hopestart has been providing two nutritious meals a week to a growing number of these children, now numbering over 525. With the meals donated by Stop Hunger Now, Hopestart will be able to expand this program by providing nutritious meals to over 1,000 children five times a week. This will enable them to achieve the level of physical development needed to sustain the acquisition of a basic education essential for breaking the oppressive cycle of poverty that has afflicted Haitian communities for such a long time.</narrative>
