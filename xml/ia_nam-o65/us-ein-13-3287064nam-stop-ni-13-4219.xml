   <narrative xml:lang="EN">ORPHANetwork&apos;s mission is to equip orphans and at risk children in developing countries to fully realize their God-given potential. They serve abandoned, abused, and at-risk children in Nicaragua through various infrastructures including: the local church, local school systems, orphanages, and feeding centers. Their model is a network of North American, international and indigenous partners working together to build and strengthen orphanages and impoverished communities in Nicaragua in a way that creates real and lasting change. 

Twenty-two feeding programs are supported by ORPHANetwork in Nicaragua. Through these programs, more than 2,500 children are nourished each weekday. The communities served are some of the poorest in Nicaragua and the feeding programs prevent children from becoming &quot;social orphans.&quot; By guaranteeing one nutritious meal to these children each weekday, the probability that they will be able to continue living with their families increases significantly. The feeding programs also serve the community holistically by drawing the children to school, monitoring their health, initiating micro-enterprise, providing a space for families to work together and connecting them to the local church. ORPHANetwork additionally supports six orphanages, which are home to more than 300 children. 
The addition of Stop Hunger Now meals enables ORPHANetwork  to provide for the nutritional needs of the children enrolled in their development programs.
