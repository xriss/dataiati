   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Salesian Missions is a network of 34,000 Priests, Brothers and Sisters around the world who work to enable poor and suffering children to live better lives and build brighter futures. The Salesians of Don Bosco operate 5,000 schools and technical training centers, 23 colleges, 216 clinics and hospitals, 225 orphanages and shelters, and run a wide variety of social and economic development activities throughout the world. In each country, the Salesians combine various works including orphanages, primary and secondary schools, vocational training, churches, children&apos;s recreation centers and various other social programs. 
The Salesians of Don Bosco began working in Swazliand in 1952, first operating a primary school and eventually adding a secondary school. They began the Manzini Youth Care program in 1978 in response to the growing numbers of children living on the streets. This program added six residential homes and an orphanage to their works. Additionally, they operate a bridging school for those who have never been to school or who have dropped out of school because of poverty and they train young adults for self-employment through technical education. The large Bosco Arena and Oratory provide extra-curricular activities for children after school and on holidays.The addition of Stop Hunger Now meals enables the Salesians to provide for the nutritional needs of the students enrolled in their development programs.</narrative>
