   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Salesian Missions is a network of 34,000 Priests, Brothers and Sisters around the world who work to enable poor and suffering children to live better lives and build brighter futures. The Salesians of Don Bosco operate 5,000 schools and technical training centers, 23 colleges, 216 clinics and hospitals, 225 orphanages and shelters, and run a wide variety of social and economic development activities throughout the world. In each country, the Salesians combine various works including orphanages, primary and secondary schools, vocational training, churches, children&apos;s recreation centers and various other social programs. 

The  Salesian program Fundacion EDYTRA-Educacion Y Trabajo (Education and Work Foundation) in El Salvador provides at-risk children and youth with an education and skills to develop their personal capacity to a point where they can provide for themselves with dignity. They operate a large technical school from which students can launch and participate in cooperative enterprises such as bakeries, automotive repair shops, print shops and more. This model allows students, and the program itself, to become self-sustaining. In addition to the technical school, EDYTRA operates a nursery school and assists an elderly care center in a neighboring slum. The addition of Stop Hunger Now meals enables the Salesians to provide for the nutritional needs of the children and adults enrolled in their development program.
