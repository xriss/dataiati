   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Salesian Missions is a network of 34,000 Priests, Brothers and Sisters around the world who work to enable poor and suffering children to live better lives and build brighter futures. The Salesians of Don Bosco operate 5,000 schools and technical training centers, 23 colleges, 216 clinics and hospitals, 225 orphanages and shelters, and run a wide variety of social and economic development activities throughout the world. In each country, the Salesians combine various works including orphanages, primary and secondary schools, vocational training, churches, children&apos;s recreation centers and various other social programs. 

The Salesians of Don Bosco began the Manzini Youth Care program in 1978 as a service project of the boys of the Salesian High School in Swaziland in response to the growing numbers of children living on the streets. At first, the children were housed in the unused mortuary rooms of St. Teresa&#x2019;s mission, with the primary intention of integrating them back into their families. Longer-term needs surfaced, not only for food and shelter, but also for schooling and skills training. 

Today, the Salesians run six residential homes and an orphanage. Additionally, they operate a bridging school for those who have never been to school or who have dropped out of school because of poverty. The Salesians also train young adults for self-employment, as unemployment is high. Skills such as carpentry, motor mechanics, electronics, baking, hairdressing, and screen-printing are taught. The Bosco Study Centre offers assistance to those students who fail their final year at school. More than 300 students attend each year to better their matriculation results. The large Bosco Arena and Oratory provide extra-curricular activities for children after school and on holidays.The addition of Stop Hunger Now meals enables the Salesians to provide for the nutritional needs of the students enrolled in their development program.</narrative>
