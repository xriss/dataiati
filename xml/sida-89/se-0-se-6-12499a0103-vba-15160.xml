   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Civil Rights Defenders Organization (CRD) has applied for Sida funding of 28 210 000 SEK to implement the regional programme &quot;Strengthening implementation of European human rights standards in the Western Balkans&quot; in Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo and Serbia including participants from Macedonia and Montenegro during the period 2019 to 2020.

The contribution intends to increase people&apos;s access to justice; increase people&apos;s access to information and strengthen the professional and organisational capacities of local human rights defenders. 

The regional programme concerns a phasing-out support of Sida&apos;s long-term cooperation with the CRD in Western Balkans with the objetive to strengthen the sustainability of CRD&apos;s previous work. An important part of this is the capacity-enhancing support provided by CRD to their local partners from civil society, which also work to strengthen human rights, freedom of expression, anti-discrimination and the rule of law. The phase-out contribution is to be seen as a bridge-support that will allow CRD to establish partnerships with other donors to continue their work in the region. The programme therefore also include a variety of administrative costs.

The project&apos;s total budget is SEK 28 210 000. CRD&apos;s total income for 2017 amounted to SEK 82 000 000 of which the project budget amount is 17 percent. The total indicative budget of the contribution is 28 500 000 SEK which consists of 28 210 000 SEK for the project and 290 000 SEK for the procurement according to Sida&apos;s framework for audit, internal management and control.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Embassy maintaines close contact and follow up of the programme with CRD, and also remains in close contact with the Sida S relevant colleagues for exchanges, consultations and guidance in relation to CRD and Sida central discussions. Minutes from the follow up meetings with CRD are kept, archived and shared with Sida S. This has worked well during 2019.
The main features of the contribution management in 2019 are as follows:
Sida approved on 12th Nov 2019 all conditions for disbursement in line with the Agreement:
-The CRD Management Response (submitted 11-11-2019) to the Audit Review of Internal Management and Control that Sida commissioned in summer this year.
-The JDs of all the CRD staff included in the implementation of the Project (submitted 26-04-2019, with updated for CRD Albania 19-06-2019).
-The CRD Fundraising Plan beyond 2020 (submitted 02-05-2019), with an important remark that there is no Sida commitment for funding beyond 2020.CRD
-Work Plan and Budget for the forthcoming year 2020 (submitted 06-11-2019).
The CRD justified that the financial need for the Project in 2020 is 10&#xA0;000&#xA0;000 SEK before the next scheduled disbursement, while for the remaining implementations in 2019 needed is still 5&#xA0;759&#xA0;000 SEK. &#xA0;This is in line with the approved annual work plans and budgets for 2019 and 2020.
In line with the Agreement Article 5.4, we processed the disbursement of total 15&#xA0;759 000 SEK that CRD requested. The next disbursement (of remaining 2&#xA0;451&#xA0;000 SEK) is not expected before October 2020.
The Embassy had&#xA0;last regular update meeting with CRD (Review Meeting) and we discussed the following:
-Programme implementation and budget regular follow up in relation to approved AWP and Budget 2020;
-CRD Management Response to Audit follow up;
-Anticorruption measures in the programme;
-Gender analysis in the programme;
-Due reporting and disbursement 2020.
Overall, CRD reported implementations of the programme and budget execution as agreed and planned and with no major deviations, the programme remains with good potential to deliver set results. CRD underlines that overall focus remains at EU integrations while national contexts remain important. The programme continues to work with important and relevant areas such as RoL, support to improvements for LGBT, also transitional justice, human rights in closed institutions, improving media literacy and other areas in line with the approved Annual Work Plan and Budget for 2020.
CRD also reported on their fund raising activities that we expect now to have the following impact on this programme in terms of budgeted CRD staff costs:
-In Alb expected the same percentage of Sida financing of staff in 2020 as it was in 2019.
-Additional lowering of percentage expected in 2020 for CRD FO Belgrade + CRD FO Pristina.
-CRD fundraised also in Belgrade and Albania but CRD reports that they intend to engage other that Sida financed staff.
CRD also presented a document&#xA0;Status of Implementation of E&amp;amp;Y recommendations, where&#xA0;CRD reported that&#xA0;all is ongoing as planned mainly. What&#xA0;the Embassy&#xA0;noticed specifically is that Procurement Guidelines and Accounting Manual remain particularly important, and also that in 2020 in Serbia we should not expect costs for Pride (as CRD fundraised Norwegian and German support should take over). The Sida S Controller reviewed the document. All seems fine according to what CRD reports, however the implementation steps need to be verified by the Auditor.
CRD submitted their Annual Report on 01st April 2020, including the Audited Financial Report. Discussion in details is planned for 17th April 2020 on a joint ARM meeting with the Sida S colleagues, and we remain in close contact for internal discussions, broader analysis&#xA0;and forming our joint standing on issues to be raised. We cosider that our&#xA0;interaction with&#xA0;the cooperation partner remains&#xA0;important&#xA0;for&#xA0;appropriate follow up of the intervention and therefore important with&#xA0;our unified&#xA0;opinions and joint standing at all levels.
We are also looking at technical solutions for this important meeting as under corona circumstances we all work from homes and need to find compatible channels for both Sida and CRD in Belgrade and Stockholm.
Also, at the end of April planned is central direct meeting between Sida S and CRD top management.
With corona outbreak and declared state of emergency in Serbia on 16.03.2020.&#xA0;the Embassy&#xA0;carefully follows up with all programmes and also CRD, and they indicate that they intend to possibly request from Sida additional funds for free legal aid for journalists and media in Serbia, as well as regional media fund (meant for various emergency needs under the corona situation from gloves and masks to operative costs). The Embassy assesses their initiative(s) as highly relevant, we appreciate CRD swift reaction appropriate to circumstances. In consultations with Sida S, our joint standing is that&#xA0;currently prioritised are issues other than good job that CRD does, internal control and ISK follow up remain at focus at this point.
CRD discusses cooperations with the Embassies in Colombia and in Turkey. We remain - together with Sida S focal point for CRD Maria Bister - &#xA0;in close contact with colleagues from those two Embassies (G&#xF6;ran Paulsson and Erik Norman in Colombia, and Karolina Hansson in relation to Turkey - currently in Sweden due to corona situation), and share available information and documents. We also collect information from our collegues to carefully analyse impacts on the regional programme under our responsibility, and the main conclusion at this point is is that costs for CRD staff needs to be followed up in the first place in relation to possible Turkey cooperation as CRD seemengly plans to include their regional office in Belgrade&#xA0;also in their budget for Turkey application, as&#xA0;backup to their Turkey field office. Head of Unit for Western Balkans Carolina Wennerholm remains included as well as the Sida S Controller responsible for CRD Jenny Lundh.
The programme&#x2019;s overarching outcome objective remains that: Human rights defenders are empowered to improve human rights standards thus strengthen the European integration process of Western Balkans countries.
This is broken down into three bridging outcomes: i) People have increased access to justice; ii) People have increased access to information; iii) Professional and organisational capacities of local human rights defenders are strengthened.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">Under Outcome #1,&#xA0;CRD supported the work of the most important and most relevant Coalition working on the transitional justice, that is crucial for the reconciliation and sustainable peace in the region. In addition,&#xA0;the programme&#xA0;also provided information to the public about highly relevant topics, with an emphasis on political developments, position of human rights defedners and challenges in the EU accession process. Under Outcome #2, together with&#xA0;the partners&#xA0;CRD worked on improving media situation and capacities of journalists and media professionals, both new ones as well as senior journalists. Moreover,&#xA0;CRD also worked to empower human rights defenders. Outcome #3 that has the main focus of this programme, and under this outcome&#xA0;CRD worked&#xA0;for&#xA0;increased capacities, outreach and networks of a significant number of human rights defenders from the Western Balkan. Regional events served as a platform for promotion of partners&#x2019; work and the results of it. Considering&#xA0;CRD long-term approach in cooperation with partners, impact of some of their efforts was more visible in 2019, and&#xA0;CRD plans to promote it in the coming period. Advocacy work, on national, regional and international level was conducted in cooperation with local human rights defenders with the aim to promote their findings and recommendations for the improvement of the human rights situation in general. With this&#xA0;CRD strengthened their advocacy skills, improved the network of contacts they had at both regional and international level and contributed to the improvement of the overall human rights situation in the Region.</narrative>
