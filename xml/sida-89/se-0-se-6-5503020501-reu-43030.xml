   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The objective of the contribution is to improve sustainable services in the areas of water supply, wastewater management, solid waste management, energy efficiency, district heating, renewable energy and urban public transports. The contribution aims to support the countries in their EU-integration/EU-approximation process, to reduce negative environmental and climate change impact, to increase sustainable use of natural resources, to introduce institutional reforms and to increase households access to good public services. 

The contribution is a cooperation between Sida and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and represents a phase 2 of a programme that started in 2010. The phase 2 contribution was agreed in Novemebr 2014 with a support of 100 MSEK and is not extended with a replenishment of 30 MSEK. The contribution is regional and includes the countries in the Western Balkans and in Eastern Europe. It is a &quot;programmatic trust fund&quot;, whereby the projects are identified and approved with a no-objection procedure from Sida. Sida&#xB4;s support can be used for technical assistance or for investment grants. All the projects with support from Sida are part of a larger investment package with loans from EBRD and often also with more financiers. Sida&#xB4;s contribution is used to address affordability constraints, to introduce higher environmental/energy requirements and to ensure institutional reforms. Results will be reported on per project and in the form of number of persons benefiting from improved services, reforms introduced in the utilities etc. The programme is relevant from a poverty perspective since the grant allocation to the investments is justified through an affordability analysis reltated to the ability of the pooer segments of the population to be able to pay for basic municipal services. Access to affordable municipal services like water and wastewater, solid waste, heating and public transport are key to be able to get out of poverty but also contribute to an enabling environment for economic growth. Consultancy services for implementation support and project preparation will ensure projects are developed to give universal access to ssuch services and that discremination against poor through e.g. misuse of funds are avoided.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The overall objective of the programme is to promote sustainable use of natural resources, to protect the environment and to improve municipal public services for the benefit of citizens in Eastern Europe and Western Balkans. The programme will also support the countries in their EU-approximation process respectively. Combined (Phase I and II) it&#xA0;was expected that that the projects would would directly&#xA0;benefit 2,9 million people with improved&#xA0;municipal services and mobilise about 170 MEUR of loan&#xA0;financing from the EBRD. The projects&#xA0;were also expected to reduce pollution, and improve energy and other natural resource efficiency although no specific combined targets&#xA0;were set for these results. By upgrading the services to EU standard it will help the countries in the EU-approximation process.
The projects are identified, prepared, and implemented as programme implementation proceeds. The investment package&#xA0;for each individual&#xA0;project&#xA0;is a&#xA0;combination of loans from EBRD, technical cooperation using grants and in certain cases investment grants. The programme can&#xA0;finance both investments and Technical Cooperation (TC) on a needs basis. The TC encompasses both support to project preparation and implementation support to&#xA0;the utility/municipality to ensure that targeted transition objectives can be reached. The investment grants are used to&#xA0;address governance, cost control, gradual full cost recovery and demand side measurements. Investment grants can be extended to address affordability.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">Results programme level
The funds have provided CAPEX&#xA0;support&#xA0;to 12 projects which is somewhat more than expected, likely reflecting the replenishments&#xA0;made to the fund after setting the target.&#xA0;At the same time the financial leverage of the Sida funds has been lower than expected.&#xA0; This lower financial leverage can partly be explained by the fact that some transactions which received TC support were later cancelled following the feasibility stage and that non-transactional TC has been supported from the funds.
The current total population benefiting from the projects has been slightly lower than expected &#x2013; 1,870,000 in comparison to 2,900,000. The main reason behind this is that the average population of the cities targeted by the Fund is lower than expected and projects are therefore more expensive per capita.&#xA0;As for environmental benefits, the expected results are significant, but here no target can be used for comparison.&#xA0;Aggregated results on transition, sustainability, gender and inclusion are being measured through the introduction of public service contracts, full cost recovery tariffs and gender related initiatives into the different projects. These elements have been introduced to almost all projects, but there are only a few examples where these elements have been fully implemented to date given these institutional changes are normally quite difficult to achieve.
Project progress
The results and progress accounted for below is focusing on the projects with CAPEX support. There are also a few projects with TC support&#xA0;only.&#xA0;
Implementation of the projects supported from the fund is advancing, but at a slower rate of implementation than expected. Currently, 4 out of 11 projects receiving investment grants have been (more or less) completed. Two projects in&#xA0;BiH&#xA0;have been completed but the remaining ones are facing many hurdles. Previously, it was decided to cancel the grant to Cazin. Since the loan finally became effective in June 2018, the Gradacac project has finally made progress.
The water sector projects in&#xA0;Belarus&#xA0;are proceeding but are facing many hurdles to handle. The Baranovichi biogas project has been completed, the projects in Slonim and Vitebsk are still under implementation. The Slonim&#xA0;project is close to finalisation, but the Vitebsk&#xA0;project have many problems related disputes with the main contractor.&#xA0;For the project in Orsha, construction works are yet to be commissioned. The Orsha project was delayed with 3 years due to the formation of a a regional Oblast owned utility in Vitebsk&#xA0;Oblast covering all water utilities in the Oblast. The Vitebsk project was however not affected&#xA0; so much by this change. Sida has voiced concern of this EBRD-backed regionalisation in Belarus, not for for being against regionalisation per se, but since it is transferring the municipal assets and power to the regional level (Oblast), rather than forming a municipally owned&#xA0;regional company, which is a common model in Sweden. The project portfolio for Belarus is quite large and should be followed up on jointly with the contributions in the Belarus bilateral portfolio that supports several of the projects, as well as the support through the Northern Dimension Environmental Partnership (NDEP) Fund.&#xA0;
For Georgia,&#xA0; the Kvemo Kartli Municipal Solid Waste project, is finally proceeding, after loosing much time due to the unfortunate relocation of the landfill site. The Rustavi solid waste project is finally doming to an end, and is expected to be finalised in September 2021.
On trustfund reporting and follow up:
As part of simplifying narrative reporting, Sida has agreed to change from semi-annual to annual reporting from 2020 and onwards. An amendment to the agreement to regulate this was signed in December 2019. The EBRD has also been piloting a new format for narrative reporting on project level and testing it on bilateral funds with Sida. Sida has been giving feed-back on the format and assisting in its further development. The idea is that the format, which is more aligned with the bank&apos;s internal reporting system, will then be applied to funds with other donors as well.&#xA0;The reporting and project follow up was discussed at the Annual project review meeting on 3 June. Minutes from the meeting have been taken and are filed in dox and should be followed up on with the EBRD at the next Annual Project review meeting. At the meeting, Sida made the following comments regarding reporting and follow up in general:
Sida noted that standard project reports were now covering many of the projects with Sida TC support which is a real improvement. Sida also mentioned the reform of moving to annual reporting and follow-up which saves time and resources.
There is however still a need to strengthen the connection between the annual narrative reporting deliverables and reporting requirements as they are spelled out in the respective trust fund agreements. The following aspects needs attention:
There needs to be a &#x201C;trust-fund level&#x201D; section (an overview) for each narrative report, including at least a list of project supported, their status, fund committed and disbursed per assignment and in total (including funds remaining for financing of new assignments/projects) but preferably also other aspects like, pipeline of projects and general conclusions on progress and utilisation of funds. For some of the trust funds, this type of overview is regulated in the trust fund agreements and should then follow what is stated there. The &quot;Programme report&quot; is to some extent covering this for SWM2 and SWME but the report need to be revised to better serve its purpose.
As a rule, the annual narrative report should be compiled as one (e.g. PDF-format) report, including all annexes. Excel charts and documents not suitable for this format could still be sent as separate files, but then in the same email as the main narrative report. For non-transactional TC- the latest report available (typically TCRS-reporting) should make part of such report. For assignments where reporting is not available, e.g. assignment which are new or for other reasons, a note should be made in the trust fund overview section, to enable Sida to verify that all reporting has been delivered.
The above will effectively mean that the current &#x201C;Programme report&#x201D; would need to be revised and splitted&#xA0;up, to make one overview per trust fund. This is also justified as the trust funds are funded and managed in a delegated manner by Sweden, involving in this case also the Swedish Embassies in Kiev and Sarajevo. Sida offered to be part of shaping the &#x201C;new&#x201D; trust-fund level overviews to come up with something which works for both Sida and the EBRD.
For trust-fund agreements with many amendments, like the Environment and Climate Funds,&#xA0;&#xA0;Sida proposed to make &#x201C;re-instated&#x201D; agreements, incorporating all the amendments. This will bring better clarity on both sides on e.g. reporting requirements for each trust fund specifically.
Another issue, not discussed at the meeting, is the different project listings EBRD provides and the related financial information. In the financial statements several projects/assignments which in other listings are reported as completed, are listed as on-going. There are also some discrepancies&#xA0;in the financial information. In part, this might be explained by the fact that the project listings provided in excel reflect the situation as of 31 March 2021 whereas the financial statement report on the situation by 31 December 2020.&#xA0; Sida has asked for clarifications to some of these issues.&#xA0;
On fund resources and project pipeline
There are some uncommitted funds left.&#xA0;In the project review meeting, Sida reiterated its preference for supporting sub-sectors that are considered more difficult like district heating, municipal solid waste management and wastewater treatment. To a lesser degree energy efficiency in buildings and public transport are of interest. It was mentioned that the Eastern Partnership and the Western Balkan countries remain the geographical focus. Sida also mentioned its preference for supporting TC- assignments from the remaining&#xA0;funds, to avoid entering into long commitments with CAPEX-funding which would risk extending the timeline&#xA0;for Trust Fund termination with many years. Sida explained their priorities for TC-support with that CAPEX-funds should primarily be sought and provided for from the larger multidonor multi-IFI financial platforms in the sector, like E5P, NDEP and WBIF, whcih Sida also provides substantial funding to. Sida has for years held on to this principle regarding project funding.</narrative>
