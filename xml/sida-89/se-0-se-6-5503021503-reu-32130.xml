    <narrative xml:lang="EN">Overall funding and SBIF aggregated results.

The main reporting of the Small Business Impact Fund (SBIF), and its results from activities
are still on an individual project-basis. However, since last year EBRD now includes a &quot;Fund Report-Cover sheet&quot;, which tries to summarize the results from the SBIF on an aggregated level. This was done by request from several donors, Sida included. While there was still a lot to be developed, this first attempt to aggregate results from the different initiatives and show more of impact level effects of the fund&apos;s operations was considered a step in the right direction last year. Unfortunately, the report for 2021 had not been developed further from the previous year.  

Swedish funding into the SBIF is quite limited, but it has continued to support initiatives under the Eastern Europe &amp; South Caucasus and Western Balkans windows.


Regardless, the SBIF grew significantly in 2021 with over 20 million euros added by donors to the fund. This now puts the fund&apos;s value at 71.7 million euros. As the total of volume from approved projects were almost 17 million euros, fund utilization remains at 88%, which is same as last year. This is quite impressive and positive, and it reflects the needs from SME:s during a very challenging 2021 primarily effected by Covid-19. In 2021 the majority of the approved funding was for Western Balkans (61%). However, to date Eastern Europe and Caucasus remains the most funded region with 33% of total investments.

In terms of activities, EBRD  offered financial relief instruments to its clients and adapted its advisory products and delivery tools to ensure better outreach to vulnerable underserved segments of SMEs that were most impacted by the pandemic, especially youth and women-led SMEs. This included remote delivery systems and new digital platforms. In this context, in 2021 the SBIF has continued to be a key tool to provide essential support to SME, facilitating access to finance and know-how. The SBIF has made available funding to allow the continuation of several financial and advisory products that have been deployed by the EBRD over a number of years and at the same time has enabled their expansion into new regions, as well as the development and launch of new product and initiatives. 

On an aggregate level, initiatives under the SBIF has according to EBRD contributed to direct, co-financed or indirect financing to a total of 18 691 SMEs. 2034 SMEs have received advisory
support. 88% of SMEs reached has reported increased turnover within a year after completion of advisory support. Finally, by the end of the reporting period, the SMEs supported through
advisory services has created nearly 10 000 new jobs within a year after completion of advisory services. This is an increase of 3 000 in 2021.

As EBRD has acknowledged that there are challenges to the reporting of the SBIFs bottom-up approach, an independent evaluation was carried out during the first months of 2022. While the initial results were provided at the annual general assembly, the actual report had not yet been disseminated. Overall the consultant has assessed SBIF as a useful and flexible fund vehicle for SME-support with room for improvement, not least in terms of coordination and ensuring effectiveness. An additional update may be done after report has been received and discussed by donors.

Specific support to Covid-19 response for EaP

In 2020 Sida approved a two-yearspecific funding for Covid-19 response in Armenia, Belarus and Ukraine. Activities commenced in February 2021. Under the specific objective &quot;Strengthened role of SMEs in economy through enhancing their competitiveness and innovation&quot; outputs have been good. 24 SMEs had received business advice by end of 2021 with a target set at 55 by end of 2022, and 363 participants had received crisis response training, thus greatly outperforming the total target of 120. For the specific objective &quot;Improved business environment for SMEs through
enhancing institutional framework and support infrastructure&quot; EBRD has managed to train 28 local consultants out of a total envisaged of 40, thus exceeding expectations for the first year. The report has not yet provided any data on outcome results against targets.</narrative>
