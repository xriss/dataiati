  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project seeks to address the educational needs of affected school children in Eastern Rural Damascus through support to 3 learning spaces. To achieve this support, a focus will be on two specific objectives:
- access: children have equitable access to safe, inclusive and equipped learning spaces and 
- quality: the quality of learning environments, teaching and learning processes are strengthened.
The project aims at increasing access and quality of education through rehabilitation of schools on a minimum scale in relatively safe areas that were damaged by the fighting during the crisis, namely in besieged Eastern Rural Damascus, and providing teaching and learning materials as well as professional training for teachers to guarantee access to quality education which will help eventually to the empowering of girls and boys. 
Based upon the needs assessment conducted and the cluster&#x2019;s response plan, Shafak puts in mind to address the most critical and prioritized needs in this project to support education in Eastern Rural Damascus which can be summed up as follows:
- conduct rehabilitation of damaged learning spaces, including school WASH facilities in line with INEE/Sphere standards
- support delivering of increased pre and in service teacher training support in key areas of Basic Teacher Training, inclusion, wellbeing, classroom management, strategies for coping with stresses associated with emergencies and other EiE basic core competences
- provide teaching and learning materials for ECCD kids, students, teachers, and schools as necessary 
- teacher well-being is supported through mentoring and peer support groups
- increase safety and security practices in each learning space through supporting and empowering Parent Teacher Committees to conduct ongoing risk assessments 
- child-safe playspaces to be created and supported That is why Shafak planned to include risk education support with no costs in this project since it would be provided by Shafak protection team already present in the area as a kind of complementarity between the two sectors 
- school health and mental health referral system is established for both students and teachers we have appointed a nurse in each school, whose task, in addition to school hygiene issues, is to refer for any case she detects among the children for extra care. This referral can be directed to mental health professionals, including psychiatrists, nursing and allied health staff in the area via our Shafak health outreach officer present in the area 
and 
- delivery of non-formal activities and language classes for children and youth to continue learning during the summer months and/or children who did not have access to formal schooling.

As Shafak, we believe that such a project supporting education of new generations is the key towards building a better future and the basis for a strong society. A whole generation of children and youth is at risk of losing hope. Education is key for their survival and preparation to rebuild a peaceful Syria. Failing to provide adequate funding would have an immensely negative impact on their future, that of the region and beyond.</narrative>
