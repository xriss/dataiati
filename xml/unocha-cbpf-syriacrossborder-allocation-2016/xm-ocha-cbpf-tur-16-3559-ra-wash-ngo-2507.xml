Moreover, elderly and chronic-disease-person will be provided with basic health care consultations, interventions and medications. Community health workers will increase the awareness among pregnant and lactating mothers about the infants and young children feeding in emergency situation IYCF-E. WASH project will be implemented in Robar camp in Afrin to improve the overall health status for IDPs in the camp. Furthermore, The mobile clinic will offer the required primary health care services for IDPs in Afrin including IDPs in Robar camp taking in consideration that the nearest health care facility to the camp is about 11 km from it, and therefore, it will be complicated for elderly persons and people with disabilities to access the health facilities with the presence of 234 individuals their ages are above 56 and 16 persons with disabilities in Robar camp. On the other hand, PHC in Azaz district - Shmmarin sub-district will provide IDPs with necessary and basic primary health care services including referring patients in need to secondary and tertiary health care facilities in Azaz district with coordination with other partners, Integrating the WASH project with the MC in Robar camp will aim to enhance the self-health status among IDPs supported by primary health care services and offer in-place primary health care services for vulnerable groups including referring to Bihar Hospital if necessary. Regarding the WASH project, it will provide the IDPs in Robar camp in Afrin district with drinking water and water for daily consumption through hygienic water system in the camp based on a main pumping station that will pump water from an underground (450 meter in depth) well that is approximately 450 meter far from the highest point near Robar camp to the main water container that will be established at the highest point in the camp with a capacity of 50,000 litre. After pumping water to the main container, it will be pumped to bath, latrine and drinking water units or blocks with internal water network system and faucets according to SPHERE criteria to ensure the delivery of healthy and chlorinated drinking water to IDPs in Robar camp. On the other hand, this project aims to provide IDPs with baths and latrines according to SPHERE criteria. These baths and latrines will be provided with water network system and will end up with a hygienic sanitation system. Furthermore, the project will improve the solid waste disposing in Robar camp. Bihar Organization has conducted through engineering office a primary technical study regarding the establishment of pump unit to suck and push the water from the well to the main container in the camp. In addition, Bihar has conducted a technical study in term of cost and position to establish latrine, bath and drinking water blocks and sewage system in the camp. Weekly-based reports will be prepared regarding the work plan progress of the WASH project.</narrative>
