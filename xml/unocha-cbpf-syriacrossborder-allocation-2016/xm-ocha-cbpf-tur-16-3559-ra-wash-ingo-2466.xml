   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Through this HPF funding, IMC will be covering 30,451 beneficiaries in 12 IDP camps and informal settlements located in Lattakia (2), Idleb (8) and Aleppo (2). In addition IMC will assess collective centers that will be added to the support under this action. The below activities however given the complexity of the situation and the volatile security situation, IMC requests flexibility in implementing locations.

Provision of sufficient and potable water for drinking and domestic purposes
IMC will maintain the provision of 20 liters per person per day of chlorinated water in the camps and collective centers along with sufficient number and size of water containers to collect and store as per the Sphere standard. In the new camps water supply will be initiated with plastic water tanks, filled by water trucking, and distributed through taps or tap stands.Where possible IMC links water supply to existing bore holes or a local water source in the community but often camps grow at a rate beyond the capacity of the environment, and populations remain mobile, and water trucking is required. IMC will continue improving the water infrastructure to provide safe water with more stable and durable water supply for IDPs, as appropriate according to the situation. 

Provision of basic sanitation facilities 
In the existing camps, particularly in those areas that have received new influxes of IDPs, IMC will repair and maintain existing communal latrines - both pit and pour flush. In the locations where communal latrines are not feasible IMC will construct pit latrines. Latrines will be made secured and accessible for the people with disabilities, women and girls, and segregated for men and women. In Bab Al Salameh (BAS) camp IMC will connect latrines with the direct sewer line, while in other locations, IMC may construct septic tanks. Faecal sludge will be emptied by desludging trucks, dependent on need.

Solid waste management
A considerable amount of solid waste is produced in the camps and collective centres on a daily basis. Garbage generated at tent levels will be collected in bins. A bin with the capacity of 100 liters will be placed between each 10 tents, from which incentive workers will collect and transfer it to the communal bins. Waste trucks will remove the waste on a daily basis. These waste trucks take the garbage to the nearest dumpsites, which are being shared with other towns and/or councils. Maintenance of existing dumpsites will take place on a monthly basis, and may include bulldozing, landfilling and covering with the earth.

Liquid waste management
Drainage of grey water from bathing and hand washing facilities is a major issue in the existing camps and has recently been exacerbated by heavy run-off from winter rains and due to the additional influx of IDPs. This will be addressed through maintaining existing drainage or constructing simple channels of soakage pits. 

Hygiene promotion
Hygiene promotion activities will be designed to address the risk behavior of the people identified from an initial hygiene risk survey. IMC will implement participatory hygiene promotion activities with the aim of improving knowledge and awareness to allow IDPs living in camps and collective centers. The approach will continue to focus on information dissemination through interactive community sessions Information, Education and Communication (IEC) materials and household visits.  Beneficiary feedback on activities is garnered through regular monitoring and Focus Group Discussion (FGD) including consultation with women and vulnerable groups such as elderly and people with disabilities.</narrative>
