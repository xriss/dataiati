  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project aims to integrate nutrition and health programs in a specialized health facility (for women and children) which provides maternal and child health care services including pediatrics and reproductive health (emergency obstetric care and family planning as well as gynecological services), apply principles of Do No Harm. The nutrition activities include Infant and Young Child Feeding (IYCF) strategy, Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) and screening for malnutrition through Community Health Workers (CHWs) and refer of severely and moderately malnourished cases (SMAM).

Services will provided to 47,949 most vulnerable and conflict affected (all of them are women and children as pediatric and gynecology services) in Atareb, District Jebel Saman, Aleppo Governorate of Syria. The target beneficiaries include the Internally Displaced People (IDPs more than half of beneficiaries: 25,592) and host communities in the target location. Human Appeal International has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) since November 2014 with the Local Council, Big Orem, Aleppo to make the existing hospital functional and to provide health care services to the most affected women and children of the Syrian conflict. Human Appeal refurbished the building of hospital and equipped it with most necessarily devices, then recruited the most needed staff and provided the hospital with drugs and consumables. Out of the overall population of 200,000, the proposed project will provide Obstetric and gynecological services to 4,900 women. 5,320 children under the age of 16 will be provided pediatric and IMCI services out of which 52% are girls and 48% boys. This will be done through procurement of missed equipment and devices for the hospital and recruitment of more needed qualified doctors, midwives and other relevant staff for the hospital, resetting up of delivery suites that will include labor wards, delivery rooms and obstetric theaters. Furthermore, the proposed project will provide referral support to the neediest patients through ambulances by admitting them in the hospital or medically evacuated to other hospital in Turkey in case of serious patients.

On the nutritional side, the project will overcome many factors, mainly to increase the appropriate access of beneficiaries with severe and moderate acute malnutrition, timely nutritional screening (facility and community based) and IYCF activities through CHWs. These activities will cover 37,729 population (women, pregnant and lactating women (PLWs) and children under 5).
The factors include: services not available in targeted area, lack of awareness and lack of assessments and reporting.
Solution: this project will monitor the general situation of Moderate and severe acute malnutrition (SAM and MAM) (and screening has already begun), mobilization and referral system for treatment of active cases, monitoring and supervising.
Why it is important and to whom: Building the capacity of health actors, by providing training on nutritional programs, implement of malnutrition preventive services for vulnerable groups and strengthen the systematic identification and referral and treatment of acutely malnourished cases. Improve IYCF practices in targeted communities especially for PLWs and provide CHWs with training, tools and information needed for their mission. This project will strengthen resilience and early recovery through communities and institutions. The project is targeting women and children in Aleppo and Idleb.

The proposed project activities will be headed by Senior program coordinator under the direct supervision of Head of Mission. Human Appeal International&#x2019;s implementing partner, Human Appeal Turkey, will be responsible for overall implementation of the project, however, Human Appeal International UK will be responsible for contract and grants management, building partner&#x2019;s capacity as well as reporting to donors.</narrative>
