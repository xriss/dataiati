   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Eliminating sources of leishmaniasis and water borne diseases in debris and rehabilitating/ setting up adequate and healthy sewage system.</narrative>

  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">After a lot of complains from the people in Ariha, Mseibin, Mastumeh, Qminas, Nayrab, Sarmin and Bennsh in Idlib governorate due to a sharp increase in WBDs and Leishmania cases amongst communities specially children (which is known in these areas for a long time). 
Taking into the consideration that those areas are rich with fruitful plants and since It began to show negative effects in terms of yield and quality.
which requires an action to put an end to this suffering and that&#x2019;s why Khayr launched the assessment faze as we studied the reason.
Khayr noticed that the reason is the presence of breeding environment for sandflies which is causing Leishmania and other related infections, were the opened sewer is located near these villages, in addition to the presence of destructed buildings which contain many possible human and animal bodies underneath and the livestock breeding in barns near population centers.
Relying on all previous, Khayr decided to study this project and we found that the solution for this problem is through setting up sewer network with 80-100 cm diameter pipes and 9 km long divided on 4 stages and including many cement connection rooms for the above mentioned villages sewers.
After setting up and connecting the 4 undone fazes, the sewer will reach septic tank and if the septic tank is filled the overflow will return to its natural stream were the soil and natural can absorb all remnants away from population centers and farms till its connected to Toum treatment plant after returning to service which is underwork by another organization.
The farms and the people in these villages will benefit from a closed, safe and adequate sewer network which will help to decrease the number of infections and increase in terms of quality and quantity of crops.
This project will cover also debris removal of four destructed buildings which contains many human and animal bodies underneath which considered great sandflies incubator environment. 
In addition, this project will cover capacity building for key persons and communities by providing trainings and publishing brochures in terms of coping mechanisms, hygiene maintenance and promotion and preventing formation of an incubator breeding environment for the sandflies which is the main Leishmania transmitter.
These trainings and brochures will help by decreasing the number of WBDs cases and the number of casualties in the supported communities were the trainings will target (school teachers, WASH actors, Livestock breeders and mothers). And will encourage the Leishmania infected population to go to the health centers which is available in the mentioned areas.
Another kind of trainings will be conducted in terms of operation and maintenance for the sewer network and the septic tank were this training will target the WASH actors in the local council since we will cover their salaries for one month.
Additional to the above training, this activity will cover also the procurement for suction engine, clothes and gas masks for all participants.
After we coordinate with local authorities, we noticed that this project was studied by the Syrian government and they started working on it and finished some parts of it but the current events and clashes prevented the project from achieving its goal.
Now, most of the service institutions stopped working and that lead to exacerbate the suffering, increasing the numbers of Leishmania and WBDs cases, and expanding in the infection areas to reach the outermost regions of the villages on the axis of the opened sinkhole to reach Sarmin and Nayrab from the east, Idlib from the west, and Saraqab form the south.
Based on this tragic situation, Khayr formed by the urgent need to complete this project and rescue those inhabitants form expected diseases and pollution.</narrative>
