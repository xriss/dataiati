  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Through this project, Solidarites International (SI) plans to provide a life-saving comrephensive package of WASH assistance to the IDP settlement of Karraj Sujjo North for a period of 12 months. Since it&apos;s formation in February 2016 following the Aleppo crisis, this settlement has recieved minimal WASH assistance from the humanitarian community.  By the end of November 2016, what assistance it has recieved from Mercy Corps and Tamkeen NGO will stop,  This vital assistance, including emergency water trucking, provides small relief for this community of IDP&apos;s located on the west of Sujjo.  Currently in the settlement, the community has a severe lack of sanitation infrastructure and what infrastructure exists is in need of extensive maintenance and repair as number of facilities are no longer operational.  Water infrastructure is insufficient and without assistance, access to water and treatment of water will be impossible for this community.  With open defecation, self-built latrines and shower proliferating the camp and basic hygiene items unaffordable, hygiene promotion and related kit distributions are critical for preventing disease outbreak in the coming months.

Following a comprehensive needs and assistance assessment, it has been determined by SI field teams that without ongoing and further, more comprehensive support for WASH activities, this community will be at risk of further deterioration of health and hygiene which may result in life-threatening cases.  As a result, SI proposes to provide a complete package of WASH assistance focused on community engagement and participation, reducing the risk of service gaps currently being experienced within A&apos;zaz due to single activity-based programming by other organisations and mobilizing the community to be active members of the program.  SI will ensure that treated water is provided to the community on a daily basis with adequate communal water storage capacity and the restoration and maintenance of existing water points.  SI will compliment its existing HF program of sanitation infrastructure support within this settlement by restoring non-functional infrastructure and mobilize communities through the creation of Hygiene Promotion amp Mobilization Committees to lead hygiene promotion and awareness campaigns throughout the community.
In compliment, cash for work activities (CFW) will help to facilitate the communal sanitation amp hygiene activities with rotational participation by settlement members for communal latrine amp shower cleaning, installation of drainage throughout the camp and community clean-up campaigns. Drainage CFW activities will also work in partnership with SI&apos;s activity of gravelling the main access roads of the camp to ensure ongoing access and environmental health throughout the winter months. SI will also ensure environmental health is maintained in the camp through daily solid waste management, desludging support and provision of garbage bins.

Through this full spectrum of activities and those outlined further within the proposal, SI aims to ensure that the long-term needs of this community are met and maintained for the life of the project.  Linking strongly with SI&apos;s existing WASH activities and focusing on community mobilization, it is anticipated that through this program, health related risks are reduced, the community takes ownership over key infrastructure and human suffering is reduced.</narrative>
