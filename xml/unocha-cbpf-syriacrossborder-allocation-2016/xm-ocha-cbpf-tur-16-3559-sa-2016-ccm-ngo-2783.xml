   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Restoring critical infrastructure for temporary Shelters and Informal Settlements for newly arriving IDPs in Idleb.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project proposes to establish a temporary shelter for the newly-arriving IDPs to Idleb from Hama, Homs, Lattakia, Idleb and Aleppo by restoring critical infrastructure. This temporary shelter will be located in Idleb- Maaret Masrin, in the town of Maaret Al Ekhwan. The GPS coordinates are longitude: 36.6817544 and latitude: 360662114. 

Saed Association Charity will be responsible of all procurement , will be using its own warewhouse in Syria, and will deliver all needed material and equipment to the Temporary Shelter Center. Maram Foundation will be responsible of the reconstruction, rehabilitation, and assistance of IDP&apos;s coming in to the temporary shelter center. Maram will also be training all center staff on SPHERE standards.  The initial procurement, training of staff and reconstruction will take approximately 3 months, and the remaining 6 months will be assisting IDP&apos;s in need of temporary shelter and basic assistance.

According to the CCCM tracking table of IDP&#x2019;s in March 2016, 2,739 families came to the area of Idleb (Dana, Hazre, Turmanin, Killi, Kadar Dariya, Hazzano, Akrabat, Tal ade, and Harim).  From this large IDP movement, 68% of the IDP families are living with the host communities. This caused a tremendous pressure on host communities in the area, which have limited capacity in space, resources and services. 

The overarching goal of Saed Charity and the Maram Foundation&apos;s (MF) project is to assist newly-arriving IDPs leaving their communities, providing them with a safe and temporary resting place. As many of the newly arriving IDPs seek to travel elsewhere, this temporary shelter will be a vital oasis that helps mitigate, stress, concerns, and various dangers that these newly-arriving IDPs may face during that time. In this way, the project further seeks to alleviate IDP camps that are already overburdened by the overflow of newly-arriving IDPs the temporary shelter will have a capacity to assist 1280  newly arriving IDPs at any given time, accepting them on a continuous basis, and prioritizing its services for women, children, and people with special needs. It is estimated that approximately 1280  people will be using the temporary shelters over every 30 days, with an average of 1280  IDP&#x2019;s using the temporary shelters every month. 2 specific additional tents (size 4X4) will be one for registration purposes and one for medical and PSS services. 

Saed and Maram shall implement its project according to all of the CHS Nine Commitments and Quality Criteria, the Core Standards of the Sphere project, and the Code of Conduct for the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement and Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) in Disaster Relief. The four main objectives that work towards this project&apos;s broader goal are the following:
1) to provide newly arriving IDPs with assistance that is appropriate to their needs, prioritizing assistance for women, children, and people with special needs.
2) to give people access to the humanitarian assistance they currently need, prioritizing access for women, children, and people with special needs.
3) to positively affect, prepare, and build resilience among newly arriving IDPs, especially among women, children, and people with special needs.
4) to administer a coordinated and complementary assistance to newly-arriving IDPs, prioritizing assistance for women, children, and people with special needs.
5) To alleviate the pressure and burden on surrounding IDP camps and host communities from the large influx of IDP&apos;s. 

By providing the comprehensive assistance listed above, the IDP population will be less vulnerable to negative coping mechanisms resulting from insecurity about the immediate future, income and social instability. In this case, families will be more stable regarding nutrition and shelter, where the children will be less vulnerable to the factors of early marriage and recruitment to armed groups.</narrative>
