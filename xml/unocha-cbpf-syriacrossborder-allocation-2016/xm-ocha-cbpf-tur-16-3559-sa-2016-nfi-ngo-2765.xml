   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Reducing the Vulnerability of Conflict Affected Syrians in Hard-to-Reach (HTR) Regions of Northern Syria through the Rehabilitation of 250 Households.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In order to improve the humanitarian response and alleviate suffering of IDPs and vulnerable populations in conflict-afflicted areas, SRD will support the rehabilitation of 250 beneficiary Households (HH) with a total of 1,625 individuals for host communities and IDPs with a substantial Protection component outreach component in the form of 12 hygiene and sanitation informational sessions and 12 Protection awareness sessions delivered by 8 professionally-qualified trainers within 2 OCHA designated hard-to-reach Idleb subdistricts of Bennsh and Ma&#x2019;aarrat Tamsrin. The individuals served consist of both IDPs (who are relatives/close friends of host community home owners, as verified by local councils) and members of the host community that reside in homes that have been severely destroyed due to continued damage to homes as a result of aerial/land attacks in addition to general dilapidation from poor living conditions that do not allow for comprehensive upkeep. Therefore, both IDPs residing with host community members and host community members themselves. Homes targeted are owned by families served, as confirmed by Local Councils. SRD staff identify and categorize households as vulnerable by utilizing an SRD vulnerability criteria index (See Annex E. SRD Vulnerability Index) with two components: the level of damage and repair needed for housing and the demographic information regarding households and the presence of vulnerable HH members. In addition to the repair of structural damage, doors, broken windows, locks and deteriorated plumbing, SRD will install one solar panel system in each targeted HHs to provide an alternative source of lighting in an energy scarce environment. SRD seeks to capitalize on its experience implementing Shelter operations throughout Northern Syria in order to devise a more qualitative and sustainable response to Shelter repair, with the goal of improving livelihoods and promoting stability, reintegration of IDPs into host communities and a return to normalcy for all targeted HHs. In addition to enhancing physical stability and safety via Shelter repair of mild to moderately damaged HHs, SRD will enhance Protection by employing trained social workers to deliver educational outreach sessions to targeted beneficiaries on human rights, SGBV, anti-violence, gender equality, family planning, health and hygiene and other critical topics. SRD has targeted two areas identified by OCHA as HTR and prioritized  them according to the considerable damage to civilian infrastructure warranting the need for moderate to substantial repair, and the high concentrations of IDPs within these areas. SRD seeks to take advantage of the decline in violence and resumption of stability that has resulted from the fragile cessation of hostilities by implementing shelter rehabilitation in a rapid manner and taking measures to promote long-term integration of IDPs into host communities. SRD has selected Idleb, as it will carry out operations in Aleppo Old City with other grant programming.</narrative>
