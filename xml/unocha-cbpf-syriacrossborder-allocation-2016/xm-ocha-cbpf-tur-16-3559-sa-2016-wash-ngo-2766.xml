   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project (Rehabilitation of existing reliable water wells which were used for drinking water system) is designed to respond to the drinking water needs of the host communities and new IDPs influx from various areas in Idlib Governorate to the sub-District of Idlib, due to the conflict caused displacement in the area. According to a recent report circulated by CCCM cluster at least 243,921 people have been displaced, with approximately 181,000 in Idlib and its sub-distrects. This project aims to benefit approximately 71700 vulnerable people in (Heish and Senjar).

Within the sub-district of Heish the population estimated to reach up to 35000 between host community and IDPs. The water wells that provide for it are currently out of service due to the destruction caused by airstrikes, looting, and the lack of maintenance over the last 4 years.

There are two water stations in Heish 
1-	The southern station that consists of: water unit, warehouse for equipment, water selling point, control panels room, water storage tank, water tower, 140 KVA diesel generator, 4 electric control panels, 2m3 diesel tank, 4m3 reserve diesel tank and 5 wells
As for the wells: 2 are out of service and in need of maintenance, 1 in need of a generator and the last one is in not working.
2-	While the northern station consists of: cistern, generating chamber, a staff room, 2 horizontal boosting pumps, electric control panel for one horizontal pump, 2 electric control panels for submersible pumps and 2 wells.
As for the wells: both are functional and in need of a generator to be put back in service.
 Within the sub-district there is an existing water system that is out of service and in need of maintenance. 

Senjar on the other hand, which is known for its lack of drinking water, has the estimated population of 20000 (in the city and surrounded camps). And even though there are 3 wells in the area people depend on water tanks to fill the needs as much as possible, because the wells are all out of service.

The proposed activities for both targeted areas include Maintenance replacement and provision of pumps, generators, pips, cables and water collective tanks. In addition to that, these systems will be checked and regular maintenance operations will be conducted by a qualified team in cooperation with the local council.  To ensuring sustainability of this system, (Tariff) system will be applied and observed by the responsible team in coordination with the local council.

Furthermore, a water committee will be established by the local councils and key informants from the community in the targeted areas, to monitor the provided service&#x2019;s quality and ensure the sustainability and accountability of those service. The targeted locations are totally depending on water trucking right now due to destruction of the water systems, or lack of maintenance. This means that brining the water wells back into service will definitely raise the host communities&#x2019; quality of life and ensure water access to all IDPs.
In relation to the norms of the targeted locations, operations and maintenance work are the role of men as they need hardworking. However, to ensure equal opportunities, BINAA will evaluate all who show the willingness to work in the project during project inception and in consultation with local committees. Also to ensure equal access and use of water service in safe conditions and in doing the proper assessment attention will all be drawn to women and girls roles in the whole prosses, the safety of water collection points and any other related habits linked to women and girl protection and dignity. 
The community will be mobilized to take ownership and protect the water and sanitation equipment installed. Water testing at the collection point will also be done on a regular basis. People from the communities will be involved during installation of equipment in order to build their capacity and strengthen local ownership.</narrative>
