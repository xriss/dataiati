The ambulance system in Aleppo city that belongs to free Aleppo health directorate is one of the services related to the overall health care system in Aleppo that plays an indispensable role in medical transportation of patients to different health care facilities and it is a part of the health referral network system. The importance of rapid ambulance response to emergency medical crises has been well-documented especially for pregnant women to be transferred to hospitals. The ambulance system of Aleppo has lost its full capacity due to the increased needs and required services for people in Aleppo city taking in consideration the escalation of military conflicts and the possibility that Aleppo city could become besieged. The Ambulance system consist of 15 ambulance vehicles that are in need for maintenance, repairing, fuel and support for running costs. This project aims to rehabilitate the ambulance system of Aleppo and support it with fuel and running costs in order to improve the essential role of ambulance system in the overall health system. SAMS will make sure that the ambulance cars are being periodically maintained to prevent breakdowns. This activity will be implemented in partnership with Bihar Organization.

Also, It&#x2019;s becoming a necessity that SAMS respond to the fast changing situation on the ground and setup mobile clinics to ensure primary health care is not interrupted. By using mobile clinics SAMS is ensuring that the clinic will follow the population and continue to provide services. Moreover, SAMS will support 3 trauma facilities, obgyn facility and a blood bank to ensure a holistic availability of healthcare services.
SAMS will also procure anesthesia medication as requested by Aleppo health directorate.
