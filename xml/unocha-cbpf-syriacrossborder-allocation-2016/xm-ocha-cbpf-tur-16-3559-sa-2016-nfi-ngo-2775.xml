   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Increase Resilience among the Conflict-Affected Syrian Population through shelters&#x2019; improvements and rehabilitation</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project is designed by SECD as a response to the community&#x2019;s needs to improve their housing and shelter&#x2019;s conditions in the city of Aleppo, in addition to developing and sustaining their resilience and cohesion. 
Within Aleppo governorate HNO show that, there are an estimated number of 457,605 people in need of shelter (231,605 Male - 226,000 Female).Due to conflict-affected communities the already existing need for the rehabilitation of shelter and improvement of living conditions has drastically increased. 
As the provision of shelter meets one of the basic survival and dignity needs of women, girls, boys and men and can strengthen protection in a physical sense this project aims to improve the shelter and living condition for approximately 600 HHs within the targeted location, who are in acquit need for shelter or shelter rehabilitation services after their homes were destroyed totally or partially. In addition to preparing these shelters for the coming winter with all needed adjustments and precautions.
While selecting the targeted households, SECD will give priority to the most vulnerable host community&#x2019;s households to receive assistance. The established vulnerability criteria will be used to select beneficiaries, including prioritization of female-headed HHs, HHs with disabled or elderly family members, HHs comprising of more than six members, and HHs where the majority of working-aged members are unemployed. 
The project will target at least 20% female/child headed household from the total number of the targeted households. As it aims to enhancing the sense of privacy for these households and mitigate the protection risks to women and young girls who will no longer have to use shared spaces and utility services. The provision of the solar system will especially improve the living conditions of boys and girls and give them the ability to study
In case the targeted beneficiaries do not own the property, the head of the household must provide a letter from the property owner stating their right to live there in order for them to be able to participate in the project. 
After communicating and coordinating with the local council we categorized parts of the old city (250 households) to be the most venerable in addition to 350 households from other parts of the city to reduce vulnerability of 600 HHs (4900 women, men, girls and boys) by improving current shelter conditions of H. Hs to SPHERE minimum standards in Aleppo city. 
As the assessment show the targeted HHs suffer from having destroyed walls, missing doors and windows, and lake of functional water and sewage networks the proposed work plan includes:
 Walls and roofs&#x2019; reparation (plastering, maintenance, repairs, painting) 
 Maintenance or installation work for the doors and windows, 
 Providing and installing stand-alone solar system with all fittings for lightening and charging some small devices, 
 Maintenance for internal sewer and water systems 
All works to be carried out will be in line with SPHERE minimum standards.
In addition to the rehabilitation work, SECD will provide a capacity building trainings for the local councils to build their experience on Sphere Standards on Shelter sector and teach them how to conduct the buildings damage survey.</narrative>
