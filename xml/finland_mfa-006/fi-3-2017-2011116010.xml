   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The purpose of the Project is to strengthen the partner&#x2019;s ability to respond to the needs of orphans and vulnerable children (OVCs) and to improve the socio-economical status of families in Bishoftu Town. In the project, Fida partners with Ethiopian Full
 Gospel Believers&#x2019; Church Development Organization that has been the implementer of the project as of January 2014. Fida and the partner work together with government officials. The beneficiaries of the project are selected together with the concerned go
vernment bodies, and the activities are planned together with all stakeholders. The project assists families financially through family sponsorship activities and helps them find a constant source of income. This creates a basis for more sustainable develo
pment. The beneficiaries&#x2019; children and youth are encouraged to be educated in primary and secondary schools, and to also continue to higher education. Families&#x2019; living conditions are improved through renovating their houses, kitchens, latrines etc. Ben
eficiaries will be regularly trained in topics related to health: sanitation, hygiene, mental care, family planning and HIV/AIDS. Training on income generating activities will also be given. Literacy training will be organized for illiterate adults. Suppor
ted families work two days per week in the project. The development objective of the project is to contribute to the wellbeing of people groups in Bishoftu. The project has gone through many changes; the Children&#x2019;s home &#x2013;model has been changed to a non
-institutionalised model where families are supported in their own communities. Through family based development, the project has been able to reach more families and children, who can live and grow in their own culture, ethnic group and background. This i
s a better and more normal foundation for life. Nowadays, Children who have grown in Children&#x2019;s Home are adults, who are able to make their own living after receiving vocational training.</narrative>
