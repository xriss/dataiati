   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The population of Kenya is 41 million and it increases by about 1 million per year. Over 70 per cent of the population is less than 30 years old, and more than half of them live in extreme poverty. Especially children and youth of poor origin are vulnerabl
e. They have limited access to education, health care and employment. 43 per cent of Kenyan youth (age 15-24) does not have appropriate skills for employment and proper living. Poverty and limited skills to support themselves leads to crime and asocial beh
aviour. Youth from poor families often also have different kind of abuse in their background, for example violence, prostitution, drugs and negligence. These youth need support and life skills training to be able to find employment and build a safe future 
for themselves. The project is implemented in Nairobi and Kisumu. It provides children and youth with basic life skills and vocational training, and skills to start up small scale businesses. A Kenyan NGO Undugu Society of Kenya (USK) has developed a metho
d to transform groups of street children and youth to associations which find their own ways from drugs and asocial life to employment and self-support. The project works together with parents and public authorities, and approaches government, media and ci
vil society to highlight and improve the difficult situation of street youth. And to create employment and training possibilities for them.</narrative>
