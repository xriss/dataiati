   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In the time of growing globalisation as well as growing nationalistic tendencies, it is becoming even more important that the young people in Finland are more aware about development issues. This means there is a growing need for global education and aware
ness raising in an appealing form for the youth. On the other hand, there is at the same time already many young people, who are interested in global issues and would like to work on them, but don&#x2019;t have the channels or means to make their voice heard. G
lobalisti magazine answers to both of these needs: by offering information written by youth for youth that can be used as global education material, as well as by creating opportunities for young people to work on and promote the development issues. More w
idely, Globalisti magazine encourages young people to global responsibility and active citizenship. The aim of the Globalisti magazine is to raise awareness of young people about development issues. To ensure this, each magazine has a special focus on one 
actual theme. Changemaker network will publish 2 issues of Globalisti each year - one in spring, one in autumn. The number of copies is 3 500/issue. 1,500 copies are distributed to young people during activities of Changemaker, 2,000 copies to teachers and
 people doing global education through SubjectAid service.Activities and expected results: &#x2022; All content (text, editing, illustrations) of the Globalisti magazine done by an editorial group consisting of young volunteers of Changemaker network. The layou
t done by a graphic artist, who has been working in close contact with the editiorial group. The magazine is printed and distributed as described above.&#x2022; As a starting point of each magazine, Changemaker organises training for the volunteers, so that the
y can develop new skills and become more confident of their abilities to produce a magazine. &#x2022; New people to join the editorial group. The editorial group will also have regular meetings throughout the year. &#x2022; Awareness of youth increased on global dev
elopment issuesTarget groups: Globalisti is targeted both (1) to youth and young adults (e.g. members of Changemaker network, youth in parishes and schools) as well as (2) to people working with youth and in the field of global education (e.g. teachers, yo
