   <narrative xml:lang="EN">FLC: MADA- Women Journalist First towards professional journalists and reducing gender stereotyping</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="FI">?MADA?  as a leading organization in defending media freedoms in Palestine focus on the role of women journalists throughout this project which they believe it  will be the basis of a clear activation of feminist press and women journalists to enhance thei
r role in society and make a significant change toward equality and democratic governance :  firstly MADA belief that women are half of the society and equal in absolute terms with men in all rights and freedoms and it is also reflected in our internal pol
icies secondly women journalists in the community are the ones able to make a difference that is effective to enhance the status and role of women journalists at various levels especially female journalists who we believe are the engine that push toward a 
real change and the connecting pillar between governmental bodies civil society organizations and the people if provided with the needed resources and support at that point we can achieve MADA main goal  of ensuring freedom of opinion and expression and fr
ee flow of information equally among all Palestinians (particularly that women journalists who are registered at the Palestinian Journalists Syndicate are approximately the third).Furthermore  Palestinian women journalists  face two kinds of violations and
 discrimination: -1.Discrimination that is based on gender (female/male journalists) which will prevent their ability to achieve and occupy key positions in media outlets due to gender stereotypes as voices of women are somehow marginalized in the media wh
ereas men?s voices dominate in hard news. 2.  Violations as journalists: and these violations are faced by two other types by the Israeli Occupation and by different Palestinian apparatuses in (Gaza Strip and West Bank) due to the occupation at one hand an
d the internal division at the other which creates a barrier in front of journalists to express the opinions freely and to access information. And therefore MADA project will achieve the following objectives:1. To engage Palestinian women journalists in pr
omoting media freedoms (freedom of expression and opinion). 2. To strengthen the role of the Palestinian media in raising issues related to women in general and women journalists in particular.</narrative>
