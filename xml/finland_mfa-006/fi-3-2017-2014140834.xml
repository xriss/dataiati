   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Preventive Education for Uterine Prolapse in Nepal</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In Nepal there are about 14 million women with Uterine prolapse. Though the expected lifetime has become longer in Nepal the amount of women who get uterine prolapse has not decreased. It has doubled from the year 2008. The problem is in the Nepalese cultu
re. It does not protect the the women after they given a birth to a child. Many of the women are expected to work hard soon after the delivery.The aim of this project is to secure a better health for all in Nepal and to prevent Uterine prolapse- by support
ing them to appreciate the motherhood and to protect the mothers after the delivery - by counselling in breast-feeding and in child care- by teaching right ways to lift and to work - by guiding to healthy living habits and versatile diet- by encouraging to
 smoke free lifestyle with no intoxicating agents or fear of AIDSIt is planned that the project will reach all the 75 districts in Nepal in three years. Partners in the districts will be the health and education departments of the districts and also the vo
luntary women workers groups which already exist in the districts. According to the plan in each district a three day seminar will be arranged in which all the health teachers from the schools health assistants midwives and the voluntary women workers in t
he district will be invited. Each year about 2500 health workers can take part in the seminar (100 in each district). All these will get the health education teaching material used during the seminar so that they can use it also in their own work. So the a
mount of the Nepalese reached by the project will be several time larger.</narrative>
