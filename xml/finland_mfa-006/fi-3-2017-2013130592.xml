   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Project provides in-service training to secondary school teachers working in disadvantaged secondary schools in Meru District Council. Most importantly, the aim is to increase the use of participatory and integrative teaching approach in teaching English, 
Geography and History. Additionally, themes such as environmental issues, social aspects of the hiv and aids -pandemia and gender equality will be holistically integrated in the mentioned subjects. Teachers? skills will be strengthened both in theoretical 
knowledge and practical training. Also research articles will be produced. During the recent years, secondary education in Tanzania has been characterised by a growing number of schools and students, and at the same time, by an alarming rate of failure in 
national Form 4 examinations. In the area of teaching approach, the Ministry of Education of Tanzania has introduced a curriculum change for secondary school subjects, including a shift from teacher-centered to learner-centered participatory approach, whic
h has caused confusion and resistance among the teachers initially trained according to the principles of the traditional teacher-centered approach. PITA Project will be implemented in collaboration between TUMA University Faculty of Education, Meru Distri
ct Education authorities and selected secondary schools. The project benefits the secondary school teachers and students but on top of that, it offers the academic programmes an opportunity to test and apply participatory and integrative teaching methods i
n practical grass root level teaching and to develop the teacher training programmes to meet the requirements and challenges of the Tanzanian reality. In 2014 a background survey was conducted and 20 secondary schools with approximately 4.200 students and 
120 teachers chosen to the project.</narrative>
