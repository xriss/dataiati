ified motivated and capacitated to do their work.? In the end of 2013 two groups of students have graduated from the Pre School Teacher course and total 38 students graduated. 2. Sustainable Pre Schools are being established.? Engcamini was the first Pre S
chool establ.and construction works in Hawane are almost complete. HLL has also built two other Pre Schools (Pine Valley and Lavumisa). As per the Mid-Term Review the sustainability prospects of the established Pre Schools are good.3. Improved Co-ordinatio
n on ECCD at the central and regional levels.? The Ministry of Education continued support to the project shows the immense growth that can partake in ECCD in Swaziland. This 3 result area needs more attention and it is considered as one of the justificati
ons to apply for the phase II.The EduGate II (2015-2017) would have same two first result areas. In order to sustain the results and also expand the project benefits for larger number of Pre School teachers the EduGate II would expand on refresher training

oved Pre School teacher&apos;s education and materials available in Swaziland.Consideration of crosscutting objectives of Finnish Development Policy Programme (2/2012): The key focus is in Reduction of Inequality - good pre school learning provides foundation f
