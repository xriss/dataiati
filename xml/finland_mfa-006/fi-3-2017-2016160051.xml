  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Centre for Rights Education and Awareness (CREAW) is a registered non-profit women?s rights organization founded in 1998 by several women lawyers who had common goals and a shared purpose to confront the low awareness of women?s real needs and rights i
n Kenya. It was registered in 1999 as the Centre for Rehabilitation and Education of Abused Women. It later changed the name to reflect its wider focus on women?s rights in society. CREAW programs focus mainly on violence against women and so far the progr
ams have managed to successfully prosecute over 16000 cases of sexual and gender based violence. CREAW has a strong track record in consistently pursuing justice for women legal representation creation of legal awareness increased psychosocial support to c
lients and continuous couple therapy and mediation.According to a baseline survey report by CREAW in 2012 it established that over 78% members of Kibera community had a tolerating attitude towards GBV. This is a true reflection of many informal settlements
 in Kenya. These findings were largely associated with cultural stereotypes perceived poor GBV services and poverty in the area. While awareness on violence against women is high residents have developed a tolerating attitude towards it. A few community me
mbers readily seek services while majority others don?t because of perceptions on the quality of service. Poverty remains a critical reason with tendency of survivors of violence to abandon cases before they are concluded due to threats by perpetrators fea
r of police intimidation while collecting evidence and lack of legal and psychosocial support to build confidence self- esteem and resilience of survivors as well as ensure accountability of duty bearers in seeking justice. In a 2010 National Survey on Vio
lence Against Children conducted by the Government of Kenya 32 percent of females ages 18-24 reported having experienced sexual violence and 66 percent of females reported having experienced some form of physical violence. Additionally 24 percent of girls 
who had sex before the age of 18 reported that it occurred against their will. In totality 76 percent of girls have experienced at least one type of violence (sexual physical or emotional) before reaching the age of 18. (IRC 2014). Most cases of GBV are co
mmitted by family members or intimate partners of the victims including boyfriends husbands fathers and mothers.</narrative>
