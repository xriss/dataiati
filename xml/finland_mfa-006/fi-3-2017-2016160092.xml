  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="FI">The project aims to identify principal barriers to women holding decision making power over community land; develop comprehensive and participatory strategy to achieving &gt;50% women beneficiaries and to ensuring women have equal decision making power over c
ommunity land in perpetuity; facilitate Participatory Natural Resource Management planning with target communities and the Ministry of Lands Housing Water and Energy (MLHWE); compose conservation agreements outlining permitted and restricted land use activ
ities as well as measures to ensure gender balance for management of the land in question; targeted communities submit formal requests for land title to the Ministry concerned; Ministry concerned and the target communities sign conservation agreements; and
 the Department of Land and Surveys under the Ministry of MLHWE direction survey land and transfer the land title to target communities for subsequent management. This project is implemented in Pemba Island. As a small island  Pemba is especially vulnerabl
e to the negative effects of climate change as well as  negative human and economic impacts of a degraded natural environment. Gender equality has been a big problem in the Pemban communities. Thus the project sees the need to diversify development activit
ies focusing on improving resilience and gender equality. The measurable changes expected include; approximately sixty (60) hectares of additional government land transferred to six target communities; twelve participatory Natural Resource Management (PNRM
) plans and conservation agreements developed in collaboration with targeted communities; also equal decision making power for women enshrined in PNRM plans and associated conservation agreements resulting in greater decision making power for Pemban women.
 The project targets rural smallholder farmers and those dependent on natural resources for their livelihoods with special considerations for women. Community Forests Pemba (CFP) is the main implementing agent of this project. CFP is a very experienced org
anization in Pemba Island in working with the community especially in issues pertaining to conservation and reforestation as well as agricultural activities. This is the only NGO the Embassy is funding in Zanzibar and Pemba.</narrative>
