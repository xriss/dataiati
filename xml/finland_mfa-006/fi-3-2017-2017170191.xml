   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Diyar 2017 International Conference The Palestinian Naksa of 1967 and Its Implications</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The main reason and idea of proposing and launching the international conference was raised up in order to use the surplus funds of the previous project ?The Palestinian Youth Leadership Training Project ? Phase III? which ended on December 31 2016 in the 
amount of ?10912.33 Euro. The proposed conference ?Palestinian Naksa of 1967 and Its Implications? is the 15th in this series and it deals with an extremely critical theme and issue to the Palestinian population first and foremost but also to the regional 
and international stakeholders which is the 1967 War. the proposed conference has four key themes : First Palestinian secular nationalism and the resurgence of Islamist ideology and its sociological manifestations; Second the role of Christian Zionism and 
its political/biblical narrative; Third the displacement of Palestinians and the construction of settler communities as well as the spread of settlement outposts; Fourth collective memory of the conflict and its role in shaping national identity across Pal
estinian communities. the conference?s outputs are to enhance the rights and status of women and gender equality since the conference deals with a historical event that has transformed the social religious and political landscape of Palestine in profound a
nd dramatic ways which led to the demise of secular Arab nationalism and the rise of Islamism and its sociological manifestations in the Palestinian society including impacting negatively the rights and status of women. besides the resulting Israeli milita
ry occupation of Palestinian land and its people and the settlements and the separation wall have worked further to strengthen the traditional reactionary and negative societal attitudes perceptions and ultimately practices against Palestinian women. As su
ch a deep study of that momentous event and its effects can greatly help in finding realistic informed solutions recommendations and scenarios to help improve the lives rights and role of Palestinian women and other marginalized groups who were gravely and
 negatively impacted by the 1967 Naksa and lead the way forward to a better future. Finally the expected outcome of this conference aside from the papers submitted is a short film of 30 minutes with the conference contributions to share its results reflect
ions and recommendations with broader groups including academicians and experts institutions libraries and other stakeholders in the rest of the world.</narrative>
