  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">CMI considers the continuing under representation of women and their views in peacemaking, and the persistent low capacity and readiness amongst peacemaking actors to understand and used gendered approaches in conflict analysis, conflict resolution and pea
cebuilding processes to be a major weaknesses in the global effort to support and sustain quality peace processes. Given the span of CMI?s work across Tracks 1.5 and 2, there is clear opportunity to enhance programme delivery through the gradual and experi
ence-based development of a gender-aware approach which emphasizes the meaningful participation of women. In the different contexts targeted, the peace processes face a number of obstacles. Women hold a range of different strategic roles and possibilities,
 and have potential to affect or drive these processes but their space to act is severely constrained. There are three specific projects where CMI has developed a stream of work which puts women?s meaningful inclusion and gender intelligent processes at th
e heart of the project objective. In the South Caucasus, CMI provides safe spaces professionally facilitated by a third party organization for continued relationship building, addressed collective narratives and developed recommendation for inclusivity of 
regional peace processes by core group of women. There is also a necessity for a Creation/establishment of a ?support group? and advocacy work as there are no women in the official track 1. This support group is needed for informing the Track 1 support gro
up of the project developments, linking Track 1 actors to the work conducted at Track 2 and Track 3. In South Sudan, through its ongoing work with the Women?s Parliamentary Caucus, CMI will support leading women from the parliament and civil society to dev
elop and advance collaborative strategies on how to link the voices of local level women to the formal processes for peace and reconciliation, including to the regional/international actors supporting them. In the MENA region, CMI continues to support the 
Women?s Forum for Dialogue in Yemen, reorienting their focus to the current conflict and the role they envisage for women in resolving it, and facilitating their engagement with the topic of violent extremism in their country and how it can be addressed as
 part of the broader conflict dynamic.</narrative>
