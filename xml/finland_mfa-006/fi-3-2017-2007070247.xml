rcity of available resources required for working. The study motivation of students is low, because they do not feel studying to be meaningful or they do not get enough support for learning. Possibilities for further education are limited. The project work
s with five high schools in the Outhoumphon and Songkhon district regions in Savannakhet province. The programme focuses on training teachers, providing teaching materials and motivating students. Trained volunteers from amongst the students play an import
ant role in motivating students. The facilities of schools are improved through cooperation between the community and the programme. The programme?s beneficiaries are 2 800 students, 120 teachers and 55 000 villagers in 46 villages. The project?s goal is t
he improved level of education in the target schools in Songkhon and Outhoumphon districts. The project?s purpose is the improvement of teaching and learning conditions in the target schools. As the school environment and teachers? skills develop, the qual
ity of education increases as a whole. The motivation of students leads to better learning outcomes. The community?s level of commitment towards the improvement of education and school environments increases as they take responsibility in the renovation of
 school buildings.</narrative>
