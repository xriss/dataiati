   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project aims to raise youth awareness of global migration and human mobility.During this project global educational activities will be carried out in Guide and Scout camps and events so that a large number of youths are reached without having to use re
sources for recruiting. The aim of these activities is to get youngsters to think about the reasons and consequences of global migration including the consequences for developing countries. By using already established Scout structures many youngsters who 
otherwise might not take part in global educational activities are reached. We will offer youngsters concrete means to work towards a better more tolerant and peaceful world.The main target group of this project are Scouts that are over 12 years old. For a
ge group 12-15 year olds and their leaders we will organise to Scout camps a ?day/ half day global development valley? which combines various global education activities targeted to this age group. The whole age group of an event will take part in this act
ivity. For the older age groups there will be also various workshops and role plays.We will make cooperation with Finnish Refugee Council Finnish Red Cross and International Organisation of Migration: in the project we will use already existing global educ
ation material from the partner organisations and Scouts. We will also create new exercises. To support the Scout event there will be in depth facilitation workshops to key person by themselves) running the programmes. In the workshops/ while planning and 
running the events young people can influence on the content of the project and tell about global migration and human mobility to their peer group. All materials and methods used will be advertised to all local Guide and Scouts groups in Finland to be incl
uded afterwards as a part of normal Guide and Scout weekly activities. In the project we aim to reach 7500 young people (who have taken part in the activities) beside that 18 000 people who took part in these Scout event have seen the programme running. Af
ter the project 50 000 people have heard or read about it.A grant of 50 580 euro has been given to this two-year project by MoFA.</narrative>
