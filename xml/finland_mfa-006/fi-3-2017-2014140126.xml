  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Civil society?s engagement in the comprehensive process of Peace and Conflict is vital in dealing with 65-years of entrenched mistrust and fear ? to move the country forward through reconciliation and a more sustainable peace. While Myanmar?s peace process
 is expected to advance and building on a positive trend, hopefully strengthened by a positive outcome of the Elections and Ceasefire agreement in 2015, civil society engagement will be crucial to stress as there are few practical entry points ? leaving a 
large part of the population concerned and skeptical of the process and its outcomes. The Main Objective: This project aims to address on-going violence in Rakhine and Kachin State by accompanying and establishing local peacebuilders to develop initiatives
 at local/community level for rights-holders and duty-bearers. Expected Results: ? Local peacebuilders and an increasing number of communities have a better understanding of the complex conflict dynamics in Rakhine and Kachin States ? Increased engagement 
and interaction of local actors (government, NGOs, CSOs) in the peace process through increased skills in handling the sensitive issues among participants and building platforms for reconciliation? Peace and Conflict issues are an integral part of and refl
ected upon in development issues and the governing agenda for local communities? CSO?s play an increasingly important role in P+C issues and represent their constituency better Rights-holders/beneficiaries: groups of local peacebuilders (different faiths a
nd women representatives) and CSO organisations; increased cooperation with local government as a duty-bearer.Implementing partner:The Centre for Peace and Conflict Studies (CPCS) is a Cambodia-based non-governmental organisation (NGO) working in the field
 of peace building and conflict transformation in Asia. Its? mission is to strengthen strategic interventions into armed conflict with the overall goal of reaching sustainable and positive peace in the Asia region. CPCS is home to a range of interconnected
 programmes and initiatives that are informed by on-going analysis and consultation with a myriad of local partners from the various contexts in which CPCS works, including Myanmar, the Philippines, India, Nepal, and Sri Lanka.</narrative>
