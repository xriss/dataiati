   <narrative xml:lang="EN">1. Project:11755 Women?s Livelihood Empowerment Project (WLEP)
2. Project area and Country: Delta region, Yangon region, Rakhine state in Myanmar 
3. Project justification: 
According to the census data in March 2016, almost 50% of the population aged 10 y
ears and over is employed in the agriculture, forestry and fishing sectors. The employment-to-population ratio is much higher for males at 81% than for females at 48%. In almost all states and regions, female unemployment rate is higher. The discrepancy wa
s largest in the Rakhine State. Fewer job opportunities exist for women and they mostly work in the informal sector. Most women owned and managed businesses lack access to finance and other necessary inputs, and access to tailored capacity building initiat
ives and on-going support. 
4. The main objective and the expected results:
Women?s Livelihood Empowerment Project (WLEP) will build on the lessons learnt from the previous ?Project for Improving Women?s Livelihoods (PIWL)?, which was piloted in 28 village
s in Pyapon and Dedaye Townships in the Ayeyarwaddy Delta Region from 2014 to 2016. WLEP project will work with another 100 villages in 10 Townships. The project?s main objective is to promote improved and sustainable socio-economic livelihoods for the tar
geted women. This will be accomplished through sustainable IGA/small business development, enhancing the women?s skills in managing their own household and village development activities and increasing their participation in decision-making processes. The 
project will also facilitate linking the Women?s Groups up to urban markets. The key activities include entrepreneurship training, saving and credit scheme management training, learning visits to cooperatives, identifying and establishing urban-rural marke
t linkages and facilitating access to financial assistance to establish businesses/income generation activities.
5. Right-holders/ beneficiaries: 49,500 direct beneficiaries
Duty bearers: Village Development Committees, Women Groups, Youth Groups, Ministry
 for Social Welfare, FCA, ACT alliance members, and Urban Setting: Hla Day social enterprise 
6. Implementing partner: LWF Myanmar
