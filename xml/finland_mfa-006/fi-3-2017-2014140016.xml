   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The overall goal of the project is to improve the social and economic situation of men, women and their families in the Shabuye/Chabi area, and to promote peaceful coexistence between the different ethnic peoples by enhancing participation. In the Gambella
 people?s regional state, Mejengir Zone, the Shabuye (Chabi) people, who are the focus of this project, are socially excluded and culturally subordinated by the neighboring ethnic groups. The number of Shabuye/Chabi is estimated to be 1.500. The Shabuye/Ch
abi people used to live in the forest being totally detached from the neighboring peoples except for sharing the market place. They are coming out of the forest to Yeri area due to a settlement program of the government to enable them get access to social 
services and other basic infrastructure. They are not familiarized with modern farming systems and agricultural extension system is not well established. By the end of the second phase of the project, awareness of the Shabuye/Chabi people to use the social
 structure is developed; school conditions, school enrollment and attendance of their children has increased; sustainable agriculture has been developed and agricultural extension services have been introduced. The health situation has been improved throug
h provision of medicine and equipment to the local health post, sensitization of community members on environmental sanitation, public health and hiv/aids prevention and control as well as potable water supply. The beneficiary is the whole Shabuye/Chabi po
pulation. The implementing agency is the Ethiopian Evangelical Church Mekane Yesus / Illubabor Bethel Synod Development and Social Services Commission (EECMY-DASSC-IBS) in Mettu.</narrative>
