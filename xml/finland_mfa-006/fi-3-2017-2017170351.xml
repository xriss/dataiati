   <narrative xml:lang="EN">F.a: A replicable model of affordable renewable energy for poor communities in Bethlehem-Palestine</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project will provide renewable and new source of affordable energy to three beneficiaries (resource-poor households) in Bethlehem, Palestine, who need to buy from Israel currently the Near East&apos;s most expensive electricity, which is produces with fossi
l fuels. Already during the project, but mainly after that, Siemenpuu-Kansalaisliikkeiden yhteistyosaatio sr&apos;s partner Applied Research Institute - Jerusalem (ARIJ) will develop scalable and innovative financial instruments whereby each kWh produced by pho
tovoltaic (PV) systems will finance future PV projects for people with little or no access to electricity and alternative energy. The concrete activities of the project are: 1) In cooperation with Bethlehem Municipality, town hall meetings will be conducte
d to explain the benefits and the operational concepts of the PV systems to resource-poor households. Three households will be selected on the basis of the socio-economic conditions, electrical consumption and the willingness and commitment of the benefici
aries to long-term affordable alternative energy. 2) The installation, management and operation of three PV systems with a total capacity of 16 kWp. The three PV systems will be installed to serve approximately 80% of the energy needs of three resource-poo
r households (Approx. 5.3kWp each). As the result of the project, the price of electricity will decrease by a third, even though the beneficiaries will pay for the solar power to the project implementer. This model empowers people through the systems&apos; tran
sfer of ownership during 15 years, after which the household will receive free electricity and 63 % decrease of their electricity bills over 25 years. The accumulated funds will be used for developing the next PV projects, which in turn will also generate 
new funding. Project aims also at mitigating climate change: the three PV systems will save approximately 366 tons of CO2 emissions over 25 years of operation.</narrative>
