   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project strengthens mother-tongue-based multilingual education in primary schools by developing school materials, strengthening the capacity of teachers, teacher trainers, dictionary workers and school inspectors as well as developing local languages a
nd cultures. In Bench-Maji Zone there are six local languages (Bench, Me&apos;en, Diizi, Suri, Shekko, Baale), and the local government has decided that all of them can be used as language of instruction in the lower grades of primary education in each language
 area. The project aims to finalize the orthographic systems of the languages, prepare pertinent and contextualized study plans and materials and transition components to English and Amhara for higher grades. With the project the local language communities
 can better maintain their own language, history and culture, and develop their written culture. It also increases the possibilities of the members of these language communities for integration into the society and helps the children to improve their schoo
l achievements. Out of the six languages, in Bench, Me&apos;en, Shekko and Diizi languages the mother tongue based multilingual education (MTB MLE) was introduced in pilot classes in grades 1-4 in 16 schools. Now the MTB MLE has been introduced also in Suri lan
guage. Local Government has expanded the MTB MLE following the pilot classes. The number of schools where MTB MLE is used has increased in four years (2011-2015) from 16 to 228. The number of students in MTB MLE classes in 2011 was 549 (333 boys, 216 girls
), and in 2015 it was 33 726 (18 824 boys, 14 902 girls). The beneficiaries are the children and local people of six ethnic peoples, and the teachers and education authorities of the region. The implementing agency is SIL International (Summer Institute of
 Linguistics), with a long experience in developing written languages and strengthening mother-tongue-based multilingual education throughout the world.</narrative>
