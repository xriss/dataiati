   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The programme works for the improvement of rural communities&#x2019; socio-economic situation and quality of life, as well for the strengthening of community capacities and enhancing children&#x2019;s in Sook, Western Kenya.Focal goals in the previous program phase 
were the improvement of the position of the girl child, promoting education for children and improving the health status in the area. When the program started only one third of children between 5 and 18 years went to school. The number of children going to
 school has however doubled since 2009 when the work started. On the basis of the evaluation at the moment 95 % of children in the area starts the school. The first secondary school for girls was finished in 2010 and the number of students is growing due t
o the security provided by the dormitories. School drop- out has been very common especially for girls who have been married off often at the age of 12-14 years, right after FGM. The evaluation showed that FGM has decreased by 21 % in the four years of imp
lementation. Now the percentage of girls who have been cut is 72%. Community members have been trained in community management and the relationships between local actors and government have been strengthened. Child participation in decision making has been
 encouraged through children&#x2019;s parliaments. Local women&#x2019;s groups have been supported and specifically women&#x2019;s vegetable gardens have brought good results through empowerment and extra income. Reusable sanitary pads are being made and also that brings
 extra income for women and helps the girls to participate fully in education. Ministry of Health representatives have joined the program team in visiting communities with talks on HIV, malaria prevention and training volunteers on child nutrition. Sook ha
s a population of 22.000 people. They belong to Pokots and families are mostly nomads moving around with their cattle. The main partner is World Vision Kenya that runs the implementation and accounts for the use of funding.</narrative>
