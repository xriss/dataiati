   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project aims to create democratic spaces that will make it possible for the state and tribal communities to engage with one and another in a way that is enshrined in the principles and value of social justice. The project seeks to spawn a set of proces
ses, mechanisms and locally adaptive institutions, which will enable tribal adivasi communities to articulate their customary patterns of use and access of natural resources. As part of the overall bid to democratize the management of forests the project w
ill steer local institutions in a manner so as to establish the legitimacy of their traditional relationship with the forests. Needless to say this relationship, which has been largely undermined by the Indian state and other stakeholders, is an enduring, 
long-lasting, and intimate one. The project is premised on the belief that local tribal communities have a sound understanding of their resources, and are capable of managing them in an ecologically sustainable manner. The establishment of traditional righ
ts over forests, through the auspices of Community Forest Management (CFM), will additionally encourage a pro-poor atmosphere through which the continued protection of our natural heritage from competing claims of industrialists will be ensured. In speakin
g of pro-poor livelihoods the project will further the cause of traditional arts and crafts, particularly those fashioned out of bamboo by the local tribal communities of Uttar Bastar. Resurrecting such livelihoods is an imperative from the point of forest
 governance, for traditional crafts are not only a critical source of income for rural households but also emblematic of local culture. The bid to democratize forest spaces cannot ignore the nuances of dealing with culture and tribal identity, which will s
ee the project founding a ?model village? of bamboo-based workers. This model village will be the first of its kind and showcase the finest of adivasi talents in the region to the outside world. It will serve as a site in the time to come to acquaint civil
 society with the ability of the local tribes to make a living in harmony with Nature. Parivartan Samaj Sevi Sanstha is an organization dedicated to the welfare of marginalized communities in the Uttar Bastar region of Chhattisgarh. www.parivartancg.org</narrative>
