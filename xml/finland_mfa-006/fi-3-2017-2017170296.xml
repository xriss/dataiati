 revision of policies, guiding documents, procedures and practices, as well as staff induction and capacity building. In 2018, the focus will be on accountability mechanisms. Certification means a full commitment to the CHS, and compliance will be verified
 annually through external audits. FCA will benefit CHS audit as well as external programme and global evaluations to improve organisational quality and accountability.
