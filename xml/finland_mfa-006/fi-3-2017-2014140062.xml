  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Kilwa district community members and local leaders are empowered by training programs and capacity building to develop their communities in a democratic and participatory way. Communities themselves define the needs and means to improve their living and th
e project may give some material support to the initiatives. The emphasis is in trainings which aim at improving both practical skills and knowledge as well as better understanding and realization of human rights. Special attention is given to the rights o
f women and the most vulnerable groups. After graduating the training program the local leaders and decision makers understand their roles and responsibilities better and are more capable to bear their duties. Community members know their rights and are ca
pable to take action to improve their livelihoods; they can make plans, follow the processes and track public expenditure. Living conditions are improved also by practical trainings and micro business. Direct beneficiaries are the most disadvantaged famili
es chosen to the program in 25 rural villages in Kilwa district. The whole community benefits from the improved capacity and actions taken. The project is implemented by Tanganyika Christian Refugee Service TCRS which implements a large human rights based 
country program including community empowerment programs and refugee work.</narrative>
