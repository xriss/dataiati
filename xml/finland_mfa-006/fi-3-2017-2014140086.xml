   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The school dropout and unemployment rates are very high among youth (between the ages of 17 to 35 years) in Bo ? the second city in Sierra Leone. For example due to lack of finances poor and vulnerable youth is often not able to complete secondary educatio
n or enter institutions of higher learning. Providing access to quality technical and vocational education and training (TVET) is critical in offering ?a second chance? for those with little formal education and often with poor literacy and life skills. Th
e main objective:Guided by the principle ?from learning to earning?, the main objective of the project is to provide training in vocational skills that respond to needs of job markets and industries, and employability skills to youth who lack the level of 
skills and competencies required for accessing employment and who lack the knowledge of how to become self-employed by turning business ideas into bankable business plans. Provision of access to credit and business advisory services are part of the project
.Expected results:As a result of vocational training (carpentry, masonry, tailoring and welding, hairdressing) and business and employability skills training, the employment and income of graduates from Youth Development Training Centre (YDTC) in Bo and fr
om other TVET providers in Bo district has increased. Through partnership with the private sector the the training is demand-driven and meets occupational and competency standards. Policy and operational environment for TVET in Southern region developed th
rough cooperation and advocacy work with educational authorities and other TVET stakeholders.Right-holders/ beneficiaries: Vulnerable urban and peri-urban youthImplementing partner: Rehabilitation and Development Agency (RADA)</narrative>
