   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The main objective of the project is to increase the understanding of the members of the Ugandan Parliament about the country?s current Internet legislation, which is incompatible with fundamental and human rights. In addition, the project aims to strength
en the expertise of different organizations, in particular at the grass-roots level, of the safe use of digital media in order to better raise awareness of the human rights situation. Unwanted Witness works on Internet access and protection of privacy. The
 project will have a significant impact on the promotion and protection of online freedoms and democracy; the main goal of the project is to increase the understanding and knowledge of the newly elected representatives of the Ugandan Parliament of the out-
dated and technically challenging Internet legislation and its contradictions with respect to fundamental and human rights. In addition, the organization aims to train individual parliamentarians on the contents of Internet related legislation so that they
 could raise cyber-legislation issues and initiatives for discussion in Parliament and make needed changes. This will lead to legislation that respects fundamental and human rights. The primary beneficiaries are the 30 representatives of the Parliament tha
t deal with relevant legislation. In addition, the primary beneficiaries are the youth organizations and networks outside the cities (10) and their representatives ( 2 each) who receive training on the safe use of digital media in human rights work.The Unw
anted Witness was founded by a group of human rights defenders in 2012, and registered in 2013 as a non-profit-making company. It organizes trainings on digital media tools and their safe use. The research work benefits the organizations overall work and i
s a basis for efficient advocacy work when advocating for the protection of the individual, freedom of expression and democracy. The organization seeks to promote freedom of expression and access to the Internet through strategic court cases. https://unwan
