   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Optolevel has set three phases for the cooperation work. The main idea is that the partner can identify their responsibilities as well as can feel secure with the support of Optolevel during the entire project. The phases are:Phase1: It is estimated that t
he first phase of the project could last about 2 years due to cultural differences and procedures including bureaucracy and hierarchies. This phase includes: study of the infrastructure in the country (terminal service station and tank trucks) documentatio
n related to the certificates and permissions of use of the new technology within the country agreements searching for customers pilot planning and execution training and analysis of the pilot results for further implementation throughout the tank truck fl
eet and installation. Even thought the main customer in Bolivia is Yacimientos Petroliferos de Bolivia (YPFB) which is the oil company. YPFB is the link with the transportation companies.Phase 2: The follow-up of procedures related to installation and tech
nical support can be estimated to be 5 years. This time depends on the number of units to be installed i.e. the number of tank trucks and service stations to which the equipment is to be installed over and above the capacity and resources of the partner. T
he time is also depending on the acceptance of the products in the country. Checking that all procedures are up to date and functioning properly.Phase 3: The cooperation continues because of the possibilities of launching new products upgrades of existing 
products and the additional benefits of the cooperation such as getting new customers. This phase is important for both partners because the image of the two parties is at stake their prestige and consolidation in the market of the country.</narrative>
