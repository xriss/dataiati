  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The domestic workers? union UNITED?s position as a trade union as well as its organising, training and advocacy work is strengthened in the project. UNITED was established in 2015 in the Philippines. The implementation of domestic workers? rights related l
egislation in municipalities and villages together with the local authorities is improved through the advocacy work. Enhanced advocacy work also supports collective bargaining actions with the local authorities. In 2016 SASK?s support is channelled to two 
cities - Paranaque City in Metro Manila and Zamboanga City in southern Mindanao. In both cities, the potential for the cooperation with the local authorities is good. In 2017 the lessons learned in the cooperation will be applied more broadly in the work o
f UNITED.The Philippines have ratified the ILO convention 189 and they have a national law for domestic workers? rights (Batas Kasambahav). In the Philippines, there are 2,08 million domestic workers of whom only approximately 2 % enjoys social security. L
ocal government has an essential role in registration of domestic workers under the social security system. Domestic workers? basic rights and trade union activities are very new in the Philippines so the cooperation begins with putting structures in place
 and awareness raising.The objective for the pilot phase is to make the domestic workers in the chosen areas aware of their rights as workers as well as register them to the local social security system. Objective is that UNITED?s local branches are active
 and relevant and new members are organised to the union. The objective of the advocacy work is that UNITED?s local branches are able to influence the local government to implement the national domestic workers? legislation better.Project partner is a nati
onal education and research centre LEARN (Labor Education and Research Network) which has been a vital part in enhancing and supporting UNITED?s work.</narrative>
