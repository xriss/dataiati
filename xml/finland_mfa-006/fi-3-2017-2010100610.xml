   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The vulnerable women, mainly victims of domestic violence, seek counselling and legal help from Fida?s partner organizations, RENEW (Respect, Educate, Nurture and Empower Women). In many cases they do not have means to support themselves (and the kids) eco
nomically. To create means of income they are given the chance to learn skills, especially tailoring, weaving and embroidery, and support to start a women&apos;s group to run the business to market and sell the products. The focus has been on teaching tailoring
, embroidery and weaving. Also the capacity building of the skills of training trainers (on product design, quality and marketing) and administrative staff (on finance, project management, reporting) have been essential parts of the project. In 2015, train
ings have also been conducted needs based on other trades, like food processing and agriculture. The work continues with new women?s groups and working districts in 2016. The goal of the project is to improve the livelihood opportunities of the victims of 
domestic violence and other vulnerable women by learning (/teaching?) livelihood skills. The purpose is to establish a well-functioning training program for the domestic violence victims and other vulnerable women. As a result of the project, there will be
 skillful trained local instructors and hundreds of women with new livelihood skills in tailoring, weaving, machine embroidery or ginger candy production. As a result the skills improve and income increases. Women?s self-esteem is improved as a result of t
he positive feedback. The project beneficiaries include vulnerable women (victims of DV, alcohol and drug addicts) and their families.</narrative>
