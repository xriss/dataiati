   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In the project health care workers will be trained about principles and practices of decent work, as well as the impact of decent working conditions on the quality of and people?s access to public health care. Recruitment of members and creation and develo
pment of a network of organizations involved in health care sector gives possibilities to influence legislation and to campaign against privatizations.PPP coupled with the relative weakness of the unions is a threat for the conditions of workers and possib
ilities of unions to act as efficient agents of interest representation. By strengthening the unions in the sector the project aims at influencing both reasonable working conditions and ensuring service provision for citizens.The membership of the unions g
rows by at least 10 % and all members pay their union dues, so the financial self-sustainability of the unions grows by at least 10 %. At least seven new unions join PSI. The unions? campaign against precarization of work, privatization and PPP program wil
l be implemented, and increase of the public health care budget will be promoted through lobbying political decision makers. The joint campaign of health care unions in collaboration with national centres and other trade union and civil society organizatio
ns to defend quality public health services bears fruit.The beneficiaries are Philippino health care workers and citizens using health care services.The partner is Public Services International (PSI) and its affiliate union in the Philippines Alliance of F
ilipino Workers (AFW), Confederation of Independent Unions in the Public Sector (CIU), Philippines Government Employees Association (PGEA), Public Services Labor independent Confederation (PSLINK), Philippine Nurses Association (PNA).</narrative>
