   <narrative xml:lang="EN">1. Project: 11819 Big Brother Big Sister 
2. Project area and Country: Occupied Palestinian Territory (East Jerusalem) 
3. Project justification: 
The Palestinian community of East Jerusalem finds itself in a particularly vulnerable position, as it continu
es to be separated from the rest of the West Bank by the separation wall built by Israel. The wall leaves the community beyond the scope of Palestinian Authorities and neglected by the occupying Israeli authority, hence lacking adequate services in all sec
tors. Comprising approximately 50 % of the Palestinian population, children endure the most difficult conditions. Dropout rates in East Jerusalemite schools are high, leaving more than 30 % of children with limited access to education, while schools and CB
Os in the area lack targeted programmes that would accommodate the needs of learners, especially those with disabilities and learning difficulties.
4. The main objective and the expected results: 
The main objective of the project is to mitigate the risk o
f dropping out of education of the children in East Jerusalem. This will be accomplished through the improved level of functioning of children at risk of dropping out in the Old City and Silwan in East Jerusalem through building a safe and supportive relat
ionship with the university student volunteers. The project will also develop university student volunteers? (?Big Brothers/Sisters?) capacities in dealing with children at risk of dropping out and enhance the knowledge and skills of targeted parents in su
pporting their children?s development. The project will also continue to expose and motivate the CBOs in East Jerusalem to participate in the Big Brother Big Sister programme.
5. Right-holders/ beneficiaries: 50 children from the marginalized neighborhoods
 in Jerusalem, 60 university student volunteers, parents of the targeted children, 200 children and 100 university students reached through community and promotional activities 
Duty bearers: Palestinian Ministry of Education, Directorate of Education in J
erusalem, local CBOs 
6. Implementing partner: Palestinian Counselling Center (PCC) 
7. Budget 2018: Total budget EUR 100 000</narrative>
