   <narrative xml:lang="EN">More than 70% of the Guatemalan population is under 30 years old, and more than 50 % is under 20 years old. The social problems of the country, such as street violence, corruption and impunity, poverty and poor quality of basic services, raise serious chal
lenges and threats in the environment the youth grow up in. Nevertheless, the issues regarding children and youth are not among priorities of the decision makers. Public investments on childhood and youth are few, and decisions are not based on rights. The
 cultural environment labelled by adultcentrism prevents the children and youth from raising their voices in the civil society, even though local decision makers have a responsibility to hear and include the relevant stakeholders when preparing public poli
cies.The project objective is to improve the possibilities of adolescents and youth to act as active citizens and to increase their participation in local decision making processes, so that they can actively contribute to building societies that respect ch
ild and youth rights. The first phase of the project provided training for youth on citizenship and motivation to act as change agents. Adult decision makers received trainings on youth rights and participation, to understand the importance of respecting y
outh rights and especially the right to participate and to be heard. The second phase of the project concentrates in supporting and strenghtening youth movements established during the first project phase in their independent work as part of the civil soci
ety. The groups are responsible of planning, implementing, monitoring and evaluating their activities and performance, and reporting to the project coordinator. This is how the youth activists learn to take more responsibility and strenghten their capacity
 to act independently to promote child and youth rights in their communities also after the project ends.Cooperation started throug open call of #tenders# in 2005. http://pami-guatemala.org/wp/</narrative>
