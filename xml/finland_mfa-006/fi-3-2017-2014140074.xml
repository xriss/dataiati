   <narrative xml:lang="EN">F.a: The Care for Orphans and Vulnerable Children in the Context of HIV and Aids, Political Violence and Poverty Project</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project aims at encouraging communities to take part in the most vulnerable children&apos;s care, protection and the provision of the essentials of life in the children&apos;s home communities. Action is based on a comprehensive and sustainable community based s
upport model for AIDS orphans and other vulnerable children.The grandmothers? groups in the Gwai area were formed as an informal response to Zimbabwe?s 1990s political chaos, deepening economic plight, livelihood challenges, deteriorating situation of HIV 
and AIDS and drought years. The grandmothers of a Lutheran congregation in a small country village in Matebeleland organized themselves in order to take care of orphans in their community. Soon they were joined by grandmothers in other churches. Thus was b
orn the first Grandmothers groups in the area.Over the years the activity has expanded and become established, in part, as a result of systematic efforts in copying the model to other areas. The model as such provides an alternative to the institutional ca
re of orphans in Zimbabwe. At the moment there are at least 14 grandmothers? groups in Chingoma area. The group size and activity varies, but larger groups support up to 250 children. It is estimated that in Zimbabwe, more than 850 000 children have been o
rphaned due to HIV.Grandmothers? groups define themselves the targeted children. They are familiar with the community and the situation in families and are therefore able to assess and prioritize the situation of individual children. The children are faced
 with a wide range of economic and social problems: stress, sadness, stigma, discrimination, isolation, economic deprivation, lack of access to education, domestic work burden and fear for the future of their own and their loved ones.Grandmothers meet a wi
de range of roles in children&apos;s lives. They provide psycho-social support, such as discussion and plays with the children, as well as storytelling and discussions to strengthen children&apos;s identity, belonging to society and self-esteem. They also support th
e education of children by encouraging, assisting with homework and providing school fees, school uniforms and school books. Grandmothers also teach the children daily living skills, such as sewing, small-scale farming, cooking, cleaning up and washing up,
 as well as provide them with food during the dry season and support them with cultivation during the crop season.</narrative>
