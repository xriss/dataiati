   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The root causes of children?s suffering is poverty in their families due to inability to access viable economic activities, negative attitude on education caused by harmful cultural beliefs and inadequate knowledge on the children&apos;s right to education (esp
ecially girls), impacts of HIV/AIDS, natural calamity like landslides and war that has led to death of parents or guardians. Children have become vulnerable without access to education, healthcare and livelihood. The project provides support to sponsored c
hildren as well as empowers their families and guardians on Rights of Children and Child Protection measures. Parents and guardians of orphans and vulnerable children (OVC) and children affected by armed forces (CAAF) will be trained in modern farming meth
ods and psychosocial support. The project will train the implementing partner?s, Pentecostal Churches of Uganda, field workers on sponsorship management and protection issues, build the capacity of the care givers/field workers and volunteers in food secur
ity issues, create awareness on the cross-cutting issues like HIV/AIDS, environment, food security and preventive health, and sponsor the children for their primary, secondary, university and vocational training. The project goals is to contribute to a jus
t and safe community caring for the wellbeing of Orphans and Vulnerable Children (OVC), Children Affected by Armed Forces (CAAF) and their families. The project is designed to support the children in their livelihood and prepare them for a better future. T
he purpose of the project is to empower the local partner to facilitate holistic development for OVCs and their families. The project will integrate a component on former child soldiers, who were abducted during the war of the Lord?s Resistance Army in Nor
thern Uganda. Through the project, the capacity of their families and communities will be improved to enable them protect and respond to the basic needs of the children. The expected positive changes in the target beneficiaries are an empowered community w
ith improved living conditions of their households through education, increased income levels for the families, improved food production and attitude changes in Child Protection. Former sponsored children are responsible people in their communities. Others
 have stable employment due to their education and others have engaged themselves in viable economic activities that enable them to support their lives.</narrative>
