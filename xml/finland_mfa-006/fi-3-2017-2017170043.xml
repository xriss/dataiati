  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="FI">Tunapanda Institute will work to create digital learning experiences for girls and boys from the community of Kibera as well as other communities in East Africa. The purpose of the project is to provide young women and men in low-income areas of East Afric
a with skills that will bring them into the digital age.  Most young people in Kibera and other communities lack awareness of how powerful IT skills can be and the various technological tools that are available to assist individuals in their personal and p
rofessional development. The project will focus on events to be held in March in conjunction with the Code Bus and will include provisions to ensure a continuing impact. By combining computer programming and music using Sonic Pi Software participants of th
e workshops will be introduced to information technology and computer programming and allow them to begin their journey into technological literacy. The event will simultaneously celebrate Finland?s 100th birthday by engaging with local musicians and artis
ts to participate in an event for the Kibera community. Tunapanda will also assist with the organization and execution of events related to Nairobi Innovation Week.  Continuing impact will be achieved by digitizing the workshop course materials which will 
then be used on Tunapanda?s open eLearning platform to allow the content to reach a wider audience.The main activities of the project will consist of in-person training training and the creation of digital materials that will assist other learners from var
ious communities in achieving the same knowledge and skills. The project will ensure that that Codebus project will have a continuous effect on the beneficiaries and will not be a one off event that lacks long term positive benefits for the communityThe pr
oject will target young people aged 12 - 25 especially girls who lack access to ICT education and would like to learn some skills related to the field which can help them to plan for a related career and earn income.  The beneficiaries will be both 1) stud
ents who receive in-person training through workshops hosted by Tunapanda Institute and the Codebus team and 2) students who can access the skills through a digitized curriculum that is created by Tunapanda team members.</narrative>
