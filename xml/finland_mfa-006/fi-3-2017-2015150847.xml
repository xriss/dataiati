  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project improves collaboration among trade unions of water services sector in the Andean region and Central America, and support their efforts to stop privatization of water and sanitation services. PSI together with its member unions support the idea 
of public water services as a basic human right that must be available to all people regardless of their ability to pay for it. PSI aims at getting right to water included in the national constitutions in all Latin American countries. The biggest challenge
s water sector unions have are the wide-spread intentions to privatize public water companies and the free trade agreements on services. A more recent challenge to sector&#x2019;s workers is the fast pollution and exhaustion of water resources and its consequen
ces to the workers. During the previous project phase in the Andean region PSI together with its member unions managed to achieve many remarkable changes, for example in the fight against privatization, increasing the unions&#x2019; capacity to act, creating al
liances and networks, and improving cooperation among unions. Thanks to the project, also many NGOs started to take labor rights and Decent Work issues in their own agenda. This project promotes the rights, not only of water sector workers and trade unions
, but also of all citizens. Specifically, it defends the rights of the poorest as in general privatization of water services has impacted most the poorest people not able to pay market price for water. As a result of this project, water sector unions will 
have regional joint strategy to strengthen trade unions in the sector and to improve public water and sewage services. Trade unions have established alliances with NGOs and energy sector public trade unions, which gives them more visibility, credibility an
d power. Unions have better knowledge on new ways of privatization and are able to affront them. The direct beneficiaries of this project are water sector workers and trade unions in the Andean region and Central America. Indirectly the project benefits al
l consumers of public water services. The project is implemented by Public Services International (PSI) together with its member unions in the target countries.</narrative>
