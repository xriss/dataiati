   <narrative xml:lang="EN">F.a: Strengthening of Trade Unions in Commerce Sector</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project strengthens the capacity to defend workers&apos; rights of commerce sector trade unions in Colombia and Peru. In Latin America, large multinational chains such as Cencosud, Exito, Falabella, Ripley, Zara and Sodimac dominate retail markets. All thes
e companies are known for their anti-union policies. In commerce sector, wages are poor, precarious work is very common, unions are relatively weak and their ability to bargain collectively is low. Multinational companies operating in this sector commonly 
don&apos;t comply with international agreements on workers&apos; rights, their own internal guidelines or the international framework agreements they have signed with the trade union movement. In many countries in Latin America, governments&apos; interest and ability to 
monitor companies&apos; activities is low. Workers&apos; legal rights are commonly violated in all the targeted enterprises and in both target countries. The project intends to respond to these challenges by strengthening trade union unity, creating union networks a
t regional and national level, and taking up proactively cases of violations to workers&apos; rights. The project aims at strengthening first commerce sector trade unions in Colombia and Peru through affiliation campaigns and training, and then regional network
ing in order for the unions to get concrete tools to negotiate with multinational companies and defend the workers. As a result of this project, Colombian commerce sector union has strong representation in the biggest commerce chains, the union has started
 collective bargaining with the companies and the negotiation capabilities of union leaders and shop stewards are improved. In Peru, commerce sector unions have better bargaining capacity and their membership has increased. Unions have started social dialo
gue with the companies to force them to respect labor rights and agreements they have signed. Unions have also created regional networks and joint strategies. The beneficiaries of this project are 39 000 commerce sector workers in Peru and Colombia. The pr
oject is implemented by UNI Global Union together with its commerce sector member unions in Colombia and Peru.</narrative>
