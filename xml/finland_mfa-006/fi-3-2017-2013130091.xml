  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Women in Somalia are generally excluded from the decision making processes both at national and local level. This undermines women?s rights and has many negative consequences to their lives in general. African Care and its local partner organisation?s; Ban
adir Women Development Association (BWDO) project aims to provide local women of Southwestern Somalia with good understanding of women?s rights and skills to influence and participate decision making as well as peace promotion. To support this the project 
seeks to evoke public discussion about women?s role and participation in decision making and peacebuilding. The project also aims at supporting cooperation and organization between women while continuing to build the local partners&apos; capacity. The focus of 
the project is on the work done locally as the local reality has the biggest effects to women?s everyday lives. In the long run the project aims at increasing gender equality and democracy in Somalia. The project is based on the pilot phase in 2014 and the
 ongoing continuation phase in 2015-2017. The project partners would like to continue the project for another three year phase (2018-2020) as it has achieved tangible results during its first years of implementation yet there is dire need to continue to bu
ilding women?s capacity and influence in decision making and peacebuilding and widen the sphere of the project?s influence to other parts of Southwestern Somalia. During 2018 and then again in 2019 15 more women of those already trained by the project woul
d be trained to work as focal points in 5 new towns in Southwestern Somalia. The focal points will be responsible for forming local women?s groups in the towns and train them on women?s rights and participation in decision making and peace promotion. Subse
quently the groups with the help of the focal point carry out local activities which include meetings with the local authorities local events and media outreach on the thematic area. The final sum-up project seminars would be organised in Somalia and Finla
nd at the end of 2020. For more information see section 5. on project document.</narrative>
