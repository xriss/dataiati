   <narrative xml:lang="EN">F.a: Scaling up and scaling out community seed systems to influence policy reform towards farmers? seed rights</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project is complementary to work done by ZIMSOFF and UNAC (Mozambique, through their Manica Provincial Union Ucama) to achieve smallholder farmer seed rights through enhancing seed sovereignty in Africa in the face of the harmonisation of seed laws vi
a seed protocols under COMESA (Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa) and SADC (Southern Africa Development Community), in the and is in particular a continuation of the 15003AFR project Siemenpuu-Kansalaisliikkeiden yhteistyosaatio sr funded proje
ct in which the development was started of a collaborative program between ZIMSOFF and UNAC (Mozambique) to support and strengthen community based and farmer managed seed systems. During that phase ZIMSOFF and UNAC held exchange visits in both Zimbabwe and
 Mozambique to promote sharing of information, and contact farmers (mostly women) were identified to play a divulgating role, furthermore a regional workshop in Zimbabwe was held on the harmonization of seed laws and to develop strategies involving the con
tact farmers, and it was decided to follow up in a process between ZIMSOFF and UNAC to capture on and enhance good practices, as well as to save and exchange available local varieties. The current project then aims to scale up and out existing community se
ed systems to influence policy reform towards farmers? seed rights. In order to deepen understanding on seeds systems, this project will organize baseline assessment of diversity on identified good practices of community seed systems in Zimbabwe and Mozamb
ique. These examples will be used to link up the voice of the farmers? organizations to influence change horizontally and vertically from the grassroots. The project will then also organise workshops for farmer to farmer training on agroecology with specif
ic emphasise on local seed systems, to raise awareness and to transform local thinking towards community seed systems that is rooted in local knowledge and ecological diversity. Towards the same objective field days, seed and food fairs will be organised. 
Members will be supported to improve access to seed diversity and securing availability through e.g. household and community seed banks, whilst linking also community and seed programmes. www.esaff.org</narrative>
