  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project works with promoting human rights for one of the most vulnerable groups people with disabilities in this case Hard of Hearing children. The purpose of the project is to strengthen the right to education and development for Hard of Hearing Child
ren in the city of Cochabamba Bolivia. The project has three strategies: 1) education and capacity buildning 2) information and raising awareness and 3) advocacy. Many Hard of Hearing children go to school under conditions that weakens their access to educ
ation. Hearing loss is still an unknown disability in Bolivia. Schools and teachers lack the knowledge and pedagogical tools to meet the need of Hard of Hearing pupils. Hard of Hearing children go to school without hearing aids or in inadequate acoustical 
environments. Many parents of Hard of Hearing children need knowledge and capacities to support their child&apos;s development and demand their rights. The authorities have taken steps to improve the situation for people with disabilities but they aren&apos;t enough
. The project is based on the promotion of human rights. The project educates teachers schools and authorities on the rights and needs of Hard of Hearing children. The project arranges teacher training in pedagogical methods for Hard of Hearing children as
 well as improving the sound environment in class rooms in 10 schools. The project arranges education and capacity buildning activities to parents of Hard of Hearing children as well as raising the general public&apos;s awarness of Hard of Hearing issues. The p
roject is a cooperation between the organization for parents of Hard of Hearing children APANH and the Finnish Federation of Swedish Speaking Hard of Hearing.</narrative>
