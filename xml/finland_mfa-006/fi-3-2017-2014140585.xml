   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Demo Finland/NIMD project in Myanmar to support democratic transition, that started in 2014, focuses on strengthening the democratic role of political parties in a cross-party setting at the regional/state level by enhancing democratic skills, knowledge an
d praxis. This is done through three Myanmar School of Politics (MySoP) core courses in a year. The core courses are 4-week-long and all the parties in the particular region/state, send their participants into the course. Through the MySoP, politicians gai
n practical experience in policy development, public consultation, strategic policy planning, debating, speech writing and multiparty dialogue. This contributes to a culture of dialogue amongst political parties, leading to the facilitation of dialogue. Mo
reover, a permanent Multiparty Dialogue Platform at the region/state level will be created with the help of the project.MySoP alumnis will receive specific support through tailor made workshops, focusing on enhancing skills in debating, advocacy and planni
ng policies etc. Additionally, peer exchange between Finnish and Myanmar politicians will create further support on multiparty co-operation on the basis of experience sharing and mutual learning.Outcomes of the project 2016-2020:1. Safe space for dialogue 
btw. all relevant political actors2. Political actors voice and monitor citizen&apos;s interests3. Improved capacity of local partners4. Increased interest in consulting, collaborating, harmonizing, being responsive and a sense of trust and mutual understanding
 among and btw political and civic actors The achievement of the outcomes and results are monitored against indicators throughout the project. The direct target groups are the state level politicians taking part in the MySoP courses, but also the political
 parties as institutions. In the end, the people of Myanmar are the final beneficiaries of improved governance and democracy in their country.NIMD and Demo Finland are currently implementing the programme directly through our joint country based country re
presentative and supporting staff, building on the work of the pilot phase in 2015. NIMD and Demo Finland will further develop a strategy to set-up a country office or identify an impartial, skilled and efficient local partner organisation for future imple
mentation ? which would also strengthen the sustainability of the action.</narrative>
