   <narrative xml:lang="EN">From Stereotypes to Covering Global Interdependencies ? Training by Journalists for Journalists</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">A few major international news agencies have dominated foreign news reporting for a long time. At the same time the number of domestic foreign correspondents has decreased dramatically. When media largely relies on the same news agencies in reporting the n
ews coverage becomes less diverse. The Finnish media coverage on developing countries is dominantly negative and simplified and mainly covers issues like war. At the same time positive stories and articles that would offer a wider perspective and are absen
t from the media.Through this project we will affect the way people see the world through media. We are developing the Finnish journalists&apos; skills and ability to cover development issues in a versatile and comprehensive manner by offering them practice-ori
ented training as well as through producing a guidebook and organizing a communication campaign and public events. The training and events will be organized and planned by experienced Finnish journalists and media experts. Covering issues related to climat
e change for instance is more appealing to a journalist if they are presented by an experienced colleague who can provide practical advice and tools to do the work. The top-level project objective is to increase Finns&apos; understanding of and interest in deve
lopment issues through pluralistic quality journalism. After the project:? The participants know the Sustainable Development Goals as well as the three dimensions of development and are familiar with global interdependencies.? Finnish journalists know wher
e to get contacts and information and how to sell their stories to editors and media houses.? Finnish journalists have an international network and understand the causes and consequences of the refugee crisis.The primary target group of the project is Finn
ish journalists. In addition to media consumers and the change agents within media the project beneficiaries are Finnish media houses. The project partners include the Finnish Lifelong Learning Foundation F-Secure Startup Refugees Haaga-Helia as well as ou
r stakeholders namely media organizations educational institutions and journalists? associations.This one-year project has been granted 101 000 euro as government support.</narrative>
