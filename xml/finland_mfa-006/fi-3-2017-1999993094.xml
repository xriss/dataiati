   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Training in Chemical Weapons Verification? project for years 2018-2020 is provided by the Finnish Institute for Verification of the Chemical Weapons Convention VERIFIN. It concentrates on strengthening of development countries? laboratory capacity and secu
rity by training chemists and experts from developing countries. The purpose of the training is to strengthen knowledge and skills in analytical chemistry for the verification of chemical weapons and further the implementation of the Chemical Weapons Conve
ntion (CWC) nationally. The project aims at enhancement of laboratories safety and know-how of chemists who in turn can serve as advisors trainers and specialists in their respected countries. Furthermore the project strengthens expertise in the field of f
ood security and good governance. In the developing countries there remains demand for laboratory security pharmaceutical environmental and arms control training which will have an effect in sustainable development. By increasing awareness of the CWC and s
ound management of chemicals sustainable development will be increased nationally regionally and globally. Learned expertise can be utilized for improvement of environmental analysis or increasing of food security. VERIFIN will continue collaboration with 
the laboratory in Kenya and begin cooperation with Nepal. Both are Finland?s long-term partner countries. VERIFIN will also continue providing training to participants from countries listed in the OECD/DAC list of ODA recipients. VERIFIN the National Autho
rity of Finland has organized internationally recognized high-quality training for chemists and experts from developing countries since 1990. Three year project totals 1 350 000 euros. During years 2015-17 the participating laboratories from Kenya and Ethi
opia received vast training on analytical chemistry. Gained skills can be used broadly on different kinds of analytics (environment food safety pharmaceutical). Training supported strengthening of laboratory capacity (e.g. sample preparation identifying ch
emicals using spectral libraries increased equipment hours). VERIFIN?s courses for National Authorities concentrate on implementation of the CWC in practice as well as on legislation. On courses on analytical techniques the participants learned to utilize 
different analytical techniques in identifying unknown chemicals. The learned skills can be utilized in environmental and food analysis.</narrative>
