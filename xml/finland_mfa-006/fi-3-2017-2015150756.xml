  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In the Burundian prisons arbitrary arrest, prolonged pre-trial detention and improper handling of cases are common. The judicial authorities and the police often do not know how to deal with the cases of minors properly and they often prevent the access of
 the families of detainees and lawyers&apos; organizations to the detainees. Also the poverty of the accused, as well as the judiciary lack of resources, corruption and inefficiency hamper or prevent the investigation of legal cases is, the use of defenders of 
witnesses, the pre-trial detention legally staying within the limits of time, as well as the appeal process is operational. Prisoners and detainees conditions are poor, even life-threatening and minor prisoners are in particularly vulnerable position, as t
hey have not been separated from the other prisoners. What represents a positive development, however, is that in April 2013 was adopted a new Criminal Procedure Code, which has taken more account of the prosecution service, pre-trial investigation and coe
rcive measures, legal aid, the weaknesses of the right to prosecution of the prosecutor and the accused. The main objective of the project is to contribute to the implementation legal rights of the prisoners, particularly minor prisoners. The project&apos;s mai
n target group consists of the prisoners in pretrial detention in Bururi, Bubanza and Muronga. The project aims to provide legal advice and assistance to minor prisoners (in particular, the poor, the illiterate prisoners, albinos, batwa, as well as prisone
rs, which litigation is significantly delayed). In addition, the project will benefit from a wider target other prisons, prisoners, prison and judicial authorities as well as AREDDHOn volunteers who have legal training during the project. Association pour 
la Recherche sur l&apos;Environnement, la Democratie et les Droits de l&apos;Homme au Burundi (AREDDHO) is founded by lawyers in April 2012 in Bujumbura, whose work focuses particularly on children and the promotion of the rights of prisoners.</narrative>
