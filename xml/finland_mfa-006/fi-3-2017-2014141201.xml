   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In spite of the revival of the India Climate Justice (ICJ) and the work made by other groups, climate change has not become a mainstream political issue in India and neither do the affected communities perceive it yet as a life-threatening chain of extreme
 weather events. In the present project the aim will be to reach out to more groups and people to strengthen peoples? understanding and response to the interrelationship between the prevailing energy and capital intensive economic development with the clim
ate crisis. Efforts will include studies and collective campaigning with emphasis on thermal power and coal mines (mainly Maharashtra), hydro power (mainly Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Northern Bengal and Sikkim), large-scale wind and biomass energy projects 
(mainly in Maharastra and Karnataka) and also the methods of adaptation and disaster readiness of the communities in mountain areas. One important task will be to exchange information and experience with groups/movements engaged in similar programmes in ot
her parts of the globe. The project is expected to generate new knowledge on the impacts of large-scale energy projects, foster the climate justice movement in India, contribute to international networking, as well as empower communities for adaptation to 
climate change on the local level. Rural Volunteers Centre (RVC) will function as the host organization and legal holder of this project, but the project involves support to the same network, India Climate Justice (ICJ) forum. The project will be implement
ed by a group based in North-East India, with a long track record of working on climate and natural disaster issues. Rural Volunteers Centre (RVC) was established in 1993. Its office is located in Akajan, Arunachal Pradesh. The main goals of the organizati
on are based on the Millennium Development Goals. The environmental work focuses on empowering vulnerable communities of upper Brahmaputra River basin towards preserving natural resources, adaptation to climate change and address risks of disasters. RVC ha
s also participated in the NGO Forum on ADB by undertaking a study on Environmental Impact Assessment processes and climate change. RVC cooperates through several regional and international networks such as South Asian Network for Dam, River and People (SA
NDRP), International River Network (IRN), and India Climate Justice (ICJ) forum. It has about 40 full-time employees, of whom 11 are women.</narrative>
