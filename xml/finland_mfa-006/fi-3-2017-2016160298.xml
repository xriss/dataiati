   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The main goal of the project is to increase Finnish teachers? knowledge of human rights (HR) to provide them with tested pedagogical tools for teaching HR and thus increase their abilities to do human rights education (HRE). The project is of great importa
nce right now as the new core curriculum for basic education to be implemented from August 2016 onwards places more emphasis on HRE.Feedback from teachers indicates that teaching HR as a part of everyday classroom activities is considered challenging due t
o the complexity of the subject. This project will thus focus on spreading awareness of the ihmisoikeudet.net online portal for HRE as well as supporting the teachers? work with online materials. The target group includes teachers of different subjects and
 school levels teacher students and officials at different government educational bodies.The project is based on the long-term work in HRE by the FLHR and other CSOs. It is a follow-up project for the ihmisoikeudet.net project where the portal was revised 
in 2015. We are now applying for funding to enable the continuation of this important work. According to previous experiences the key tools to increase awareness of the portal and to expand the number of visitors include reaching inspiring and supporting t
he target group. It is time to move on to a new level in the advertising of the portal and work with the target group on a grassroots level. The HR based approach to development is at the core of ihmisoikeudet.net portal. HRE offers new possibilities to se
e the world in a broader context and to explore issues linked to development policy and social justice. The existing material for the project has been created with the support of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. This follow-up project considerably adds to
 the sustainability of the results from the previous project.During the first phase of the project the communication content and pedagogical aspects of the website was developed in order to better serve teachers and teachers-to-be. With these tools teacher
s are now able to integrate human rights training as part of their everyday teaching work.A total of 53 000 euro government support has been granted to this project by MoFA.</narrative>
