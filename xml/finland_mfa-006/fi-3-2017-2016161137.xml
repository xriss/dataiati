   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The communities in arid rural areas of Kenya are in need of holistic development for community member&apos;s wellbeing and families? sustainable development. While the young people are left without education possibilities and employment, many of them end up in 
the streets of big cities and fall into a lifestyle of substance abuse and crime. The culturally harmful customs and gender inequality hinders girls? educational possibilities. Communities? wellbeing is developed holistically; families, children and young 
people are trained in human rights and gender equality issues, and the project has a strong emphasis on psychosocial support according to needs. The child protection policy is developed and monitored in practice. The project reaches out to the young people
 in Nairobi slum, Kawangare, and offers a wholesome alternative for their lifestyle of crime and substance abuse. Environment conservation awareness is created on all levels of society; in schools, among farmers, and households, as the more efficient and e
nvironmentally beneficial methods of farming, water harvesting and use, and fuel are introduced. Educationally the project ensures access to school for hundreds of children, including disabled, who traditionally are culturally shunned. The project goal is 
to create impact on wellbeing of children and youth, their families and the whole communities, by responding to cultural, environmental and social challenges. The project purpose is to equip families and communities with skills and resources for sustainabl
e development of their own wellbeing, to provide access to quality education to vulnerable children, and to take care of their environment as a source of livelihood. The project results in children?s increased access to schools as the parents are able to p
rovide their children?s school fees. Awareness about environmental conservation, WASH, tree planting and health issues increases and the social standing of the disabled, girls and other vulnerable groups strengthens. The project benefits children, youth, t
heir families, farmers, and the communities as a whole through a long-term impact. The churches also benefit by gaining recognized positive social influence in their communities. Fida partners with Full Gospel Churches of Kenya (FGCK).</narrative>
