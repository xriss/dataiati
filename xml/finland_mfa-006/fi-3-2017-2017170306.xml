   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The main objective of the project is to promote the right to participate in decision-making on the environment and health of the Kenyan coastal residents who have suffered the harms of the mining industry. The project also seeks to obtain information on ma
tters related to the environment and health. Legal focus of the project is the right to health and a clean environment.The project may contributes to Kenya&apos;s coastal local communities&apos; participation rights in decision-making concerning the environment and 
access to environmental information. In the short term, the project empowers local communities and residents, particularly the human rights and environment defenders trained in the project to promote more effectively the right to health and a clean environ
ment. In the longer term, the project contributes to a better consideration of environmental and human rights on a larger scale, for example, when granting construction permits for new enterprises.

The project target group is are communities suffering fro
m miming industry in the Kenyan coastal counties in Mombasa, Lamu, Kilifi, Kwale and Taita Taveta. The beneficiaries are the communities who live closest to the mining industry and / or most affected by the environmental and health effects caused by extrac
tive industries. Most of the beneficiaries are farmers, but there are also fishermen and factory workers. In particular, the project takes into account children and pregnant women, because they are most vulnerable for the harms caused by the the extractive
 industries. Indirect beneficiaries are the public authorities and non-state actors that influence on the environmental governance.

Center for Justice, Governance and Environmental Action (CJGEA) was established in 2009 and was officially registered in 20
12. It is a Community Based Organisations. The organization was founded with the aim to promote and protect the rights of local communities in a situation where companies started to gain ground in the exploitation of natural resources along the coast of Ke
nya. The organization aims mainly to promote the protection of the environment and the respect for human rights, for example by information work , litigation, advocacy and campaigning. Part of the strength of the association is strong ownership of the loca
l communities in supporting the activities of the Organization.</narrative>
