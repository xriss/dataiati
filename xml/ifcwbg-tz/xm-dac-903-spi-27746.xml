   <narrative xml:lang="EN">DDespite the country&#xE2;?s considerable mineral resources, the mining sector in Tanzania is concentrated in the north with the south overlooked since colonial times.  A number of mining juniors, however, have started to explore the south. A successful exploration could have considerable demonstration effects and help the development of a new gold district in Tanzania with the potential of spurring economic growth in the south through infrastructure development and employment generation.

The Project is in an early exploration phase so its developmental impacts are limited in scope at this stage. However, the project is located in an under-developed part of the country and outside of key centers of commercial activity and will likely contribute significantly to the area&#xE2;?s development should it transition into a full operating mine. The following development impacts that are anticipated at that point, include: 
&#xE2;?&#xA2;	an increase in formal employment locally; 
&#xE2;?&#xA2;	improved infrastructure and access to services in the District; 
&#xE2;?&#xA2;	economic opportunities through downstream linkages for service providers; and
&#xE2;?&#xA2;	payments to government in the form of royalties and tax.

During the early exploration phase the following indicators will be tracked to follow the project&#xE2;?s progress relevant to development impact: (i) finalization of drilling program, initiation and undertaking of a feasibility study (subject to continued exploration success) and conversion to a mining license (subject to positive feasibility study); (ii) number of local employees; and (iii) completion of Social and Environmental Impact Assessment (SEIA).espite the country&apos;s considerable mineral resources, the mining sector in Tanzania is concentrated in the north with the south overlooked since colonial times.

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Helio Resource Corp (Helio or the Company) is a Vancouver-based, TSX -V listed (HRC.V), mineral exploration company focused on exploring and developing gold and base metal deposits. Through its 100% owned subsidiary BAFEX Tanzania Ltd., Helio can earn a 100% interest, subject to a 2% royalty (which can be reduced to 1% through a cash payment prior to commencement of commercial production) in five contiguous licences, which cover a 35km strike length of the Saza Shear Zone in the southern part of Tanzania. These licenses constitute Helios main project, the SMP Gold Project (the Project).  Since June 2006, the Company has drill-tested thirteen targets, ten of which are hosted by the Saza Shear Zone.  All thirteen targets have intersected bedrock-hosted gold mineralization, the most advanced being the Kenge and Porcupine Targets.  Helio also has a portfolio of earlier stage projects in Namibia.

Helio is seeking IFCs engagement to help finance the Companys exploration activities in line with industry best practice in environmental and social sustainability.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">The SMP property (238km2) covers almost 35 km of strike length along the Saza Shear Zone, the primary gold-bearing structure of the Lupa Goldfields, southwestern Tanzania where 6 colonial-era gold mines were intermittently active between 1930 and 1960. During the colonial period, the Lupa Goldfield was the second largest gold producing area in Tanzania.  Helios license area cuts across three villages, namely Ngombe (approximately 1,000 people), Patamela (approximately 2,000 people) and Saza (approximately 5,000 people); the current exploration program does not indicate that relocation will be required if a mine is developed in the future.</narrative>
