   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Peak Resources Limited (Peak) is an Australian junior mining company focused on advancing its wholly owned Ngualla Rare Earth Project (Ngualla or the Project) in south western Tanzania. The Ngualla deposit was first discovered by Peak in 2010 and after several years of exploration drilling, Peak completed a Preliminary Feasibility Study (PFS) in March 2014 to assess the potential for future mine development and associated beneficiation, recovery and separation plants and infrastructure. Results indicate that the Ngualla deposit provides sufficient ore for a potential 40+ year mine life. The operation, as contemplated in the PFS, is expected to produce ~10,000 metric tonnes per annum of separated high purity rare earth oxides. Peak is now proceeding to complete a Bankable Feasibility Study (BFS), the final milestone to confirm the commercial viability of the deposit. Construction is forecast to commence in mid-2016, with commissioning to follow 18 months later.  Ngualla has a JORC compliant mineral resource of 195 million tonnes (MT) at 2.26 percent Rare Earth Oxide (REO) grade (4.4 MT of contained REO), including mineral reserves from a core 21.6 MT weathered Bastnaesite Zone at 4.54 percent REO for 982,000 tonnes of contained REO.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed investment is an early-stage investment preceding final feasibility studies to confirm the commercial viability of the deposit. Generally, exploration projects have limited near-term development impact but even at this early stage, the proposed investment has shown tangible benefits for the surrounding community.  The Project provides direct employment and training to the village of Ngwala, a rural community, in a region where formal employment opportunities are scarce and poverty levels are high. The vast majority of employees are Tanzanian nationals, most of which are from Ngwala, and are employed based on a rotation schedule. The community also benefits from a variety of community programs the Company has implemented, mainly in the educational field, and the purchase of local products.   Should exploration lead to mine development and production, the developmental impact from this Project could be significant, in particular given its potentially long mine life.  The mine could generate significant revenues for the government, largely in the form of taxes and royalties. The development of a rare earth project would also help diversify the mining sector which is currently predominantly driven by gold production.  Additional future development impacts include an important demonstration effect of how large-scale mining may be developed in accordance with good international industry practices, environmental and social and transparency standards.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Project is located in southwest Tanzania, 55 kilometers west of the main north-south trunk road. An 827 kilometer long bitumen highway and the TAZARA railway connect the city of Mbeya, 150 kilometers south of the site, to the deep water sea port of Dar es Salaam. The closest nearby village to the Project is the community of Ngwala which lies approximately 4.5 kilometers south of the Ngualla deposit. The village of Ngwala has over 5,000 inhabitants.</narrative>
