   <narrative xml:lang="EN">As previously disclosed (in    Project ID 9579   ), the project was to establish an exclusive 16-bed lodge on the boundary of the Tarangire national Park in Northern Tanzania. This lodge would form part of a 35,000 acre private wildlife consrvation area that would be established as part of the project (the Lolkisale Conservation Area).      This project has very strong developmental impact because of the following reasons: The local community is involved as a major shareholder, a significant area will be conserved in terms of diversity of flora and fauna, additional income will be generated for the Lolkisale village from royalties which will be directed to community development programs and employment benefits will be generated.    The additional component incorporated in this SPI has the purpose of developing and implementing a comprehensive Integrated Conservation Management Plan (ICMP). The ICMP will aim, inter alia, to clarify land tenure policy, strengthen stakeholder relations, mitigate tourism impacts and develop solutions to current overgrazing problems.  The implementation of the ICMP will include hiring and training field staff, community counterparts, establish ranger posts and established community-based conservation processes and programs. In this way the MSP will catalyze global environmental benefit from a project that already aims to generate significant development benefits.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project site is on the eastern boundary of the Tarangire National Park on Boundary Hill, a small basalt outcrop overlooking the park. The core site covers 100 acres and was contributed by the LVC as their equity. The project will however operate in a broader area of 140 square kilometres which has been set aside as the Lolkisale Conservation Area and which borders upon the Tarangire national Park.</narrative>
