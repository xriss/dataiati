  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed project involves an equity investment in CRDB Bank in Tanzania. The bank plans to raise new equity to fund growth and comply with anticipated changes to the banking regulations relating to capital adequacy.   CRDB is the largest commercial bank in Tanzania by asset size. Formerly known as the Cooperative and Rural Development Bank, the Bank was privatized in 1996 when DANIDA (Danish International Development Agency) took a 30% stake through the Danish Investment Fund (DIF) which remains the largest shareholder of CRDB with a 21.5% stake. The Bank listed on the Dar es Salaam Stock Exchange in 2009. CRDB is a universal commercial bank with a full range of corporate, SME and retail products and services, with significant market share in corporate and agri-finance. CRDB is also a major microfinance player in Tanzania through a wholly owned subsidiary that offers banking and advisory services to agricultural cooperative societies and Savings and Credit Cooperative Societies (SACCOS) in the country.  In addition, CRDB has a fully owned subsidiary in Burundi, which was established in 2013 and is the Banks only operation outside Tanzania.  IFC and the African Capitalization Fund managed by IFCs subsidiary The Asset Management Company (AMC) plan to invest up to US$ 37.7 million by participating in the Banks forthcoming rights issue. IFC will invest up to US$15 million and AMCs up to US$ 22.7m in the new issue.</narrative>

Specifically, expected development impacts will include: -	Improved access to finance to SMEs: the capital injection will enable the Bank to extend its reach and coverage of SMEs in East Africa. In turn, increased lending to SMEs will generate new jobs, a key driver of poverty reduction in the region.  -	Demonstration effect:  By taking an early lead in enhancing its capital base ahead of expected regulatory changes, the Bank will set the pace and demonstrate investor appetite to support the banking industry in meeting the new capital requirements -	Improved financial performance:  with an increased equity base and planned growth in lending, the Bank is expected to deliver better results in terms of profitability and operational efficiency.</narrative>
