   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Contribution to MENA Regional CVA initiatives</narrative>
  </title>
  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The MENA region has been dominated by a number of protracted and on-going conflicts, contributing to, along with other factors such as food insecurity, large scale displacement, a growing migrant population and over-stretched host communities. Social and political upheaval has degraded the existing safety nets and impeded further development, leaving many without access to essential services and reducing resilience to external risks. It is key that the Movement in MENA is supported to continue developing and innovating in terms of disaster management, including CVA which is essential to assist people affected by crisis. In such, there a clear recognition of the on-going investments and effort to enhance the capacities to deliver CVA by Movement partners in the MENA region.
Cash &amp; Vouchers Based Assistance (CVA)1 is well-recognized as an appropriate way of providing humanitarian assistance. The recent years have seen a dramatic increase in the use of CVA, from 2015 to 2016 the amount of cash disbursed globally increased 40%. At the World Humanitarian Summit in 2016, many of the largest humanitarian agencies made a set of commitments, as part of the &#xE2;&#x20AC;&#x153;Grand Bargain&#xE2;&#x20AC;&#x9D;, including commitments to increase the use of CVA.
The International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement (RCM) is also committed to scaling up CVA. In 2017 a Movement Strategic Framework as well as an ambitious Roadmap was developed.
BRC is looking to provide funding towards two specific outputs of the MENA Regional Cash Plan, as well as a general contribution to the revised Plan of Action (as of Sept. 2020):
- Regional Cash Coordinator position (under Output 1.2 Enhanced Regional Cash Coordination)
- Regional Cash Centre of Excellence (CoE (under Output 2.1: Enhanced Regional Cash Capacity).
