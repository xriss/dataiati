  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Migration and displacement within, from and to Myanmar is linked to a diverse range of complex drivers, and in many cases results in critical humanitarian needs. Myanmar is one of the top five countries of origin globally for refugees, with large numbers of refugees hosted in neighboring countries and across the region. Some of these refugees are starting to return, in both spontaneous and organized processes, and the prospect of large-scale refugee repatriation remains from Bangladesh, Thailand and beyond.
&#xC2;&#xA0;
Myanmar also hosts large numbers of Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) fleeing conflict, violence, persecution and disaster. An estimated 241,000 IDPs &#xE2;&#x20AC;&#x201C; of which 77 percent are women and children &#xE2;&#x20AC;&#x201C; remain in camps in Rakhine, Kachin, Shan and Kayin States. Recent initiatives of the Government and the humanitarian community are paving the way for durable solutions to internal displacement and the &quot;closing&quot; of IDP camps. Myanmar is also the largest country of origin for migrants in the Greater Mekong Sub-Region, with the vast majority of more than 4 million migrants travelling to Thailand, China, Malaysia and Singapore. Many migrant workers are undocumented and in &quot;irregular status&quot;, with regular deportations back to Myanmar. There are also considerable humanitarian concerns related to trafficking (within and from Myanmar), people smuggling, extortion, debt bondage and physical exploitation. Statelessness and migration is also a critical humanitarian challenge.
&#xC2;&#xA0;
In September 2018, an MRCS national workshop was held on &quot;Strategic Approaches to Addressing Humanitarian Needs in the Context of Migration and Displacement&quot;. This was the first time MRCS convened a national humanitarian workshop on migration and displacement. The first two days of the workshop included participants and presentations from Kachin, Rakhine, Shan, Mon, Kayin and Thanantharyi, on humanitarian needs linked to migration and displacement, challenges in addressing those needs and recommendations for stronger MRCS action. The third day of the workshop was reserved for a discussion with MRCS management on how to strengthen MRCS action in migration and displacement. The workshop resulted in a 10-point MRCS Action Plan on Migration and Displacement, to be achieved within two years</narrative>
