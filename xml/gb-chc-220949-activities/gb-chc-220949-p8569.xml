   <narrative xml:lang="EN">On February 1st 2021 a military intervention took place in which the Myanmar Armed Forces (MAF) arrested the Union President, State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi, senior leaders of the NLD, as well as parliamentarians and high ranking governmental representatives, such as Chief Ministers. This was in response to allegations of electoral fraud in the elections that took place in November 2020.&#xC2;&#xA0;The MAF subsequently announced a one-year state of emergency, during which the Commander-in-Chief (CiC) would assume full &#xE2;&#x20AC;&#x153;legislative, judicial and executive powers&#xE2;&#x20AC;&#x9D;.
Since the military took control on the 1st of February, mass protests have been taking place across the country.&#xC2;&#xA0;A campaign of civil disobedience and labour strikes has begun following calls from activist groups and senior NLD officials for peaceful resistance. Beginning with health workers on the 3rd of February, the campaign of civil disobedience now includes the majority of public sector workers as well as students and the private sector. In response to the growing protest movement, the police and MAF have enacted a number of countermeasures. These have included internet and social blackouts, curfews, and the pursuit of arrests and criminal sentences against protesters.&#xC2;&#xA0;
The police and military&apos;s response has gradually escalated, with tear gas, water cannons, stun grenades and even live ammunition being used against protesters. On Sunday 28th of February, the UN reported that at least 18 protesters had been killed in a single day.&#xC2;&#xA0;
