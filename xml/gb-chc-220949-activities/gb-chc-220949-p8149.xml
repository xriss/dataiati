  </title>
  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Since mid-April, tensions between Palestinians &#xE2;&#x20AC;&#x201C; many of whom protested against the longstanding threats of eviction by Jewish settlers &#xE2;&#x20AC;&#x201C; and Israelis in East Jerusalem resulted in street violence. Fighting escalated following the intervention of the Palestinian militant group Hamas, firing rockets into Israel, and airstrikes by the Israel Defense Forces on Gaza. At least 119 people have died in Gaza, including around 30 children, and 800 have been wounded. Eight have been killed in Israel. Humanitarian needs in Gaza were already high across sectors prior to conflict escalation, with protection assistance and access to health services being a priority.
PRCS is the leading humanitarian organization providing emergency medical services (EMS) to victims of violence and conflict across all of occupied Palestine during this crisis, as it is during all of Palestine&#xE2;&#x20AC;&#x2122;s crises. The EMS assistance is provided through different centres, and the emergency advanced medical posts, as well as at the PRCS hospitals.
On 10 May, PRCS activated its central operations room in Gaza, and all branches, centres, staff, and volunteers have been alerted and teams ready to respond as needed. The current capacity responding to the increasing cases of casualties includes 28 ambulances with 420 emergency medical personnel and volunteers, and currently, the Al-Quds hospital is being prepared to receive cases and to utilize its operation rooms and intensive care units, when required. As fighting and attacks across Gaza escalate, the scale and nature of impact are widening, affecting nearly all of Gaza&#xE2;&#x20AC;&#x2122;s civilian population. As of 14 May, PRCS has dealt with a total of 572 injuries and 55 fatalities. On 14 May alone PRCS dealt with 107 cases, including 6 fatalities. This is 66 % of all people reported as injured by MOH.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">As per the signed GAD BRC is&#xC2;&#xA0; contributing &#xC2;&#xA3;100k to ICRC Israel/OPT Appeal budget extension
Funds raised through BRC&apos;s appeal will be used for this contribution. The latest appeal income update (attached) shows BRC has raised around &#xC2;&#xA3;67k, from which we will use &#xC2;&#xA3;60k and top up with MENA unallocated G funds to reach the &#xC2;&#xA3;100k contribution.
Unforeseen delays in appeal income reaching our account has meant only &#xC2;&#xA3;54k from appeal funding are available at the time of making this payment. In order to mitigate for the delays and stay closer to the agreed transfer date, the Head of Region has approved to make use of additional &#xC2;&#xA3;6k from general funds to cover this payment. The additional funding will be backfilled once income becomes available in P8149.</narrative>
