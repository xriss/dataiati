The 3rd short film, tackling issues of Sub-Saharan migrant women in Tunisia is still being edited. The 4th about a black Tunisian actress did not receive follow-up from the filmmaker despite several reminders from our team. 

On the 18th of November, MRG released a Baseline study on the situation of minorities and discriminated groups in Tunisia. This baseline study aims to make an assessment of the progress and achievements in several areas, as well as the challenges that remain for a non-discriminatory Tunisia. The study also intends to shed light on the groups that continue to suffer from multiple forms of discrimination and to suggest recommendations.

On the 1st of December, MRG released another report, Impact of Covid-19 on the rights of minorities and &#x2018;minoritized&#x2019; populations: consultation with civil society. This study focuses on the impact of the pandemic on minorities and &#x2018;minoritized&#x2019; populations in Tunisia. Most of these populations were in a situation of prior vulnerability which was worsened by the various measures taken by the Tunisian state to counter the spread of the epidemic.

On the occasion of the Human Rights Day (10 December 2021), MRG organised a face-to-face event to present the reports and the short documentary films. Printed reports, goodies, along with flyers having our emergency numbers for consultation were distributed. The event started with an opening speech by Frerik Kampman, First Secretary of political affairs and human rights within the Dutch Embassy to Tunisia. The authors of the reports presented their work and answered questions. Then, 4 films were screened and discussedin the presence of the main characters and the directors. 45 attended the event including journalists,diplomats, researches and civil society organisation representatives. As a result, two interviews with local radio stations were conducted to discuss about discrimination in Tunisia.

In November 2021, we sent on behalf of the Bahai community a communication to the United Nations Special Rapporteur on religious freedom about the creation of a Bahai cemetery in Tunisia. This communication covers a request submitted by the Bahai community since 2017 asking the Minister of Local Affairs and Environment and the municipality of La Marsa to create a specific cemetery for the Bahai people in Tunisia in order to ensure respect for their dignity and rights, as Tunisian citizens, to have a funeral that respects their religious beliefs.
