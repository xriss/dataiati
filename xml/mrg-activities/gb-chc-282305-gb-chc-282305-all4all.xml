&#x2022;	Some PADs continued the documentation of cases of discrimination. During this period, we received 42 cases of discrimination (28 based on SOGIESC and 14 cases against sub-Saharan migrants).
&#x2022;	Our pool of lawyers provided 5 legal consultancies to Sub-Saharan migrants and defended 4 cases on behalf of a person with disabilities, a non-Muslim, a migrant and a Black Tunisian. Furthermore, a Sub-Saharan woman was assisted in the legal procedures to get financial reparation. 
&#x2022;	A consultant was recruited in February to analyse the cases of discrimination we collected in 2020. The report, available in Arabic and French, was launched in a webinar on the 21st of March, International Day against Racial Discrimination. The webinar was moderated by MRG MENA Coordinator with the presence of the author of the report in addition to a spokesperson of the Sub-Saharan migrants in Tunisia and a spokesperson of the LGBTQI+ community from our Points Anti-Discrimination Network, respectively &#x201C;By-Lhwem&#x201D; and &#x201C;Damj&#x201D;.
&#x2022;	A meeting with our pool of lawyers and the Baha&#x2019;i organization &#x201C;Unity in Diversity&#x201D; was held to discuss potential strategies for advocacy. A press conference was held on the 16th of March in partnership with them and the Observatory to announce that a case was filed by the Baha&#x2019;i community against the government because of accusation of blasphemy.  
&#x2022;	In February, MRG organised a 2-week field visit to the South of Tunisia to investigate issues of racism including changinglast names referring to slavery.
&#x2022;	In March, the MENA Coordinator spoke about our work regarding the fight against racial discrimination at a panel organised by the OHCHR.
