    <narrative xml:lang="EN">Croatia has successfully navigated the Euro-Atlantic accession process, having joined the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in 2009 and the European Union in July 2013. U.S.~assistance has played an important role in helping Croatia become a leading partner in Southeast Europe and a model for its neighbors, including by joining forces with the United~States to address regional and global challenges. Croatia&apos;s mentoring of neighboring countries, including through NATO&apos;s Partnership for Peace and the Adriatic Charter, has helped those NATO aspirants advance on their paths to membership by initiating defense reforms and contributing to Alliance operations. Continued U.S.~assistance will help the Croatian military meet its NATO commitments on modernization, interoperability, and expeditionary capability, and further refine the Croatian Armed Forces (CAF) into an interoperable force that provides critical assets to international security operations. U.S. assistance will advance defense reform, build capacity, and strengthen partnerships in the region to more effectively counter Russian aggression and other emerging threats.</narrative>
