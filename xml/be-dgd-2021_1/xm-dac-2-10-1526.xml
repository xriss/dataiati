   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Mass displacement as a result of inter-communal violence has been prevalent and recur-ring in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) since the so-called African Wars of the 1990s, but has recently flared up again in Ituri and North Kivu Provinces following tribal skirmishes and intensified clashes between armed factions, compounded by elec-tion-year instability. Scores of civilians caught up in the violence are seeking refuge in neighboring countries and in particular Uganda, entering the country via a perilous cross-ing of Lake Albert. It is projected that up to 150,000 refugees from DRC could make their way over to Uganda in 2018. By comparison, only 44,000 Congolese entered Uganda in all of 2017.
Ugandan authorities, host communities and aid organisations are struggling to respond adequately to the humanitarian needs caused by this sudden, massive refugee influx. Substantial gaps in the response persist in the production of water, construction of sanita-tion facilities and the promotion of correct hygiene practice. Cholera and other infectious diseases are rife and have led to 47 deaths in just two months. 
The Uganda Red Cross is by and large the most important local responder on the scene, having mobilized over 120 volunteers who are currently active in both major refugee set-tlements in the promotion of hygiene activities for cholera prevention, and the production of clean water. 
A disaster preparedness programme funded by the Belgian Government has significantly improved the response capacity at national level, and indeed the same programme is currently bearing its fruits in the DRC as well as the South Sudan refugee response. However, gaps remain in the efficiency and effectiveness of aid being delivered at branch level, in those districts bordering DRC. As a result, vulnerable refugees continue to endure hardship and face unmet needs, particularly in relation to their health, sanitation and livelihoods.
