   <narrative xml:lang="EN">There is a high risk of malnutrition amongst pregnant and nursing women in Syria, since the increase in food prices limits women&#x2019;s access to fresh food such as dairy, vegetables, meat and poultry. These women may not receive adequate micronutrients essential for their health and that of their unborn or infant child. Poor dietary diversity has a profound impact that reaches far beyond the first vital 1,000 days of a child&#x2019;s life which establish the foundation of the child&#x2019;s future well-being.

To complement ongoing general food assistance and address the critical needs of this vulnerable group, WFP provides eligible women with cash-based transfer nutritional support (in the form of monthly fresh food vouchers) to improve their dietary diversity. Women receive an electronic food voucher to purchase fresh food products (meat, fruit, vegetables and dairy) which are not included in the general food ration basket, from WFP&#x2019;s contracted retailers
