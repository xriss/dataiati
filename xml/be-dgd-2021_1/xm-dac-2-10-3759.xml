   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Emergency humanitarian assistance for the program &quot;Contribution in support of people of concern to UNHCR in Syrian Arab Republic, Niger, Mali and Uganda&quot; for activities in Syria (2 MEUR), Niger (1,162,980 EUR), Mali (1,837,020 EUR) and Uganda (3 MEUR). This proposal takes into account themes that are essential to Belgium (protection of and assistance to people affected by armed conflict, access to health care, fight against sexual violence, promotion of International Humanitarian Law (IHL)) and respect for humanitarian principles. The Syria crisis is in its eleventh year and humanitarian needs are multi-faceted, showing no signs of reducing. The socio-economic situation, depreciation of currency, and restrictive measures are 
taking their toll on society. Added to this are COVID-19 related challenges such as loss of livelihoods, a reduction in peoples&#x2019; purchasing power and increase in negative coping mechanisms. Most areas in Syria are under government control, nevertheless, the security situation is still volatile with regular security incidents across the country.
Early 2021, it was estimated that some 13.4 million people are in need in the country, while some 
6.7 million are estimated to be internally displaced. In 2020, some 448,000 internally displaced 
Syrians and a little over 38,200 Syrian refugees were reported to have returned to their areas of 
origin. As more areas are becoming accessible for return, it is expected the pace of return will 
stabilize. No large-scale displacements resulting from conflict or natural disasters are expected, 
however intermittent localised displacements may take place from time-to-time. 
Syria also hosts some 24,000 registered refugees and asylum-seekers, mainly from Iraq. Unfortunately, achieving durable solutions for these people of concern are limited. There are limited resettlement opportunities and local integration is not yet available. It is estimated some 160,000 stateless people reside in the country.
In Syria, UNHCR follows a community-based protection approach to reach and provide assistance to people of concern. UNHCR supports over 200 community centres and mobile community units and engages some 2,600 community outreach volunteers across the country to implement this strategy. At the community centres, people of concern can receive  comprehensive protection related services such as to address child protection and gender-based violence concerns, legal assistance, counselling, pyscho-social support, and case management services. Outreach volunteers, who are attached to community centres engage their communities to identify and address specific protection concerns by implementing small-scale community-led projects. At community centres people of concern can also apply to receive livelihood support either in the form of assets (livestock or seeds) or to start small businesses. stateless people reside in the country.
In Syria, cash-based interventions support refugee families improve their living conditions and 
reduce their susceptibility to exploitation and other protection risks such as engaging in child labour and survival sex. Overall cash-based interventions allow people of concern the freedom to decide and address needs in the most appropriate manner possible, respecting their dignity. Providing cash to people also directly benefits the local economy and can contribute to co-existence with host communities and promotes self-reliance. Families&#x2019; eligibility to receive cash assistance is based on vulnerability criteria and is reviewed at regular intervals so the most-in-need receive the assistance. Niger faces unprecedented humanitarian challenges that result from years of volatility and growing militia activity in its border regions. 2,310 security incidents have been reported between January and July 2021. At present, border regions with Nigeria, Burkina Faso and Mali are hosting more than 579,000 persons of concern to UNHCR, and the numbers continue to grow. Communities are being threatened by armed groups to close educational institutions and health facilities, while roving groups of indiscriminate criminals continue to steal property and assassinate tribal chiefs and faith leaders, creating a state of fear throughout the border regions.
As per a rapid needs assessment conducted in June 2021, food, shelters, core relief items (CRIs) 
continue to be priority needs of refugees, IDPs and host communities. It is also paramount to ensure safety for these vulnerable households to allow access to education to all their children.inate tribal chiefs and faith leaders, creating a state of fear throughout the border regions.
The regions of Tillabery, Tahoua and Diffa are witnessing a rapid increase in protection and 
humanitarian incidents, which require additional support and capacity from the humanitarian 
community and international stakeholders.
The armed groups that operate along the border and the increase in military operations in the regions of Tillabery and Tahoua continue to cause a rise in internal displacement. At the end of June 2021, the number of refugees and IDPs in Tillab&#xE9;ry and Tahoua was estimated at 267,522. This emergency has led humanitarian actors to set up a protection cluster in charge of coordinating protection in the region. As the targeted assassinations and military operations along the border with Mali continue, further population movements and protection incidents could be expected in the coming months.
In the region of Diffa, movements have been restricted on the Gueskerou, Toumour, and Bosso 
roads since April 2019 due to successive attacks, kidnappings, and the discovery of explosive 
devices. The border with Nigeria was closed in August 2019, which increased the price of essential goods for the population. Throughout 2020 and 2021, attacks against the population &#x2013; including the trademark use of kidnappings &#x2013; continue to pose threats to populations and humanitarian workers. 
At the end of June 2021, the Diffa region hosted 269,589 Nigerian refugees, IDPs and Nigerien 
returnees, over 80 per cent of whom live in the spontaneous settlements.


 In Mali, violent extremism, crime, and intra- and intercommunal conflicts &#x2013; notably in the northern and central parts of Mali &#x2013; are an ongoing security concern for forcibly displaced persons and their host communities, especially amid the absence of state security forces and social services in most areas. In 2021, the intensification of military operations in the three-border zone and growing insecurity towards the south of the country continue to drive new forced displacement. Protection monitoring reports highlight cases of murder, mutilation, assaults, arbitrary arrests, recruitment by non-state armed groups, and gender-based violence (GBV) including forced marriage and sexual violence. In addition, extortion of goods and theft of cattle deprive the populations of means of subsistence. Regular attacks on public infrastructures such as schools, health centres and roads limit humanitarian access and the delivery of basic services. Moreover, amid an ongoing socioeconomic and political crisis, the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated the already difficult humanitarian and protection situation and contributed to the increase of GBV and economic difficulties. 
Due to the ongoing insecurity in Mali, internal displacement quadrupled from 2019 to June 2021, 
to a total of more than 386,000 IDPs in the country. Despite the precarious security situation, the 
number of arriving refugees and asylum-seekers also increased from nearly 28,000 to more than 
48,000 in the same period, largely due to severe insecurity in neighbouring Burkina Faso and Niger. UNHCR aims to reinforce the protection environment in conflict-affected regions hosting displaced populations in Mali, and will work with partners to strengthen shelter/NFI interventions, reinforce registration and support to GBV survivors.
