    <narrative xml:lang="EN">The United States is strongly committed to supporting democracy in Tunisia, following the 2015 formation of a democratically elected government. In FY 2017, assistance will focus on promoting accountable governance, democratic processes, and civil society, enhancing security capabilities; and expanding economic growth. The FY 2017 request builds upon critical programs initiated after the 2014 and 2015 U.S.-Tunisia Strategic Dialogues. U.S. assistance seeks to: institutionalize democratic processes, good governance, transparency, and inclusive participation; support the ability of the Tunisian police, gendarmerie, and military to provide security for the Tunisian people and contribute to regional security while respecting human rights; and enhance sustainable economic growth on the basis of increased competitiveness, inclusive opportunities, and improved economic governance. Across these efforts U.S. assistance will enhance the constructive engagement of youth and women and seek to mitigate vulnerability to violent extremism and conflict.</narrative>
