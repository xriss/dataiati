    <narrative xml:lang="EN">Foreign assistance aims to deepen Burma&apos;s democratic reforms, advance the national reconciliation process, and improve the lives of millions left vulnerable by decades of military rule. By bolstering support for civil society, U.S. efforts aim to strengthen political reforms, advance the national peace process, expand economic opportunity, and improve the health and welfare of all the people of Burma. The signing of a Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement in 2015 has raised expectations for national reconciliation and political dialogue in order to end the conflict. While the landslide victory for Aung San Suu Kyi&apos;s National League for Democracy (NLD) party was a historic milestone for the country&apos;s trajectory toward greater freedom and opportunity, progress may be undermined by conflict, intercommunal violence, limits on constitutional reform, and weak economic foundations. U.S. assistance aims to support Burma&apos;s continued transition and respond to new opportunities critical for Burma to become a more democratic, peaceful, stable, and prosperous country.</narrative>
