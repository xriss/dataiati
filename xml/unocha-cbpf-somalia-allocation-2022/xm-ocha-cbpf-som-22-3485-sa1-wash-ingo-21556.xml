   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Drought has worsened significantly across Somalia following three consecutive below-average rainy seasons. According to FAO/SWALIM, drought conditions are expected to worsen in the first quarter of 2022, leading to a similar situation witnessed in 2016/2017. The intensifying drought has led to water shortages, crop failures, and high levels of livestock migration and deaths. This comes only two years after a devastating drought that impacted hundreds of thousands of lives, placed additional strain on communities, stretched the humanitarian response and displaced over 300,000 people. The failure of three consecutive rains (Gu&#x2019; and Deyr in 2020 and also Gu and Deyr in 2021) resulted in severe drought that has affected thousands of people in Puntland, where communities in Bari,Gardaful, Nugaal, Sool, Sanaag and Karkaar regions are the most affected. Generally the Gu rains were delayed and the performance was poor in terms of coverage and distribution in most of the areas assessed including Burtinle, This aggravated the already poor conditions that resulted from below-average 2021 Deyr rains. The Puntland Government of Somalia, through HADMA. The impacts of the drought differ across all regions hence the severity and intercity differ as well from region to region however Nugal region remains of the most affected regions especially areas like Burtinle and surrounding villages where communities are affected by droughts and thousands of people displaced and people lost their animals to the drought, 
In order to fill the gaps Islamic Relief worldwide with funding from OCHA is planning to rehabilitate 2 strategic boreholes, each borehole will serve between 3,000 to 7,000 people, and construction of 120 emergency latrines, the project aims to tackle the affects of the droughts by providing timely and life saving support to the communities in Burtinle district in Somalia, the intervention is in line with the needs of the community and WASH strategy, the intervention will directly support 15,500 direct beneficiaries, the project will respond to the current drought disaster and will build the community resilience through rehabilitation of strategic water wells. The project will install solar powers systems to the boreholes, construct civil works including water tanks, animal troughs, two of the boreholes will have complete piping system that&#x2019;s connecting between water source and IDPs camp each borehole will have minimum 2 water kiosks, gender balanced water management committees will be formed and trained. Islamic Relief will provide emergency water trucking to 4,000 beneficiaries in Burtinle district, the beneficiaries will receive water in accordance with sphere standards (7.5 liters/per person per day).
