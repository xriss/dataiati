  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This is a 6 months&#x2019; project aimed at continued focus on famine prevention and life-saving humanitarian response by reducing HH food consumption gaps with life-saving multi-purpose cash and, protection of livelihoods assets in Agro-pastoral villages in Baidoa district. The project will target 1585 vulnerable drought affected IDPs (910) and Agro-pastoral (675)HHs among women, men, boys, girls, including female headed households classified under IPC 3 amp 4.
The deteriorating food security and nutrition situation in the district is driven by worsening, multi-season drought that has gripped the country since late 2020. Persistent insecurity, conflict and unresolved political tensions as well as global supply and price shocks are further exacerbating the food security situation. The impacts are widespread, including but not limited to severe water scarcity, excess livestock deaths due to starvation and disease, consecutive poor or failed harvests, escalating local and imported food prices, and drought and conflict-induced population displacement, all of which are leading to a decline in the coping capacity of the poor and vulnerable population.
Current seasonal rainfall forecasts indicate an increased likelihood of below-average rainfall during the 2022 Gu season in most of central and southern Somalia. HHs currently face water shortages, limited milk availability, and a lack of saleable animals as animals die from starvation and the body condition of remaining livestock deteriorates. The rising costs of water and feed for livestock, as well as migration to distant areas in search of pasture and water, have led to very high debt burdens among pastoral households.
The project is informed by the centrality of protection and a gender, age and diversity-sensitive approach which is mainstreamed throughout the project cycle. Moreover, the project reflects the principles of COOPI Protection Policy and is built consistently with COOPI Protection SOPs and Protection Mainstreaming guidelines. The project will be guided by the principles of DO NO HARM, ensuring safety and dignity of target population is upheld and at the same time providing for accountability, participation and empowerment. 
In order to improve household immediate access to food, unconditional cash transfer will be provided to 910 affected IDP to enable them immediately access food, water, healthcare, and other basic services while 675 rural HHs including girls, pregnant and lactating women, boys and men will be given cash plus inputs to enable them get back into production and improve household access to food. To protect key livelihoods assets of Agro-pastoralists, 675 vulnerable Agro- pastoral HHs will be provided with Emergency fodder provision and livestock water in response as part of the cash plus inputs to protect their assets against the drought fatalities. The activity is aimed at protecting livestock assets of the drought affected agro-pastoral communities from dehydration, starvation, opportunistic infections and death. This activity is envisaged to reduce workload and stress on women and girls who are responsible for watering of livestock and collection of pasture for livestock feeding. In addition, GBV and exploitation malpractices associated with search of livestock feeds and water for long distances will be mitigated through the proposed activity. 
In summary the following activities will be carried out:
1. Provide unconditional cash transfer to 910 IDP and rural HHs in Baidoa/Berdale district to increase immediate access to food.
2.Cash plus inputs to 675 rural HHs in Baidoa/Berdale district to increase immediate access to food.
3. Emergency fodder provision for 675 vulnerable drought affected Agro-pastoral HHs. .
4. Provision of emergency livestock water to 675 drought affected households in Baidoa/Berdale district
5. Post distribution monitoring activities</narrative>
