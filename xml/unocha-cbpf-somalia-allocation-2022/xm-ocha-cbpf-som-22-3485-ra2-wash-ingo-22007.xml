   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Galmudug state remains one of the areas worst hit by the drought, with all the districts facing severe drought. Light rains were received in mid-April in some parts, that recharged water reservoirs and provided temporary relief to the local communities, but access to water remains a challenge as it has increased human and livestock disease incidence and has exacerbated inadequate access to sanitation and hygiene facilities, leaving households vulnerable to diseases like cholera and Acute Watery Diarrhea (AWD). The current worst affected regions include Galgadud region, Somalia. The capacities of IDP settlements are overstretched. According to the Galmudug Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs and Disaster Management (MoHADM) the prevailing drought has affected an estimated 734,158 people in Galgaduud and south Mudug regions. MoHADM noted that Galmudug interventions are not sufficient at present, and are critically underfunded. Thus proposed WASH project will contribute to the 2022 Somalia Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP) and 2nd SHF 2022 Reserve Allocation round targeting drought/AWD/Cholera-affected rural communities and unserved populations in hard-to-reach areas including IDPs to prevent loss of lives and drought induced in Cadaado district, Galgadud region, Somalia. PAH will focus on both immediate and sustainable intervention that includes:
Provision of temporary access to safe water through water trucking mainly to drought-affected rural communities and unserved populations in hard-to-reach areas for lifesaving - maximum 2 months.
Improved sustain access to safe water through drilling and construction of new strategically located communal wells (boreholes, shallow wells) in recurrent drought hotspot areas to prevent drought-induced displacement will be undertaken equipped with appropriate storage systems, tanks and distribution networks. Gender balance water management committees will be trained on operation and maintenance, including provision of spare parts that oversee and ensure the management of WASH facilities. Water quality monitoring (chlorination of communal water sources/HHWT will be part of the action.
Installation of new sanitation facilities in IDP sites ONLY and that is culturally appropriate safe for users of all ages and gender, and accessible to persons with disability equipped with handwashing facilities (at least 15% of facilities should be accessible to PwDs).
Addressing the need of improved hygiene practices through promotion campaigns focusing disease preventions (including AWD/Cholera) and Hygiene kits distribution, including female-specific hygiene items (sanitary materials).

The project will reach an overall population of 16594(15714 direct and 880 indirect beneficiaries) (3319 men, 4480 women, 3817 boys, 4978 girls)</narrative>
