  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Of the 4.1 million people affected by worsening drought, close to 3.5 million of them including 1.3 million IDPs are now in acute need and require urgent life-saving WASH assistance to prevent further drought-induced displacement (WASH Cluster Drought Response Update February 2022). Water prices have increased to as high as 70% since December 2021 in most drought affected districts in Somalia including Baardheere district of Gedo region. 42,000 people live in Bardheere district out of 579,514 total affected people in Somalia. The WASH cluster report also indicated that there is a critical WASH gaps in Bardheere district. 
ARD is implementing WASH project in Bardheere currently but due to the large number of draught displaced people in fluxing to Bardheere, it has become a burden which must be addressed to respond faster to effects of draught in the region.
To response this situation, ARD proposed project will cover WASH needs of drought/AWD affected men, women, boys and girls. A total of 20,000 drought affected men, women and children including the disabilities, marginalized communities and IDPs will benefit safe drinking water and will have access equally through: 
1) In collaboration with the local authority, partnership with main water vendors in Aminay, Bula cadey, Tur gadaal, Bay gaaljecel, Baraxow and Bula gedi villages n Bardheere district, ARD will provide emergency water voucher to the 6,800 (1020 men, 1,700 women, 2,040 boys and 2,040 girls) targeted beneficiaries including people with disabilities and marginalized communities in the targeted IDP camps, which they can redeem for water at the specified water vendors (water trucks). The action also includes hiring water truck of a capacity of 6,000 liters of safe water to the targeted locations. Each voucher can be used to redeem specified quantity of safe water of 7.5 liters per person per day for a period of 60 days.
2) Rehabilitation / construction of 6 strategic shallow wells with hand pumps.
3) Capacity building of 42 gender balanced WASH Committees members shared equality by men and women on operation and maintenance of developed water infrastructures shall be throughout the project implementation period, to ensure the sustainability of the developed water facilities after the project is faced out. 
4) Provision of reliable and sustainable access to environmental sanitation through construction of 100 IDP latrines in Bardheere IDP camps. The latrines will be gender separated and flood proof with lockable doors and hand washing basins. Construction of latrines will be implemented through market-based programming.
5) Distribution of 40 sanitation sets to 4 IDP camps, in order to improve the environmental sanitation of the targeted locations. The aim of the 40 sanitation sets distribution is to carry out clean-up campaigns, in order to reduce the spread of AWD/cholera diseases and to improve the environmental sanitation of the target locations.
6) Conducting comprehensive hygiene promotion campaigns focusing hand washing with soap practices to 20,000 men, women, boys and girls through visiting house to house, health facilities, and nutrition centers.
7) ARD will also train 15 Community Hygiene Promoters (CHPs) shared equally men and women, selected from the target communities and IDPs, so that in their turn can educate the entire population to change their behaviors. 
8) Distribution of 950 HP kits to 950 IDP HHs. 
All the project equipment and materials will be purchased locally and the skilled workers from drought affected communities will be recruited to improve local communities&#x2019; livelihoods and to strengthen local markets through the market-based programming initiatives. In addition, ARD will ensure mainstreaming protection including mitigation measures against GBV in all phases of the project. This project will also promote and empower women participation in different activities such as the management of constructed WASH facilities.</narrative>
