  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project is an integrated response that is framed around three sector areas, Shelter, Housing Land amp Property (HLP) and Camp Coordination and Camp Management (CCCM). Shelter and HLP activities will be implemented by NRC while CCCM activities will be carried out by Puntland Youth and Social Development Association (PSA) targeting the same locations and beneficiaries in various settlement of Bossaso. A pre-teaming agreement has been uploaded/attached to this proposal providing further details on the approach and rationale of the collaboration. In essence, the multi-cluster, and multi-agency approach, will maximize assistance as different sectors and actors will be able to share critical information to inform immediate programming and re-design of programs. This approach will be useful to create synergies enabling the concentration of services and expertise within the same location and same population leading to achieving a greater impact. The interventions will support the targeted communities holistically and efficiently by providing well-tailored and packaged responses in order to address different needs of the people of concern. The integrated response is in line with SHF principles by prioritization direct implementation and supporting integration of response across clusters. 

This project is designed to mitigate physical and protection consequences of droughts and conflicts on populations and communities directly affected in Bossaso. This overarching objective will be achieved by enhancing the overall protective environment for protracted drought-affected and conflict-affected population, increasing access to basic services linked to Shelter, HLP and CCCM. Through this grant, NRC will reach 3831 HHs (24,211 individuals, 50% females) in Bossaso with services and assistance in Shelter and HLP sectors. PSA will target the same beneficiaries through CCCM interventions to have an integrated and area- based approach with the maximum impact of the intervention. Additionally, NRC will also collaborate with PSA during eviction risk mapping to avoid duplication and enhance collaboration. After the approval of the project, NRC and PSA will conduct joint needs assessment in Bossaso to select the most vulnerable settlements for interventions. NRC&apos;s main shelter activities will be the distribution of 900 NFIs through cash, construction of 900 Emergency Shelters through cash followed by Post Distribution Monitoring (PDM).


The HLP component of the project seeks to contribute to the protection of drought-affected populations in overcoming obstacles that are hindering their ability to access, claim and enjoy their HLP rights in Bossaso. The proposed action builds on NRC&#x2019;s hands-on expertise in HLP programming in Somalia, and targeting 2,005 households (13,411 individuals) in Bossaso. The project seeks to enhance the protection of displaced affected communities&#x2019; HLP rights and to create an enabling environment for sustained recovery and the pursuit of long-lasting solutions. Priority actions include the following:
i) Eviction response &#x2013; prevention efforts and remedial (support individuals supported with unconditional cash to cope with post-eviction stress).
ii) Supporting proactive engagements to negotiate improved tenure arrangements and/or facilitating dignified relocations. 
iii) Undertaking comprehensive due diligence processes through consultations with landowners, communities and local authorities. 
iv) Case management: provision of specialised counselling and legal assistance services to increase access to justice. 
v) Strengthening local dispute resolution capacities to address HLP violations and fostering social cohesion in target communities. 

Overall beneficiaries of the project will be 3,831 HHs (24,211 individuals). To promote integration shelter, HLP and CCCM will target the same eviction prone sites that have been identified through an eviction risk analysis and receiving influxes of drought-displaced.</narrative>
