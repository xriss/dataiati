Declining availability of milk for both  consumption and sale, and a reduction in agricultural employment opportunities during the  Gu  season, has escalated the food security situation a cross Somaliland. . Food security situation in Buuhodhle district ,Togdheer region has been classified as extreme. Being a 
 a pastoral livelihood zone, poor households are facing large food consumption gaps due to  poor milk availability,  limited number of saleable animals, and increased expenditures on food and water. In response to  noted  humanitarian needs, among  poor and vulnerable house holds in Buuhodhle district,  VSFGermany has proposed a project to support a total of 4200 poor and vulnerable households in 5 most affected villages Buuhodhle, Horufadhi, Ceegag, Carro Weyne, Qurilugud with cash plus interventions. The project is integrated to address immediate food access to bridge the  large food consumption gaps in poor households with malnourished family members and also protect  productive livelihood assets(Livestock).  The key interventions will be a) Unconditional Cash Transfer(UCT) to 1200 poor and vulnerable households with food consumption gaps  for  immediate food access, each household receiving  USD 85 or 3 months/rounds, b)  Protection of productive livelihood assets of  vulnerable pastoralists. This will entail, i)provision of supplementary livestock feed to 400hh(2400 people) to  small ruminants  lactating/breeding herds and (ii) Improved water access  for lactating small ruminants /breeding through water voucher system to 400households(2400 people).  Provision of supplementary animal feeds will be  expected to support lactating  sheep and goats while water supply will support. Livelihood protection interventions will be provided for 30 and 60 days, respectively. At the end of distribution of cash, supplementary feeds and water  a post distribution monitoring will be conducted to and the findings will provide lessons on cash plus intervention in emergency situation.  Gender mainstreaming and Protection will be integrated throughout the selection process.

Pastoralist  households with less than 30 shoats and those who lost their livestock&#x2019;s as a result of drought will be targeted with supplementary feeds .  Pastoralist households with unto  30 sheep and goats with young stock(kids /lambs) will be supported to access water  for this category of their animals. A total of  400 vulnerable households will be supported  to increase water access for livestock  through a voucher system to reduce fatalities. The 400 households, will   each receive 100litres for  60 days. The distribution will be done with support of community committees, representative of Local authorities who will supervise the identification, mobilization and selection of beneficiaries using agreed selection criteria  with the help of project officer.
