This project will deliver an integrated lifesaving emergency health and nutrition services including maternal, neonatal and child health together with an integrated basic nutrition service package (OTP, SC and community mobilization) through 2 static Health facilities (Galbarwaako and Elgula) and 2 mobile health clinics serving far flung villages without static health facilities in close proximity in Hobyo District. This action will complement and strengthen CESVIs health care, WASH and FSL activities in the above stated locations with funding from AICS, FCDO and QFFD donors. Within Hobyo district, this action will provide quality lifesaving health and nutrition services to the following 12 villages two static facilities: Galbarwaako and Elgula and 10 mobile clinic sites: Herodhagaxley, Haaro, Afgaduudle, Garday, Lulubsho, Toore, Hadiidle, Qarsoni, Dabaqalooc and Hogcadaadley. The two mobile clinics will provide health and nutrition outreach services in 10 villages hosting a total of 9480 people. On top of the health services, the mobile clinics will also provide nutrition treatment and prevention services through OTP, Micronutrients and IYCF services using the standard Somalia IMAM guidelines. The health facilities will be equipped with essential medicines and equipment to provide quality services. Emphasis will be laid on Maternal and Child Health, including Basic Emergency Obstetric and Newborn Care (BEmONC), and Expanded Programme on Immunization to IDPs and most vulnerable communities. This project will focus on provision of both curative and preventive health services at primary level integrated with activities addressing GBV and protection needs. Emphasis will be laid on application of standard treatment guidelines as per EPHS at PHC. On top of the health services, the static health centers will also provide nutrition treatment services both inpatient (SC) and outpatient (OTP) treatment services for severely acute malnourished children. On top of that, the facilities will provide malnutrition preventive services including maternal and young child nutrition (MIYCN) services with special focus on promotion of breastfeeding, community mobilization on promotion of nutrition seeking behavior and provision of micronutrient supplementation to prevent Micronutrient Deficiencies (silent hunger). This action will deliver comprehensive reproductive health care to women of reproductive age among the target beneficiaries and promotion of health seeking behavior including adoption of preventive practices through campaigns, health and hygiene education sessions. Referral system for patients seeking secondary healthcare services will be done to Galkayo hospital and will be strengthened with focus on pregnant women requiring emergency services, victims of gun shots, casualties from accidents, trauma cases among others using Cesvi owned ambulance vehicle. The project will also undertake confidential identification of GBV survivors for provision of comprehensive caret in-line with IASC MHPSS standard. Clinical management of rape (CMR) will also be provided in the 2 Health facilities. Children between 6-59 months of age will be screened from acute malnutrition and those who are severely malnourished children without complications will be treated through outpatient therapeutic programs at both static and mobile clinics using the RUTF plumpynut supplies from UNICEF and medical treatments. Furthermore, the severely malnourished children with complications will be treated at the facility level through stabilization center(SC) using F100 and F75 supplies from UNICEF and medical treatments. For those children who are moderately malnourished will be referred to TSFP centers run by Mercy USA. That way, Cesvi will achieve to provide all of the four components of CMAM (OTP, SC, TSFP and community mobilization)</narrative>
