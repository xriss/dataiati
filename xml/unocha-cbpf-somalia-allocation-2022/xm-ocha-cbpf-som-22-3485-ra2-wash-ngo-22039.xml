   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Emergency WASH services for drought affected displaced communities in Adado District</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This proposed WASH project for Adado District is designed to support a total of 20,820 people (3,470 households) drought affected displaced IDPs (disaggregated by gender), in Adado District. The action will improve access to adequate, safe drinking water supply that meets the minimum recommended amount for a household facing emergencies (7.5&#x2013;15 litres per day as per SPHERE Standards). The project&apos;s approach is aimed at scaling up the drought response in worst hit areas where the situation is rapidly worsening. It will be based on WASH cluster recommendations where rehabilitation of critical water points to meet the water requirements in identified water deficit is prioritized. This project is designed to respond to the current ravaging drought situation by providing life-saving WASH services to the drought affected displaced IDPs in Adado District. Adado District experienced a poor Deyr season rains in 2021, and now preliminary forecasts indicate that below average to near average rainfall is expected to prevail across most parts of Somalia during the forthcoming 2022 Gu season (April-June). This portends gloom on an already bad situation with the on-going drought.
The project proposes to carry out rehabilitation of four strategic public boreholes in Dibira (in Dibira settlement), Kahando (in Kahando settlement) and Qeyb and Zamzam boreholes in Bahdo settlement. These will include civil structures (construction of additional 60m&#xB3; water storage tanks and installation of generating set and submersible pumps in the 4 boreholes of Dibira, Kahando, Qeyb and Zamzam), solar pumping system for Qeyb borehole, improvement of distribution system and pipe networks as well as training of water management committee members on operation and maintenance. 16 strategic public berkads will also be rehabilitated in 16 different settlements by the project. These will directly and indirectly serve a combined population of 27,852 people (4,6421hh). Water will then be trucked from the rehabilitated boreholes and other strategic boreholes to the strategic public berkads for communities&#x2019; use.  The strategic public berkads will remain in use by the community as strategic water access points during emergencies even after the end of this project. The project will carry out awareness on chlorination/household water treatment for community members utilizing water from the berkads. 
The project will also construct 59 no. culturally appropriate new sanitation facilities for newly displaced in four IDP sites in Adado town  (Kulmiye, Xeeb, Badbado and Karama) that are safe for users of all ages and gender, and accessible to persons with disability. 9 no latrines (15%) will be constructed with considerations for people living with disabilities. The lockable gender-segregated latrines will be fitted with hand washing facilities. CPD will carry out hygiene kits distribution, including female-specific hygiene items (sanitary materials), and hygiene promotion campaigns focusing on disease prevention (including AWD/Cholera).
A total of 20 Hygiene promoters consisting of 10 men and 10 women shall be trained on hygiene and deployed to the 4 targeted IDP Camps and the communities using berkads. Hygiene promoters&apos; training will aim at creating awareness on prevention of AWD/Cholera, elimination of open defecation and promotion of uptake of latrine use within the settlements and improve general hygiene within Adado. The project will also work with UNICEF Emergency WASH Regional Supply Hub in Adado Town (which CPD manages) to chlorine for disinfection of the water points and provide hygiene kits to women in the IIDP camps.
The centrality of Protection: The design of the water infrastructure will be done to ensure water collection is women friendly. Women and girls shall also be prioritized for protection measures including having designated water collection points and also the planned hygiene kits.</narrative>
