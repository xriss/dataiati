   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Provision of  sustained access to emergency  WASH services for the  drought-affected IDP and Non-IDP households in Abudwak District</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Sequential seasons of reduced rainfall, drying up of strategic water sources, and dying livestock exposed millions across Somalia at the risk of famine. The drought conditions have affected about 6.1 million people and displaced 759,000 people from their homes in search of water, food, and pasture.  Among them, 4.2M people face severe water shortages with over 159 strategic communal boreholes needing urgent upgrading to restore their functionality. Among them are boreholes in drought-affected rural villages in the Galgadud region that have been classified as a priority 1 area in need of interventions to improve the working conditions of key community water infrastructures.  NAPAD&#x2019;s rapid WASH assessment (3rd-4th May 2022) in Abudwak and Balanbale Districts found that the community boreholes faced various and differing challenges that limited water supply to both humans and livestock due to dilapidated WASH infrastructures, pump breakdown, generator breakdown and high costs of diesel fuel to pump the water. The assessment also found that IDP camps with drought IDPs lacked sanitation facilities and basic hygiene provisions such as solid waste pits and handwashing facilities.
NAPAD proposes to deliver life-saving WASH services targeting vulnerable and drought-affected rural populations and IDPs who are not receiving other comparable assistance. These targeted rural locations are Koshin, Kahandale, Landheer, Faaqato, and Harqabobe villages and in addition, drought-affected IDP households living in Ala Amin, Daya&apos;an, and Balgorey IDP settlements, of Abudwak District, Galgaduud Region. The proposed project will support 30,180 direct beneficiaries and 7680 indirect communities comprising IDPs, rural underserved communities, nomadic pastoralists, and host communities. In Koshin, Kahandale, Landheer, Faaqato, and Harqabobe villages, building on its success in establishing and transitioning water systems to vulnerable communities, NAPAD will support the construction /rehabilitation and or equipping of 4 solar-powered water supply systems. The project will also build the capacity of 4 community water management committees that will manage the operations of the water supply systems, established to sustain access to safe drinking water in the villages 6 youth volunteers from the targeted communities will also be trained on the operations and maintenance of the solar systems established. 24,180  persons (4030  households who include 5332 men, 5549 women, 6650 boys, and 6650 girls will benefit from the sustained access to safe drinking water, especially during the drought period. 7800 persons will be provided with emergency water through water vouchers. 15% of these are persons with disabilities. 
To provide and sustain access to hygiene and sanitation services for 6000 persons (1000 households (1323 men, 1377 women  1650 boys, and 1650 girls) in the Daya&#x2019;an, Ala Amin, and Balgorey IDP settlements, the project will construct 140 temporary floodproof latrines suitable for PWDs, provide the communities with the tools to improve solid waste management, as well conduct IDP settlement cleanup campaigns.  Additionally, these households displaced because of the drought will be provided with hygiene kits.   Finally, the project will conduct hygiene promotion through community hygiene promoters. These interventions will significantly contribute to preventing any potential WASH-related disease outbreaks such as AWD and Cholera.
Hence, the proposed WASH interventions will complement the ongoing WASH and food security interventions by NAPAD and holistically address the ongoing critical WASH situation in Abudwak where there is an increased risk of morbidity, the inability of the administration to provide adequate WASH services, and limited safe water sources and sanitation remain a challenge. NAPAD MampE and programs technical staff will conduct project monitoring and documentation of change stories for project quality assurance.</narrative>
