   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Increased life-saving and sustainable access to water, sanitation and hygiene for disaster Affected Communities in Erigavo district &#x2013; Sanaag Region</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The 2022 Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP) for Somalia estimates about 6.4 million people are in the severe category who lack access to safe water, proper sanitation and hygiene services and are highly vulnerable to displacement and Waterborne diseases including Acute Water Diarrheal (AWD) and cholera. Furthermore, below-average performance of 2022 Gu rainy season as observed in most of Somaliland regions and the projected high risk that drought conditions will continue throughout the year worsened the situation and increased the vulnerability of target communities.
To respond both the urgent and long term needs of triple crisis affected communities (drought, Covid-19 and locust), HAVOYOCO conducted rapid needs assessment and designed interventions that aims providing timely emergency and sustainable WASH services to the most vulnerable populations including IDPs and marginalized host community members by targeting 25,200 persons consisting of (women, men, boys and girls) including those with disabilities and the elderly in 20 Communities under Erigavo district &#x2013; Sanaag Region. Key interventions include provision of water through voucher to 10800 persons for 50 days, rehabilitation of 5 boreholes and 6 shallow wells, pipeline extensions for Erigavo IDPs, distribution of hygiene kits to 1500 HH, construction of 20 latrines in IDP camps, Hygiene promotion campaigns, HH water treatment and chlorination of key strategic water sources
The project will provide much-needed humanitarian assistance to vulnerable people in targeted areas of  Erigavo district and the proposed actions including (1) Deliver life-saving WASH assistance to reduce acute needs among the most vulnerable communities through water trucking, PHP and water treatment through chlorination of communal water sources (2) Reduce the risk of violence against women, children, and vulnerable groups when accessing WASH services, by ensuring their inclusion, training the beneficiaries on Complaint response mechanism to increase the AAP (3) Restore sustainable access to safe water and adequate sanitation services in targeted communities through construction/rehabilitation of water sources, establishment of WASH committee, PHP awareness and construction of latrines.
Further, the target population will be involved in different project activities designing, implementation, and monitoring to promote ownership and in turn ensure the sustainability of the interventions. Special attention will be given to women, children, and the elderly, and PWD during the designing and construction of WASH interventions (i.e. 15% of all latrines will accessible to PWD) while targeting IDPs. Moreover, women and minority groups will be part of WASH committees and will be represented in all community structures to empower them. Distribution sites will be pre-selected by target community and hygiene kits contents will be shared with beneficiaries allowing them to understand their rights and entitlements. Different distribution modalities will be used where protection concerns are mitigated and reported if they occur. PWD will be supported if they could not travel to distribution sites.
In addition, Covid-19 prevention mechanism, Gender, and protection will be mainstreamed to project activities thoroughly, by providing PPE and setting up inclusive selection criteria with the community, while networking and coordination with different stakeholders will be maintained thoroughly to support target triple crisis-affected communities</narrative>
