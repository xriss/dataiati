  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Decades of conflict, disease outbreaks, widespread poverty and recurrent climatic shocks, including the ongoing drought emergency, have devastated Somalia. An estimated 7.7 million people in the country require humanitarian assistance and protection. The drought emergency has heightened in Somalia and now the country faces the risk of famine. An estimated 3.5 million people lack sufficient access to water, and more than six million people (up from the current 4.8 million people) will need food assistance to prevent crisis (IPC Phase 3) or worse outcomes this year. This includes 1.7 million people who are expected to be in the Emergency phase (IPC 4) and over 81,000 people to face the Catastrophe phase (IPC 5). The project is in line with Somalia Humanitarian Fund (SHF) Reserve Allocation and will provide integrated life-saving emergency primary health care and nutrition needs of drought-affected women, men, boys and girls of proposed project targets in Buuhoodle district. NODO is proposing 6-month integrated Health and Nutrition project targeting the most affected populations in Buuhoodle district reaching a total of 15,000 persons including 11,000 women, 1,500 Men, 1,300 girls and 1200 boys)

Health: The proposed project will support 6 static and 2 mobile IERT centres in Buuhoodle district. NODO plans to deliver an integrated package of promotive, preventive and curative maternal, new-born amp child health services and scale-up outbreak early warning and response and case management of epidemic prone diseases through IERT response team as part of the efforts to support the flood affected communities in Buuhoodle. The project aims to maintain the static and mobile clinics in Buuhoodle IDP and host community&#x2019;s sites and scale up the health care through skilled health professionals. NODO through this project will provide regular medical supplies and life-saving drugs to established health facilities, establish referral mechanisms and improve the coverage of measles vaccinations, support safe motherhood and reproductive health while also ensuring readiness to prevent and respond to outbreaks such as malaria, measles or AWD/Cholera and promote health update through health education and beneficiary sensitization

Nutrition: The proposed nutrition activities will be integrated with the health interventions with the aim of addressing underlying causes of high levels malnutrition as well as to enable early identification of SAM cases for treatment 2 mobile and 6 fixed in targeted IDPs and host community in the most affected areas in Buuhoodle district. This program will establish a strong community network through competent community nutrition volunteers for early detection/case finding and referral of children and pregnant and lactating mothers with acute malnutrition. In addition to the treatment of acute malnutrition, the project will be promoting positive infant and young child feeding (IYCF) practice by providing IYCF promotion and counselling. NODO is strong partner for the nutrition cluster and therefore, will have close coordination with other partners in the district for identification of vulnerable communities and avoiding overlapping of responses. Through this project, a total 15,000 most affected individuals in Buuhoodle will have access to a package of Emergency lifesaving integrated health and nutrition services for six months. The mobile teams will provide comprehensive community screening, identification, treatment and referral services from community, IDP areas to the fixed OTP and SC to improve access to the integrated package for the vulnerable community prioritizing rapid referral of the most critical cases (priority will be given to under 5 children and pregnant and lactating women), Referral of complicated cases will be done to the OTP integrated with PHC services managed by NODO by providing more holistic opportunity to the target beneficiaries.</narrative>
