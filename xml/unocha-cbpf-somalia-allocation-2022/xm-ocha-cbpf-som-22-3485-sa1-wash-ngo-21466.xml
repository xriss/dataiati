   <narrative xml:lang="EN">According to FNAU/FAO drought release report, on 27th January 2022, the poor rains during the last three consecutive seasons (October 2020 to December 2021), have caused widespread and worsening drought conditions across most parts of Somalia. This has resulted in failed crop harvests, widespread water shortage, triggering abnormal livestock migration, decline in livestock production and increased livestock deaths. Water and food prices have continued to rise sharply. In Gedo region, prices of water have increased by 20 per cent in some rural locations with a 20-litter barrel costing $0.7 to $1, before and during the drought, respectively. Severe water shortages and inadequate access to sanitation and hygiene facilities have heightened the risk of disease outbreaks. Cases of Acute Watery Diarrhea/Cholera, as well as measles outbreaks are spiking in multiple drought affected locations including Gedo region.
ASEP designed intervention to contribute to the 2022 Somalia Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP) and SHF standard allocation priorities, in an effort to address the needs of most vulnerable drought affected/displace d communities including IDPs, with a focus on Bardhere districts of Gedo region, Somalia. ASEP WASH activities will focus on both immediate and sustainable intervention that includes:
- Provision of temporary access to safe water through water trucking and improvement of water facilities through Construction and rehabilitation of water facilities (boreholes shallow wells). ASEP will carry out rehabilitation and/or extension of existing water infrastructures, construction of new water infrastructures equipped with appropriate storage systems, tanks and distribution networks , establishment of gender balanced water management committees, for ensuring continuity` of services, appropriate operation and maintenance and as well strengthen women leadership and participation in WASH projects. 
- Improving access to sanitation through installation of new sanitation facilities (culture sensitive and addressing specific needs of different gender and people with disabilities in IDP sites (15% of facilities targets people with PwDs).ASEP, will ensure the environmental sustainability of wash facilities is improved, by proper construction of latrines and water facilities, to avoid surface and groundwater level contamination.
- Addressing the need of improved hygiene practices through promotion campaigns focusing disease preventions (including AWD/Cholera).Education on hand washing with soap as well as menstrual hygiene education for women and girls will be carried out. In addition, provision of hygiene kits will be ensured, including female specific hygiene items and people with special needs (sanitary clothes, adult diapers ) .The project will target to reach 20,710(19,060 direct and 1,650 indirect beneficiaries) in Bardhere districts of Gedo region, Somalia.(4142 men, 5592 women, 4763 boys, 6213 girls).</narrative>
