This program will establish a strong community network through competent community nutrition volunteers for early detection/case finding and referral of children and pregnant and lactating mothers with acute malnutrition. In addition to the treatment of acute malnutrition, the project will be promoting positive infant and young child feeding (IYCF) practice by providing IYCF promotion and counselling. NODO is strong partner for the nutrition cluster and therefore, will have close coordination with other partners in the district for identification of vulnerable communities and avoiding overlapping of responses. Through this project, a total 15,250 most affected individuals in Iskushuban will have access to a package of Emergency lifesaving integrated WASH and nutrition services for twelve months&#x2019; period. The mobile team will provide comprehensive community screening, identification, treatment and referral services from community, IDP areas to the fixed OTP to improve access to the integrated package for the vulnerable community prioritizing rapid referral of the most critical cases (priority will be given to under 5 children and pregnant and lactating women), it shall also capacity building of nutrition staff on IMAM, infant young child feeding best practices, IYCF. Referral of malnourished children with complicated cases will be done to the OTP integrated with PHC services managed by NODO and other actors in the program areas thus providing more holistic opportunity to the target beneficiaries.

Increasingly erratic weather patterns and climatic shocks have led to prolonged and severe drought conditions with devastating humanitarian consequences. According to Puntland inter-agecy drought assessment report, the failure of three consecutive rains resulted in severe drought that has affected thousands of people in Puntland, where communities in Bari, Nugaal, Sool, Sanaag and Mudug regions are the most affected. Almost all water sources such Berkad, and shallow wells already dried up, and communities are now relying on few strategic water sources to access safe water.

In this project, NODO is aimed to improve access to life-saving WASH services for Iskushuban IDPs, host communities with recognition of people of disabilities, and the most vulnerable population through: -
1) Provision of safe water drinking with water vouchers for 45 days period. benefiting around 6,000 (1000 men, 4200 women, 400 girls, and 400 boys) drought affected IDPs and host communities will be under taken. 
2) NODO will also construct 35 flood-resistant latrines to benefit residents in Iskushuban IDP sites which will also receive the clean water and hygiene promotions and hygiene kits. 5 of the 35 latrines will be preserved for people with disabilities living in the target locations.
3) A total of 2,500 (500 men, 1500 women, 250 girls, and 250 boys) people will benefit from access to the sanitation, 
4) 2500 Households will benefit from hygiene kit distribution and hygiene awareness, 
5) WASH committees will be established in addition, carry out environmental sanitation services to all project target locations especially IDP camps to improve all preventive measures against the risks of AWD/cholera outbreaks in Iskushuban district,</narrative>
