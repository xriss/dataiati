  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The humanitarian situation in Ceelwaaq district of Gedo region is a critical and this is resulted by conflict and drought. Furthermore, limited availability and accessibility of integrated lifesaving health care services including and Mental Health Psychosocial support services and GBV services, unavailability of women friendly safe spaces, limited skills of health professionals in providing medical assistance, poor legal system and overcrowding among others. 
The most significant outcome of drought, conflict and other circumstances of violence is an impact of the mental health and psychosocial well-being of the people affected. ARD has long standing partnership with UNFPA through health system, psychosocial support, on stop GBV center for CMR in Gedo region. To address needs of lifesaving health care including MHPSS and GBV effectively, ARD proposes to implement integrated primary health care including MHPSS and GBV interventions through two mobile outreach team in Ceelwaaq district. Mobile outreach team one will be targeted in Ceelwaaq town while mobile outreach team two targeting  six surrounded villages  (Buulcadey, Duduma Abdi , Duula garas Dheeka, Dharkayn dhooqa and Buula Bardhere) in Ceelwaaq district. ARD will closely work with HDC on referral and coordination for timely response. Complicated cases will be referral to HDC&#x2019; health centers in Elwak district. 
ARD&apos;s health activities include:
Provision of life-saving primary health care services to 20,300 people (4,100 men, 3,500 boys,3,500 girls and 9,200 women) including PLWDs and minorities through mobile outreach services. The primary health care service will include essential clinical care, communicable disease treatment, TB screening and treatment, emergency and trauma care.

Provide mental health/psychosocial consultation services to 1, 3000 drought affected people.
Provide immunization services through fixed and outreach team to 700 children (350 boys and 350 girls).
Health staff training on SRH/GBV and mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS) 
ARD GBV activities include
Provide Clinical Management of Rape services to 200 GBV survivors with equal access to male and female survivors through mobile outreach services. PEP kits will be received from UNFPA.
Support direct cash assistance for drought affected population targeting 100 vulnerable women and girls to mitigate GBV (including pregnant and lactating women). Mobilize PSS actors to provide one on one and group counselling services, targeting 520 (70 men, 50 boys, 100 girls and 300 women).Procurement and distribution of dignity and menstrual hygiene kits to 500 vulnerable women and girls in Ceelwaaq district. Field visit monitoring and PDM  for cash and dignity and menstrual hygiene kits will conduct. 

We would like to note that ARD is working closely with partners to monitor and respond to drought and will plan to modify and adapt programme activities according to the emerging situation if necessary. A Conflict-Sensitive Approach will be implemented throughout the project cycle. Resilience operations are assured through ARD&#x2019;s risk reporting protocols and minimum operating security standards (to staff, beneficiaries, infrastructure, and resources). Services provided by the mobile clinics will be monitored through a file tracking system that will ensure accurate input of data for every registered patient. 
ARD will work in liaison with various stakeholders in the implementation of the project among them (Federal Ministry of Health) FMOH, UNICEF, WHO Somalia and the community.</narrative>
