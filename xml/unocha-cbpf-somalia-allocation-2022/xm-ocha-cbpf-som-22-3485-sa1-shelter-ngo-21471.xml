   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Integrated Emergency Shelter/NFIs and CCCM/HLP Support for Drought-affected Communities in Luuq and Bardere in Gedo</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project is a response to the drought currently ravaging different parts of Somalia and will focus on Luuq and Bardere districts in Gedo.  The project will target IDP households that have been displaced by the current drought and have not received similar support previously.  Each of the targeted 2493 households including 1180 in Luuq and 1313 in Bardere  will  receive both an emergency shelter and NFI kit to reach a total of 14,958 individuals including 2543 men, 2767 women, 5011 boys and 4637 girls camping in, or residing around 11 camps. The camps include Akaro, Busley, Duyacley, Busley (Luuq), Mandeeq, Towfiiq, Horseed, Tawakal, Ceel Waaq, Camp Jirix and Al Aamin (Bardere). 10% of the beneficiaries will be drawn from host communities. Prior to the formulation of this proposal, HAPEN and NOFYL, a partner organization working in the same areas have been observing the trends of displacement and drought effects before conducting a quick survey of the needs. Consequently, the two reached a consensus to implement an integrated intervention featuring Shelter amp NFIs on one hand and CCCM amp Housing, Land amp Property (HLP) on the other.

All the camps selected have a significant number of newly arrived IDPs and protracted IDPs who have not received shelter and NFIs support for at least two years. It has been observed that the IDPs are living in small makeshift structures where their privacy, physical security, protection and generally their dignity is compromised. Since the IDPs have mostly settled within the confines of the urban poor, support to the IDPs cannot be expected from the hosts. 

The ESKs and NFIs will be provided in kind in order to minimize diversion from the shelter and NFIs and protect the weak local markets where inflation follows cash injection and makes items more unaffordable especially to non beneficiaries. While the NFIs will be ready to use, ESKs will be provided and construction support given through an owner-driven approach where benefiting household is assisted and trained to undertake the construction. The process will also enable them to undertake basic repairs using local materials or rebuild their shelters in future. The approach also contributes significantly to sustainability of the project. 

Selection criteria will be widely discussed to ensure acceptance before embarking on a community-led selection process. Women, minorities, youth and people living with disabilities are among the vulnerable groups that the project will be keen to reach out to for participation as the tendency in the context of the project areas would be to leave them out. A community response and feedback mechanism (CFRM) will employ a combination of approaches including CFRM desks, a hotline, camp leaders and community alders acting as conduits to collect and convey feedback and grievances from community members. 

Proper application of selection criteria, participation of the affected population, inclusion of the vulnerable, quality and quantities of items delivered and effectiveness of the project among others will be assessed for learning through third party Post Distribution/Construction Monitoring (PDM/PCM). The PCM and PDM will be conducted concurrently after at least one month following the distribution and will seek to target 90% of the beneficiaries to ensure proper representation and accuracy. Internal monitoring is also provided for to ensure the project remains on track.

The project will employ an integrated approach with NOFYL undertaking CCCM and HLP activities in the same districts. The two partners will undertake common approaches in mobilization, selection of beneficiaries, inclusion, feedback mechanisms, protection and capacity building among the two teams. CCCM and HLP services including strengthening of safe access to multi sectorial and addressing of eviction risks, land tenure security and general protection will complement shelter and NFI services and enhance the overall project impact.</narrative>
