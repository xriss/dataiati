   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The shrimp aquaculture industry has grown rapidly over the last two decades and has become increasingly important for the national economy. However, the rapid growth of shrimp farming has created a range of environmental, social and economic challenges. Policies have failed to account for the environmental effects and the value of benefits from local ecosystem services. Unsustainable practices and poor regulation have increased volatility and hazards and resulted in greater risks and social inequality in shrimp farming communities. Producers are affected on farm-level profitability, and the long-term viability is threatened causing detrimental effects on all involved in the shrimp industry. In Vietam we aim for a desired situation where civil society effectively exercise their human and environmental rights and are actively influencing policy and market decisions to promote a green and socially inclusive transition of the aquaculture sector. The programme will support the formation of coalitions and alliances of smallholder cooperatives as well as the partner CSOs and their engagement in roundtable discussions and platform meetings with key industry stakeholders, such as the Public-Private Partnership for Sustainable Aquaculture. WWF has co-founded the Aquaculture Stewardship Council (ASC) aiming to transform the global seafood market and promoting the best environmental and social practices through a global certification programme. Thus, the shrimp farmers are required to improve performance around biodiversity impacts, responsible and traceable feed, water and soil pollution, disease outbreaks, and social and labor issues. It is especially needed to establish market mechanisms that incites smallholder shrimp farmers to adopt sustainable production practices such as the ASC. Overall, an integrated approach is required, one that considers broader issues such as poverty reduction and resilience for poor vulnerable groups, to ensure disadvantaged groups are not left behind.</narrative>
