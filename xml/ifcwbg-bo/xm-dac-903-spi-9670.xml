Location of project and Description of site    	Comsur operates seven mines in the north-west of Bolivia, all but one located in remote areas of Bolivia&apos;&apos;s Altiplano.    Description of Company and Purpose of Project    	Comsur, a medium-sized poly-metallic mining company in Bolivia and an existing IFC client, has requested IFC&apos;&apos;s support to finance its capital expenditure program over the next five years. Comsur will invest in its mines in Bolivia in order to replace mining equipment, construct shafts in two of its underground mines and make improvements in tailings dams. The capital expenditure program will allow Comsur to achieve its production targets and remain a low-cost zinc producer.      Environmental Category and Issues   	   This is a category B project according to IFCs environmental review procedure, because specific impacts which may result can be avoided or mitigated by adhering to generally recognized performance standards, guidelines or design criteria. The review of the project consisted of two parts: i) the technical assessment and site review of Comsurs current operations in Bolivia, and ii) the appraisal of environmental and social information submitted by the project sponsor, and completed by IFCs and Environment and Social staff. The following potential environmental, health and safety, and social impacts of the project were analyzed: air emissions; water quality; tailings dams safety; occupational health and safety in relation to design, construction and operation of new shafts; resettlement and land acquisition; and public consultation.    Based on its assessment of current activities, IFCs Environmental Unit concludes that Comsur is in compliance with Bolivian and IFC/World Bank environmental and social requirements. On the basis of the review of available information regarding potential environmental impacts and proposed mitigation measures, IFC concludes that the proposed project will also meet the above-mentioned requirements.
