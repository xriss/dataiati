The results of each operational review will be compiled in a report along with recommendations for strengthening of the CCT programme. (2)  Conduct three rounds of spot checks at payment points and collect feedback directly from beneficiaries and payment service providers of the UCT and the CCT programmes to assess compliance with procedures, and identify good practices, risks, and opportunities for improvements and social accountability. The service provider will develop a report for each round of spot check and beneficiary feedback.  (3)  Collect data from the field to support DFID in verification of achievements of selected DLIs as per the agreed DLI verification protocols, including review of BISP reports submitted to DFID as evidence of achievement of the DLIs.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The primary recipient of the B-FORM deliverables will be the Government of Pakistan (BISP) for outputs from Strand 1 and Strand 2. The information from spot checks, beneficiary feedback and, operational reviews of the CCT will facilitate BISP to improve its operational effectiveness, strengthen systems, accessibility, and social accountability. Strand 1 and Strand 2 reports will also be made available to other stakeholders (e.g. development partners such as the World Bank and Asian Development (ADB) on need basis. Strand 3 outputs are to be used by DFID for verification of achievement of the DLI targets.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Under the Pakistan National Cash Transfers Programme (PNCTP), DFID is providing up to ?300.3 million to the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP) over a period of eight years from 2012 to 2020: ?279 million in non-budget support financial aid and ?21 million in technical assistance. The PNCTP aims to contribute to making the incomes of the families living in the bottom two income quintiles predictable and increase the enrolment of children from the bottom two income quintiles in schools by strengthening the institutional capacity and core systems of BISP. This will raise the living standards of the poorest through reduced vulnerability and hunger and, improved human development. DFID has recently completed a mid-term review (MTR) of the PNCTP. Overall, PNCTP has met expectations in terms of progress on objectives and outputs and  is on track to support the Government to build a nationally owned social safety net that promotes welfare and human development outcomes for the poor. DFID support to BISP until March 2020 will focus on building institutional capacity and strengthening of core systems: the National SocioEconomic Registry (NSER), payment system, communications, fiduciary controls, and capacity of local offices. DFID will also support BISP to improve performance of the CCT systems for enrolment and attendance compliance, and increase its coverage from 1.3 million children to at least 2.5 million children so that they have support to enrol in and stay in primary schools. The CCT programme is currently operating in 32 districts but there is huge potential as well as demand for expanding the programme to additional districts. In addition, substantial work is needed to formalise collaboration with provinces to use common systems and to align the targets with sectoral objectives.</narrative>
