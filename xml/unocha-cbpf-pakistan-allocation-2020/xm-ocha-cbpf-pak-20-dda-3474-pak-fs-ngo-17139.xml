  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project aims to contribute to the PHPF 1st allocation strategy&#x2019;s objective of  providing humanitarian support to those whose livelihoods are severely affected and suffering from food insecurity. The project also targets to respond to the recent floods of August 2020.  

Following the floods, we carried out a Rapid damage and needs assessment and are proposing the following union councils:
TEHSIL GANDAWA: Union Councils Khari, Patri, Mirpur and 
TEHSIL JHAL MAGSI: Union Council Mat Sundar

During the need assessment, we found that different groups have different needs. There are those who have suffered significant losses and are unable to meet daily food consumption needs, their agriculture infrastructure is damaged but they have access to seeds for next cropping season. For such beneficiaries we have proposed 3 cycles of cash transfers through Cash for Work.

On the other hand, there are affected families whose head is an elderly or PWD or have other chronic condition due to which they are unable to work, for such beneficiaries we have proposed unconditional cash transfers (3 cycles)

Then there are affected families who cannot meet their food consumption requirements and do not have any arrangements for next cropping season. Such families are at a high risk for missing sowing season and are prone to relying on negative coping mechanisms. For such families, we have proposed a CASH+ packages (combination of cash and in kind Crop support). This will enable the families to meet immediate food needs while ensuring they have adequate arrangement for next cropping season. They will be provided cash grants for two months whereas an agriculture inputs package will also be provided to them. The input package proposed is climate smart and promises better results in terms of yields and water use classifying the package as an innovation. Therefore, for diffusion of innovation and ensuring adaptability, we will use a Farmer&#x2019;s Field School (initially facilitated by our field teams) where farmers, on regular intervals, will gather in small groups and will share their learning, approaches, what works and what doenst while our staff will also provide key inputs. 

Particularly for females, we have proposed a locally suited and culturally contextualized solution. We will enhance house hold food security through kitchen gardening. Women will be trained on managing kitchen gardening, knowledge amp skills on nutritional diet and COVID 19 prevention. Then they will be provided with a kitchen gardening package including assorted seeds and tools. Our teams will provide demonstration during the training and women will be extended support for sowing and managing their kitchen gardens by our staff. On the other hand, women will also be enrolled in a Farmer Field School. Through that, they will meet in small groups and discuss their approaches to gardening thereby creating a platform for exchange of ideas and sharing lessons learned.

Lastly, there are beneficiaries who rely mainly on livestock farming. Their food security is linked with viable livestock raising and selling. Since the floods have severely affected the grazing lands (referring to our assessment report) we will ensure viability of these farmers and their grazing lands through provision of fodder seeds and related inputs. Without such inputs, these farmers are at the risk of being further pushed in misery since they are likely to suffer from livestock death, weight loss and selling the livestock on significant losses. 

Furthermore, we have been undertaking similar projects in same region since 2010 in partnership with UNWFP and UNFAO. Since September 2020, we are also implementing an emergency response project in partnership with IRC in proposed district Jhal Magsi. For cash transfers, irrigation infrastructure, kitchen gardening, FFS and Fodder packages, we have in-house highly qualified staff with relevant qualification.</narrative>
