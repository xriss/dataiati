    <narrative xml:lang="EN">Cabo Verde is one of Africa&apos;s success stories and an important U.S. partner in West Africa. A model of democratic governance, Cabo Verde enjoys a relatively high literacy rate, high per capita income, and positive health indicators. Its strategic location also means that Cabo Verde is increasingly at the crossroads of the transatlantic narcotics trade. Maritime security, domain awareness, and border control are among the highest priorities for the United States in Cabo Verde. U.S. foreign assistance in FY 2017 will continue to professionalize the military of Cabo Verde and build its capacity to respond more effectively to maritime security challenges, thereby helping the country to better access and develop potential wealth from national waters. U.S. assistance will be instrumental in allowing Cabo Verde to continue to develop and share its political and economic successes with neighbors in West Africa.</narrative>
