       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Acclab Indonesia was only fully operational in November 2020 when all three Heads were onboard. The AccLab team was participating in dedicated 4-week AccLab Bootcamp in October 2020. The Acclab team was introduced to the CO team in Programme Staff Meeting and also conducted internal collective intelligence session with CO, both on December. The CO has identified the frontier challenge of the Lab which is on urbanization and smart city, as well as identified key government partner, which is Ministry of Research and Technology. The team also expanded its initial network through active engagement with unusual partners such as SDG Office under Regional Government in Jakarta and Design Ethnography Lab in Bandung Institute of Technology.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Throughout 2021, the Accelerator Lab dedicated its efforts to strengthen the role of UNDP as a leader in Indonesia&#x2019;s innovation ecosystem through broadening its network with various government stakeholders (mainly The National Planning Ministry &#x2013; BAPPENAS and The National Research and Innovation Agency - BRIN), academic institutions (Design Ethnography Lab in Bandung Institute of Technology), civil society organizations (RUJAK Centre for Urban Studies and seven grassroot communities in different cities), private sector (Ecoxyztem Venture Builder) and other UN entities (UNESCO and UNDRR Office for Asia and Pacific). The team conducted lean research with BAPPENAS to influence policy design processes on flood mitigation, comprising of a public survey and ethnographic study, resulting in a community-based policy brief. In addition, the team also initiated and co-organized a capacity building initiative entitled &#x2018;Futures Thinking in Disaster and Resilience&#x2019; with UNESCO and UNDRR which consisted of webinars, participatory workshops, and public dialogues, inviting youth and young professionals throughout Asia Pacific. Lastly, the team also conducted the Urban Innovation Challenge, together with Ecoxyztem and supported by BRIN, that crowdsourced grassroots solutions on waste management (with the support of RESTORE project), MSME digitalization and smart city &#x2013; which will lead to a 6-months experimentation phase with the selected winners. In regards to programme integration, the team supported various initiative by other CO project such as DX4R for the InaRISK Hackathon Festival, DGPRU &#x2013; PVE on behavioural insights, and conducted a CO-wide initiative on &#x2018;Deep Demonstration&#x2019; with the support of Strategic Innovation Unit and BRH, among others.</narrative>
