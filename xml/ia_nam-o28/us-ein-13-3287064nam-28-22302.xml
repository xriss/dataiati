   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Improved access and utilization of health services are targeted on multiple levels; HPs as a first point of entry into basic essential health services, PHCs to provide an expanded package of services, and community-based services through the Community Health Worker  network. This project will positively impact health status not only of the general population, but with particular focus on pregnant and lactating women (PLW), children under five years and adolescents. At the same time, this project will improve health-seeking behaviour amongst the population concerned, increasing knowledge of preventable diseases and hygiene and thereby positively contributing to a reduction in the risk of communicable diseases. The Rohingya refugees  will have improved access to quality reproductive services through the continuation of existing services. This includes a better integration of family planning and contraceptive services in the essential service package, as well as increased capacity of the clinical staff to address Adolescent Sexual and Reproductive health (ASRH), with continued training of midwives to increase the quality of ANC, delivery and PNC care as well as overall rate of facility-based births in the refugee population.</narrative>
