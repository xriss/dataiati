   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The contribution is a support to the implementation of the last year of the CP 2015-2019 as well as the first year of the new CP 2020-2024. Since the start of the CP 2015-2019, important results have already been achieved, the context in Mali has changed in a significant way and new strategic direction has been provided at the global level. The CP for 2020-2024 was developed during 2019 and adopted in early 2020.
Taking into account that Sweden has a strong strategic partnership with UNICEF on a global level, it is relevant to document the global objectives and theory of change. The impact statement of UNICEF&#x2019;s global Strategic Plan, 2018&#x2013;2021, is &#x2019;Realizing the rights of every child, especially the most disadvantaged&#x2019;. This envisaged impact will be contributed to through five Goal Areas:
(a) Every child survives and thrives;
(b) Every child learns;
(c) Every child is protected from violence and exploitation;
(d) Every child lives in a safe and clean environment;
(e) Every child has an equitable chance in life.
These five global goal areas have been further defined through 25 outputs, 8 change strategies, 4 enablers and two cross-cutting areas (humanitarian and development nexus and gender integration) for which UNICEF is fully accountable. The change strategies give insight on how UNICEF works; &#xA0;
(a) Programme at scale;
(b) Gender-responsive programming;
(c) Winning support for the cause of children from decision makers and the wider public;
(d) Developing and leveraging resources and partnerships for children;
(e) Harnessing the power of business and markets for children;
(f) United Nations working together;
(g) Fostering innovation for children;
(h) Harnessing the power of evidence as a driver of change for children.
In Mali, the new vision of the CP 2020-2024 is that children and adolescents, both girls and boys, especially the most disadvantaged, deprived and hard-to-reach and those affected by crises, live and participate in resilient communities, enjoying a protective, nurturing and supportive environment that allows them to unlock their full potential throughout their lives.
UNICEF has opted to build their CP 2020-2024 based on the life cycle of the child. UNICEF has defined bottle necks and theories of change. The vision will be achieved if:
(a) more children aged 0 to 5 years and their mothers and caregivers have access to and use quality basic social services;
(b) communities are child-friendly and engaged and nurture children&#x2019;s early physical, emotional and cognitive development;
(c) more children aged 6 to 12 years are enrolled in schools with adequate water and sanitation and a protective environment that champion high-quality learning and respond to increased social demand for diversified education options;
(d) more children aged 6 to 12 years benefit from integrated health, nutrition and protection services allowing them to thrive and succeed in school and beyond;
(e) more adolescent girls and boys aged 13 to 18 years have access to high-quality learning to boost their employability and are engaged in communities that promote child-friendly behaviours and protect them from violence;
(f) young girls and boys and their communities have increased skills and space to demand their rights and participate in decision-making and have enhanced capacities for civic engagement, peacebuilding and social cohesion; and
(g) social services are more gender-responsive, more integrated and better tailored to the needs of girls and boys at different stages of their lives.
The life-cycle approach recognizes the intersectoral and mutually reinforcing nature of the key results for children (KRC); a more robust approach to early childhood and to the second decade; the empowerment of adolescents and the positioning of girls as key actors of change; and the linking of humanitarian and development programming while building community resilience will bring about innovative strategies for results at scale. The above has been translated to a transformative agenda through three key windows of opportunity, supported by two cross-cutting programme components:
(a) The early years (0&#x2013;5 years), focusing on health, nutrition, birth registration, water and sanitation, protection and early learning for school readiness;
(b) The formative years (6&#x2013;12 years), facilitating successful transitions, with an emphasis on safe and inclusive quality education and the prevention of violence and exploitation;
(c) The second decade (13&#x2013;18 years), focusing on adolescent empowerment, skills development, well-being, the promotion of child-friendly behaviours and the prevention of violence and exploitation;
(d) An enabling environment for community resilience through active participation in social service management, monitoring and social protection;
(e) Programme effectiveness.
As mentioned above, Sweden is supporting three components of the CP 2015-2019 and has decided to continue supporting the same thematic areas of the CP 2020-2024. The theories of change for each component in the CP 2020-2024 are described below, highlighting the behavioural changes to be achieved.
Water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH)
The WASH component of the CP 2020-2024 aims to ensure that communities, families, women and children in Mali, in particular those in rural and semi-urban areas as well as those affected by humanitarian crisis, have access to sustainable drinking water and sanitation services and practices adequate hygiene and environmental behaviours. To achieve this change, UNICEF WASH focuses on two main results;
1) By 2024, the most vulnerable communities, families, women and children in rural and semi-urban areas as well as those affected by humanitarian crisis have new means and services to sustainably access drinking water and basic sanitation
2) By 2024, schools and health centres have adequate water and sanitation infrastructure as well as improved hygiene conditions, especially the most vulnerable in rural and semi-urban areas as well as those affected by humanitarian crisis.
The main actors that have been identified in the theory of change to have key roles to play include the private sector, the decision makers and the financial and technical partners. The private sector is needed to support the government and the communities with sufficient technical and financial resources, the decision makers are needed to provide strategic direction and coordination and financial and technical partners are needed to support the scaling up of service provision and capacity building.
At component level, seven change strategies have been identified; production of data and evidence, strengthening the multi-sectoral approach, developing innovative financing mechanisms and public private partnerships, strengthen institutional capacities as well as those of local authorities, strengthen communities with a gender approach in the decision-making process and management of WASH, stimulate the demand of sanitation and a clean environment while developing the local WASH market for service provision and, finally, integrate humanitarian, development and social cohesion approaches while developing climate resilient WASH services. At this level, the role of women is specifically highlighted with respect to decision-making while gender aspects such as specific WASH needs of women and girls have been integrated in the implementation, follow up and analysis.
Child protection
The Child protection component of the CP 2020-2024 aims to ensure that children and adolescents, girls and boys, in vulnerable areas, including in humanitarian situations, are better protected against violence, exploitation and traditional practises. The Child protection component focuses on three main results;
1) By 2024, adolescents, girls and boys, benefit from an integrated and evidence-based system that protects from sexual and physical violence and exploitation and that is adapted to regional contexts and both humanitarian and development needs.
2) By 2024, adolescents, girls and boys, are equipped to protect themselves against gender-based violence, child marriage and FGM and to evolve in a social, legal and policy environment that is favourable to gender equality and autonomy of girls.
3) By 2024, all children, including those living in humanitarian contexts, receive birth certificates at birth and all children and adolescents that are victim, witness or in conflict with the law benefit from a fair, equitable and gender sensitive justice system that is adapted to contextual needs.
The draft theory of change and draft strategic paper for the child protection component highlights all actors that play a key role in the lives of children, starting with the children and adolescents themselves. The community and the parents are given a particular attention, including how inter-generational dialogue can be promoted. Similarly, linking the traditional protection system and the modern justice system is emphasized. Overall, an integrated system to ensure protection is needed.
The change strategies that are included mainly address the capacity of the above-mentioned actors and systems. Expanding the partnerships and increase resource mobilization is also included as a main change strategy. The strategic paper further explains that corporate social responsibility can be a lever and a way for UNICEF to diversify financial resources. &#xA0;&#xA0;
Social inclusion
The social inclusion component aims to ensure that all children live in a socio-economic environment that favors their ability to exercise their fundamental rights and that offers equitable chances to realize their full potential. The following three key results have been defined;
1) By 2024, the local and national state structures have sufficient technical capacity to use and analyze data on poverty in the process of elaborating public policies and during the implementation of social protection programs.
2) By 2024, the local and national actors have increased capacity to conceive, coordinate and implement integrated social protection systems and inclusive policies.
3) By 2024, the local and national actors are better equipped to raise, allocate and manage public resources that better supports children.
Also in the social inclusion component, a range of actors are required to reach the impact and outcome objectives. Similar change strategies as for the global theory of change are identified for this component in Mali. The main difference is that the focus is rather on implementing the existing program rather than scaling up and the community and civil society engagement is given more importance than collaborating with the private sector and &#x201C;harnessing the power of business and markets for children&#x201D;.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">UNICEF and Sweden have in dialogue agreed to continue the longstanding bilateral collaboration in Mali. The contribution that this decision refers to is a support to the implementation of the last year of the Country Programme (CP) 2015-2019 as well as the first year of the new CP 2020-2024. Since the start of the current CP, important results have already been achieved, the context in Mali has changed in a significant way and new strategic direction has been provided at the global level. The CP for 2020-2024 is under development and is expected to take these changes into account. Preliminary theories of change are available for each component that Sweden will continue to finance, including information on the main changes envisaged and the stakeholders that are expected to change their attitudes, relations or behaviours. Specific targets and indicators will be further defined during the year. 

Water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH)

The WASH component of the CP 2020-2024 aims to ensure that communities, families, women and children in Mali, in particular those in rural and semi-urban areas as well as those affected by humanitarian crisis, have access to sustainable drinking water and sanitation services and practices adequate hygiene and environmental behaviours.

Child protection 

The Child protection component of the CP 2020-2024 aims to ensure that children and adolescents, girls and boys, in vulnerable areas, including in humanitarian situations, are better protected against violence, exploitation and traditional practises. The Child protection component focuses on three main results; 

1) By 2024, adolescents, girls and boys, benefit from an integrated and evidence-based system that protects from sexual and physical violence and exploitation and that is adapted to regional contexts and both humanitarian and development needs. 

2) By 2024, adolescents, girls and boys, are equipped to protect themselves against gender-based violence, child marriage and FGM and to evolve in a social, legal and policy environment that is favourable to gender equality and autonomy of girls. 

3) By 2024, all children, including those living in humanitarian contexts, receive birth certificates at birth and all children and adolescents that are victim, witness or in conflict with the law benefit from a fair, equitable and gender sensitive justice system that is adapted to contextual needs.

   <narrative xml:lang="SV">UNICEF och Sverige har i dialog kommit &#xF6;verens om att forts&#xE4;tta det l&#xE5;ngvariga bilaterala samarbetet i Mali. Detta beslut h&#xE4;nvisar till ett st&#xF6;d till genomf&#xF6;randet av det sista &#xE5;ret av landprogrammet 2015&#x2013;2019 samt det f&#xF6;rsta &#xE5;ret av det nya programmet 2020&#x2013;2024. Det kommande landprogrammet &#xE4;r under utveckling och tar h&#xE4;nsyn till att viktiga resultat har uppn&#xE5;tts de senaste fyra &#xE5;ren, att kontexten i Mali har f&#xF6;r&#xE4;ndrats p&#xE5; ett betydande s&#xE4;tt och att ny strategisk riktning har tillhandah&#xE5;llits p&#xE5; global niv&#xE5;. Prelimin&#xE4;ra f&#xF6;r&#xE4;ndringsteorier finns tillg&#xE4;ngliga f&#xF6;r varje komponent som Sverige forts&#xE4;tter att finansiera, inklusive information om de huvudsakliga f&#xF6;r&#xE4;ndringarna som planeras och de akt&#xF6;rer som f&#xF6;rv&#xE4;ntas &#xE4;ndra sina attityder, relationer eller beteenden. M&#xE5;l och indikatorer kommer att definieras ytterligare under 2019. 

Vatten, sanitet och hygien (WASH)

WASH-komponenten i landprogrammet 2020&#x2013;2024 syftar till att s&#xE4;kerst&#xE4;lla att samh&#xE4;llen, familjer, kvinnor och barn i Mali, s&#xE4;rskilt p&#xE5; landsbygden och i semi-urbana omr&#xE5;den samt dem som drabbas av humanit&#xE4;ra kriser, har tillg&#xE5;ng till vatten, sanitet och hygien. F&#xF6;r att uppn&#xE5; denna f&#xF6;r&#xE4;ndring fokuserar UNICEF WASH p&#xE5; tv&#xE5; huvudresultat;

1) &#xC5;r 2024 har de mest utsatta samh&#xE4;llena, familjer, kvinnor och barn p&#xE5; landsbygden, i semi-urbana omr&#xE5;den samt dem som drabbats av humanit&#xE4;r kris nya medel och tj&#xE4;nster f&#xF6;r att s&#xE4;kerst&#xE4;lla h&#xE5;llbar tillg&#xE5;ng till dricksvatten och grundl&#xE4;ggande sanitet. 

2) &#xC5;r 2024 har skolor och v&#xE5;rdinstitutioner tillg&#xE5;ng till vatten och sanitet samt f&#xF6;rb&#xE4;ttrade hygienf&#xF6;rh&#xE5;llanden, s&#xE4;rskilt de mest s&#xE5;rbara p&#xE5; landsbygden, i semi-urbana omr&#xE5;den samt dem som drabbats av humanit&#xE4;r kris.

Skydd av barn 

Barnskyddskomponenten i landprogrammet 2020&#x2013;2024 syftar till att s&#xE4;kerst&#xE4;lla att barn och ungdomar, flickor och pojkar, i utsatta omr&#xE5;den, inklusive i humanit&#xE4;ra situationer, &#xE4;r b&#xE4;ttre skyddade mot v&#xE5;ld, utnyttjande och traditionell praxis av skadlig natur. Barnskyddskomponenten fokuserar p&#xE5; tre huvudresultat;

1) &#xC5;r 2024 drar ungdomar, flickor och pojkar nytta av ett integrerat och bevisbaserat system som skyddar mot sexuellt och fysiskt v&#xE5;ld och exploatering, anpassat till den regionala kontexten samt humanit&#xE4;ra och utvecklingsbehov.

2) &#xC5;r 2024 har ungdomar, flickor och pojkar kapacitet att skydda sig mot k&#xF6;nsbaserat v&#xE5;ld, barn&#xE4;ktenskap och k&#xF6;nsstympning samt att utvecklas i en social, juridisk och politisk milj&#xF6; som &#xE4;r gynnsam f&#xF6;r flickors j&#xE4;mst&#xE4;lldhet och sj&#xE4;lvst&#xE4;ndighet.

3) &#xC5;r 2024 har alla barn, inklusive de som lever i humanit&#xE4;ra situationer, tillg&#xE5;ng till f&#xF6;delsebevis vid f&#xF6;dseln och alla barn och ungdomar som &#xE4;r offer, vittne eller i strid med lagen gynnas av ett r&#xE4;ttvist och k&#xF6;nssensitivt r&#xE4;ttssystem som har anpassats till kontexten.

Social integration

Landprogrammets komponent som fokuserar p&#xE5; social integration syftar till att s&#xE4;kerst&#xE4;lla att alla barn lever i en socioekonomisk milj&#xF6; som gynnar deras f&#xF6;rm&#xE5;ga att ut&#xF6;va sina grundl&#xE4;ggande r&#xE4;ttigheter och som ger r&#xE4;ttvisa m&#xF6;jligheter att uppn&#xE5; sin fulla potential. F&#xF6;ljande tre nyckelresultat har definierats;

1) &#xC5;r 2024 har de lokala och nationella statliga strukturerna tillr&#xE4;cklig teknisk kapacitet att anv&#xE4;nda och analysera data om fattigdom f&#xF6;r att utarbeta policy och f&#xF6;r att genomf&#xF6;ra sociala skyddsprogram.

2) &#xC5;r 2024 har de lokala och nationella akt&#xF6;rerna &#xF6;kad kapacitet att utforma, samordna och genomf&#xF6;ra integrerade sociala trygghetssystem och en inkluderande politik.

3) I &#xE5;r 2024 &#xE4;r de lokala och nationella akt&#xF6;rerna b&#xE4;ttre rustade att &#xF6;ka, f&#xF6;rdela och f&#xF6;rvalta offentliga resurser till f&#xF6;rm&#xE5;n f&#xF6;r barn.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">2020 was the first year of implementation of the new Country Programme 20202024,
which uses a life-cycle approach and recognizes the intersectoral reinforcing nature of the
key results for children. The programme contributes to the CREDD, the Sustainable
Development Goals and the African Union Agenda 2063.
It is aligned with the United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework
(UNSDCF) 20202024, the United Nations integrated strategy for the Sahel, UNICEF
Strategic Plan, 20182021 and UNICEF Gender Action Plan. 2020 was also a very
challenging year.

The flexible thematic contribution from Sweden is continuously emphasized to be very
valuable to the UNICEF WASH, social inclusion, and child protection team in terms of
allowing UNICEF to couple funds with other donors for the most impact, adapting to a
new situation (such as the current Covid-19 pandemic) and working across the
humanitarian-development- peace nexus approach.
The Swedish funds are also important contributions that allows UNICEF to address
 structural issues in the north, not only meeting humanitarian needs. Additionally, the
 thematic contribution from the Government of Sweden, allowed UNICEF in Mali to
 respond to Covid-19 in many ways in 2020.

WASH
As part of the COVID-19 pandemic response, thanks to the flexibility of the thematic
 funds from the Government of Sweden, UNICEF was able to contribute to the
 implementation of the national response plan. In total, 338,588 people (89,557 men,
 89,895 women, 159,136 children) were sensitized on the key messages and actions for
the prevention and control of COVID-19 and were provided with hygiene promotion
materials. Among them, 11,075 households are Internal Displaced People 8,364 of them
benefited from safe water through water trucking (50,184 persons: 13,324 women,
13,274 men; 11,818 girls and 11,768 boys) in Mopti and Gao.
The overall trend within the WASH sector in Mali in 2020 remains more or less the
 same with progress in terms of number of people gaining access to drinking water, high
population growth which limits the percent access to WASH, challenges in the sanitation
sector (lack of funds due to a focus on water among donors and related to behavioral
change), great disparities between urban and rural areas and rich and poor, a high
dependency of external funds within the sector and persisting humanitarian needs where
WASH funding is low.

At community level, during the reporting period, 172,011 new people (79 per cent of
2020 target), including 91,443 women, 80,568 men and 20,783 children under 5 live in 184 ODF certified communities in the regions of Koulikoro, Sikasso, Mopti and Menaka
through the direct support of UNICEF in 2020. With special thanks to the thematic
funds, UNICEF ensured access to clean water to vulnerable people including women and
children (boys and girls). Furthermore, 61,110 new people (32,847 children) gained
permanent access to potable drinking water through the construction/rehabilitation of
modern water facilities in the regions of, Mopti, Gao and Timbuktu.
The coordination of the sector remains weak due to the presence of several donors with
varying agendas and thematic focus as well as the weak capacity of
 the DNH and the DNACPN.

Social inclusion
UNICEF reports that the sector in 2020 is marked by the combined effects of social,
 political, and economic shocks. In response to these changes, which continue to have an
undeniable impact on households, unprecedented social measures have been deployed as
a short-term response. Despite these efforts, the additional needs in terms of both depth
and quantity, which come up against a limited structural supply of basic social services,
have challenged the government&apos;s ability to fulfil its obligations.
The financial support from Sweden supported a collaborative approach based on joint
 programmes to ensure consistency and complementarity of interventions.

Child protection
2020 was an exceptionally challenging year for the entire humanity and in a country like
Mali, affected by multiple structural, chronic, political and security problems the impact
on children was particularly heavy. The COVID pandemic, the coup d&#xE9;tat and the
consequent transitional government, the increased violence had major repercussions on
children and adolescents&apos; vulnerabilities, well-being, and protection. E.g., the number of
reported grave violations against children in the northern and central region stood at
1,013, which represents 36 per cent increase compared to 2019 (745 grave violations).
 Increased access to psychosocial support for children: COVID-19 has hindered
 community-based psychosocial support activities due to restrictions on gatherings that
led to the closure of some child-friendly spaces (CFS) and other safe spaces. However,
UNICEF and partners came up with 10 adjustments to ensure the continuity of these key
services for children. Adjustments included setting-up mobile teams to provide
recreational and psychosocial activities within families, which proved successful in
delivering quality psychosocial services.

In 2020, a total of 783 children from 6 to 12 years (359 girls) who experienced physical,
sexual or emotional violence were reached with social, health and/or legal services
through UNICEF Program, (78.3 per cent of the annual target). Among them 81 girls
and 5 boys were survivors of sexual violence. Additionally, in 2020, 143 children from 0
to 5 years (57 Girls) who experienced physical, sexual or emotional violence were reached with social, health and/or legal services, among them 1 girl and 1 boy were
survivors of sexual violence</narrative>
