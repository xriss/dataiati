Support the State Capacity in sustainable management of environment and climate change

Mali runs from the Sahara on the edge of the Guinean Forests to the Ivory Coast in the agroclimatic area of northern Guinea. Its annual rainfall varies greatly in terms of both time and location, ranging from 100mm in the north to around 1200mm in the south. About 70 percent of Mali&#x2019;s population of 14.5 million people (Census 2009) are engaged in agriculture and depend on natural resources for their livelihoods, economic development, and food security. Management systems over natural resources are poorly developed and rarely allow strong influence by users themselves or rural communes. Mali is a poor country whose agriculturally based economy remains under-diversified and susceptible to external shocks. Continued depletion of these natural resources will compromise the nation&#x2019;s health, food security, and economic development. Plant and animal diversity though high are decreasing tremendously. Five direct threats to biodiversity have been identified (climate change, agriculture, urbanization and loss of natural habitat, bush fires, the uncontrolled exploitation of wood as an energy source). Indirect threats identified include changes in human demographics, economic activity and technology, as well as sociopolitical and cultural factors.

About 70% of the population is rural. Households rely heavily on rain fed agriculture and pastures for livelihoods. Disputes between farmers and pastoralists over access to land and other natural resources are common. Sedentary farmers and transhumant pastoralists clash over issues of resource access and damage to crops, inheritance rights, and rights of access to water and pasture. 

The country&#x2019;s vulnerability to climate change patterns gives natural resources like trees, rangelands, and pastures importance. Over the years, the Malian government has attached high priority to developing effective strategies for environmental protection and management. In Mali, the main vulnerability pattern is the great climatic variability and the consequently high incidence of droughts and dry- spells affecting the livelihoods of farming, fishing and pastoralists communities.
The precise environmental problems among others are: 
&#x2022;	The extreme sensibility of the climate to warm;
&#x2022;	Fragile ecosystems;
&#x2022;	Unsustainable use of environment and natural resources; 
&#x2022;	The multiplicity of interveners without real coordination between government, private and civil society actors; 
&#x2022;	The law implementation of the urban development plans creating pollution and hazards in cities; 
&#x2022;	The weak budget allocated by the government to environment;
&#x2022;	The relatively poor policy and institutional framework namely the weak implementation;
&#x2022;	The lack of public awareness of environmental problems and the tools and regulations for their resolution; 
&#x2022;	The lack of public awareness of climate change problems and insufficient adaption and mitigation measures;
&#x2022;	The weak experience sharing among stakeholders.

The main negative impacts of climate change on communities are among others:
&#x2022;	Increased vulnerability and reduced resilience
&#x2022;	Decreased agricultural and pastoral productivity and family welfare
&#x2022;	Reduced livelihood options notably for herders and families headed by Women
&#x2022;	Decreased water resources availability
&#x2022;	Decreased fish stocks in rivers
&#x2022;	Increased food and livelihood insecurity
&#x2022;	Increased energy crises
&#x2022;	Increased public health and education problems
&#x2022;	Increased conflict patterns (access to natural resources and control over them)
&#x2022;	Increased marginalisation of youth and women in accessing and controlling over land resources as the customary laws are unfavourable to these groups. 

The Constitution of Mali of February 25, 1992 engages in its Preamble the Malian citizens &#x201C;to Assure the quality of life, to protect the environment and the cultural heritage&#x201D;. In its article 15, stipulates that &#x201C;The protection, the defense of the environment and the quality of life are a must for all and for the State&#x201D;. 

The General Development Policy Framework of Mali is based on its Strategic Framework for Economic Relaunch and Sustainable Development (2018-2023).
The state of Mali has taken concrete policy and strategic actions to address climate change, biodiversity conservation, Environmental Protection and Sustainable Land resources Management. Among others:
&#x2022;	Elaboration of its National Determined Contribution to reduce Green Gas emissions in 2015/2016 and the Set- up of a &#x201C;Coordination and implementation Cell&#x201D; in 2017
&#x2022;	Ratification of Paris&#x2019; Agenda on Climate Change in September 2016
&#x2022;	Integration of the UN Sustainable Development Goals in its Strategic Framework for Economic Rehabilitation and Sustainable Development (CREDD 2018-2023)
&#x2022;	Elaboration of a new Forestry Policy considering Gender, climate Change, decentralization and private forestry 
&#x2022;	Strategic Framework for investment and Sustainable Land Resources Management
&#x2022;	Ratification of the UN Framework Convention on climate Change on December 28, 1994
&#x2022;	The choice of the National Forests Directorate as the focal point of the UN Framework Convention on Biodiversity
&#x2022;	Elaboration and adoption of a new Environmental Protection Policy in 2019
&#x2022;	Ratification of the UN framework Convention on Biodiversity on March 29, 1995 
&#x2022;	The choice of the National Meteorological Directorate as the focal point of the UN Framework Convention on climate Change 
&#x2022;	Choice of a National Designed Authority Environmental and climate change matters called &#x201C;National Agency for Environment and Sustainable Development -AEDD)&#x201D; as the focal point of the Kyoto Protocol
&#x2022;	Adoption of a National Strategy on biodiversity conservation in 2000
&#x2022;	Elaboration of a National Climate Change Adaptation Action Plan in July 2007 with 19 priority projects
&#x2022;	Elaboration of a National Policy and Strategy on climate change. 

In addition to the above actions, some practical decisions have been taken in order to add partially the bio- diesel to fossil fuels up to 20% by 2023. A National Agency for the Development of biofuels (ANADED) has been created. In the type of fragile and sensitive Malian agroecosystems, farmers have developed through time diverse, adapted and dynamic genetic materials using their experimental knowledge of soils, climate, plants, selections, breeding, exchange of information and germplasm storability. Because of both external, human induced and natural factors, lack of partnerships and favourable policies, the traditional farming systems, however, tend to lose ground and are exposed to the risk of losses of time-tested knowledge, genetic erosion and irreversible land degradation processes.

Environmental issues in Mali include desertification, deforestation, soil erosion, drought, and inadequate supplies of potable water. Deforestation is an especially serious and growing problem. According to the Ministry of the Environment, Mali&#x2019;s population consumes 6 million tons of wood per year for timber and fuel. To meet this demand, 4,000 square kilometers of tree cover are lost annually, virtually ensuring destruction of the country&#x2019;s savanna woodlands. 
One of Mali&apos;s major environmental issues as stated is desertification. Mali has been in a drought altering with floods for decades now and it is really affecting the country. Soil erosion, deforestation, and loss of pastureland are all major problems in Mali. Mali also has a shortening water supply.
To help sustain Mali&apos;s ever-growing problem the government has assigned 3.7 percent of Mali&#x2019;s total land area protected. It has ratified international environmental agreements and conventions pertaining to biodiversity, climate change, desertification, Endangered species, and Ozone Layer Protection etc. 
According to the U.N. FAO, 10.2% or about 12,490,000 ha of Mali is forested. Mali had 530,000 ha of planted forest. Change in forest cover: Between 1990 and 2010, Mali lost an average of 79,100 ha or 0.56% per year, totaling to a loss of 11.2%, or around 1,582,000 ha, during that period. 

Environment being part of the Constitution and the President of the Republic warranting the application of Terms of the Constitution, one can say that the institutional set- up of environmental issues in Mali starts from the &#x201C;Presidency of the Republic&#x201D;. But the environmental issues has no coordination level at the &quot;Presidency of the Republic&quot; making it lower in most of the development policies and budget alocations. 

The National Assembly having an environmental Sub-Commission under the Rural Development Commission has also a key role to play in proposing and adopting policy innovations in environment.

The High Council of Territorial Collectivities has also a key role to play in Environment and Climate Change as the 1992 Constitution pronounced the principles of decentralization while follow-up legislation of 1993 (Loi 93-003) created the general framework. This legislation was updated by the law No: 2017-051 of October 2, 2017 on local territorial administration. Local task forces are set up to create the territorial units, define the regulations for territorial apportionment and build administrative capacity at the local level. Legislation in 1993 established the current structure consisting of &#x201C;r&#xE9;gions&quot; (regions), &quot;cercles&quot; (districts) and &quot;communes&quot; (communes) as &quot;collectivit&#xE9;s territoriales&quot; (territorial units) in rural areas. - Currently Mali has 10 regions (plus Bamako), 49 cercles and 703 communes. New additional regions as well as new communes are under creation, meaning that decentralization is foreseen to be the main pathway to development in the coming years
in Mali.
Finally, the Economic and Social Council of Mali representing the Civil Society and Private sector members has also a key role to play in the concerned matters.

Environmental and climate change issues in terms of operational policy coordination/governance is under the ministry of Environment, Sanitation and sustainable development created in 2005.
Under the Ministry, stands the National Environmental Council created through the decree N&#xB0;10-390/PM-RM of July 26, 2010. This Council includes State, Civil Society, Private Sector et local governments&#x2019; stakeholders. Itis duty is to give informed opinions on environmental and climate change issues and processes and formulate recommendations. A National Climate Change Committee created in 2011 helps the government in guiding the implementation of favorable climate change adaptation and mitigation initiatives. Under this Committee, the Unit for the coordination of the Nationally Determined Contribution of Mali (NDC Mali) to reduce its green gas emissions was created in 2018.

Under the Ministry, there are:
The National Directorate for Sanitation, Pollutions and nuisances Control
The National Fauna and Forests Directorate
The National Agency for Environment and Sustainable development. The Agency was created in 2010. Its mission statement is to assure the coordination and the implementation of the National policies in environment and climate changes making sure that these two themes are integrated to all macroeconomic and sector policies and strategies. The agency is also in charge of resources mobilization in favor of environment and climate change. Finally, it assures the coordination between national environment and climate change policies and the multilateral treaties and conventions. 
The National Agency of Management of Waste Infrastructures

The National Agency of The Niger River Basin.
Under the Ministry of Mines and Water, there are:
The National Hydraulic Directorate
The National Agency for Domestic Energy and rural Electrification
The Malian Agency for Renewable Energy.
As one can see, the &#x201C;atomization&#x201D; of the Institutions and Structures dealing with Environment Coordination in Mali is a reality. In addition to that, the number and quality of staffs are adequate. Many overlaps between duties are other realities making environmental and climate change coordination a stake. AEDD dealing with the operational coordination does not the appropriate staff while the ministry in Charge of environmental dealing the policy and institutional coordination is among the weakest in the country with an annual state budget allocation of about 1% of the country budget Since 2012, the institutional instability with an average a new appointed minister each 8 months in average adds to the obscure picture.

Through a lengthy process, the donor&#x2019;s harmonization and coordination group in Environment and climate change together with the government of Mali have elaborated a &#x201C;Conceptual Note&#x201D; on the current situation of the Institutions and Structures in charge of the Coordination in Environment and climate change.  Following this, the government submitted Terms and References to the donors&#x2019; community for organizational audits (self-assessment audits and external audits) and for the design of a &#x201C;Capacity Building Programme of Institutions and Structures in Charge of Environment and Climate Change including the process to consolidate and update its NDC. The intention is to design a structured and comprehensive Programme in order to fill the institutional and policy gaps and to make these thematic more coherent and operational.  After a consensus made between the donors and the government and after having received a &#x201C;Funding Request dated March 19, 2020&#x201D;, it was decided by the Coordination and Harmonization Group that Sweden given its experience funds and coordinates these audits and the design of the Programme. The intention is that the future Programme which will be planned from 2021 to 2025 be funded through a &#x201C;Basket Funding Mechanism&#x201D; with shared responsibilities among donors. 
The budget The overall budget for the event is worth 241 963 000 FCFA (4 034 000 SEK) to be funded by Sweden. The overall draft budget was 300 000 000 FCFA (5 000 000 SEK). Through the comments from the Embassy, the budget was reduced by 19.35 %.  From the total budget of 4. 034 MSEK, 70 % will be used for consultancy services (national and international) while 30 % will be used for validation workshops and management costs for AEDD which is a &#x201C;Public Administrative Establishment&#x201D; with financial and administrative autonomy. Such status makes it obliged to generate resources from all operations it should be involved in. The costs for audits/diagnosis are 60 000 000 FCFA (1 MSEK or 24. 80%) while the costs for the Programme formulation where most of consultants are internationals are: 181 963 000 FCFA (3.034 MSEK or 75.2%).
The overall budget will be managed by AEDD. No fund is forwarded to other entities.
The Embassy assesses that given the objectives cited above and the intended better coordination and capacity vis &#xE1; vis the Environmental protection, the public education and awareness making about climate change adaptation and anti- desertification work, the budget seems adequate.  The funding will permit more efficiency and effectiveness of environmental protection and climate change while improving coordination and harmonization.</narrative>
