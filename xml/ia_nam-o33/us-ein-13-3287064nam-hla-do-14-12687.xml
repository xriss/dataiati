   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The goal of this project is to reduce statelessness in marginalized neighbourhoods of West Santo Domingo by educating the target population on their rights and providing them with essential, understandable and accurate information on the current laws and procedures related to nationality documentation. The complex mosaic of laws creates both opportunities and risks for Haitian-Dominicans depending on date of birth, existence of birth records, the date and circumstances of ancestor arrival in the Dominican Republic, and other factors. HAI and MUDHA will educate communities on their rights and on current law.  Direct legal and documentation assistance will be provided using a participant-centered approach, in which individuals will be fully educated on risks and benefits, and empowered to make decisions about whether or not to seek documentation and nationality. Nobody will be pressured or otherwise encouraged to obtain nationality. The project will serve Haitian-Dominicans of all ages and genders, but will particularly focus on women of Haitian descent with children born after 2010, or those who are likely to have children, in order to prevent statelessness for children who are unambiguously eligible for nationality under existing law. Through sensitizing and supporting the target population to exercise their right to nationality, specific data will be also be gathered to measure the presence of stateless persons in the communities of intervention.</narrative>
