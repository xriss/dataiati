   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Enhancing protection through provision of specialized mental health services and psycho-social support to the affected men, women, girls and boys living in vulnerable areas at Gaza Strip</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project will support the delivery of quality specialized mental health services to the most venerable women and men, girls and boys who are living in the most affected and marginalized socio-economically vulnerable under-served communities, in proximity to border and access restricted areas, and IDP populations in Gaza Strip through the following:  
A1)	Provision of specialized mental health services for children (boys and girls) and adults/parents (women and men) who have displayed symptoms of severe psychological distress. By using the existing referral system, those cases will be detected and referred by the case managers and psycho-social support staff working in family centers, Child Protection and MHPSS networks. Also, CIVITAS  will refer IDPs cases who were detected by its filed workers. CIVITAC is a non-governmental and non-profit organization working with IDPs in all Gaza strip areas. CIVITAS has launched a database until on IDPs and IDPs profiling through field research and surveys through 28 field workers. Additionally, other support detected through structured activities implemented through other venues such as GCMHP&#x2019;s community centers and their teams can be provided. The clinical services will be provided by specialized multi disciplinary team at GCMHP three community centers located in Gaza city, Deir El Balah and Khanyounis. Therapy plans include psychotherapy, play therapy, medication, family counseling and home visits. GCMHP has procedures that offer practical guidance and assistance in taking protection issues seriously in the workplace, and to make staff aware of their roles and responsibilities while interacting directly with women and children. 
A 2) Provision free telephone counseling service for children (girls and boys) and adults/parents (women and men) who couldn&#x2019;t reach mental health centres due to economic or social barriers. Through this service, the telephone counselors will provide psycho education, individual and family counseling, and also detect and refer children and adults with severe symptoms to GCMHP community centres to receive specialized mental health services including medications if necessary. This service helps overcome stigma attached to mental health problems. This service provides another differentiated aspect, where all GBV and protection cases will be detected and referred to women protection organizations and other service providers in Gaza Strip.
A3) Strengthen coordination mechanisms: GCMHP will update and share its 5 W matrix with CPWG and PHSS including gender disaggregated information in addition to report on indicators to HRP periodic reporting. Also, GCMHP has already a referral mechanism in which all referrals and needed information are followed up and traced. It is worth mentioning that GCMHP is already a part of the SOPs&apos; manual which managed by UNICEF and includes all referral pathways. There are three trained professionals at GCMHP who received training on a case management approach and they have excellent knowledge with all referral pathways. The current scanning system in GCMHP is to scan each referred case by the Directors of GCMHP community centers then to direct those cases to the case managers to do needed actions in terms of needs analysis and referral processes to service providers either internally or externally.  
A4) Produce one fact sheet, including gender and age dis aggregated data, to document trends/patterns of psychological disorders among those assisted to be shared with all stakeholders to help improve the prevention and protection response and for joint coordinated advocacy messages and acti</narrative>
