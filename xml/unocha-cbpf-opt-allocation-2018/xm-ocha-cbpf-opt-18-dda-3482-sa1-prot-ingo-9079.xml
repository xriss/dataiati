   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Meeting the Protection Needs of Vulnerable Children  in the Gaza Strip through Child Protection Case Management System</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Children in Gaza are growing up in a society permeated by restrictions and conflict related violence which leave them with a deep sense of insecurity for their future. Palestinian children older than ten year&apos;s old living in Gaza have now witnessed three conflicts in their short lives. And children aged 11 or less have only known life in Gaza under closure, resulting in an increase of the number of children displaying high levels of stress related symptoms, requiring additional family and community based support and individualized interventions aiming at reducing vulnerability and increasing protection. Child Protection Rapid Needs Assessment has been carried out by Tdh in partnership with the Child Protection Working Group in Gaza in 2018. The assessment aims to explore and understand the protection needs of children in light of the evolving situation in the Gaza Strip. The study findings have shown that Physical violence against children is common in the Gaza Strip. The Assessment (2018) found significant patters including the increase in the prevalence of sexual violence against children and child labour. Moreover, the Assessment found significant patters including 96% of responders identifying psychosocial distress in children as one of the main child protection concerns in the Gaza Strip. The main distress manifestations include children being more aggressive, bedwetting, unusual crying and screaming, violence against younger children, unwillingness to go to school, disrespectful behavior in the family, having nightmares and not being able to sleep, sadness and avoiding others. In the last 2 months the Gaza Strip has been witnessing a progressive deterioration of the political, social and security environments. This situation has been contributing towards volatility in the security context, as well as for a rise of the instability levels in Gaza. Furthermore, it was observed that there was a significant increase in the number of demonstrations under what is called &quot;the Great March of Return&quot;. During the reporting period, demonstrations are planned to take place at several border areas, East of Gaza Strip. The participation of children in the demonstrations exposes children to different kinds of risk, including the risk of being injured or even killed. According to the Palestinian Ministry of Health (April 26, 2018), 4 children were killed and 650 injured since the beginning of Great March of Return on 30 March. Some of the injured children sustained injuries that will result in lifelong disabilities. With an overall objective of promoting psychosocial status of the served children and their families in the Gaza Strip, the Action aims to meet the protection needs of  2730 children (1515 boys and 1215 girls) in need of protection services in the Gaza Strip, including GBV. The project has one outcome which is vulnerable children have increased access to child protection services, including case management and PSS services and risks of violence against children are reduced through improved multisectoral and community based interventions in the Gaza Strip. Under this outcome, three outputs are constructed: (1) Child Protection services including case management and PSS are available to vulnerable children in the Gaza Strip, (2) Child protection services for children victims of GBV are available, including PSS and specialized mental health services through the referral pathways, and (3). Child protection services are available for children who have been recently injured during the demonstrations of the Great March of Return, including Psychological First Aid and structured PSS services. Tdh and its partner organizations will utilize the newly developed Child Protection Web-based Case Management System and the referral pathways that have been developed jointly by Tdh and UNICEF in 2017.</narrative>
