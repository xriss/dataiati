  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This is an urgent emergency response to provide highly vulnerable Palestinian families with adequate shelter for the summer season. This action, which includes the rehabilitation and/or upgrading of shelters, will further reduce/prevent the risk of seasonal displacement and forcible transfer of affected people. Activities are designed to provide assistance and reduce the exposure of targeted beneficiaries to both man-made and natural disasters, enabling them to live with adequate standards. The action follows an holistic approach which couples the provision of essential services and materials, with legal and incident profiling, provision of risk preparedness tools and resources and reinforcement of communities&apos; capacities to engage local authorities, humanitarian and development actors. 
The action, which is fully in line with the 2018 HRP Strategic Objective 1 and 2, complies with the minimum SPHERE standards for adequate housing, Shelter Cluster minimum agreed standards, gender, and adequate access to housing by people with disabilities. Further, gender and protection are mainstreamed, ensuring compliance with &#x201C;Do-No Harm&#x201D; principles to prepare against security-related risks or shocks. The identified activities come as a result of the conduction of a community-based protection approach, in a participatory way, to strengthen the capacities of the communities in Area C. Specifically, the action intends to rehabilitate/upgrade 86 shelters in 5 communities, located in the Governorates of Hebron and Ramallah. People of these communities, mostly farmers and herders, are 62% refugees, and are highly affected by Israeli Force demolitions, &#x201C;Stop Work Order&#x201D; and demolition orders, lack of access to basic services, inadequate shelter, and movement restrictions among many other hindrances.  As part of the implementation methodology, led by community members through a participatory approach, the intervention will ensure that the most vulnerable households have the right to adequate living standards through rehabilitated shelters, in respect to international and national standards and Shelter Cluster objectives. This will be established by enhancing local expertise and empowering the local community. Rehabilitation/upgrading will be completed by the beneficiaries themselves through community implementation, in line with GVC methodology, which includes one month for data collection on beneficiaries, identification of the project committees, analysis of the skills of the member of the local project committees, and signature of the MoUs by the local committees, which assume the responsibility of the implementation of the works. It will generate revenues, reduce visibility during implementation, and increase maintenance and ownership of the rehabilitated shelters, reducing vulnerabilities. The specific technique selected for each community depends on several factors (among other, the status of land ownership). In Qawawis the intervention is the rehabilitation of concrete shelters with composite roof: the composite shelters consists of concrete sides with a roof composed of metal or zinc roof, polystyrene between wood and metal that functions as an insulation material. They are comprised of steel framing covered with metal sheets, insulated, and include a wooden floor framework (treated with fireproof material). In Hebron H2 the intervention rehabilitation of concrete shelter with asphalted roof with internal renovation works. For the 3 targeted communities in Area C given the specific circumstances and the lack of land ownership, the intervention will foresee the provision of PVC plastic cover (supporting the structure of metal bars that the community members already own). These high-priority interventions will be implemented in partnership by GVC and MA&#x2019;AN Development Centre and in coordination with the Palestinian Authority-related bodies such as village councils, the AWSC and ACCO</narrative>
