   <narrative xml:lang="EN">PCDCR seeks to respond to emergency protection and psychosocial needs of injured individuals and families (children, wives, brothers, sisters, etc.) of injured or killed people by Israeli forces during demonstrations at the fence in Gaza, Khanyounis and North Governorates and to reduce number of future injuries mainly among children. 
According to MOH statistics, nearly 2200 children injured (hospitalized and non-hospitalized) during the demonstrations at the fence in Gaza Strip. Nearly 800 children were visited by family centers and other service providers (according to primary communication with CPWG).   
PCDCR will closely coordinate with CPWG, and other current service providers including GCMHP, Maan, Tamer and Aisha association to determine the accurate number of injured children and adults who have not been visited yet by any organization and to avoid overlapping in the interventions.  
A team of 50 (Psychosocial support facilitators) will conduct nearly 5500 outreach visits to injured individuals and families of injured or killed individuals (including 560 boys, 40 girls, 4590 men, 310 women) and families of killed individuals in Gaza, Khanyounis and North Governorates who have not been visited by any other service provider. This number could be reduced according to coordination with other service providers. 

During the visits, the team will recognize the injured individuals and their families, present the PSS services provided within the project, examine their psychosocial needs, identify their needs and willingness and motivate them to participate in the project activities. Injured individuals and their families will be referred to adequate psychosocial support services. 

Also, the project will target 600 children (560 boys, 40 girls) of injured children and children of injured or killed individuals in Gaza, Khanyounis and North governorates through 40 groups of First Aid psycho-social support to give them a practical care and support, comfort and help them to feel calm. 
Furthermore, 975 individuals (210 boys, 15 girls, 700 men, 50 women) of injured individuals and family members of injured or killed individuals in Gaza, Khanyounis and North governorates will participate in Group Counseling Sessions. These sessions helping them to release their anxieties, stress and express their feelings and build their confidence and resilience. 
Moreover, 800 individuals (280 boys, 20 girls, 460 men, 40 women) will receive individual counseling service by 5 individual counselors offering them a safe environment to express their problems and talk about their experiences and feelings in order to modify behaviors and equipping them with coping skills. 

Also, 1200 individuals (560 boys, 40 girls, 560 men, 40 women) who were participated in PSS activities will join 10 sharing days, each of 120 persons. These days aim to complement the work done inside the groups to improve psycho-social status of injured individuals. They will have chance to play and enjoy fun group activities, big games and music show.
To provide services that are more integrated to injured individuals, 2 case managers will provide case management service to 120 children and their families (110 boys, 10 girls) with multi-service needs using existing referral pathways and potential services. 

As a preventive approach to decrease number of future injuries during demonstrations at the fence, the project team will conduct 400 awareness-raising sessions for 10,000 individuals (4900 boys, 2100 girls, 2100 men, 900 women) broadcasting 6 radio episodes and 200 times radio spot on risks of engaging in demonstrations and risks of injuries.
Additionally, PCDCR will create a reference base about multi-sectorial humanitarian needs of injured individuals to facilitate reaching them and help service providers to design appropriate interventions based on their needs through conducting a humanitarian need study in coordination with multi-sectorial clusters.</narrative>
