   <narrative xml:lang="EN">IFCs financial sector strategy in Guyana is focused on expanding the level of credit being made available to low income households and SMEs operating in the local market. The areas where IFC support is most needed is in expanding the level of outreach, to areas outside of Georgetown, and extending the terms of credit so as to avoid reliance on collateral based lending and short term finance.   Small Business Development Finance Trust (SBDF or the Trust) is a non-profit organization created in 2002 with the objective of providing financial and advisory services to low income households in Guyana. Its mission is to strengthen the economic base of micro and small scale sector entrepreneurs in Guyana through increased access to lending, technical support and non-traditional financial facilities.  The proposed project involves a tailored approach of working with the management and board of SBDF to provide it with the technical and financial support it needs to enhance the platform it has created for itself within this target market. To date SBDF has grown its operations using donations followed by the rotation cash generated from its portfolio to grant loans and expand its outreach.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The development impact of IFCs financing to Small Business Development Finance Trust is expected to be high, as it will support productive microenterprises and employment generation. Given the companys average loan size of approximately $900, IFCs financing is expected to enable SBDFT to provide over 2,000 loans during the life of the project. The beneficiaries of these loans will be low-income micro entrepreneurs, many of them women. A number of SBDFs new clients are based in rural areas  and providing credit to them is expected to help increase food production for local as well as the export market.  For 2008, the institution projects a 94% portfolio growth and a 50% increase in the number of clients; hence, the project will be instrumental in SBDFT achieving these targets.</narrative>
