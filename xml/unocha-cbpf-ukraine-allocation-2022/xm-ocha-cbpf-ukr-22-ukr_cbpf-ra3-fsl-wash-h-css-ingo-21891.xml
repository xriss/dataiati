   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Complex support of the people affected by the military offensive in Ukraine</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">IGFM and its Ukrainian branch IAC ISHR is focusing on performing complex multisectoral activities which cover different needs of multiple groups of beneficiaries. Such an approach allows us to enhance the effect of each humanitarian action. The project will aim at supporting individual IDPs, families with children, people with disabilities, elderly people, medical and social institutions, and, at the same time Ukrainian small businesses and farmers. Such complex support will be achieved by giving priority to the purchase of food and NFI (for the vulnerable groups) directly from the Ukrainian producers of these items (small businesses, individual entrepreneurs, farmers). Such activities will support both people in need and small businesses, this way we will cover two spheres of the humanitarian activity (support of the people and support of the Ukrainian economy) with a single action.
&#xA0;
Since the beginning of the military offensive IGFM (through the network of volunteers of the Ukrainian branch IAC ISHR) is providing the affected population and institutions (hospitals, orphanages, elderly houses, maternity hospitals, IDP centers) with food (in-kind), hygiene items (including diapers, MHM products) and medicine (mostly for NCDs) in 13 oblasts of Ukraine, including&#xA0;Zaporizhzhia, Kharkiv, Kyiv and Sumy oblasts which are targeted by the 3-rd allocation. These activities will be the focus of the project aiming at the objectives of&#xA0;sustaining humanitarian activities in areas under threat through the provision of relief items and critical supplies to Kharkiv and Zaporizhzhia (Strategic Objective 1- Priority 1) as well as scaling up the delivery of humanitarian supplies and services in conflict-affected accessible areas including Kyiv Oblast and Sumy Oblast (Strategic Objective 1- Priority 2).&#xA0;&#xA0;
&#xA0;
Based on IGFM&apos;s previous experience the main target group of the project will include&#xA0;affected individuals (IDPs, people with disabilities, children, elderly people), their families, and institutions (hospitals, orphanages, elderly houses, maternity hospitals, IDP centers). At the same time, the project will strive to support a secondary target group which includes small businesses, individual entrepreneurs, and farmers. Since the project&apos;s activities focus on targeted support (including the provision of specific items, such as baby food, diapers, menstrual products, and NCD medicine) its whole objective (i.e. delivery of the needed supplies) is based on addressing the differentiated needs of women and girls, men and boys of different ages and disparities.&#xA0;&#xA0;
&#xA0;
Through IAC ISHR our organization is actively participating in humanitarian activities of FSL, WASH, and Health clusters, by providing weekly 3W/5W reports and participating in the meetings of these clusters. IAC ISHR and its personnel (who at the same time are active members of the IGFM) are important to the implementation of the project because these are IGFM&apos;s representatives on the ground (in Ukraine).&#xA0; &#xA0;
&#xA0;
The main risks of the project are: 1) potential lack of necessary food and NFI items in Ukraine, which can be mitigated by the purchase and shipment of these items from Germany (IGFM has the necessary experience in the shipment of humanitarian aid to Ukraine) 2) risks of SEA incidents which might be caused by the power imbalance between the humanitarian aid workers (especially volunteers who bare less responsibility then permanent staff) and beneficiaries, this can be addressed by performing mandatory PSEA training and assessment for the aid workers 3) change of the control of certain locations from one side of the conflict to another, such situations will require an individual approach, IGFM and IAC ISHR have prior experience in similar situations acquired during the distribution of supplies to NGCA cities of Melitopol, Zaporizhzhia&#xA0;Oblast&#xA0;and Putivl, Sumy Oblast (was NGCA in March 2022). See &quot;Risk management&quot; section 7 in &quot;Other Info&quot; tab for more risks.</narrative>
