AVSI overseeing the project, ensuring capacity building of the organization, and providing specific technical skills on EiE and Protection. AVSI and Emmaus NGO have a ground presence in targeted locations with offices, warehouse, volunteers and resources and are already active in providing immediate help to IDPs, host communities and vulnerable people. For the implementaiton of the activities in the field with the communities AVSI and Emmaus will share project location according to the geographcal area.

Practical administrative arrangements that are already used and operational between Emmaus and AVSI for the implementation of other activities, will be replicated for this project in order to alllow to AVSI to implement activities even if AVSI is still in the process of registering their branch in the country. 
Activities will take into consideration the possible development of the current crisis with price hikes and disrupted supply chains expose vulnerable populations to environmental and protection risks. Since 24th February 2022, the Russian invasion of Ukraine have led to the internally displacement of an estimated 7.7M civilians.
Multiple shocks have left people living in hosting places feeling helpless, prone to structural violence, abuse. Vulnerable women and children are forced into behaviors which expose them to exploitation. Conflict affected children spread across hosting places and host communities with poor access to learning opportunities and protective environments. Overall, these vulnerable groups are continuously prevented from accessing their rights. Given this context and this grant request would prioritize children, women and others vulnerable groups. All activities would mainstream Covid-19 prevention, women&#x2019;s participation, accountability to affected populations (AAP) through MampE and community feedback mechanisms. The project aims to improve access to EiE, protection services and increase community awareness and capacity to address women&#x2019;s and children&apos;s rights. We would be guided by the priorities set out in 3rd Reserve Allocation Strategy 2022, mainstream cross-cutting themes in Protection, AAP, Gender, Disability, Inclusion. Particular attention would be given to strategies related to Age, Gender and Diversity and Localization &#x2013; leveraging partnerships with CSOs and local governements who have valuable experience and access, Operational, security, safety and financial risk and the corresponding mitigating measures would be in place, and risk registers would be updated regularly, with project stakeholders receiving this information. A detailed monitoring and evaluation plan would be implemented with the use of indicators, the practical application of lessons learned and the documentation of recommendations. Sustainability or handover strategies including funding advocacy would be explored for the project&#x2019;s duration.</narrative>
