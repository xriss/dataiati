   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Provision of health support and protection monitoring through mobile clinics  in Central, East and South Ukraine</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project will provide integrated emergency health and  protection services for all conflict affected people in an inclusive manner, with a special focus on vulnerabilities, elderly, women, children, and persons with disabilities (PWD) in  Central, East and South Ukraine ). 
INTERSOS builds its response based on the data collected through the presence in the field, through the Emergency team, active and deployed in country since the commencement of the war, and with the full support and expertise of its national partners, but also based on the experience from its operational activities in conflict settings and European migration-related crises, and from other multi sectoral integrated programming. 
The health service package is designed to support the national health system, the local authorities and health actors in providing emergency health services to all in need, encompassing a whole spectrum of activities ranging from the supply of lifesaving medical items for the identified health facilities, to the set-up of mobile clinics to respond to primary health needs of the communities, where necessary, with the end goal of ensuring access to primary health care with a special focus on non-communicable diseases (NCDs), first aid, set-up of a referral system for life-saving and surgery needs and prevention and health education integrated with protection services (Protection Profiling and Referral). 
Within the  Protection domain, Intersos will provide initial assistive care for people fleeing the crisis through provision of both individual and group PFA and basic PSS. Those requiring advanced PSS and counseling will be referred to psychologists in the team from INTERSOS local partner by mobile clinics and online PSS support platform. Information resource booths will be set up in the mobile clinics to help people access information of safe travel routes and safe shelters in the areas and along the routes. Along with this information, women and children in particular will be provided information on services for GBV response, how to protect themselves from trafficking, hotlines they can access to report incidents and information about other humanitarian actors and services in the area. Information will be collected from people accessing the clinic on violations, protection risks and abuses to be able to predict protection trends and also to design a suitable response. GBV survivors will be provided with PSS and referred to the health team for medical support.
 The project will be operating in 4 Oblasts that face the consequences of the hostilities in the neighboring regions (Oblasts). There are: Odeska, Vinnyska, Cherkasy and Poltava with a field office set up in Vinnytsia. As the technical assessments are still on going at the time of writing, the proposal foresees a high degree of flexibility, for target locations and modality of intervention,to ensure the response stays relevant to the needs and adapts to the evolving conflict and access conditions.
INTERSOS will implement the response in close coordination with regional health and social authorities, the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Social Policy and local national partners and the clusters of concern for complementarity in the areas of intervention, to achieve the implementation of high impact interventions in targeted Oblast. As part of an exit strategy, INTERSOS will ensure continuous coordination and capacity building also with the existing National Health Service and Social Services, guaranteeing a direct link for all activities, especially referral. INTERSOS will cooperate in the project with national and international partners Zaporuka and and Soleterre for the PSS support</narrative>
