   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project is aimed at providing emergency humanitarian assistance to people affected by the escalation of the armed conflict in Ukraine. Priority groups for humanitarian assistance are IDPs and persons whose households were affected during the fighting. Assistance will also be provided to the most important objects of social and medical infrastructure, whose functioning is critical for the survival of communities.

Within the framework of the proposed humanitarian project, nine activities are proposed:

1) Shelter/NFI: Provision of construction materials and equipment for repair crews restoring housing and social infrastructure facilities in settlements of Donetsk oblast, where direct clashes took place in 2022. The minimum number of restored households is 100 HHs (250 beneficiaries). In case of prioritization of emergency restoration of thermal circuits of buildings with covering material, the number of beneficiaries may grow to tens of thousands.
2) Shelter/NFI: Provision of NFI kits (beds, bed linen, mattresses, equipment, generators, dishes, etc.) for 15 affected social, educational, medical institutions, including support of evacuation points and transit collective centers with equipment and materials. The approximate number of beneficiaries is 3,750.
3) Shelter/NFI: Providing 300 AEK and NFI kits to affected households
4) Health: Provision of equipment and supplies to 10 medical institutions
5) Protection: Social assistance to 100 vulnerable persons in the areas most affected by the fighting. A social worker provides assistance at home (cooking, cleaning, going to the store or social institutions, etc.) to lonely elderly people.
6) Protection: 15 CSP projects for collective centers and IDP communities. The approximate number of beneficiaries is 3,750.
7) FSL: Providing 5000 food kits
8) FSL: Emergency agricultural grants to 150 households (recommended by the cluster)
9) Emergency Telecommunications: distribution of communication services, as well as provision of generators and power supplies to social institutions in places where there is no electricity, provided that residents have access to them. Creation of public Wi-Fi and phone charging zones in the absence of centralized electricity. The approximate number of beneficiaries is 5,000.

The locations of the project implementation will be the most affected areas of the NGCA Donetsk oblast.

The estimated number of beneficiaries is 40,760

The SGBV factor will be taken into account while project implementation. In particular, all beneficiaries will be able to use the help of a full-time psychologist. In case of detection of SGBV, the beneficiary will receive consultations and will be redirected to other existing projects of the organization or to the organization&apos;s partners specializing in topic of SGBV. In particular, the organization implements projects involving assistance with medicines and cash payments, there are also working contacts in the medical institutions of the NGCA of Donetsk oblast, including those specializing in the fight against the spread of HIV.</narrative>
