  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project aims at responding to the critical needs of conflict affected population in the Eastern part of Ukraine (Donbass), based on an assessment conducted on the field by PUI emergency teams, as well as by phone with the HF in the area of intervention. However due to the recent escalation in the conflict, displacement of some of PUI&#x2019;s staff outside Donetsk region, this proposal revision is based on a new target area in and around Dnipro as a likely alternative due to the probable lack of access in the immediate run. PUI is in the process of opening an office in Dnipro, from where new assessments (based on the Health Cluster new assessment tool) will be conducted in areas where health facilities have been weakened by new influx of population from Donbas. 
PUI standard MHT intervention takes a two-pronged approach reinforcing national fixed Health Facilities and a mobile response that is provided through Integrated Emergency Response Teams/Mobile Health Teams.
Fixed Facility will support 5 hospitals through the provision of medication, medical supplies and medical equipment based on needs expressed and targeting key causes of mortality and morbidity such as NCDs.  As well as supporting Infection Prevention and Control in the ongoing Pandemic through PPE kits.
Integrated Emergency Response Teams will ensure access to PHC with boasted services around NCD, regardless status, age or gender. Integrating MHPSS appropriate to disasters and critical events will enable more comprehensive support, adapted to people on the move, and protection mainstreaming will be ensured through the support of a Protection Specialist.  The areas of deployment will be based on PUI&#x2019;s MHT vulnerability criteria adapted to Ukraine and areas covered will be coordinated with the Health cluster and partners, to ensure that the project actually fills a gap in the access to health services and there is no overlapping with other organizations. 
The mobile modality allowing an outreach towards people who don&#x2019;t have access to health services, even temporarily, the gender diversity in the MHT staffs will contribute to address the different needs faced by age and gender groups as well as partially mobile / immobile people. The plurality of the medical positions composing the MHT will allow a large package of care, to respond a diversity of individual situations. Needs that cannot be addressed by MHT will be referred to a relevant health facility or health organizations &#x2013; depending on the services locally available.
PUI has been active in Donetsk Oblast since 2015 to respond to the humanitarian needs provoked by the conflict, through its projects funded by ECHO, BHA, French MoFA and UHF on both sides of the Line of Contact. This longstanding experience in the country has enabled PUI to develop a network of partner health facilities, good relations with the government. PUI offices in Kiev, Lviv and Kostiantynivka support the implementation of PUI projects in the country but as of now, the soon to be opened Dnipro office will pilot this project and continue working on the access strategy, taking into account the security developments to come. In the meantime, target health facilities are likely to be based in and around Dnipro. 
PUI foresees an approximate minimum 1-month period necessary to start having the 1st MHT running. This month should allow recruiting the team, arranging the logistics aspects (car rental, etc.), updating the security conditions and coordinate with Health facilities. 
The highly unstable context prevailing in Ukraine induces risks the most impacting being the impossibility for PUI to safely operate for security reasons, challenges in medical / drug supply due to shortage at national level and the risk of duplication with other humanitarian actors given the massive scale up of relief activities. The mobile modality of the project will contribute to mitigate the threat related to security and and the duplication risk.</narrative>
