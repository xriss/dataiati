  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed project aims at providing MPC assistance to vulnerable internally displaced persons hosted in Lvivsky Oblast, to meet their basic humanitarian needs in a holistic manner.

Specifically, the action aims to increase the ability of the targeted beneficiaries to meet their immediate basic needs and maximize the use of resources in a way that is most suited to their requirements.

The intervention addresses critical gaps and meets the needs of vulnerable age and gender groups, targeting Households (HH) with children, single-headed HH, female-headed HH, HH with pregnant/lactating women, HH with elderly, HHs with disabled (mental or physical) members, and HHs with members that have chronic illness/medical conditions  who do not currently receive assistance.  

The project will directly target 1,688 individuals that will receive a transfers of 2,220 UHA per person per month, for a maximum value of 6.660 UHA, covering a three months perios. The beneficiaries will be selected in cooperation with the relevant institutions, in compliance with the criteria established by the CWG. 
Targeting will proceed with the following main steps:
-Lists of registered IDPs from Local Authorities
-Agreement with LA and Collective centers managers on selection criteria
-Verification of the current presence of the household in the center. During verification: data collection on household composition, vulnerability criteria, humanitarian activities of other sectors, data collection on key indicators (baseline setting during verification considering information and parameters from the PDM proposed by CWG Task Team 4)
The activities have been identified through a need-based assessment, jointly conducted by WW and its Sub-IP Law and Democracy in April 2022. The  following information and dataset were considered: data analysis of secondary data, CWG  data and meeting, Direct Key informants&#x2019; and IDPs interviews.
A Web based feedback and complaint mechanism will be put in place, in order to guarantee Data protection and promote accessibility. 
To gather the opinions, suggestions and to measure the satisfation level about the assistance received by the beneficiaries, and therefore make changes in the project, when needed, a set of specific web-based tools  (including a satisfaction  survey) will be put in place and made available in different languages. It is possible, given the fact that the affected population in the area of intervention has access to smartphones and internet connection.
WW will be responsible for the coordination, supervision and financial management of the project and liaising with other humanitarian actors, the CWG and the sectoral clusters while LampD will be responsible for field implementation of MPC transfers, field monitoring and liaising with Collective centers managers and staff and the local authorities.

The local partner was selected as a long-standing partner of Child Fund Germany, member together with WW of the Child Fund Alliance, with whom we are implementing other activities with private funds in 12 collective centres in Lvivska Oblast. The partner has no experience in emergency interventions and therefore it was decided not to go into direct management as WW promotes and supports the localisation process by transferring the necessary skills to local actors.</narrative>
