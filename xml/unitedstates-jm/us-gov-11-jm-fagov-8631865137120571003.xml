    <narrative xml:lang="EN">U.S. assistance to Jamaica focuses on reducing violent crime and instability and addressing the negative effects of climate change. U.S. assistance will improve Jamaica&apos;s resiliency to extreme climate and variable weather events and strengthen Jamaica&apos;s ability to implement adaptive strategies and pursue low carbon emission development. Climatic shifts pose significant threats to major infrastructure and to the livelihoods of urban and rural communities across Jamaica. To advance security and citizen safety, programs through the Caribbean Basin Security Initiative (CBSI) will complement and enhance bilateral assistance by strengthening Jamaica&apos;s security capacity and ability to address both domestic and transnational threats, such as illicit narcotics trafficking. CBSI~programs are requested through the State Department&apos;s Western Hemisphere Regional Congressional Budget Justification.</narrative>
