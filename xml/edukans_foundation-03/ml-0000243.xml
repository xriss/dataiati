   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Lyc&#xE9;e Professionnel is a public professional school, open to all students who have qualified for secondary technical education. Students will be mainly Dogon and Peul who inhabit the Dogon region.  
 
When the Lyc&#xE9;e Professionel starts in October 2016, there is a capacity of 150 students. 
When the school is completed in 2018 it may accommodate 400 to 600 students. They all may profit of the adapted curriculum, traineeships and the course in entrepreneurship.  
 
As in the program &#x2018;les mots Imprim&#xE9;s&#x2019; the teachers will become more motivated and enthusiastic by training and that will create a good atmosphere in the school. A good school can compete with the regular education in the city (Mopti, Bamako). 
 
The inhabitants of the Dogon region may profit from an secondary education in Sangha. Families will not be split up and more experts on issues relevant for the region are available. 
Moreover, the intention is that experts will create businesses and will thus stimulate the local employment and economy.</narrative>
