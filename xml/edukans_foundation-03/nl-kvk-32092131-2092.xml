   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Ethiopia suffers from chronic food insecurities associated with recurrent drought and Afar is one of the regions affected. The project, funded by UNICEF,  aims to reach the most marginalized IDP and host communities in selected 15 districts. This is done by providing cash assistance to 1330 households so that 5320 children continue education. In addition 27 schools will be equipped with water tanks and rehabilitated water points. A total of 13,300 children are expected to benefit from the project.</narrative>
