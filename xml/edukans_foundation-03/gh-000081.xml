   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Chocolonely Foundation and Edukans are two Dutch organizations aiming to improve the socio-economic situation of underprivileged people (both with their own special mission) in West-Africa. Edukans is a development organization focusing on education and started its educational programme in Ghana with the aim of improving the quality and access to education. Next to the Foundation, the company Tony&#x2019;s Chocolonely has the goal to produce 100% slave-free chocolate bars with cocoa from Ghana and Ivory Coast. Besides improving the lives of the farmers they are supporting directly through their contract with the ABOCFA cooperative. The Chocolonely Foundation is also seeking for ways to improve the socio-economic circumstances in the communities of the farmers. These communities expressed the importance of, amongst others, improved educational services for their children. This draft proposal is the outcome of various discussions between Tony&#x2019;s Chocolonely, Edukans and a local expert organizations IBIS and AGREDS.
