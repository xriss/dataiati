   <narrative xml:lang="EN">South East Asia&#x2019;s particular vulnerabilities to disaster are well-documented;The region is considered to be highly affected and at risk from climate change  and re-occurring major natural disasters leaving many people and particularly the poor highly vulnerable to shocks. Responses to disasters differ between countries depending on the level of preparedness and response capacities. Reducing vulnerabilities to disaster needs appropriate risk reduction. Base on our regional analysis The Association of South-East Asian Nations is the one supranational body which has an undisputed role across the whole region. In the instance of disaster risk management , one of the most positive recent shifts has been ASEAN&#x2019;s significant role in the nitroduction of ASEAN Agreement for Disaster Management and Emergency Response ( AADMER) for the region, which could be one of the influence tool for CSO  to advocate for better policy regarding to resilient work across the region. Important to note is the fact that much influencing of ASEAN still needs to be undertaken by through representatives of individual member countries, rather than in directly approaching the body as such.
The Asia Ministerial Conference for Disaster Risk Reduction (AMCDRR) is a biennial conference in the Asia region to ensure political and stakeholder&#x2019;s commitment towards Disaster Risk Reduction implementation. Five AMCDRR conferences have been organized by countries in Asia in collaboration with the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNISDR) since 2005. The 6th AMCDRR will be hosted by the Royal Thai Government in collaboration with UNISDR. The conference will be a venue for countries, organizations and individual practitioners to meet and discuss the way forward in reducing disaster risk in the region. It will also be the final regional inter-governmental meeting in Asia before the completion of the Hyogo Framework for Action 2005-15.  This AMCDRR will provide a unique opportunity for Asian DRR organizations and practitioners to shape the HFA2, the successor arrangement of the HFA. so to take an advantage of this high profile platform, thus  CAROTAS Asia under support from CAFOD and other Caritas Members will work together to find the potential way to advocate for better policy relate to Disaster Management in this region. However, the project will continues to identify the potential regional advoacy activities that we could work together beyond the 6th AMCDRR. The project will be under management of CARITAS Asia.</narrative>
