  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In Africa, as well other parts of the world, globalisation triggered that non-state actors including transnational corporations and other businesses have gradually become more powerful and influential, bringing new challenges in the field of human rights. Increasingly, local communities have been confronted with human rights abuses committed by businesses, whether through poor labour conditions, forced evictions or the destruction of their livelihoods as a result of e.g. logging, mining and pollution. Although governments have the obligation to protect people from such abuses, many fail to do so. Over the years, the United Nations human rights machinery has tried to clarify the respective roles and responsibilities of governments and businesses with regard to protecting and respecting human rights. Yet, there are still few effective mechanisms at (inter)national level that prevent and address corporate abuses. Moreover, local people and communities often do not know their rights or how to seek justice for the corporate abuses they are confronted with. They lack access to information; are excluded from decision-making processes; or face ineffective legal systems and/or corruption. To help local organisations, activists, and grassroots communities in Africa better understand their rights, as well as the respective roles and responsibilities of business and governments, AI/HURICAP is currently developing a capacity-building package comprised of a handbook series and training modules. Accordingly, AI/HURICAP hopes to strengthen the knowledge base and skills of local activists and grassroots organisations so that they can contribute to holding companies to account for abuses they commit and enhance their access to justice and effective remedy.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Despite some initial delay, the project is currently on track. An overall guidebook on business and human rights is expected to be finalized in 2018 for publication. Part 1 explains the various (international) human rights standards, the key actors involved, how businesses impact on human rights as well as specific human rights issues (such as labour rights, damage to environment, displacement and land rights, security arrangements, armed conflict, corruption and access to remedy). Part 2 (Taking Action) is a slightly more  operational  document, which aims to provide practical guidance and steps for CSOs (mainly) and community rights activists in designing strategies for preventing, mitigating or remedying human rights impacts related to business activities. 

The final versions of Part 1 and 2 will be used as background material (in particular the tools presented in part 2) for future trainings by Amnesty&apos;s Human Rights Capacity-Building Programme (HURICAP). A first pilot training is expected to be held by the end of 2018.</narrative>
