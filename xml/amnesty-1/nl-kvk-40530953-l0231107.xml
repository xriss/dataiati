  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Zimbabwe Human Rights NGO Forum consists of 22 Zimbabwean human rights organizations, including Amnesty International Zimbabwe. Along with engagement strategies and ESC rights being recognized to some extent in the new constitution of Zimbabwe, they had a clear need to be trained on ESC rights: how to identify, research and campaign to make the Zimbabwean government live up to its obligations under international and national law. The project started with a training and action planning, which is now being followed up with further project planning and a follow-up training focused on ESCR advocacy.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">After a first ESCR training in 2016, a second training, focused on ESCR Advocacy, was held in May-June 2017. This was a pilot training, which was subsequently written up into a standard training module. During the training the participants formed three groups, each of which developed a draft advocacy plan for respectively the right to education, the right to health and the right to food. Amnesty did a further assessment of the capacities of some members of the network. Then it took until the end of December 2017 for the network to submit a follow-up proposal. They decided to focus on the right to free primary basic education. The proposal needed a lot of clarification; hence the operational delay. As a result of the delayed response of partner organizations, and unclarity of the proposal, the project will probably be cut in phases and implemented in a cascaded manner.</narrative>
