   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Strengthening the MDR capacity of human rights defenders in Iraq</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project, for which AINL/HURICAP is closely collaborating with PAX, seeks to strengthen the capacity of human rights defenders in Iraq, so that they are better able to monitor, document and report on human rights violations in their respective territories. Whereas the project&apos;s main focus is on gender-based violence, it was decided to also incorporate the issue of enforced disappearances (as of 2018) in order to respond to the growing number of enforced disappearances since the liberation of Mosul. A first training in MDR and gender-based violence was held in November 2017, and a second in May 2018.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project is on track. We see that our partner organization is monitoring, documenting and reporting human rights violations and using the reports for advocacy purposes with the national government or at UN level. The monitors, who collect the information in the field, have now adopted a human rights approach when documenting violations and stepped away from a purely journalistic approach. They are also better able to distinguish between violations, abuses, and crimes, and to apply MDR ethics and principles in their work. This means, amongst others, that they do their monitoring work in an impartial way (not being influenced by the different religious and ethnic backgrounds they may have).</narrative>
