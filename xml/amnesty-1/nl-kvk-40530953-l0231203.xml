   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Somalia&apos;s long-running armed conflict continues to leave civilians affected in many ways. The Islamist armed group Al-Shahaab is still committing human rights abuses, including deadly attacks, against civilians, journalists and political figures in the areas under its control as well as in government controlled areas, such as Mogadishu. But also government security forces, African Union troops, and allied militias have been responsible for indiscriminate attacks, sexual violence and arbitrary arrests and detention. Despite positive commitments and policy development from the Somali government, insecurity and political infighting continue to detract from concrete progress on justice and security sector reform. Restrictions on access of aid organizations to affected populations have exacerbated the humanitarian crisis. In Somaliland, the government is becoming increasingly repressive with the authorities restricting any public criticism of their governance (including corruption) and policies. Authorities regularly arrest and detain journalists and the country reinstated the death penalty in 2015. Seven people were executed in 2016. 
Following an initial assessment visit to the country in February 2017, this project aims to support partner organisations in Somaliland and South-Central Somalia in their capacity to monitor, document and report on human rights violations and abuses that are being committed in both States. In Somaliland, we trained local human rights monitors to investigate the abuses/violations happening on the ground. For Somaliland, the ultimate aim is to change the mindset/behavior of the government towards human rights defenders/journalists; whereas in Somalia the main focus is on better reporting of human rights violations, so that this information can be shared with international NGOs and other actors, which can help in attracting international attention for their case and their search for justice. Work in Somalia is expected to start in 2018.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project only started in July 2017 and implementation is on track. According to the local partner organization, the MDR Capacity Building training provided by HURICAP has led to an increase in  their evidence-based advocacy, as well as in the documentation of the cases from the regions. The monitors, for example, started their work by using guidelines and hand-out materials provided by HURICAP. Before this project, the local partner organization was not able to monitor all regions throughout Somaliland and get the correct information regarding the human right situation since the office was/is based in the Capital (only).</narrative>
