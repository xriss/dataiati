  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">For several years, Cameroon is affected by high levels of insecurity and multiple human rights violations/abuses as a result of an Anglophone crisis, frequent Boko Haram attacks (in the north) and a heavy-handed indiscriminate response by Cameroonian forces, with large numbers of people imprisoned and tortured on terrorism charges. 

Since 2016, Cameroonians living in the Anglophone regions of the country have been protesting against their marginalization by the Cameroonian government and to denounce the inequalities that they are facing.  The first of October 2017 marked one of the worst moments when demonstrations were violently repressed, leaving more than 100 people dead. 

While the AI Regional Office reports on violations and abuses by all conflict parties, AI-NL intends to strengthen the capacity of civil society organisations in monitoring, documenting and reporting human rights violations by security forces, including supporting victims to access justice and adequate and effective reparation. Staff and volunteers of such organisations will be trained in human rights provisions, in techniques of factfinding and documentation, and these organisations will be facilitated to bring corroborated information to AI and other international actors, while they will also be supported to perform local and national advocacy to change the anti-terrorism law, to change its application, to ensure human rights-compliant behaviour by security forces, to liberate suspects arrested on futile grounds, to improve prison conditions, etc.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">There is a strategic delay. Follow-up by trained organizations was limited and slow in 2017; however, in the end, two organisations did submit follow-up plans, which will be implemented in 2018. Due to limited response and capacities of partner organizations, the focus of the project will partly move away from the Boko Haram conflict, and towards the conflict in the anglophone regions.

Despite the aforementioned delay, NGO partners became more active in following human rights incidents, including court sessions, and in condemning violations publicly, despite the harassment by the authorities. At the same time, they continued to recognize the authorities for their mandate and responsibilities. According to one of the partners, the security forces have become more prudent, because they know that information on how they handle the crisis cannot be kept secret, and the situation is being &#x201C;watched by Amnesty&#x201D;. On the other hand, the authorities have also become more hostile towards Amnesty and its NGO partners in Cameroon.</narrative>
