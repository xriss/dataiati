   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Monitoring Security Incidents and Human Rights in Ituri province, DRC</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In light of the Strategic Partnership, PAX and Amnesty explored in 2016 how they could renew their collaboration in the Ituri region of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, amongst others to strengthen PAX Bunia and local partners in their monitoring capacity of security incidents. To this end, an exchange visit was held in Goma in February 2017 between PAX partners (Ituri) and Amnesty&apos;s partners (North Kivu) with a view to learn from each others experiences in monitoring security incidents and/or human rights violations/abuses and to help identify the training needs of PAX partners. It was agreed that Amnesty will train a select number of participants through a Training of Trainers on Monitoring, Documenting and Reporting (MDR) of security incidents that on their turn will strengthen the capacity of locall representatives from 41 community structures - with the support of AINL/HURICAP and PAX. 

In addition, directly following the exchange visit, a needs assessment visit was carried out by AINL/HURICAP in Bunia and Mahagi, Ituri Province with the view to have a more complete picture of the organisations active in the Province, the burning and most relevant human rights issues in the region and to possibly develop a comprehensive intervention strategy for HURICAP/AINL.</narrative>
