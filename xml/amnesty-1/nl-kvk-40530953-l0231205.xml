   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Ending Impunity</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Tens of thousands of people have been killed and over 2 million people displaced both within and across South Sudan&apos;s borders since the conflict started in December 2013. South Sudan is one of Amnesty International&apos;s priority countries and part of Amnesty&apos;s overall proposal &quot;Promote an End to Impunity for Grave Human Rights Violations in Africa.&quot; A fragile peace agreement between president Kiir and former vice president Machar was sealed in August 2015, followed by Machar being sworn in as the vice president in April 2016. On the eve of South Sudan&apos;s fifth anniversary, heavy fighting broke out again between the two opposite groups. Such events make it all the more essential for AINL/HURICAP to invest in selected organisations in establishing a core group of human rights monitors.  Many of the grave violations -including war crimes- that have been committed by all sides in the conflict over the past few years have barely seen the light of day; human rights monitoring and evidence gathering has to date not been given the attention it deserves. Human rights monitoring and evidence collection is particularly important when considering the establishment of a future Hybrid Court that was part of the August Peace Agreement.  

AINL/HURICAP&apos;s capacity building programme aims to contribute to a civil and human rights society that prioritises human rights fact-finding for purposes of accountability. It aims to contribute to establishing a human rights community that has gained the skills and knowledge to effectively collect information on grave violations committed during the past or current conflict, and to support the collection and delivery of evidence in support of trying those who bear greatest responsibility. AINL/HURICAP, in close collaboration with Amnesty&apos;s South Sudan researcher from its Regional Office in Nairobi, equipped ten South Sudanese human rights defenders with the skills to safely and effectively research conflict-related sexual violence. As a result, a joint report on sexual violence  entitled &quot;Do Not Remain Silent . Survivors of Sexual Violence in South Sudan Call for Justice and Reparation&quot; was launched in July 2017. The report highlights the prevalence of sexual violence within the South Sudanese conflict and the inadequate humanitarian aid and care for survivors of sexual violence. It calls upon the international community to act upon these violations.

The follow-up project focuses on personal profiles surrounding abduction and arbitrary detention and will again be further developed in close collaboration with the Regional Office. This project aims to give victims a platform to tell their stories, and to show how these violations impacted on their lives and those of their loved-ones.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">A total of ten human rights monitors from two partner organizations - both male and female - were taught the skills to do effective research on the characteristics, scale and consequences of sexual violence in South Sudan. They interviewed 168 victims of sexual violence, including 16 men, the results of which were incorporated into Amnesty International&apos;s report  &quot;Do not remain silent&quot;, which was able to gain international media attention (e.g. in NRC Handelsblad, The Boston Herald, The Guardian and The Japan Times) and raise awareness on the issue at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, among others.</narrative>
