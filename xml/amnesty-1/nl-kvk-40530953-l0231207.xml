  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Communities living in the two states of South Kordofan and Blue Nile have endured unrelenting bombing campaigns by the Sudan Armed Forces (SAF). The aerial attacks have resulted into severe food insecurity in both states, a destroyed infrastructure and have led to a major humanitarian crisis. Amnesty International research has confirmed that many civilian areas were targeted, which amounts to war crimes. Since 2012, AINL/HURICAP has trained and worked with a group of human rights monitors, who systematically gather evidence of these attacks, by building their MDR and report-writing knowledge and skills, as well as on community mobilisation and strategy development, Detailed data provided by the monitoring groups are not only used by AI but also by partner IRRI (International Refugee Rights Organisation) to publish quarterly updates targeting key international actors. As the monitoring teams have become mature enough to continue their monitoring and community mobilisation work, this part of our Sudan programme was phased out by the end of the 2017. 

Since 2015, AINL/HURICAP also started working with another local partner, which supervises monitoring teams in both SPLA-N territory as well as SAF controlled areas. This brings opportunities to get a more balanced picture of the human rights situation in both SPLA-N and government controlled areas. We will continue working with this partner in strengthening their monitoring skills, but will also focus more on their (methods of) report writing. Capacity building to this particular organisation is on an ad-hoc basis and when requested. 

Despite the vast amount of human rights work that is already being done by Sudanese civil society actors in both the conflict and non-conflict affected regions in the country, there remains a strong need for capacity building and professional trainers to strengthen the work of those civil society actors. Consequently, AINL/HURICAP, in close collaboration with a newly identified Sudanese partner and the Sudan team at the AI regional office in Nairobi, is seeking to establish a network of human rights trainers who could provide capacity building to a wide range of Sudanese organisations and organisations working on Sudan from abroad. The emphasis is on improving the work on monitoring and documenting human rights violations by security forces and crisis-mapping which is undertaken by our partner. Secondary objective is to have a number of individuals trained as human rights monitors, focusing on specific areas, including arbitrary arrest and detention, and the excessive use of force by the Sudan National Intelligence Services (NISS),  amongst other priority areas yet to be defined. These trusted monitors operate under the radar and will be a direct source of information for the Sudan research team in Nairobi. Monitors are selected on the basis of their professions too, which aims to include persons with medical backgrounds (in a position to identify torture methods); and persons with a law or media background.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Despite some strategic delay, the project is currently on track. Work ended with our Sudanese partner that operates in SK/BN states, as they are sufficiently able to deliver good MDR work and to fend for itself. However, work continued with the new partner organization that has monitors working throughout the whole of Sudan. We build their training and facilitation capacity; helped them organize mini-workshops in their respective communities to practice their newly gained skills and to raise human rights awareness; and we enhanced their monitoring, documenting and reporting, as well as safety and security skills. There was a short slowdown in the project (the monitoring network had been working at 30% between August - December 2017), when they were asked (by the organizers) to stop working until they had received a training in digital security (held in December 2017). There were fears that the network would face direct threats. After the workshop, our partner decided to amend the implementation of this ongoing project by changing the structure of the network and sign clearly defined TOR with each monitor to properly organize the work and have an accountability system in place. This has diminished the volume of monitoring reports received, however, the partner believes that this new structure is needed to improve the production of the network and have better communication channels with the most committed monitors. It also helps ensure secure communications channels between the monitors and their sources.</narrative>
