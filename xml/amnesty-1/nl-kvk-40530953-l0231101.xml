   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Protecting ESC rights in rural Burundi</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project initially aimed to phase out the Remesha programme under the Twungurane coalition, which was an initiative supported by AINL/HURICAP since 2012, while seeking to continue the promotion and protection of human rights and improving access to justice for the poor in Burundi. It built the capacity of local Burundi partners to raise local awareness on and monitor the extent in which people&apos;s human rights are respected, promoted and fulfilled in  their respective communities. As such, it enabled relevant partner organizations to promote people&apos;s human rights and social cohesion; to monitor the human rights situation in the communities of their respective action areas; to report abuses and violations observed with the relevant organizations and/or institutions of the State, and to conduct lobbying and advocacy at the local and provincial levels. Currently, the project has downsized considerably with one partner remaining, who seeks to effectively monitor and advance ESC rights in the communities it works in.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Project relevance is at stake. Originally work was envisaged with three local partners, but with two of them, work did not take off at all as they were not able to send in any meaningful project proposal. The partner that did make efforts in this regard was however able to bring about some change. For instance, their lobby efforts to advance people&#x2019;s right to health and education in their community  (undertaken in 2016) with provincial authorities, yielded results in 2017 with the creation of a community support fund for education.

Nevertheless, a series of laws recently enacted in the country to control the activities of both Burundian and international non-governmental organisations seem to have created a serious barrier to the type of partnership we have had so far with our partners in the country. This may require us to stop working in the country.</narrative>
