   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Strengthening human rights monitoring in North-Kivu, Democratic Republic of the Congo</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">At the end of 2015, AI/HURICAP started its collaboration with two local partner organisations to scale up their skills in monitoring, documenting and reporting human rights violations and abuses that are being committed by government forces as well as numerous armed groups in the province of North-Kivu. Whereas one partner organization covers the territories of Rutshuru, Nyiragongo, Lubero and Beni, the otherpartner organization operates in the territories Masisi, Walikale and Nyiragongo. The overall aim is that - through better human rights monitoring - both partners are able to use their collected evidence to put pressure on and address such abuses/violations with relevant authorities and institutions, bring perpetrators to justice, as well as seek justice for the victims. Accordingly, they aim to contribute to a reduction of such incidents and fight impunity. The collaboration with both partners was initially envisaged for three years and will most likely be continued until the end of 2018.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project is on track. Successes have mainly been achieved at local or provincial level. For instance, lobby and advocacy efforts in North Kivu have proven effective with the establishment of a second office of the Prosecutor in Mangurujipa and a reduction of the number of sexual violence cases in Nyamilima. A joint verification mission to Bweremana by our partner and provincial government representatives led to the immediate release of ten illegally detained persons and the resettlement of a military commander, whose men had been involved in extortion practices. Since then, no new cases of extortion have been reported in this area.</narrative>
