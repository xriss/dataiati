   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Strengthening Customary Land Justice Structures in the Acholi sub-region</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project has two components. One is strengthening a coalition of 9 human rights NGOs to enable it to raise its profile, become a self-standing advocacy actor bringing together the voices of different organizations with constituencies in different districts and communities of the Acholi subregion, and attracting funds from national and international donors. The second component builds on the advocacy work of the coalition, which aims to protect the land rights of certain Acholi communities threatened with land grabbing, and of vulnerable groups like widowed and divorced women, youth and children. This is mostly done by sensitizing traditional leaders endowed with land tenure to learn about and build on customary law, and to guide them to do effective mediation in cases of conflict. The results of these interventions are further fed into advocacy actions towards central cultural and political leaders in the subregion.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Overall, the project is on track, but throughout the year and towards the end, we recorded quite some operational delay (E.g. the major land rights advocacy workshops had to be postponed, because the local organization coordinator was too late in preparing the advocacy workshops). 

The most important behavioural change is the increased awareness and resolve of traditional leaders about land grabbing and the need to stand up against increased encroaching of communal Acholi land.This was achieved through partners at various levels (district, subcounty, clan and subclan levels) reaching out to the leaders and involving them in conflict mediation at their own levels. When evictions or conflicts happened (such as in Apaa), the partners mobilized civil society and the cultural leaders to have a joint meeting or take a joint action, even by going to Kampala to protest.</narrative>
