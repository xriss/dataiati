   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Strengthening human rights monitoring in Ethiopia</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Repression of civil society in Ethiopia has become progressively worse as of 2014, when the CSO law was more rigorously enforced. The law severely limits nongovernmental organizations to work on human rights, good governance, conflict resolution and more. Our local partner in Ethiopia  - as most other human rights and civil society organisations - has been severely affected but managed to continue its work on investigating forced evictions, arbitrary arrests, extra-judicial executions and more. With civil society in Ethiopia nearly decimated, our partner is one of the last standing human rights organisations in the country that manages to share information  including on the violent suppression of the largely peaceful protests in the Oromia region. Late 2015, our partner contacted Amnesty International to strengthen their capacity in monitoring human rights violations for their monitoring teams, to strengthen their evidence and credibility, and to produce stronger reports in appealing for the international community to respond. Despite the relentless state repression, Ethiopia is still one of the largest recipients of donor aid in Africa, while donors remain silent of Ethiopia s dire human rights record. AINL/HURICAP&apos;s expertise is to train human rights organisations and activists in how to monitor, document and report human rights violations and abuses more effectively, as well as how to use the data collected more effectively in putting pressure on governments as well as onregional and international human rights bodies. AINL/HURICAP started training the first batch of human rights monitors from our partner in the basics of human rights law, skills and knowledge of monitoring violations and basic safety &amp; security techniques. Follow up will focus on researching specific areas such as arbitrary arrests, and possibly torture in detention and freedom of expression, on digital security (our partner s staff is under constant surveillance) and on improving their international reports as well as broadening their audience and therewith increasing their visibility and impact.</narrative>
