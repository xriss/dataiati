    <narrative xml:lang="EN">Activity progress during the reporting period: Throughout the reporting period, SCM/VDC continued its data collection and documentation activities as planned. Evidentiary material on violations by all parties all over the country was collected daily by our network of sources and data collectors. The data was then verified and entered regularly on the database. Evidence-based monthly reports were published regularly throughout the reporting period. One additional special report, summary report on the recent military attacks on Idlib and Hama in March 2019, was drafted and published, reporting the number of strikes and casualties in every municipality, giving a detailed account of the impact of the strikes that targeted the area at that time. To support advocacy efforts, SCM/VDC also published a summary statement on the recent offensive on Idlib and Hama in May 2019, as well as an infographics to documented the casualties over the entire offensive on the North. Geopolitical information: Changes in context during the reporting period During the reporting period, SCM/VDC witnessed the offensive on the Syrian North (Idlib and Hama), where some of its information providers were staying. This offensive follows a pattern that led to the displacement of information providers after previous similar offensives. Accordingly, VDC has been facing a modification in the allocation of information providers; data collectors were displaced from the area they cover which made it more difficult to obtain direct information, but correspondents have been relying on a network of indicators and information providers that kept communicating about the onfield reality of these regions.</narrative>
