   <narrative xml:lang="EN">VDC intends to continue providing evidentiary material to SCM&#x2019;s litigation program, the IIIM, and other international partners engaged in litigation. This collaboration will involve designing a joint strategy to select the cases that would shed light on the most serious violations taking place in Syria, while successfully leading to the conviction of perpetrators. In order to do so, VDC intends to identify relevant information it can provide legal actors with, and strategically incorporate such considerations into its documentation methodology and tools. As part of its new database, VDC intends to develop a War Criminals Observatory, which would serve as a reliable database of alleged perpetrators of war crimes and crimes against humanity in Syria, as well as a Terrorists&#x2019; Observatories listing documented potential perpetrators of terrorist acts and/or organisations who took part in relevant activities in Syria. Both observatories appear to be essential tools to support strategic litigation efforts. VDC has already started working on this initiative and a significant number of suspects were identified, documented, and verified. VDC also intends to identify and monitor locations of interest to them and to SCM&#x2019;s litigation program, such as prisons, courts, or mass graves.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">Activity progress During the past year and throughout the reporting period, SCM&#x2019;s litigation team invested in VDC&#x2019;s available records while building profiles for the chain of command of some of the state and non-state actors of which case files are being prepared. The available documentation was also used in the process of designing background research and filling information gaps related to the use of chemical weapons. With the support of the VDC database, SCM&#x2019;s litigation team was also able to identify several stakeholders at the suspect and witness levels which enabled access to further information. Throughout the reporting period, VDC/SCM also answered requests by three international police departments. The VDC database helped building different cases, which was raised in June 2019 in France for crimes against humanity and war crimes, the Center is currently working on raising this file in Germany and the Netherlands as well. The Dabbagh case was brought about before the French judiciary by the family, which resulted in the issuance in October 2018 of three international arrest warrants against Ali Mamlouk, Abdel Salam Mahmoud and Jamil Hassan, and the case of the Baba Amr media center in Homs in which journalists Mary Colvin and R&#xE9;mi Ochlik were killed. It has also been supporting our collaboration with various war crimes units in Europe and Canada. The information of the database also helped in constituting other files, information will be given when relevant.</narrative>
