   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Although Ethiopia has considerable mineral resources, the mining sectors contribution to the countrys GDP is still small. The Government of Ethiopia has made the development of its mineral resources an important strategic priority in order to diversify its economy, grow its sources of foreign currency (reducing its dependence on coffee exports) and attract foreign direct investment.  A successful exploration program by Nyota would have notable demonstration effect and help establish mining as an attractive sector for private investors, promoting sustainable resource development and economic growth through infrastructure development and employment generation.   The Project is in an early exploration phase so its developmental impacts are limited in scope at this stage. The key impacts of the project that IFC will monitor include: (i) finalization of drilling program, completion of the scoping study and acquisition of a mining license; (ii) number of local employees; and (iii) completion of Social and Environmental Impact Assessment (SEIA).  Should the project move to a fully operating mine, it promises to generate notable, additional developmental benefits both for the country as a whole and particularly for the area around the mine, which is located in an underdeveloped part of the country.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Nyota Minerals Ltd (the Company or Nyota) is a mineral exploration company with exploration properties in Ethiopia and Burundi.  Nyotas most advanced exploration target is the Tulu Kapi gold project (Tulu Kapi), located in western Ethiopia, 510 km from Addis Ababa.  The Company acquired its 100% interest in the Tulu Kapi exploration license through the acquisition of Minerva Resources in July 2009.  Nyota announced a JORC (Joint Ore Reserves Committee) compliant inferred resource of 690,000 oz of gold at Tulu Kapi in September 2009.  It is the Companys intent to increase this resource and progress Tulu Kapi to the mine development phase.  Nyota is seeking IFCs engagement as a strategic partner to help, among other reasons, develop Tulu Kapi in line with industry best-practice in environmental and social sustainability.  IFCs equity investment will support: (i) continued exploration activities; (ii) scoping studies and environmental and social impact assessments; and (iii) working capital needs.</narrative>
