   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Hunger Project, in partnership with many local civil society organizations, has trained more than 79,000 elected women representatives. Examples of the activities within this strategy include: 
 
  Empowering Women in Elections: To encourage voter participation among women and nominations of potential women leaders, The Hunger Project conducts intensive pre-election campaigns. SWEEP (Strengthening Women&apos;s Empowerment in Electoral Processes) campaigns include meetings, film screenings, street plays, door-to-door contacts, trainings and distribution of posters and pamphlets. 
 
  Federations for Advocacy and Mutual Empowerment: To empower women leaders and their communities, The Hunger Project supports the formation of federations among their elected leaders to voice their concerns as a collective unit. 
 
  Mobilizing the Media to Support Women Leaders: To highlight the work of women leaders and Panchayati Raj, The Hunger Project actively engages with the media and annually awards the Sarojini Naidu Prize, showcasing the efforts being made by the elected women and recognizes three journalists reporting on their work in Hindi, English and other Indian language categories.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Hunger Project-India (THP) uses a multi-pronged strategy to strengthen the political leadership and participation of elected women representatives (EWRs) in Gram Panchayats (GPs). The strategies aim to build the capacities of individual EWRs and an enabling environment for them to exercise their leadership effectively. The Hunger Project facilitates the leadership of these women leaders with key interventions in each year of their five year tenures: Year One: Conduct Women Leadership Workshops (WLW) and follow-up needs-based workshops to strengthen skills of women leaders; Year Two: Work with leaders to create bottom-up plans for villages to meet basic needs; Year Three: Facilitate the formation of federations at district and state level to overcome bureaucratic obstacles; Year Four: Focus on ensuring successful implementation of plans and policy changes, and; Year Five: Carry out campaigns to encourage participation of women as voters and as candidates in the run-up to elections.  
 
The Hunger Project has been working with elected women representatives in the state of Bihar since 2001, having organized a workshop with EWRs and Civil Society Organizations immediately following Panchayat elections. Work with EWRs eventually progressed to Women&#x2019;s Leadership Workshops, adopting the five-year planned cycle in 2005. The Hunger Project has successfully prevented the implementation of the Two-Child Norm in Panchayats in Bihar. The Two-Child Norm, ostensibly an effort at curbing population growth, is a legal provision that systematically prevents the participation of female representatives with more than two children.  
 
Jamui is a district in the northern state of Bihar. THP works in 39 Gram Panchayats in two blocks in Jamui: Jhajha and Gidhaur. In 2016, 2 women leadership workshops took place, with 68 Elected Women Representatives participating. Federations provide elected women representatives (EWRs) with a platform through which to collectively bargain and demand rights as EWRs. As an informed group, they are able to represent and protect their own interests, and advocate for issues of accountable governance, inclusive democracy, a gender sensitive society and a pro-women policy environment.</narrative>
