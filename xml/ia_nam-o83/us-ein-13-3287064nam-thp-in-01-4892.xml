   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Hunger Project, in partnership with many local civil society organizations, has trained more than 79,000 elected women representatives. Examples of the activities within this strategy include:

Empowering Women in Elections: To encourage voter participation among women and nominations of potential women leaders, The Hunger Project conducts intensive pre-election campaigns. SWEEP (Strengthening Women&apos;s Empowerment in Electoral Processes) campaigns include meetings, film screenings, street plays, door-to-door contacts, trainings and distribution of posters and pamphlets.

Federations for Advocacy and Mutual Empowerment: To empower women leaders and their communities, The Hunger Project supports the formation of federations among their elected leaders to voice their concerns as a collective unit.

Mobilizing the Media to Support Women Leaders: To highlight the work of women leaders and Panchayati Raj, The Hunger Project actively engages with the media and annually awards the Sarojini Naidu Prize, showcasing the efforts being made by the elected women and recognizes three journalists reporting on their work in Hindi, English and other Indian language categories.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Hunger Project-India (THP) uses a multi-pronged strategy to strengthen the political leadership and participation of elected women representatives (EWRs) in Gram Panchayats (GPs). The strategies aim to build the capacities of individual EWRs and an enabling environment for them to exercise their leadership effectively. The Hunger Project facilitates the leadership of these women leaders with key interventions in each year of their five year tenures: Year One: Conduct Women Leadership Workshops (WLW) and follow-up needs-based workshops to strengthen skills of women leaders; Year Two: Work with leaders to create bottom-up plans for villages to meet basic needs; Year Three: Facilitate the formation of federations at district and state level to overcome bureaucratic obstacles; Year Four: Focus on ensuring successful implementation of plans and policy changes, and; Year Five: Carry out campaigns to encourage participation of women as voters and as candidates in the run-up to elections.

The Hunger Project has been working with elected women representatives in the state of Karnataka since 2001, holding women&#x2019;s leadership workshops and building capacity among elected women representatives from various districts of the region. The Hunger Project has focused on expanding partnerships at the grassroot level, enabling a larger percentage of elected women representatives in various districts to be engaged through the Women&#x2019;s Leadership Workshops. These programs are currently active in fifteen districts.

Koppal is a district in the southwestern state of Karnataka. THP works in 27 Gram Panchayats in one block in Koppal: Koppal.  In 2014, 1 Koppal Federation meeting took place at the block level, with 25 Elected Women Representatives participating. Federations provide elected women representatives (EWRs) a legitimate platform through which to collectively bargain and demand rights as EWRs. As an informed group, they are able to represent and protect their own interests, and advocate for issues of accountable governance, inclusive democracy, a gender sensitive society and a pro-women policy environment..</narrative>
