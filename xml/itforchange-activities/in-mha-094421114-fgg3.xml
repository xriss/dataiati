  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Fair, Green and Global Alliance (FGG) aims to increase the power and decision-making influence of organised, mobilised and informed civil society, especially women, to advance fair and green trade and value chains. FGG believes that poverty, inequality and exclusion are caused by power asymmetries. We see the unprecedented power of capital over people and planet as the primary obstacle impeding realisation of fair and green trade and value chains. The FGG programme focuses on recalibrating power within the global architecture of trade and value chains by amplifying the voices of targeted rights-holders &#x2013;  small producers and traders, workers, fishers, rural and Indigenous peoples, religious and ethnic minorities, and migrants, especially the women and youth among them &#x2013; who are practising, claiming or defending human rights and fair and green economic practices, and/or whose rights are being ignored, threatened or violated by corporations and/or governments. We aim to transform social relations so that these rights-holders&#x2019; voices are heard and heeded. FGG&#x2019;s eight members (ActionAid, Both ENDS, Clean Clothes Campaign, IT for Change, Milieudefensie/Friends of the Earth International/Friends of the Earth Europe, Samdhana Institute, SOMO and the Transnational Institute) cooperate with some 1000+ partners and allies in our many worldwide networks to strengthen collective capacities to advance a common vision of fair and green trade and value chains.</narrative>

(1) The Karnataka (a state in India) Additional Secretary for e-Governance cited an oped written by IT for Change on the Karnataka State Open Data Policy framework to allay civil society concerns about Big Tech capture of public data sets. This came after IT for Change, in collaboration with DataMeet and Environment Support Group, pushed for action against this policy framework , which was announced without public consultation. IT for Change raised a range of concerns around the policy &#x2013; the lack of public consultation, anonymization being an insufficient safeguard for citizen privacy in data sharing arrangements, and the issues of data monetization as a violation of the state&#x2019;s fiduciary responsibility. The State Government of Karnataka in India, decided to revisit its Open Data Policy framework following these efforts. (x)

As part of the working group, participating in close to 5 meetings with leading academics, technologists, civil society members, and activists in the domain of data and AI governance from across the world, IT for Change developed a futuristic roadmap for a global AI constitutionalism, which has been included in a key paper brought out by the group.

 (1) A ten member UN expert group that supports the UN&#x2019;s Technology Facilitation Mechanism invited IT for Change to be a member and has taken on board IT for Change&#x2019;s recommendations in developing the agenda around digital economy and infrastructure issues for the upcoming Science, Technology and Innovation forum in May 2022. 

 (1) The Government of Kerala (a state in India) (1) invited IT for Change into dialogue to develop public policy frameworks through mapping of good practices in platform cooperativism, and provision of social security to knowledge workers, key agendas IT for Change has advocated for through research and policy work, for kick starting public initiatives in December 2021.

 (1) The ILO governing body (1) in 2021, recognized the concept of workers&#x2019; data rights, which IT for Change has worked on and promoted as a critical area for labor rights in the digital economy was by, and has tabled the issue to be discussed in the 2022 International Labour Conference.

Through the year, we have had opportunities to use the FGG mandate to broaden understanding of the impacts of digitalization to value chains and global south development among our partners including unions and CSOs through multiple webinars, workshops, meetings and smaller discussions. IT for Change has also focused on broadening the understanding of these issues within the alliance through online learning sessions with FGG alliance members such as Centre for Research on Multinational Corporations (SOMO) and Transnational Institute (TNI) including a crash course on big tech and the Global South.

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">(16) 16 CSO actors from LLMUMICs, including from India, Philippines and Indonesia strengthened their understanding of feminist perspectives on digital economy and society by participating in a two-day online institute organized by IT for Change. The institute was the first of its kind to provide conceptual and analytical inputs and in-depth capacity building on the issue, covering diverse topics such as the platform economy and macroeconomic shifts, and feminist agendas for policy in the digital economy and society. The institute also focussed on addressing the critical issue of voice and claims-making in a platformized society. (x, g)

(2) CSOs from Asia and Latin America improved their knowledge on Digital Sequence Information (DSI) through a capacity building webinar on Digital Sequence Information (DSI), Biodiversity as Big Data: How DSI fits into Global Data Flows, organized by the Global Youth Biodiversity Network in collaboration with Third World Network in August 2021, for which IT for Change provided content and programming inputs. The session addressed how gene sequences and data science are transforming biological research, and how digital sequencing of information relates to fairness and equity for developing countries, especially for farmers and indigenous peoples.

(1) The People&#x2019;s Working Group on Multistakeholderism, which IT for Change is part of, was able to further a critical perspective on the multistakeholder capture of the digital governance process as part of a coordinated campaign targeting the annual forum of the World Economic Forum in January 2021. IT for Change supported the campaign through the development of knowledge outputs. (x)

 (2) CSOs working effectively towards common strategic goals on science, technology and development in different parts of the UN were able to strengthen their capacities on digital issues through a CSO Briefing in Science, Technology and Development Agenda at the UN for CSOs in May 2021, organized by the ETC Group and the CSO FfD Group, where IT for Change provided inputs.

(1) CSOs in the ICT sector were able to broaden their knowledge on digital sector Business Responsibility and Sustainability Reporting at a CSO consultation jointly organized by UNDP India and Partners for Change, where IT for Change was invited to provide inputs on non-financial reporting guidelines for digital economy actors. 

(1) CSO actors were able to expand their knowledge on digital economy issues and strengthen their engagement at the Consultation of Civil Society with the Co-Chairs of the Preparatory Committee for the Fifth United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries (LDC5) in May 2021. Towards this, IT for Change, as part of the Just Net Coalition and in collaboration with Social Watch, supported input development outlining key concerns for digital economy for LDCs. 

(21) 21 CSOs actors expanded their knowledge and were able to contribute insights to an important policy brief at a strategy meeting and co-organized by IT for Change in collaboration with Indian digital rights CSO, Center for Internet and Society on the Indian Government&apos;s newly launched e-Shram portal, designed to deliver targeted social security benefits to informal sector workers. 

(1) The Alliance for Sustainable and Holistic Agriculture developed a response to the Government of India&apos;s Ministry of Agriculture, Cooperation and Farmer Welfare on their Consultation Paper on India Digital System of Agriculture in June 2021, with expert support and inputs from IT for Change.
