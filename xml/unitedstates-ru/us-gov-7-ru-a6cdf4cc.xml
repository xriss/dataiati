    <narrative xml:lang="EN">U.S. assistance programs are designed to promote Russia&amp;rsquo;s role as a stable, democratic, and reliable partner in addressing crucial global issues, to support U.S.-Russian cooperation in areas of common interest, to advance priorities outlined by the Bilateral Presidential Commission (BPC) Working Groups, and to develop partnerships that leverage Russia&amp;rsquo;s considerable resources in solving domestic and international problems. At the same time, the United States will support Russian organizations that encourage the adoption of policies and practices that promote democratic norms on issues such as human rights, civil society, and the rule of law. Programs under the Peace and Security objective will complement broader U.S. Government efforts under the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program to enhance nuclear cooperation and reduce the threat of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMD). Secretary Clinton noted that the coming years will be crucial for Russian democracy, as Russians from all walks of life make their voices heard and express their hopes for the future. Programs under the Governing Justly and Democratically objective will promote U.S. interests in a strong, politically vibrant, open, democratic Russia, as well as deepening the U.S.-Russian partnership. Resources will also help fight the transnational threats of epidemic disease, such as multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB).
