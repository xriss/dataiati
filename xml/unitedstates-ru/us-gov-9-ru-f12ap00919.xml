This includes &apos;The purpose of this proposal is to demonstrate measurable changes in human access and wildlife population numbers, particularly ungulates, resulting from logging road closures in order to prove the effectiveness of closures for tiger conservation. This would be done by: (a) closing unused logging roads; (b) measuring changes in wildlife populations; (c) measuring changes in human use; (d) designing closures that facilitate effective law enforcement; and (e) promoting road closures as a necessary component of FSC certification. Specifically the applicant would select six roads within the Maksimovka River drainage and close three of these roads once the ground thaws in the spring 2013 and then (a) measure changes in wildlife populations; (2) measure changes in human use; (3) design closures that facilitate effective law enforcement; and (4) promote road closures as a necessary component of FSC certification.&apos;.

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">U.S. assistance programs are designed to promote Russia&amp;rsquo;s role as a stable, democratic, and reliable partner in addressing crucial global issues, to support U.S.-Russian cooperation in areas of common interest, to advance priorities outlined by the Bilateral Presidential Commission (BPC) Working Groups, and to develop partnerships that leverage Russia&amp;rsquo;s considerable resources in solving domestic and international problems. At the same time, the United States will support Russian organizations that encourage the adoption of policies and practices that promote democratic norms on issues such as human rights, civil society, and the rule of law. Programs under the Peace and Security objective will complement broader U.S. Government efforts under the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program to enhance nuclear cooperation and reduce the threat of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMD). Secretary Clinton noted that the coming years will be crucial for Russian democracy, as Russians from all walks of life make their voices heard and express their hopes for the future. Programs under the Governing Justly and Democratically objective will promote U.S. interests in a strong, politically vibrant, open, democratic Russia, as well as deepening the U.S.-Russian partnership. Resources will also help fight the transnational threats of epidemic disease, such as multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB).
