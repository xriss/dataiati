   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Project&apos;&apos;s development impact will include: -	Direct Job Creation: The Project will create approx. 80 new direct jobs, as well as temporary jobs during construction. Number of female jobs are expected to be in the range of 10%. Given that the hotel will be operated by a world-class hotel operator, the Project will help enhance local workers&apos;&apos; skill-sets. -	Indirect Job Creation and Local Supply Chain Linkages: As in all hotel projects a significant number of indirect jobs are expected to be created. The Project will generate incremental business and indirect jobs for domestic Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) in the value chain, construction supply and services during implementation including transportation, tour guides, F&amp;B suppliers and other service providers.  -	Bridging Gap in the Tourism Sector: Fairfield Kathmandu would be the first internationally branded and professionally managed hotel in Nepal focusing on middle income travelers. This particular segment would be more interested for leisure travel to Nepal because of quality infrastructure and service. -	Technology Transfer: NHGPL intends to adopt global best practices in terms of green building construction, efficient hotel operations, worker productivity and energy efficiency, which would set an important example and potentially elevate productivity and efficiency standards of the overall industry.  -	Benefit to the Government: The Project will generate tax revenues for the Government of Nepal.</narrative>
