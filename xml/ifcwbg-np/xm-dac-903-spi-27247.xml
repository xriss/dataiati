   <narrative xml:lang="EN">- Contribution to sustainable development:   The resurgence of the tourism industry in Nepal is being hampered by the unavailability of airline services to the major regional hubs. Through its support to boosting tourism, air transport also contributes though indirectly but to a great extent to reduce poverty by generating economic growth, providing employment opportunities (tourism accounts for more than 300,000 jobs in Nepal), earn foreign currency reserves and increasing tax collection.   - Safe, reliable and efficient transportation services to underdeveloped areas:   Being a mainly mountainous country, air travel is important to economic development as well as emergency and essential services to isolated regions of the country with either none or limited road access.  BAPL provides essential air transportation services in Nepal, where traveling by road or rail transportation is inconvenient, time consuming and at times impractical in light of the quality of the countrys land-based transport infrastructure and the distances between the countrys urban centers..   - Investment Enabler:   Air transport is an enabler of investment both into and out of countries and regions: viable air transport links are one of the key considerations that influence where international companies choose to invest. Improved air transport links by way of improved connectivity between cities, expand the market in which companies operate. As a result, companies are better able to exploit economies of scale thereby reducing costs, and to specialize in areas of comparative advantage. By opening of markets, air services expose companies to stiffer competition, encouraging them to become more efficient.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Buddha Air Private Limited (BAPL or the company or the Airline) started operations in Nepal on October 11, 1997 with one brand new Beech 1900D financed by Raytheon Aircraft Credit Corporation USA. The company currently owns and operates five 1900D Beech aircraft and two 1900C Beech aircraft, each with capacity to seat 18 passengers. The company focuses on scheduled passenger flights between the capital, Kathmandu and the regional airports as well as mountain flights (flights over the Himalayan range for tourists). The company plans to purchase ATR42-300s and also construct an aircraft hangar. The purchase of the aircraft will help BAPL meet the anticipated increase in passenger demand and provide the company with an alternative in the absence of leased planes from the aircraft company.</narrative>
