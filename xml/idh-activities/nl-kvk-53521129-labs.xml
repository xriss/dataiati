     <narrative xml:lang="EN">Number of multi-stakeholder agreements signed as a result of IDH interventions. A multi-stakeholder agreement is a collection of institutional arrangements, decision-making processes, policy instruments, and underlying values in the system by which multiple actors pursue their interests in sustainable food and manufacturing, ecosystem service conservation, and livelihood security. These institutional arrangements include multi-stakeholder platforms and coalitions that represent the main actors in the sector and landscapes responsible for sustainable production, landscape governance and planning.

Typical activities through which IDH seeks to influence sector or landscape governance including supporting the development of policy frameworks &#x2013; such as Green Growth Plans and Sector Initiatives &#x2013; including the convening of the multi-stakeholder platforms and coalitions required for these; influencing policy changes or supporting improved enforcement; attracting and mobilizing investments for sustainability solutions; and capacity building of local government.</narrative>
