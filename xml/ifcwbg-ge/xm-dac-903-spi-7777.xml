Description of Company and Purpose of Project    	The Georgian Glass and Mineral Water Company N.V. (GGMW) was formed in 1995 to acquire and revitalize the Borjomi brand of mineral water.  GGMW has a majority interest in the Khashuri glass bottle factory and is involved in two joint ventures which own two mineral water bottling plants in Georgias Borjomi Valley.    	The Republic of Georgia is known throughout the former Soviet Union for its abundant mineral water resources.  The Borjomi brand of mineral water has been distributed throughout the FSU for over 100 years.  The brand name Borjomi remains widely recognized in the FSU and is often associated with medicinal qualities.  After the dissolution of the Soviet Union and during the subsequent civil unrest in Georgia, much of the countrys industry, including these mineral water operations, was idled.  GGMW was formed to reactivate the glass factory and the bottling operations and to relaunch the Borjomi brand of mineral water.    Environmental Category and Issues    	This is a category B project according to IFCs environmental review procedure.  Environmental issues of potential concern on this project include air emissions and other discharges from the bottle manufacture plant, potential contamination of the mineral water source as well as health protection measures for the bottled product during the mineral water bottling operations.   Key mitigation measures include the elimination of the need to produce carbon dioxide and a management plan to protect the mineral water reservoir.
