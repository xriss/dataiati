   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Project is expected to have the following development impacts:    - Demonstration Effect and Improved Access to Quality Infrastructure:      The project will be the first modern mixed-use development in Georgia offering quality shopping experience as well as the best Class A office space in Tbilisi. It will provide quality business infrastructure to the business community and attract companies seeking to establish their premises and work in a new neighborhood away from downtown Tbilisi. This is expected to help shape the appearance and functionality of the city and its attractiveness as domestic and regional commercial destination.      - Retail Sector Formalization:      The retail sector in Tbilisi is presently underdeveloped and fragmented. The shopping mall component of the project will be the first in Georgia constructed to international standards and will significantly improve the Georgian retail experience.  It is expected to introduce more formalization in the sector and provide local consumers with greater choice of higher quality goods.     - Support to local construction sector:     The project will support the growth of the construction and related sectors generate (such as construction and construction products) and service firms (architects, engineers, brokers and surveyors).</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Rakeen Development PJSC (Rakeen), a real-estate development company based in Ras Al Khaimah (RAK) in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) is embarking on a diversification of its business operations with its first investment in Georgia.  The project is to develop a mixed-used commercial property consisting of a shopping mall and two office towers, at an estimated cost of $255 million.  The project will be located on a 7.3 ha site about 10 km from downtown Tbilisi, the capital city of Georgia.  The project company to be established (Uptown Tbilisi) will sell each component of the project in a phased manner over a 4-5 year period.  The proposed project in Georgia will be one of Rakeens first green field venture outside UAE and will address the growing local demand for quality property developments fuelled by Georgias strong economic performance in the past few years and rising income levels.  The project is likely to be the first and largest mixed-use development in Georgia, and the development impact of quality business infrastructure (retail and office space) will be high.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project will be located on a 7.3 ha site on David Aghmashenebeli Alley in the Digomi neighborhood about 10 km from downtown Tbilisi, the capital city of Georgia.  The site enjoys a favorable location, on an arterial road that links Tbilisi with other cities in Georgia and the Caucasian region.  This part of the city is developing fast but currently has low density villa and cottage type residential properties. There are few commercial developments comprising auto dealerships, gas filling stations and a large home furnishing store.  Tbilisis largest (and so far only) hypermarket Goodwill is also located in this area as well as the US Embassy. The Swiss embassy will be locating nearby.</narrative>
