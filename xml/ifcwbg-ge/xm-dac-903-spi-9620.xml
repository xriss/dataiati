   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Summary Of Project Information (SPI)       Project Name    Georgia - Telasi      RegionEurope   Sector   Project No009620   Projected Board DateDecember 27, 1999   Company NameAES Telasi JSC   Technical Partner and/or Major Shareholders    	American Electric Services Corporation (AES) Incorporated owns 75% of AES Telasi JSC (Telasi).    Project Cost Including proposed IFC investment    	The total project cost is US$147 million. The proposed IFC investment is an A loan of US$30 million.    Location of project and Description of site    	Tbilisi, the capital city of Georgia, an urban area.    Description of Company and Purpose of Project    	AES Telasi JSC is the recently privatized electricity distribution company of the capital of Georgia, which serves approximately 370,000 customers, delivering 2,197 GWh of electricity per annum (a major part of total national energy consumption). The project aims to reform and rehabilitate Telasi in order to bring it in line with modern utility practices. The project costs will include the rehabilitation of dilapidated physical assets; installation of meters and modern billing systems; and reform of governance and staff structures of Telasi.     	Georgia has suffered severe power outages over the last several years due to a breakdown in payment discipline. This has caused personal hardship for the citizens of Georgia and has hampered economic development. This project aims to improve the level of payments for electricity delivered by Telasi, which is the largest electricity distribution company in Georgia. By improving cash flows available to pay for generation of electricity, it is expected that outages in Georgia will decrease.    Environmental Category and Issues    	This is a category B project according to IFCs environmental and social review procedure because specific impacts may result which can be avoided or mitigated by adhering to generally recognized performance standards, guidelines, or design criteria. The review of this project consisted of appraising technical, environmental, and social information submitted by the project sponsor, as well as a site review by IFCs technical staff. The following potential environmental, health, safety and social impacts of the project were identified: handling and storage of fuel chemicals; solid and liquid waste management; management of transformers or equipment containing PCBs; phase out of CFCs including Halon; and worker health, safety and training programs. Social issues include: management of land acquisition; economic displacement of people associated with the siting; and right-of-way alignment for new facilities and mitigation of the social impact of redundancies.    The majority of the distribution system is underground with buried cable. The system is not located in any national parks or environmentally sensitive areas. The setting ranges from heavily industrialized to rural. The Environmental Action Plan (EAP) will identify active leaks, stop them and remove underground storage tanks and piping, unused electrical equipment, leaking transformers and vehicle repair pits and remediation of all areas. Additional research will be conducted to determine whether groundwater is used for potable purposes and if so evaluate the extent of contamination, if any, in the groundwater. Analysis of dielectric fluid were conducted and concluded that PCBs were below the method detection limit. Solid and liquid waste is limited to paper, scrap metal, electrical equipment, and oily waters from the vehicle maintenance areas. As part of the EAP, AES will also develop a program to segregate and dispose of solid waste according to type and level of hazard. AES Telasi has indicated that there are no CFC&apos;&apos;s in the system. AES Telasi has implemented formal safety training courses initially for all outside workers and those dealing with electricity and materials. AES is also investing in safety equipment, reorganization of the safety department, drafting of a Safety Handbook, forming health care task force and implementing an annual health physical program. Most staff are members of the Professional Trade Union. A committee of specialist, trade union representatives, and AES Telasi employees was convened which developed a generous Voluntary Selective Severance (VSS) package. The company will also assist with the training courses and exams for those who opt for the VSS. Some 760 people have taken the package and left the company. The current number of employees is 1,699. Further reduction in staff are anticipated in April 2000.   The sponsor has demonstrated that the proposed project will comply with applicable Georgian and World Bank Group requirements.
