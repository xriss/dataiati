   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Georgia Reconstruction and Development Company (GRDC or the company) is a real estate company established in February 2004 to make and manage investments in urban real estate infrastructure development in Georgia. Following decades of minimal investment in housing and commercial property developments, Georgias existing urban real estate infrastructure is primarily composed of outdated and badly maintained office and apartment blocks. Since the turn of the century and more specifically following the Rose Revolution in Georgia, construction has been quickly ramping up with demand for quality residential, office and commercial space rapidly outpacing supply, spurred by strong performance of the economy. The proposed IFC investment will help support GRDCs strategy of expansion and consolidation in the Georgian property market as a market leader in delivering quality residential, office and commercial real estate.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project would have significant development impact in Georgia because of its effect on the following stakeholders:  - Residential, office and commercial tenants  by developing quality residential and business infrastructure which will help improve the quality and volume of stock available to the local population, as well as foreign and local businesses.  - Contractors, subcontractors and other related businesses  by increasing demand for their services and contributing directly and indirectly to job creation in the construction sector and other related sectors of the economy.  - Banks and mortgage clients  by improving the quality and quantity of real estate stock which in turn will have important downstream effects on the mortgage/housing finance market, a sector which is currently in its early stage of development in Georgia.  - Government  by creating opportunities for additional revenues generated through the payments of taxes.  The project will also mobilize technical assistance services along the project supply chain of property management, including capacity building at the contractor/subcontractor and tenant levels, where applicable, sustainable urban development and energy efficiency schemes, etc. Finally, the project will implement high environmental and social standards by requiring GRDC to ensure adherence by each development project to IFCs environmental and social guidelines and to Georgias regulations in those respects as well.</narrative>
