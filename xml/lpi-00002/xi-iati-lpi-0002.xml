   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Living Peace project seeks to achieve its goal by pursuing following objectives at five different levels: 1. Individuel Level: Men and women (spouses), healed of severe mental health and psychosocial problems, adopted positive non-violent coping strategies and experience greater personal efficacy to build meaningful relations with self and others. 2. Family Level: Reduced violence at home and restored peaceful partner relations create a safe and healthy environment for women, men and children. Reduction of violence use by men against their partners and children and increase gender equitable behaviours in the household create a safer environment for all members of the family. 3. Community Level: Restored community-based social support systems increase social cohesion between families, individuals and community structures resulting in higher levels of inclusion, and solidarity between community members. 4. Society Level: Congolese civil society organizations and public institutions of Police, Army and Health Care and religious leaders institutionalized the Living Peace approach in their services to adequately address the consequences of SGBV, promote positive masculinity and prevent (mainly) men getting involved in conflicts and/or (re)join armed groups. 5. Women Social and Economic Empowerment: Women, partners of male participants in Living Peace groups, enjoy greater social and economic autonomy with positive support of husbands that participated in Living Peace groups.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">LPI is working with ex-combatants and ex-child soldiers in Kirotche and Mweso health zones to help them to address a range of psychosocial challenges during their transition to civilian life in order to increase their prospects for successful reintegration. This includes the healing of individual and social trauma; reduce the effects of stigma and exclusion in order to create a space that facilitates the process of reconciliation between ex-combatants, their families and communities. In the context of the on-going conflict in eastern DRC, it seems that the social fabric is extremely weak. The fragmented nature of society is a serious obstacle to the reintegration process of ex-combatants. The building of social capital through the expansion of social networks, and then the more general establishment of social cohesion in the community, should be at the heart of the processes of social reintegration.</narrative>
