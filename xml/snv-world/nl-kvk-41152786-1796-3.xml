   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Through the &#x2018;Voice for Change Partnership&#x2019; (V4CP) programme, SNV works to strengthen civil society organisations (CSOs) in their role as advocates and lobbyists. We work together with IFPRI and over 50 CSOs to foster collaboration among relevant stakeholders, and influence decision-makers with solid and contextualized evidence to get the interests of communities embedded into government and business policies and practices. For this specific project in Kenya, our advocacy activities focus on Resilience.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">23-05-2018: In spite of the political party campaigns during the period, the CSOs managed to have meetings with national and county government officers. This was due to good rapport and connections that the CSOs had with specific contact persons in respective institutions, as well as being able to demonstrate that the discussions were urgent, especially in the light of worsening droughts in pastoralist areas. Resource Advocacy Program working in coordination with National Drought Management Authority, Isiolo has convened meetings to identify opportunities, collaborate and synergise around climate resilience. CSOs have also sought one on one meetings with government officers at every opportunity. Resource Advocacy Program has held meetings with Isiolo county officials and with Members of County Assembly (MCA) seeking information/ clarification on county budget allocations to water and climate change, progress on climate change fund bill and customary bill and County Integrated Development Plan. Centre for Minority Rights Development met officers from Ministry of Agriculture, Climate Change Unit and shared inputs to the climate smart agriculture framework. Kenya Livestock Marketing council held separate meetings with National and County government officers (Director of livestock production - State Department of Livestock, Isiolo Governor, County Director of Livestock- Marsabit, County Director of Veterinary services - Isiolo, county lawyer, county clerk) on sale yard bill and livestock identification and traceability strategy. The biggest challenge was due to the fact that many government officers were not sure the direction government policy would take after elections, depending on whether the current governments would be retained or be replaced after the general elections. That uncertainty contributed to reluctance of the officers wanting to meet and make commitments they were not sure would be taken on board should new governments be in place after elections.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Through planned  county  consultative meetings, it is  expected  that resilience CSO partners will have more meetings with key stakeholders (Government, private sector and development partners) with substantive results on the NCCAP 2018-2022 and the implementation of County Climate Fund Bills e.g. in Isiolo. The  established CSO platforms at county level will  enable intimate review and development of plans, policies, strategies and regulation for building pastoralists&apos; resilience to climate change. On County Climate Fund Bills CSOs will specifically empasize the public finance management to establish fund capital for a low carbon development pathway in Kenya. Cemiride and PACJA have sent their comments on the proposed climate fund bill to the National Treasury for incorporation. Issues raised include management of the seed capital and fund administrators and where it will be institutionalized.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">20-06-2018: MOU has been signed in Marsabit County. KLMC initiated a policy discussion with the county of Marsabit with regards to the adoption of the co-management model in the management of livestock markets. Several county based stakeholders including the Food for the Hungry partcipated in this discussion. The specific role that KLMC played in this is that it mobilized all the stakeholders and facilitated the initial stakeholders discussion. KLMC also provided and shared with the stakeholders a detailed presentation on how the model works, benefits to the livesock farmers and the county government as well. This MoU has acted as a precursor for the development of the current livestock management sale yard bill which is expected to legitimize the model and give more decision making powers to the livestock marketing associations.</narrative>

The livestock Insurance Program is a national government insurance scheme that is aimed at providing cover for the livestock that are mainly owned by the pastoral communities. This is therefore a program that is intended to cushion livestock owners against the adverse effects of the drough especially the loss of livestock to the drought. The Insurance program is based on the payment of affordable and subsidised premium rates by the farmers where animal feeds and fodder are provided during the dry spell. CEMIRIDE and KLMC organised stakeholders meetings to review the content of the program and agree with the national government on the implemenataion approach.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">&quot;The Movable Property Security Rights Act and regulations came into force mid 2017 which provide an avenue through which pastoralists cn use livestock as assets to secure financing for business and development enhancing their resilience. However, since enactment, it is not discernible if pastoralists have benefited or even that financial institutions have products developed for pastoralists using this law.  CSOs will follow on this to realize benefits for pastoralists.
Additionally, CSOs will continue to follow progress on KLIP, especially given that the government insurance scheme exists alongside a private sector lead initiative of Index Based Livestock Insurance (ILRI, TAKAFUL Insurance and APA insurance). There is also the private sector Index Based livestock Insurance (IBLI) being rolled out alongside the government one. The challenge however is that both could be working at cross purposes, and at the worst, the government scheme could be undermining the private sector one,since it is free. Further, both schemes are being implemneted with very different structures, meaning that they are causing confusion to the pastoralists and may not in the end achieve the intended purpose of enhancing resilience. There is therefore an urgent need to bring both implementors of the schemes to a round table to harmonise the structures for roll out which CSOs intend to facilitate. &quot;</narrative>

Livestock related policies - 2
&gt;Two committees set up by Government are in place to follow up on two policies: KLIP and National Livestock policy. The  committee tasked with KLIP has  not met since it was instituted hence follow up has been difficult. 
&gt;The National Livestock Policy committtee has however recently become vibrant and review of the draft is ongoing although progress is unclear  
&gt;Although KLMC had cultivated stong relationship with PPG and remains one of the key ally/stakeholder it has become difficult to have regualr meetings due to polarising national politics(referendum discourse) that divided the group right in the middle. 

NCCAP - 3
In December 2019, PACJA was assigned the role as designate CSO to track all the climate finance by the national treasury. PACJA is also designated by the Climate Change Directorate (CCD) to report on behalf of the national Civil Society Organizations  on the implementation of NCCAP II. Through the  Kenya Platform on Climate Governance (KPCG), PACJA is reporting to stakeholders including government on these processes and making follow up through the system to enhance accountability.

Climate Smart Agriculture (CSA) - 2
&gt;CSA MSP steering committee exists as a forum for consultation with MOALF on implementation CSA framework. The CSA project funded by world bank should support marginalised communties but feeedback on intereventions and progress towards this has not been forthcoming from the Ministry 
&gt;NGEC marginalised communities platform also exits but the definition by NGEC of marginalised is in contention and as such following the agenda for marginalised communities (including pastoralists) through this platform has not progressed</narrative>

These engagements have  however been ad hoc and there is need for formal channels of engagement with the CSOs
&gt;CEMIRIDE and KLMC organised PPG breakfast meeting prior to KPW 2018 during which MPs were appraised on the Climate Change discourse in the country. A number of areas that were of concern to pastoralists were discussed including involvement and participation in the NCCAP 2018-22 formulation, the Equalisation Fund, the Climate Change Funds at the County levels, Livestock Insurance amongst other areas. While the meetings were to have been targeted and regular, this was not possible though individual MPs were further engaged. The MPs felt that there was need to for CSOs to strengthen capacities of MPs and Members of County Assemblies on how to link the Equalisation Fund to Climate Change Adaptation and hence lobby for its speedy implementation. The MPs were also of a strong opinion that for accountability, the implementation committee for the Equalisation Fund includes community/ CSO representation.</narrative>

The county  has engaged with CSOs  through  CSO platforms at the county on matters  climate  change.The county  government of Marsabit  has committed to work closely with the CSO platform for enhanced information  exchange on matters  climate change in the  county. 

The need for accountability is growing, for example at the 3rd Stakeholder forum in Marsabit technical officers from livestock department were nominated to do field visit to assess progress/outcome of programs implemented by partners in thematic area of livelihood support.  Their  feedback and action from this exercise will be significant in informing sector coordination.

Livestock marketing associations (LMAs) and Ward County Climate Change Planning Committee (WCCPC) were coached to be champions to advocate and Lobby for inclusion of programs that builds resilience, reduce poverty and  equality at County Planning and Budgeting process  public participation forums. This has empowered citizens to be proactive in public participation and raise demands for accountability. For instance in Kinna public participation 2018, citizens sustained request to be provided with progress report on implementation of their expressed priorities in the previous financial year; a clear indication that there is demand for accountability at grassroot level.</narrative>

Due to COVID-19, interactions were resticted. Public participation necessary for the passing of various laws and policies was made difficult and as such many policies (e.g. county saleyard bills) that were expected to  have advanced up to adoption are still in the pipeline. However, KLMC kept close contact with key county policymakers even during the tight restriction period and now that restrictions have eased, engagement on this policy processes is quickly picking up. The saleyard regulations process in Samburu is advanced, at  cabinet and county assembly level for discussion, which is a marked improvement from the situation in 2019.

&gt;PACJA has had very good engagement in the operationalisation of the Climate Change Adaptation Policy of Marsabit County. The Policy was launched in Augus by the County Government led by The Governor and the Department of Environment and its objectives made widely known to the general public through media engagement. Through Marsabit climate change chapter CSOs were advancing awareness and capacity building. They planned to use local radio to promote awareness and hold stakeholder meetings with government to improve implementation. PACJA has supported the awareness initiatives of the county CSO climate change chapter. Following the launch, plans have been set in motion to  work on the related climate change bill ( to be led by PACIDA) and the climate change regulations ( to be led by PACJA with support from V4CP) which should be ready 2weeks time within September 2020. 
&gt;PACJA&apos;a engagement in Isiolo is through the CSO platform. Consultations and exchange of knowledge between the platform and PACJA on climate change  matters are regular.

Improving pastoralist economic resilience is important in the context of climate change. One of the major bottlenecks of livestock marketing in Kenya is presence of livestock diseases. Reduction in livestock disease through better delivery of veterinary services will open Kenyan livestock to export and better markets. Trade in hides and skins provides additional income to pastoralists which can be used to access veterinary services, acquire fodder or improve herd composition in the face of climate change.</narrative>

&gt;NDMA is an agency of the Government of Kenya mandated to establish mechanisms which ensure that drought does not result in emergencies and that the impacts of climate change are sufficiently mitigated. KLMC has continued to have good collaboration with NDMA extending to county level e.g. rangeland policy in Isiolo. NDMA invited KLMC to provide inputs to discussions on the climate change fund bill invited KLMC to the meetings for input. KLMC is a member of two NDMA committees at national level i.e. on marketing and institutional development. The committees have only held one meeting this year because of COVID-19. 
&gt;The relationship between KLMC and designated technical line ministries (MOALF, MOTI,) and partners (NDMA, KNCC,KEPSA,ASF, COG) will continue to flourish due to a number of activities in the pipeline that need to be completed before end of July 2020 e.g. Cascading National policies to the counties through guidance in the development of livestock policies. 
&gt;Engagement with MoALF on the National Livestock Insurance Policy has progressed to development of related bills both at national and county level. 

* KLMC had started discussions with State Dept. of Livestock to hold a workshop for DoALF CECs to provide a forum to share issues of livestock insurance, co-management model etc but this has been made difficult by restrictions imposed by COVID-19.

Collaboration in Marsabit and Isiolo is well advanced. CSO interests for increased budget allocation to key government departments of Agriculture and Water have been fulfilled. In 2018 KLMC commissioned budget tracking study in Marsabit and Isiolo to assess level of resource allocation to climate sensitive sectors and supported the advocacy budget meetings and lobbied the relevant assembly committee for budget increase to climate sensitive sectors.  In June 2019, budget estimates for financial year 2019 /2020 for Department of Agriculture, Livestock and Fisheries in Isiolo increased to +9.9% while in Marsabit  budget increased to + 8.7% for both the Department of Agriculture, Livestock and Fisheries and The Department of Water and Environment respectively. Although not all plans have been processed to completion (e.g. Marsabit livestock trade and market bill and Marsabit livestock policy, Isiolo sale yard act ammendment) there is still close collaboration with the county governments on this.
&gt;In Isiolo county, KLMC collaborated with the department of Agriculture, Livestock and Fisheries, Division of Livestock  in orgnising Isiolo Livestock stakeholders forum. KLMC suggested  TOR for  the forum which were accepted. KLMC also disseminated policy brief for budget tracking 2013-2017 for Isiolo showing budget allocation to agriculture sector which was received well
&gt;Together with other partners, KLMC organised a meeting with assembly committee of agriculture, CEC, CO,Directors for Agriculture,Livestock production,Veterinary services and county director of legal services of Marsabit to discuss Marsabit livestock trade and market bill 2019 and Marsabit livestock Policy whose approval process has been delayed.

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">26-04-2020: KLMC planned to engage with the various relevant government institutions including the Pastoralist Parliamentary Group (PPG), the MOALF,FCDC,ASF,KLDC (clustered meetings) on relevant issues like insurance policy,feed policy, NLP, 80% export levy and drought emergencies. However no change in support is seen from key decision makers on these issues; discussion on insurance stalled, evidence on county abbatoirs was not disseminated and despite sharing evidence on export tax no changes were constituted or enforced. 

The policy maker rating method was not strictly conducted but according to the guidance provided in rating support, CEMIRIDE analysis of 2019 engagements confirms increased support from 3 key decision makers: 
 
1. CS Environment Keriako Tobiko - since the NCCAP 2018-22 process he has always shown public support for the engagement of marginalised communities including pastoralists in the relevant climate change processes. In 2018 the CS publicly called for the involvement of marginalised communities in the NCCAP 2018-22 development, and in 2019, during a meeting with CCD Assistant Director Thomas Lerenten, CEMIRIDE was assured that the CS was still very much in support and will push for any policy interventions that will be of benefit tmarginalised communities. 
2.The Climate Change Unit Director, Ms Veronica Ndettu, in a meeting with CEMIRIDE in November 2019 reitarated the comitment of the CS Mwangi Kiunjuri, to supporting the marginalised community involvement in climate smart agriculture and was supportive of the policy environment to reflect that.
3. Dr. Pacifica Ogolla, the Head of CCD, was supportive of a marginalised community engagement framework with CCD which will secure better involvement and consultations of the communities on climate change processes. She indicated that she was eagerly waiting for the draft framework and adoption of the same. Also, in quater three, PACJA held a national validation conference for CSO engagement ...</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">30-04-2019: The policy maker rating will be done early 2019. It was not possible to assess support from the new office bearers as planned in the early phase of 2018 as they were only getting started with little known about them. Their interest could only be confidently assessed after some period of engagement in the sector and this will be done in 2019. So far a number of key decision makers have shown interest in pastoralists and climate change:
For instance, the CS Environment has on several occasions called for effective engagement of marginalized/ indigenous communities (including pastoralists) in climate change planning and actions. The Directors at the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock, Fisheries and Irrigation have been supportive towards special attention towards marginalized communities and inclusion in actions. A senator on the floor issued a statement calling for support of pastoralists resilience in March 2018. The Environment and Forest CS on several occasions called on the engagement and inclusion of marginalized communities in the climate change actions and planning. The Director of Climate Change Unit in the Ministry while at first reluctant to engage with marginalized communities became very supportive and called for the an engagement framework with marginalized communities. The Directors at Climate Change Unit have increasingly publicly supported the pastoralists resilience. This came through as CEMIRIDE was able to influence the CS Environment and Forestry to push for deliberate inclusion of marginalized communities in the process of reviewing the NCAAP. This was done through various platforms including meetings with senior staff of the Climate Change Directorate, the Kenya Pastoralists Week that brought together County and National Government officers, as well through the media. It is notable that this influence was picked up by the President who also while addressing the 7th CCDA, emphasized the fact that marginalized/ indigenous communiti ...</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">20-06-2018: &quot;Support from 22 decision makers (Governors, Chief Executives -CECs, Chief Officers and Directors of the following Ministries - water, energy, climate change and Agriculture, parliamentary committees: County Assembly committee for Agriculture, County Assembly committee for environment, land and natural resource, County Assembly committee on planning and budgeting in Isiolo and Marsabit counties) was monitored. Majority of these showed some level of support for climate change resileince building (e.g On June 1st 2017, the Isiolo county assembly chairman of house committee of Environment and Natural Resources and member of county Assembly from Cherab Ward mentioned that the county assembly is establishing Isiolo county climate fund legislation) however, the political mood and the preparations for 2017 general elections especially the political activities at the counties disrupted CSO advocacy activities. Key policy makers including the county executive committees, members of county assemblies and even the governors were all involved in the current political processes and accessing them turned out to be a difficult task. The drought experienced in many parts of the ASAL counties in 2017 also made it difficult for the project staff to conduct advocacy engagements as planned; crucial county leaders were involved in emergency drought interventions with little concentration given to civil society proposals for long term solutions to climate change and resilience building. 
Further, after 2017 national elections, office bearers in these positions have changed hence their support will have to be observed from early 2018  so that changes in support of pastoralist resilience building efforts can be reported at the end of the year.&quot;</narrative>

It&apos;s now very easy to access the Governor. 
&gt;At the grassroots, there has been engagement with Environment management committees (EMCs) who are essentially community elders with sweeping decision making influence. The EMCs have been central in passing and operationalisation of Marsabit Adaptation Policy.</narrative>

In the previous NCCAP 2013-2017, pastoralists and other indigenous communities were not recognized as  a separate and distinct group, vulnerable to climate change and consequently there were lapses in the provision of priority actions to enhance their resilience. The 2017-2012 Action Plan highlights the impact of drought and Climate change in general to pastoralists. It takes cognizance of the fact that these groups are particularly vulnerable to climate change due to environmental degradation and growing competition for land and water; and their dependency on livestock as their key source of income. The Action Plan identifies priority climate change actions to be undertaken by the government at both national and county levels to enhance the resilience of these vulnerable groups. Additionally, pastoralists and other indigenous groups will be involved in the reviewing of the implementation plans as well as monitoring and evaluation of the process every two (2) years.</narrative>

There is also targeted mobilisation of women in water sector working with the local CSO networks. Departments are also more aware of and considering gender responsive budgeting.

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">20-06-2018: &quot;&gt;The reviewed veterinary surgeon and the veterinary para-professionals bills was reviewed and comments provided but was not presented at flooor of the house in time before parliament closed . The Veterinary Surgeon and Veterinary Para-professionals Bill deters community  based animal health workers from providing animal health services at the farm level. The Bill states that community based animal health workers can only provide vet services under the direct supervision of graduate vets who are in reality few in the dry lands counties compared to the livestock population. The networks that were developed through the V4CP  support were used to rally support for the review of the  current Bill. KLMC facilitated stakeholders meetings to review the contents of the previous Bill in order to generate recommendations for consideration by the national legislators. In 2017 a reviewed Bill was shared with Hon Ali Wario who is the member of parliament for Bura constituency in order for the Billto be tabled at the National Assembly. The process is ongoing and it is expected that the Bill will be heard by mid this year.
&gt;Final draft of Isiolo County Disaster Risk Management (DRM) Policy has been finalized and will be presented to cabinet in the early phase in March 2018. This Policy is aimed at providing predictable and reliable climate adaptation interventions and the platform to coordinate and guide the intervention process.
&gt;National Policy for the sustainable development of arid and Semi-Arid lands was discussed. The meeting was organised by the National Drought Management Authority. In this meeting, KLMC through a memorandum submitted a list of issues that were later incorporated into the draft policy. Among these issues were: investment in marketing infrastructure such as feeder roads, livestock markets, and other processing equipment, setting up of drought mitigation and resilience county contingency funds and the inclusion of livestock marketing associa ...</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">30-04-2019: &gt;KLMC is lobbying waiver of  80 % tax levy on hides and skin export. Improving pastoralist economic resilience is important in the context of climate change. Trade in hides and skins provides additional income to pastoralists which can be used to access veterinary services, acquire fodder or improve herd composition in the face of climate change. 
&gt;The veterinary surgeon and the veterinary para-professionals bill did not make it as 2018 parliamentary house business. Following 2017 elections and political issues and posturing that followed, it has been difficult to table the bill at the floor of the house and real have robust development debates.</narrative>

In the previous NCCAP 2013-2017, pastoralists and other indigenous communities were not recognized as  a separate and distinct group, vulnerable to climate change and consequently there were lapses in the provision of priority actions to enhance their resilience. The 2017-2012 Action Plan highlights the impact of drought and Climate change in general to pastoralists. It takes cognizance of the fact that these groups are particularly vulnerable to climate change due to environmental degradation and growing competition for land and water; and their dependency on livestock as their key source of income. The Action Plan identifies priority climate change actions to be undertaken by the government at both national and county levels to enhance the resilience of these vulnerable groups. Additionally, pastoralists and other indigenous groups will be involved in the reviewing of the implementation plans as well as monitoring and evaluation of the process every two (2) years.</narrative>
