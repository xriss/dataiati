   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Through the &#x2018;Voice for Change Partnership&#x2019; (V4CP) programme, SNV works to strengthen civil society organisations (CSOs) in their role as advocates and lobbyists. We work together with IFPRI and over 50 CSOs to foster collaboration among relevant stakeholders, and influence decision-makers with solid and contextualized evidence to get the interests of communities embedded into government and business policies and practices. For this specific project in Kenya, our advocacy activities focus on Food &amp; Nutrition Security (FNS), in particular dairy.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">We aim to enhance consumer welfare in the dairy sector and to improve safety and reduction in milk losses. This will be achieved through evidence-based advocacy, capacity building and lobbying for policy and practice change in the dairy sector to spur action for the adoption of inclusive policies, regulations and programmes for milk safety and loss; and improvement in the coordination and implementation of milk safety and loss policies by government for increased market access and investments within the dairy industry in Kenya.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">08-10-2019: CUTS has received two general enquiries on milk safety which were addressed.   

To rejuvenate the online consumer portal, CUTS has allocated 2 staff members to monitor and regularly update information on the platform. Further, FNS parteners (SOCAA &amp; SACDEP) have administrative access to the portal to assist in news updates. Consumers mobilised through consumer watch groups at county level have been informed of the existence of the portal and are encouraged to report complaints using the portal. A hotline number is still being considered as an additional quick method to encourage complaints reporting. The online consumer cell counter recorded 3736 hits (number of times the portal has been visited) as at end of second quarter 2019;  approximately 125 percent increase from the first quarter count of 1664.  
           
Further, CUTS has co-opted officers from institutions such as the Ministry of Public Health and the Natioanl Food Safety Coordinating Committee (NFSCC) to the portal for direct access to complaints  received.  CUTS intends to link KECOPAC to the portal but at the moment  KECOPAC is building  its own internal structures first.</narrative>

However, on 2nd May 2019, CSOs learned that the KFDA bill had undergone its first reading at the floor of the Parliamentary Assembly after its introduction by a private member. The process leading to submission of the bill was closed and restricted stakeholder participation. The bill has faced opposition from the Pharmaceutical Society of Kenya and together with KenyaPrivate Sector Alliance (KEPSA) and civil society organisations, are lobbying that the bill is subjected to critical review and brought back to the public for comprehensive review considering the model&apos;s failures in   countries such USA and Tanzania.  CSOs and private sector will lobby Parliamentary Departmental Committees on Health and Agriculture on their concerns. 
Despite this setback, CUTS was able to make the following submissions:
1. CUTS provided written submissions into the  Dairy Industry Act Regulations 2017 in March 2019.                                        
2. CUTS also provided written submissions on 5th February on enhanced targeted budgetary allocation for food food safety that were consolidated into a common stakeholders&apos; position to inform Kenya&apos;s 2019/2020 budget.                                         3. CUTS provided inputs on improving milk quality and safety into the Nakuru, Nyandarua and Murang&apos;a Dairy Strategic Plan. Among the suggestions made were; introducing random quality checks for milk, adoption of the quality based payment system, investing in cold chain equipment, consumer awareness amond other interventions. The same was also done with the Laikipia Dairy Development Policy.</narrative>

CSO interaction with the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Fisheries (MoALF), State Department of Livestock especially on the food loss agenda remains low.    

The strengthened influence of CSOs in milk safety agenda at the national level is as evidenced below:           
1. The role of consumer organisations in policy advocacy and facilitation of youth inclusion in policy processes was recognised through an invitation to present and speak in a panel (Influencing Policy and Leadership Session) at Kenya&apos;s National Youth in Agribusiness Forum on 27th November 2018.                                                                 
2. Following a presentation made by CUTS on its milk safety advocacy and awareness creation activities for milk safety at a meeting with the Kenya Dairy Board on 2nd August 2018, the Managing Director KDB instructed formation of a focused group including KDB officers and CUTS to discuss activities for collaboration to promote milk quality and safety.            
3. Between 02 - 04 October 2018, CUTS engaged with national stakeholders in a  workshop that brought together experts from national agencies and institutions to highlight and prioritise safety issues Kenya.                                        
4. On 15th November 2018, CUTS was co-opted to the national steering committee on dairy awards scheme whose objective is to scale up production of safe milk.                                                                           
5.

The CIDP is a five year development plan for the county which spells out broad plans/ agenda in various sectors. In all counties, it was established that there exists opportunities to make inputs either at draft stage or at public particpation forums as required by law. Forums in which CSOs provide inputs will be explored in the coming year.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">25-10-2020: &gt;On 3rd April, CUTS initiated county dairy platform WhatsApp groups- Nakuru, Nyandarua and Laikipia as a way to ease communication and share information with dairy stakeholders especially during the Covid-19 crisis. Key government officers are members of these platforms. A number of questions have been put to them e.g. on status of policy development. There has also been improved communication and transparency from government e.g. the call from county livestock production division to stakeholders in the WhatsApp dairy platform to submit recommendations for the 2020/21 budget proposal. CUTS has over 2020 enhanced the role and position of dairy platforms (in Laikipia, Nyandarua and Nakuru) in policy making by strategically supporting them and the county government to develop sector newsletters detailing both their activities and intended plans especially on policy and key issues like food safety in order to promote mutual accountability

CUTS and SACDEP will follow up with KDB to ensure proper implementation of the dairy industry regulations at the county level by advocating development of appropriate county laws for example on milk conveyance, milk facilities/ premises and purchase of dairy equipment by County Governments. Based on current CSO engagements, progress on this seems more likely at the outset in Murang&apos;a and Nakuru counties. 
CSOs will also establish the status of Dairy sector strategic plans for Laikipia, Nyandarua and Nakuru and engage relevant stakeholders.

&gt;On 5th December, 2018 the Minister of Agriculture Livestock and Fisheries ( MoALF) while addressing milk farmers at the Brookside Raw Milk Supply Award noted the need for farmers to embrace safety  in food as a priority, which in turn would lead to reduced food loss.</narrative>

&gt;CUTS and SACDEP have worked with County Governments through the technical committees established in Nakuru, Nyandarua and Murang&apos;a to develop dairy Strategic Plans; issues on milk postharvest loss management, milk quality and Safety are well captured in the draft documents. The same has been achieved in the development of the Laikipia Dairy Development Policy which is now complete is set to be handed over to the county government in July, 2019. 
&gt;CUTS and SACDEP have been part of the committee developing the Nakuru Dairy Co-operative Union which will ensure productivity and profitability of the county dairy sector through reduction of postharvest losses and production of  safe, quality milk. 
&gt;In collaboration with KDB, KEBS, Public Health and Livestock production, CUTS has facilitated capacity buildings for milk dealers in Nakuru, Nyandarua and Lakipia counties. 
&gt;CUTS has  utilised different engagement channels to disseminate evidence to the county officials, for example during policy and Strategic planning meetings, capacity building meetings and sector stakeholder forums. 
&gt;In Nakuru county, ASDSP and NARIGP have identified CUTS as a key stakeholder in the dairy sub-sector. Through the technical committees, CUTS has collaborated with the two in: 1. the development of the dairy strategic plan 2. building dairy stakeholder inventory during adairy stakeholders mapping exercise conducted in April 3. formation of the dairy stakeholders&apos; platform.

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">20-06-2018: &quot;This score is an estimated indicative score of collaboration in the 4 focus counties (Murang&apos;a, Laikipia, Nyandarua and Nakuru). County government officials are generally receptive but for various reasons, counties rate differently on level of collaboration.
Murang&apos;a - 2; Laikipia - 2; Nyandarua- 0; Nakuru - 0.
Murang&apos;a: Early county engagements started in Murang&apos;a since CSOs had established contacts already there. CUTS held several meetings important among them: a meeting with Murang&apos;a Technical Committee to review the Dairy Strategic Plan                                                          Laikipia:several meetings with county government including Director for Agriculture were held resulting in Laikipia County Food Nutrition and Security (FNS) Multi-stakeholder Workshop and Project Launch (18 July 2017 )  
Nakuru: engagement in this county got to a slow start as CUTS struggled to establish contacts. There was hightened political atmosphere in the county due to national elections at the time which made it difficult to introduce the food safety/ loss agenda 
Nyandarua; Focus in this county started late in August 2017 as it became apparent that advocacy efforts could take shape faster here due to SNV projects already being implemented in the county. Formative meeting were  held with County government officers  to introduce Ffood safety/ loss agenda and explore action point (31 August 2017) 
In late 2017 SACDEP began to engage the county Government on the status of CIDPs and the following were the findings; in Muranga county SACDEP was advised to send a memorandum on issues to be included in the CIDP, Laikipa County is at its initials stages of development, Nyandarua the CIDP was already developed and is waiting for County Assembly, Nakuru county is planning to hold a  stake holders forum on CIDP input whereSACDEP and partners will partcipate. &quot;</narrative>
