      <narrative xml:lang="EN">A breakdown of the regions covered by the FNS CSOs was carried out and each CSO was empowered to collect data in these regions. So focus group has been conducted in the Regions of the Boucle du Mouhoun, Center-East, East, Central West, North Center, North, Sahel, Southwest, Haut-Bassins and Cascades in Burkina Faso With the actors involved in the provision of services to the EFA: the MAAH through its deconcentrated services (ZAT and UAT); The private sector (traders, equipment makers) and FFAs including gender and vulnerable households. Data analysis showed a very poor general level of EFA satisfaction with services provided, ie. 19.36%, broken down as follows: inputs: 6.38%; Equipment: 6.32% and technical support, 6.48%. Concerning quantity, the level of satisfaction is very alarming in the Boucle of Mouhoun and the Center-Est. A cooperative of 964 members received only one ton of fertilizer. One commune received one ton of NPK and 1.5 ton of urea for 62 villages. In the East, Center-West and Center-North, inputs account for less than 15% of EFA needs. In terms of equipment, sometimes a plow is given to the whole village. On the other hand, the scores on the quality of services are rather moderate (government inputs have a better quality than those purchased with traders in the market). The delay in the introduction of inputs and equipment is also very serious. Inputs from the 2016-2017 wet season were offered in July in the east, center-west and north-central regions. Exceptionally, in the Northern and Sahel Region, the level of female satisfaction with quantity is higher than in men (19% versus 17%) due to gender-sensitive projects. The analysis showed a very poor level of satisfaction for the technical support (ie. 1 agent for eighteen (18) villages technical supporting, this is very insufficient).</narrative>

      <narrative xml:lang="EN">&quot;Qualitative method approach based on focus groups made it possible to determine the accessibility levels of the EFA to the services provided. The analysis showed a very poor level of physical accessibility at 12.86% (score of 1). This reflects the low level of public and private investments in the modernization of family farms. There is a disparity between regions in terms of access by different categories to services, especially for women. Thus, while women in the Mouhoun Boucle Regions in the East, West Central and North Center do not have equipment and use little or no inputs in their fields (difficult access and expensive), in the Northern and Sahel Region of drylands, access to inputs, equipment and technical support is made possible by projects and institutions supporting women, youth and / or people Vulnerable. These specificities draw scores upwards in favor of women: women&apos;s access is 12.55%, compared to 10.70 for men and 13.25% for vulnerable farms. In general this level is low because of the high cost of inputs: 1 bag of fertilizer costs 21,000 FCFA; The poor quality of roads. In some cases, villages are cut off by water during the winter season or the inputs are not available (Case in the Southwest, Cascades and Hauts-Bassins) and producers have to travel to the main centers Like Bobo-Dioulasso, to have inputs.  
These factors limit the access of family farms to inputs and have a different effect on the level of access of producers to services in the 4 CSOs. As for the level of access of vulnerable producers in these CSOs, the difference is not very pronounced between CSOs. In general, the level of access to government services is higher for vulnerable producers than for other producers.</narrative>

They suggest that services should be made more accessible with supply points. However, 41% of RUs believe that they are more accessible in 2020 compared to 2018 because they have the possibility of obtaining them more quickly than in 2018.

The results show that these 4 institutions support the theme with an average score of 3. The MAAH, through its central directorates and specialized services (DGPER, DGPV, SP/CPSA,...), has increased its support for advocacy on family farm modernization and scored 4. This has been reflected in both discourse and practice: for example, six Central directors of the Ministry of agriculture and water supply (MAAH) are engaged to support OSCs advocacy actions during the workshop in Koudougou.These managers who do not often have contact with the producers did not hesitate to meet the producers and growers of the southwest region to learn about and exchange information about their situation.  In terms of shares, in 2018, the MAAH organized a workshop linking family farms and seed growers to promote grouped orders; between family farms and suppliers to improve the quality of inputs and lower their costs; financial actors (banks and MFIS) to increase access to family farming credit. the Ministry of agriculture has organized entrepreneurship training sessions for the benefit of family farms. Substantial endowments have been provided to technical support services to make them more operational in the farm management of family farms
the National Assembly (AN): since June 2018, deputies &apos; interest has increased for advocacy on the modernization of family farms, and this has resulted in a massive presence of at least 30 MPs in the project&apos;s activities. These deputies have been very interested in advocacy on the modernization of EFA, and use the evidence provided by the OSCs in the debates in which they participate. The Ministry of economy and finance (MINEFID) responded to the invitations of the OSCs to the workshops to discuss b ...</narrative>

&#xA0;- The Ministry of Agriculture: on December 10, 2019, the MAAH demonstrated to the TV channel 3TV the need to modernize family farms using the evidence shared by CSOs.

The Head of State stressed that agricultural mechanization is a sine qua non for the intensification and increase of agricultural production.
On July 23, 2020, the Council of Ministers adopted a decree establishing the Agricultural Development Fund (FDA) which will be domiciled at the Agricultural Bank of Faso (BADF). He also adopted the creation of an agricultural insurance mechanism to &quot;reduce the vulnerability of our agriculture to climatic hazards and strengthen producers&apos; access to financial services. This mechanism will begin with a pilot phase from 2020 to 2022 with three regions: Boucle du Mouhoun, Center-West and East. It will focus on the rice, sorghum and maize sectors &quot;whose production represents 86% of annual food consumption in Burkina Faso.&quot; Finally, the Council adopted the decree on the digitization of payments which, of course, will impact the rural world and agricultural sectors, in particular by securing their economic activities and giving them access to numerous services. It is also an attractive factor for young people.
 - The MAAH: On January 23, 2020, the MAAH chaired the opening ceremony of the Days for Understanding Family Farms and Dissemination of Evidence, organized by CSOs. On May 8, 2020, the MAAH chaired the handover ceremony of tractors to members of the National Union of Seed Producers of Burkina (UNPSB), in Ouagadougou. He invited the beneficiaries to organize themselves to take better care of this agricultural equipment in order to achieve the objectives of sustainable food and nutritional security.

However, we note the project to create the MAAH agricultural development fund and the commitment made by the banks to work to make available financial products suitable for family farms. CSOs have managed to have proposals from banks on the levers to activate for a reduction in the cost of agricultural credit, which is a big step anyway.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">28-10-2020: In 2020, the CSOs FNS undertook various actions within the framework of the program such as interpellations, exchange meetings, etc. as mentioned in the number of meetings. Following these advocacy actions with the Minister of Agriculture and Hydro-Agricultural Development, the Council of Ministers adopted July 2020:
- A decree establishing the Agricultural Development Fund (FDA) domiciled in the books of the Banque Agricole du Faso (BADF). This will lift the guarantees imposed by the banks.
- Another decree for the establishment of agricultural insurance. This will make it possible to cover the risks of agricultural losses. All these measures aim to facilitate farmers&apos; access to credit.
- Similarly, a national inclusive finance fund was created in June 2020 by MINEFID which recruited ten decentralized financial systems (MFIs) to facilitate family farmers&apos; access to credit. The recruitment of MFIs will allow the implementation of lines of credit to promote the access of low-income people, family farmers and agricultural entrepreneurs to loans adapted to the needs of the agricultural sector.
- In July 2020, CSOs developed and sent to the government (MINEFID and MAAH) a roadmap for reducing the cost of agricultural credit. This mechanism, if it is operationalized, will undoubtedly make it possible to reduce the cost of agricultural credit and improve family farmers&apos; access to agricultural credit in order to transform / modernize their farms to contribute sustainably to food and nutritional security. Moreover, in July 2020, CSOs set up a task force (CNA, CPF, COPSA-C) to monitor the implementation of proposals for mechanisms to reduce the cost of agricultural credit sent to the government.</narrative>

During the meeting with the National Assembly Committees (COMFID and CODEC) the CSOs presented their plans and achievements. This was the first time that there was a meeting with CSOs and the parlement. The members are not specialists in agriculture and therefore benefit from these meetings.

The CSOs have actively contributed to the elaboration of the PNSR

Furthermore, every six months a meeting will be held with the deputy of parliament to discuss how they can better take the FNS advocacy priorities into account, so CSOs will ask questions to the national assembly on e.g. availability of inputs ((seeds, fertilizers), equipment, technical advice, family farm financing, governance of FNS at the institutional level...) and what the government will do about this. This will enhance their responsibility. Also meetings will be held with the CSOs that are part of the alliance, to define a common strategy and implement an action plan that has been defined last year.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">08-12-2018: &quot;During all of the meetings the CSOs have made active contributions (they always gave attention to advocacy topics and asked for contributions/replies from the target actors), which they have prepared beforehand. A few examples are mentioned below. 
During the meeting with the National Assembly Committees (COMFID and CODEC) the CSOs presented their plans and achievements. This was the first time that there was a meeting with CSOs and the parlement. The members are not specialists in agriculture and therefore benefit from these meetings. They will be repeated every 6 month. 
They organised and actively participated in hearings with the Governor of the Northern Region and the Governor of the Upper Basins; Multiple interventions on institutional food purchases, and other participations into encounters.
The CSOs have actively contributed to the elaboration of the PNSR 
The CSOs have organised meetings between the ministry of agriculture and research institute to tackle the lack of callobarion between the two parties. This problem was acknowledged by both actors and it was agreed to work on a framework for collaboration. 
The CSOs also participated in international events, such as in Benin and Ivory coast, related to the issues of malnutrition, food systems and food security situation in the Sahel area.&quot;</narrative>

Indeed, they always build their arguments based on the evidence produced, as well as a critical analysis of the evolution of their advocacy environment. We can cite some relevant examples:
- During the audience with the presidential program monitoring office (BSPP) in Ouagadougou on 12/23/19, the CSOs presented their advocacy process for a coordination and a unique food security and nutrition policy. They challenged the BSPP on the various initiatives underway (presidential initiative and draft decree creating the national multisector nutrition council and maintaining the CNSA) which can constitute a brake on the integration and synergy between nutrition and Food Safety.
- At the regional workshop on sharing experience in the provision of rental services in sustainable agricultural mechanization in the countries of Sub-Saharan Africa organized by FAO in C&#xF4;te d&apos;Ivoire, from 03 to 06 December 2019, FEPAB presented its experience in agricultural mechanization.

Ministry of Agriculture (DGPV, DGPER, DGFOMR), CPF, Alliance, and the Ministry of Finance were present. The results of the study showed that the subsidy does not optimally benefit small family farmers. It would be better to subsidize diversified improved seeds, which will also have a big impact on food security and household incomes.
- Evidence on the inventory of components of modernisation of family farms (including agricultural mechanization, agroecology and agricultural inputs), was presented in a workshop with the Ministry of Agriculture, Finance, National Assembly, NGO, Private Sector and Allied CSOs. Based on the presentation, a discussion was held and recommendations were made. FNGN also shared the same evidence with its support units.
- All evidences generated in 2017 were shared with Allied CSOs during their first meeting with them in March 2018.
.People who received the research products appreciated their content, their relevance and quality of propositions and recommendations. For example, after the dissemination workshop of evidence related to potential of family farms, other people who didn&apos;t participated contact SNV to have the report (evidence).

These expenditures rose from 10.4 billion in 2016 to 21.2 billion in 2017 (report SP/CPSA-MAAH), 2018). This is a great step forward and the CSOs have contributed greatly through the many encounters and interpellations. 
It should be recalled that there was a decrease in public expenditure between 2015 and 2016 of 4.5% from 14.9 billion to 10.4 billion. This reflects the significant contribution of the V4CP program to this major change., with the goal at the start of the 5% project</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">28-10-2020: CSOs pleaded for an increased budget for the modernization of family farms. This is why, despite the budgetary constraints linked to the security crisis and its consequences on the budgets allocated to the various ministries, public expenditure made by the MAAH for the modernization of family farms has increased by 6.58% from 15.2 billion in 2018 to 16.2 billion FCFA in 2019. This increase, although lower than the expected rate in a context as difficult as that of Burkina Faso, is a strong testimony to the success of the advocacy led by the CSOs of the FNS thematic group. In fact, in 2019, public expenditure in favor of the modernization of family farms was 16.2 billion out of a forecast of 6.7 billion, and this because of the success of the advocacy of CSOs with the President of the Republic during of the national farmer&apos;s day in Gaoua.
For the year 2020, forecasts are 12.7 billion FCFA in the finance law. However, as part of the economic and social support plan against the effects of COVID-19, the President of the Republic has promised 30 billion to family farms, which however requires a dialogue between CSOs and the ministries in charge of Agriculture to its implementation.</narrative>

This situation is caused  in big part by the exitences of 2 institutions created separately in 2 ministries (Health for CNCN and agriculture for CNSA). One of them is in charge of coordination of nutrition (CNCN, and the other the coordination of food security (CNSA). Their activity is not very integrated and we will advocate to have a single institution with power and resources, to manage FNS in Burkina Faso. In the scale that we created, the level 0 means that no unification, only dialogue frameworks exist in both ministries,</narrative>

In Benin they will  talk to CSO/NGO partners, as well as with the ministry of agriculture and health, parliament and the mayors association.

After that the CSOs will organise 3 workshops; 1 with ministries of agriculture and health technicians to exchange and share with their colleagues Benin&apos;s experience and to do recommendations. The second workshop will serve to discuss operationalisation of recommendations with the central directors of the 2 ministers. The third meeting will concern a meeting with the 2 ministers and their advisors so they can support the operationsalisation.

The recommendations of the high-level Panel have shown this as well as the conclusions of the study on the political will conducted in the framework of V4CP. Indeed, at the end of the study trip to Benin in may 2018 organized by the CSOs and which was inspiring and which constituted evidence for the participants of the Ministry of health, the Ministry of agriculture, the National Assembly and the first Ministry, CSOs decided to organise a high-level Panel with all relevant actors involved in food and nutrition security. This Panel allowed the two coordinating structures of food security (CNSA) and nutrition (CNCN) to present their current features as well as the experience of Benin. The exchanges resulted in a single coordination model and a supra-ministerial anchor, the United Nations agencies (WFP, REACH) and sub regional institutions (CILSS) and international organizations (USAID) strongly supported this idea and the members CNCN and CNSA showed a greater willingness to go towards a single aspects. It now remains to raise awareness among other important actors who have not taken part in this Panel (UNICEF, FAO, Ministry of Health Office) to get them to join.</narrative>

These are the President of Faso, the Prime Minister, the National Assembly, the FAO, the 13 presidents of the regional council, the MAAH. However the ministry of health through the national council of concertation on nutrition (CNCN), as well as certain organizations (RESONUT) remain hostile to this unification. However, the support of the above-mentioned decision-makers constitutes a real step forward in favor of this unique coordination. A draft decree has been prepared and is being amended.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">28-10-2020: Since early 2020, a draft decree has been under development for the creation of a national nutrition council for the Presidency of Faso. Even if the anchoring seems satisfactory, the position of this new body in relation to the SE-CNSA and its composition is not satisfactory from the point of view of the CSOs who plead for there to be a single coordinating body and no longer of them. This is why the Minister of Agriculture responded in April 2020, by correspondence to the Prime Minister, proposing to him the opening of consultation under the aegis of the Prime Minister, to find solutions to the concerns of the CSOs who had questioned him on the draft decree to create a national nutrition council.
The Minister of Health, for her part, finally agreed to receive CSOs in May 2020 and admitted having understood the concern of CSOs about the draft decree creating the national nutrition council. She understood that CSOs want greater consideration of nutrition in its multisectoral nature.
Subsequently, a meeting was held on the subject for the first time in May 2020 between the Ministry of Agriculture, that of Health and CSOs on the instruction of the Prime Ministry. This meeting enabled CSOs to directly express their concerns in connection with the draft decree and to make realistic proposals for more coherence, effectiveness and efficiency of food and nutrition security interventions.
Subsequently, the CSOs organized a press conference to denounce the draft decree creating the national nutrition council in June 2020. Following this press conference which had an international impact, the Under-Secretary of the Nations United in charge of the Scaling Up Nutrition (SUN) movement Gerda VERBURG had discussions with SNV on the concerns raised by CSOs in Burkina Faso and indeed admitted that it is necessary to work on more synergy between multisectoral nutrition actors. These exchanges made it possible to gain a better understanding of the concerns of CSOs in Bu ...</narrative>

Also, a large national forum on the transformation / modernization of family farms is planned. As an expected result of this forum, targeted actors (government, the private sector and the private service providers) are expected to define strong actions  in the short and medium term with regard to the enhanced availability of improved seeds, equipment, fertilizers and technical frameworks. There will be discussions with these actors who will engage in a final communiqu&#xE9;.

At the local level, meetings with municipal and regional councillors have led to commitments by local authorities to integrate the needs of family farms into their community development plans. 

These two important elements have increased the influence of CSOs from 2 to 3 between July and December 2018 since they have had several exchanges and interactions with the Government and which have led to strong commitments enshrined in the framework agreement commitment</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">It is foreseen that the degree of influence will be maintained. In the coming months, several activities will be carried out that will ensure CSOs influence on agenda setting. These activities include hearings with different ministries and meetings with the parliament. Meetings with the parliament are effective to ensure influence, as the ministers are sensitive to questions from the deputy.  
This year meetings will be held with banks and microfinance institutes (which has not been realised last year). The study on financial products will be shared with the banks, which also include recommendations that say the government has a role in accompanying the banks. So beyond that meeting, separate meetings will be organised with minister of agriculture &amp; economy to follow up, to present results of studies and how they will take them into account.
Next to that there are plans for 2 main activities; a forum on the modernisation of family farms, which will involve actors of all 13 regions in Burkina. With these government actors concerns and recommendations will be discussed. These recommendations will be followed up by the CSOs. The second main activity is the study trip to Benin with government actors to understand how they accomplished to merge the food security and nutrion coordination structures</narrative>

The Minister of has shown his willingness to accompany CSOs in this process, and all the allied NGOs support this idea.
At the regional level, the increased influence is demonstrated by regular meetings with the local government that gradually take into account the CSOs&#x2019; concerns. FNGN for example has participated in the support programme on the implementation of the Family Farm Council (CEF), and participated in the regional nutrition assessment, where their data were integrated into national statistics.
It is clear that during the last half year the CSOs influence has increased, as they have been able to put important issues forward. Since these issues are not always put on the agenda, level 2 seems appropriate.

The established committee wrote its report on the operationalization of commitments.
Advocacy was continued in favor of the effectiveness of the single institutional coordination of food and nutrition security. CSOs sent, on October 14, 2019, CSO letters of appeal to the President of Faso, the Prime Minister, the Ministers of Agriculture and Health, the TFP (UNICEF, FAO) and the president of the panel of high level on the governance and institutional anchoring of the FNS of July 2018. It was a question of drawing their attention to the various initiatives in progress (presidential initiative and draft decree of creation of the national multisector council of nutrition and maintenance of the CNSA) which can constitute an obstacle to the integration and synergy between nutrition and food security. They received reassuring responses from the Prime Minister and the Presidency of Faso on the consideration of their concerns. They were also received by the Presidential Program Monitoring Office (BSPP) and an audience is underway with the Director of Cabinet of the Presidency of Faso. The officials of the Presidential Program Monitoring Office (BSPP) reassured CSOs about the relevance of their concern and made a commitment to report to the President of Faso and measures will certainly be taken in the coming days with the involvement of CSO. In addition, a workshop to assess the level of implementation of MAAH commitments in favor of the transformation of family farms was also held.

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">28-10-2020: CSOs have maintained their influence on the government agenda and also on the private sector. Indeed, during the working session with the Minister of Agriculture on June 18, 2020, the Minister recognized that it is thanks to the V4C program that public investments in favor of family farmers have increased considerably in 2020. Similarly, following the advocacy actions undertaken by the CSOs FNS with the Minister of Agriculture and Hydro-Agricultural Development, the Council of Ministers adopted a decree establishing the Agricultural Development Fund (FDA) domiciled in the books of the Banque Agricole du Faso (BADF). This will lift the guarantees imposed by the banks. Another decree was taken in the Council of Minister for the establishment of agricultural insurance. This will make it possible to cover the risks of agricultural losses. All these measures are aimed at facilitating the access of family farms to credit. Also, the National Chamber of Agriculture, which represents all the peasants, through a correspondence to the MAAH in April 2020, expressed the serious concerns of family farmers and reservations about the mechanism recommended by its department for the distribution of subsidized inputs and subsequently, in the discussions, obtained an agreement with the Ministry of Agriculture for the monitoring of the mechanism.
At the level of the SAN coordination, at the insistence of the CSOs, the Minister of Health finally agreed to receive them in May 2020 and admitted to having understood the concerns of the CSOs about the draft decree creating the national council of nutrition. subsequently, and undergoing media actions by CSOs to denounce the draft decree to create the national nutrition council in June 2020, a meeting was held on the subject for the first time in May 2020 between the Ministry of Agriculture , that of health and CSOs on instructions from the Prime Minister.

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">&quot;The CSOs are planning to take the deputies and central directors on a field visit, so they can witness the problems of family farmers and provide suggestions on what they can do to improve the situation. The deputies/central director do not know, understand or take seriously the problems at the local (farm) level. The visit will enable them to have direct discussions with the family farmers, and ensures they are aware of the implications of their policies.

Furthermore, the CSOs will monitor implementation of PNSR (Programme national du secteur rural). However, it takes a while before it will be adopted and the technical teams have to be in place. Not yet clear when it will be operational, probably not this year. CSOs can put pressure to accellerate implementation. They will have working sessions with minister in April, and can ask to accelate.

The CSOs have asked resakss to give data on expenditure, to show the ministry what they have done last year, and what more they need to do.&quot;</narrative>

CSOs also participate in the various sectoral dialogue frameworks of the departmental departments. These bodies are places of interpelation for CSOs in relation to the duty of accountability of the Government.
CSOs are associated with the processes of development, piloting and monitoring-evaluation of public policies and programs.
CSOs are now associated with the Organization of national peasant days that were exclusively done by the Ministry of agriculture (MAAH). The initiative and the facilitation of regional fora are the assets of CSOs.</narrative>

The CSOs have also attended a meeting in which the ministry of economy has shared insights on  how the budgetting process works and how the budget is divided among ministries. This gave CSOs a better understanding of how the ministry of agriculture is planning and what budget lines are relevant.

In this context, a working session was held with the target departments. This monitoring has also been extended to Banks to ensure that the cost of loans will be reduced. In this sense, 18 letters of inquiry were sent in addition to the meeting with all of these actors to review the progress made. These actors have each time informed the CSOs of the stages already initiated or crossed and are involved in the discussions within the frameworks for consultation. FEPAB participated in the CASEM of the MAAH and intervened on the increase in the budget allocated to the Central Directorates for substantial support to the RUs, the improvement of the criteria for identifying and targeting vulnerable families for better support. Then, he insisted on the imminent deployment of engineers at the decentralized level. Finally, he recalled the urgency of speeding up the creation of the agricultural development fund through the creation of a window for the benefit of family farms. COPSAC participated in the municipal council session in 10 municipalities and in the regional council session. In these consultation frameworks, she had the opportunity to advocate for the inclusion of family farms in the annual investment plans.</narrative>

The collaboration with the banking sector and the MFIs allowed the CSO to know the existence of certain guarantee structures which could facilitate the access of the family farms to the financing. These institutions have also suggested to the CSO to seek rather the reduction of the cost of credit than the development of other products that can take a lot of time.
All this demonstrates that the CSO and the government/private sector make plans together, it remains their implementation and the CSO will take care to remind them and make the point on a regular basis</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">10-01-2018: Collaboration with Government (Ministries of economy and Agriculture) is good. As soon as we invite them, they come and participate actively to discusions. This is the case during FNS advocacy actions presentation where there were more than 20 public services represented and gave their contribution in terms of strategies, to have best results.  One of the central Director agreed to moderate one of FNS workshop. After this, CSOs noticed that they received some invitations from agricultural services to participate at workshop. It means that collaboration is beginning to be good. We could add also here the decision of Minister of agriculture to meet CSOs during a whole day every year. Then, we noticed that the presence of a first vice-President of parliament commission in charge of Finance and budget at FNS study results presentation related to family farms financing. He was very interested to the study results and advice CSOs to meet and discuss with all parliament finance and budget commission members. Banks and MFIs was also present to this workshop and they participate actively to debates through data related to their institutions&apos; investment in family farms in terms of loans and financial products. For all these reasons, the actual target is 1.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">The collaboration will be further enhanced in the coming months. The CSOs will plan for more joint advocacy actions with partner CSOs. Also they will have multiple exchanges with the ministry of agriculture and the ministry of economy, to evaluate actions of the ministries,  how they can ensure the needs of family farmers are better include and how this is better integrated into the budget. 
A national forum on the modernisation of family farms will be organised with the ministry of agriculture. For the ministry of economy, working session with technical director are planned to see how he can make available more budget in favour of modernisation. Also meetings will be held with the ministry of health, to achieve a fusion of the committees working on nutrition.
With regard to the private sector, as explained, closer collaboration will take place with banks and microfinance institutes to ensure they will develop financial products adapted to family farmers.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">10-04-2020: Collaboration with the Ministry of Agriculture has improved. CSOs are more involved in meetings organized by the Ministry of Agriculture and their views are more and more taken into account. The Prime Ministry, the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Agriculture participated in meetings organized by CSOs. These structures have agreed to designate agents to join the Benin study tour to learn from their unique FNS coordination model. Also the collaboration with MPs is very good. They appreciate being involved because it allows them to better understand the concerns of CSOs and to challenge the government to better address these concerns. They also appreciated the approach of CSOs and suggested them to focus more on specific departments because that is where all decisions are made. The National Assembly has promised to inform the CSOs in the event that the concerns of CSOs are not taken into account by a ministry.
Even though the collaboration has improved, it is still ranked as 2 since the CSOs and ministry do not yet work on joint plans.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">14-04-2020: At national level, there is very good collaboration between CSOs and the government. In fact, in the second half of 2019, CSOs conducted follow-up activities to the framework agreement with MAAH and MINEFID. COPSAC received a visit from MAAH at its headquarters. CSOs sent 24 letters of inquiry to 18 banks to remind them of their commitment to lightening the conditions for access to credit for family farms and to 6 institutions including the National Assembly for the implementation of the framework agreement for the transformation of family farms in Burkina Faso. The network of credit unions in Burkina expressed their willingness to receive concrete suggestions from CSOs on mechanisms that could reduce the cost of credit for family farms. During the organization of the field visit of the technicians from the 13 regional directorates of agriculture, the CSOs sent an Email to the MAAH, which instructed the 13 Regional Directors to release the heads of Regional Services for Hydraulic Improvements and Agricultural Productions to participate in the field visit on climate-smart agriculture and its application in the advisory support system. The FNS CSOs were able to hold a working session with the Minister and the MAAH Central Directors in order to verify the progress recorded in terms of the commitments made by the MAAH. Also, following the letter of inquiry from CSOs, the Prime Minister and the Presidency of Faso responded to CSOs and reassuring them that they have instructed their services to take up the concerns of CSOs.
The Faso presidency also met with CSOs in December 2019 on the issue of coordinating food security and nutrition. Also, the CSOs organized under the sponsorship of MAAH, an advocacy meeting with banks and MFIs to reduce the cost of credit</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">15-10-2018: The collaboration bweteen CSOs and the government has improved, and has moved from level 1 to 2 as now the CSOs are more actively sharing and discussing relevant informatin.
The collaboration between the V4CP CSOs and other CSOs is very good as is also witnessed by the partnership agreement that was signed. Through this agreement, they are jointly defining and carrying out activities.
Staff from the Ministry of agriculture are showing increased engagement by participating in several activities organised by the CSOs. They have also invited the CSOs to their meetings. There was for example one deputy that shared with OSC a bill on co-investment in the agrosilvopatoral sector.  Before sharing it with the parliament, they shared the document with CSOs and SNV and asked for feedback. The CSOs had a whole day to provide feedback and make sure advocacy priorities were integrated.   
The collaboration with the central director of the ministry has also improved, as he has opened one of the workshops and is showing interest in the activities. 
Collaboration between CSOs and private sector still needs to take off.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">At the national level, the level of collaboration with the authorities is very significant. CSOs have very easy access to the authorities and are invited to consult with these different institutions. During the first half of 2020, CSOs will work to maintain this good collaboration. The strengthening of collaboration will be more accentuated with the private sector (seed producers, agribusiness man) for access to agricultural services and with the Ministry of Health with the aim of the single institutional coordination of Food and Nutritional Security. Indeed, the Ministry of Health is indeed very shy to engage in the process of single institutional coordination.</narrative>

This is confirmed by the number of meetings during which the two parties have invited each other. The CSOs were invited by the MAAH to draft proposals for measures for the support / accompaniment of agro-sylvo-pastoral operators impacted by COVID-19, a final document of proposals called &quot;Impact analysis note and proposals support for agro-sylvo-pastoral farmers impacted by COVID-19 &quot;which was produced and shared with the CSOs who participated in the process and MAAH on April 22, 2020. In addition, the Minister of Agriculture recognized the importance and weight of the CSOs of the program in the increase of the budget allocated to agriculture during the working session with the Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of Women on June 18, 2020 and only if the program did not exist not, it had to be created.</narrative>
