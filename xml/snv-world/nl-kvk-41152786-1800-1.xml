   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Through the &#x2018;Voice for Change Partnership&#x2019; (V4CP) programme, SNV works to strengthen civil society organisations (CSOs) in their role as advocates and lobbyists. We work together with IFPRI and over 50 CSOs to foster collaboration among relevant stakeholders, and influence decision-makers with solid and contextualized evidence to get the interests of communities embedded into government and business policies and practices. For this specific project in Indonesia, our advocacy activities focus on Water, Sanitation &amp; Hygiene (WASH).</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">We aim to contribute to achieving universal access to sanitation, the national target for 2019 as set by the Indonesian government. This will be achieved through advocating for the prioritization of sanitation, the increased provision of affordable, inclusive and sustainable sanitation services by local governments and private sector, and district-wide implementation of the STBM programme (a community-wide sanitation approach) to contribute to the elimination of open defecation at scale.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">19-03-2018: The score for this indicator is 2 because it is average for the four areas. Sijunjung and Padang Pariaman in West Sumatra scored 1 because sanitation service have not meet the criteria of affordable, sustainability and inclusive yet. For instance, the supply for latrine in West Sumatra is still dominated by the big and international brand which are expensive for the community. Currently, the focus of efforts are for increasing the awareness and demand to use adequate toilet in the community. However, the score for Pringsewu and Lampung selatan is 3 because they already met the afforadbility, sustainability criteria, and one inclusive criteria. CSOs will try to advocate more inclusive implementation for 2018.  Fo example, we could access the supply for latrine package throuh STBM army that already trained by the government to produce toilet in almost every village in Lampung Selatan. Also, there are several hub service for sanitation entrepreneur in Pringsewu to meet the demand of the community to supply latrine with affordable price. From the sustainability aspect, Pringsewu and Lampung Selatan already have the regulation to guide the STBM implementation  and reach the target for ODF in 2017 and 2018. Also, the budget allocation to increase the sanitation development has already existed. They also already set the mechanism to help the poor people to have their own toilet, but the inclusive implementation for the sanitation school and disaster area still need to be improved</narrative>

Most of the budget used for STBM triggering process in community is from that government special operational support fund (BOK). Therefore, the use of fund for STBM triggering process were depends on each Puskesmas .The increase of the budget allocation from 2017 to 2018 ranging from 0% until 200% due to additional fund for to implement Pamsimas/STBM program at selected village since the access for sanitation is one of the national priority, and government increased the number of village in each district that eligible to received Pamsimas and STBM village fund. For instance, one district in West Sumatra increased their pamsimas village from 11 (2017) to 22 (2018), so the budget allocation increased too. Similar for other district in Lampung who increased the STBM budget allocation up to 200%.  Another district in West Sumatra did not increase their special operational support fund (BOK), but they increased the budget allocation for STBM in health agency for 30%. On the other hand, one district in Lampung decreased the STBM budget allocation for STBM after achieving the ODF District status, so they could prepare and allocate more for Post-ODF strategy and the sludge management preparation for 2018. Overall, there are increasing of the budget allocation for STBM and sanitation programme which might be influenced and supported by national target to achieve 100% sanitation access in 2019</narrative>

Pringsewu: Pringsewu has already achieved ODF, so they focused on sanitation in school in 2019 --&gt; 2017: IDR 156 million, 2018: IDR 350 million, 2019: IDR 770 million (2018 vs 2019 increase 120%)

Lampung Selatan: 2017 : IDR 541 million, 2020: 1.3 billion (2017 vs 2020 increase 140%)

However, the source of the money for STBM implementation and sanitation development are not only from district fund. The huge resource from village fund could be mobilised. Many villages in those four areas have already allocated their village fund for sanitation especially latrine facility with various amount. These achievement was contributed by the CSOs who always advocate for the prioritisation of the sanitation especially STBM issue. They also closely engaged with the district planning agency and technical agency to monitor the budget allocation for STBM</narrative>

There are significant decrease for the budget because most of the portion for STBM activity will be done through village funds (public fund from national level as the special allocation for village) because currently each village got near IDR 1.000.000.000 for village development and one of the priority from national level for village fund utilisation is sanitation</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">21-04-2020: It was ranging from -293 to 239%. Here it is the details of sanitation budget allocation:
Sijunjung : 2017 : IDR 8.7 billion, 2018 : IDR 5 billion, 2019 : IDR 8 billion (2018 vs 2019 increase 160%)
Pringsewu : 2018 : IDR 9.45 billion, 2019 : IDR 17.96 billion (2018 vs 2019 increase 190%)
P.Pariaman : 2018 : IDR 7.4 billion, 2019 : IDR 2.8 billion (2018 vs 2019 decrease 62%)
Lampung Selatan : no data yet

Therefore, the proportion of STBM budget to whole sanitation budget are

Sijunjung : 2017 : 1.49%, 2018: 1.24%, 2019: 1.04% (2018 vs 2019 decrease 0.2%)
Pringsewu: could not be calculated because it is sanitation in school budget 
P.Pariaman : 2018 : 0.74%, 2019 :  7.41% (2018 vs 2019 increase 6.66%)

Even though, Sijunjung District increased their allocation for STBM and sanitation (from district budget) from 2018 to 2019, but the relative annual budget allocation for STBM compare to whole sanitation budget percentage is slightly decrease. This is because they also mobilised the village fund (separate from district budget) utilisation also for STBM implementation in 2019. 

These achievement for increasing budget was contributed by the CSOs who always advocate for the prioritisation of the sanitation especially STBM issue towards the key stakeholders especially the head of district (Bupati)</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">30-11-2020: YKWS, PKBI, and Mitra Bentala&apos;s score is 4.5 because related STBM regulation which are
1) YKWS : Sustainabe STBM regulation in Pringsewu
2) PKBI : Bupati&apos;s regulation on acceleration of ODF achievement
3) Mitra Bentala : Bupati&apos;s regulation on swasembada WC
Those regulation has been applied and enforced, so those three districts achieved ODF status in 2019 with 100% sanitation access. However, it is still not equally applied especially for the difabled people who still faces challengess to access sanitation facility. Therefore, during 2020 especially in the pandemic situation, YKWS hosted the inclusive event and invited various representative of DPOs to discuss the WASH behavior in the pandemic situation and the importance of inclusive development.

LP2M&apos;s score is 4 because the STBM regulation that was signed in 2019 has been applied, but still not equally applied. They still focused on 3 sub-districts as the pilot project to achieve ODF and expected to be replicated to other areas. Also, the sanitation access is still below &lt;70%. However, they tried to involve more PKK (women organisation) and women cadre in the village to raise the awareness about sanitation in the grassroot level.

For the roadmap STBM, the district government used as the guideline for development planning. Then, in the new regulartion, they considered the assessment from roadmap STBM that developed previously as the input</narrative>

However, the collaboration between LP2M and District Government still could be improved through working together to set road map to achieve ODF district and scaling up the pilot ODF village to all villages in the district. The involvement of AKKOPSI is essential to raise awareness of district government on the important of sanitation issues.
