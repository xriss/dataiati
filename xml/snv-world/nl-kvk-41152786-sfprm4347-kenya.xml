   <narrative xml:lang="EN">EOWE will target:

&#x2022; National-level organisations (listed under actors) for capacity to implement gender-sensitive laws and inform the rules of the game for female businesses.

&#x2022; National and local-level CSOs to initiate advocacy on gender norms and demand for implementation of gender-sensitive policies.

&#x2022; Existing and new women-led enterprises in agriculture and renewable energy value chains for increased business performance.

&#x2022; Other value chain service providers for access to resources and assets, leadership capacity, financial services, and market integration.

&#x2022; Local sub grantees to implement programmes and institute good M&amp;E system for shared learning and adapting actions.</narrative>

  <description akvo:type="6" type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In 2014, SNV programmes have increased incomes and economic participation of 200,000 women in Kenya and Vietnam. With nearly 50 years of experience in women&#x2019;s economic empowerment, we have learnt that economic growth alone is not enough to address gender inequality; the structures that underpin them have to be addressed: women and girls should be able to expand their economic opportunities, have access to resources and participate in decision making. Without these, the structures that cause inequality remain intact. A growing body of literature demonstrates the profound impact of women&#x2019;s empowerment on human and socio-economic development, benefitting societies at large. In the agriculture and renewable energy sectors, where a significant share of rural women are engaged in economic activities, inequality is manifested most profoundly in income distribution and control of resources, division of labour and associated time burdens, decision-making power, gender-based violence, and restrictions in socio-economic and physical mobility.</narrative>

  <description akvo:type="8" type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Inspired by SNV&#x2019;s global practice on gender in Agriculture, namely balancing benefits in agriculture and Renewable Energy, namely health and wealth from clean energy, SNV propose an integrated strategy, tailored to the target group&#x2019;s needs and capacities, and

complementarity with ongoing initiatives.

These are:

&#x2022; Increasing capacity of government actors to implement and localise female entrepreneurshipfriendly

policies and institutions.

&#x2022; Increasing capacity of local actors, including CSOs, to create bottom-up pressure for women&#x2019;s economic

empowerment and leverage existing policy frameworks to enhance the enabling environment.

&#x2022; Challenging gender norms inhibiting women&#x2019;s access to economic opportunities through behavioural change.

&#x2022; Increasing women&#x2019;s capacity and confidence to lead successful businesses.</narrative>

  <description akvo:type="9" type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Our intervention model is built on the premise that political and legislative environments continue to be favourable for gender-equitable economic participation. Additionally, the changes we aim to influence require initiative from actors involved. We assume that there are sufficient incentives for all actors, including men, to engage and change behaviours. Most importantly, we premise that women&#x2019;s economic contribution to their families, especially where there is a male head of household, will provide the incentive for men to share decision-making power with women. We premise that empowered women will continue to challenge gender

norms and values that will in turn benefit more women, while women&#x2019;s success in leadership will reinforce positive gender norms and lead to the emergence of new relationships between men and women and their positions within institutions.</narrative>

One key area was the development of the five-year CIDPs, aligned to national development plans such as the Kenya Vision 2030, Medium Term Plans, the National Spatial Plan and international commitments such as the Sustainable Development Goals. The CIDPs are expected to guide in ensuring effective and efficient use of scarce resources by linking county policy, planning and budgeting processes. It therefore informs the allocation of resources by counties to women entrepreneurs. The program works closely with civil society and government to support women&#x2019;s participation in the development of CIDPs. | 30-04-2018: This information is currently being collected from partners and will be available in time for Annual Reporting 2018</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">30-04-2018: Women and men taking part in the household dialogues report that before the sessions, each was making their own decisions, with little or any discussion with their husband or wife on taking out loans, how to spend money or to make plans together. After the sessions, women and men became aware of the need to discuss and make joint decisions on income. Many have started to plan together and they notice that these plans are more successful than their individual ones. This is an important motivation to keep discussing income and investment decisions together. | 30-04-2018: The pilot on the Most Significant Change is finalised. Secondary analysis of the stories will be finalised in time for Annual Reporting due April 2018</narrative>

      <narrative xml:lang="EN">According to the WEAI methodology, a person is considered to be empowered in this domain if there are at least two categories in which (s)he takes the decision, has some input into decisions or feels that (s)he could make the decision if they wanted to. This is a relative broad definition, and doesn&apos;t take into account that there are areas of agricultural production that are inherently female, such as poultry or vegetables and where male interaction is limited. However, results of the focus groups revealed that men always decide over issues related to production for the market.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">29-04-2019: We saw a decline in the percentage of women that was empowered on workload. Partly this is due to project activities (labelled as productive time), and a better understanding amongst women how to create quality products, which also increases time. Women are able to produce better quality products and increase their incomes, so the increase in time spent on their business comes with increased income. At the same time, we see that some men assist with reproductive tasks, but this is still largely with women. Men prefer to assist women in their businesses to be able to generate higher incomes. In focus group discussions women have indicated they too preferred men to help with the business, rather than in the household.</narrative>

Priority capabilities identified to build on are &#x201C;to adapt and renew&#x201D; and &#x201C;to deliver on development objectives&#x201D;. With devolution, the county governments are also expected to develop policies and frameworks, a role they have no previous experience in. In this regard, the programme has started developing the capacity of the counties through training and review. | 30-04-2018: 40 government actors participating in the capacity building training yet, partly due to the run-up to the presidential and governmental elections taking place last year.

From these different implementing CSO partners, the capabilities prioritised for development were &#x201C;to act and commit&#x201D; and &#x201C;to adapt and renew&#x201D;. The programme built the actor&#x2019;s capacity to advocate on women&#x2019;s economic issues by providing practical technical support and training to help them gain deeper thematic knowledge on gender and development in the context of economic empowerment of women. The actors established multi-stakeholder forums and developed capacity development plans on supporting women to participate in county government planning and the development of CIDPs. Activities conducted were consultations with women entrepreneurs prior to the government-led CIDP development process. The women entrepreneurs agreed on their priorities and developed memoranda which they presented during the county government gatherings. | 30-04-2018: 8 CSOs participated in capacity building training, but sessions on the 5C tool are planned in Feb/March, in time for Annual Reporting (April 2018)</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">28-04-2020: Target not achieved. Out of the 127 enterprises for which we were able to collect data, 61 were able to access credit (due to COVID-19 we did not receive information from Marsabit in time). There is quite a lot of variation between regions, where in Laikipia, Samburu and Kitui over 70% of enterprises were able to access finance, whereas in regions such as Narok and Isiolo less than 33% (19.4 and 32.0%). Whether or not enterprises can access finance is dependent on many factors that the project cannot always influence successfully.</narrative>
