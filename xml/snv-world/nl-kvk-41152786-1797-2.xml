   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Through the &#x2018;Voice for Change Partnership&#x2019; (V4CP) programme, SNV works to strengthen civil society organisations (CSOs) in their role as advocates and lobbyists. We work together with IFPRI and over 50 CSOs to foster collaboration among relevant stakeholders, and influence decision-makers with solid and contextualized evidence to get the interests of communities embedded into government and business policies and practices. For this specific project in Burkina Faso, our advocacy activities focus on Renewable Energy (RE).</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">We aim to improve households&#x2019; access to quality RE products and services. This will be achieved through the development and adoption of a better regulation policy of the RE sector by the government; education and training structures for certified training in RE; increased appropriate budgetary allocation by the government and local authorities; and increased commitment from private service providers to offer quality products and services in RE.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">06-12-2018: A study on the mapping of educational and training institutions has been conducted. The study revealed that only 3 vocational schools offer renewable energy courses.
A study on funding opportunities for technical or vocational education institutions active or interested in RE training has been conducted. The interesting outcomes of this study include that funding is not the only bottleneck for education institutions to include RE in their programme. There is also a lack of qualified teachers and there is concern if there will be enough demand. The concern on the demand is based on the uncertainty of employment opportunities in the sector. It is a new sector and therefore parents might not want to take the risk to subscribe their children as there is no track record of absorbtion of certified students by the employment market.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">04-07-2018: A new law regulating the energy sector including REs has been developed and adopted by the government. This law has extended the tasks of the Regulatory Authority of the Electricity Sector (adopted, but for the moment only partly applied). Even though the CSOs have been heared by the National Assembly before having voted the law, none of the inputs given by the different stakeholders (besides the CSO also the national electricity company, private actors, etc.) have been taken into account. But despite that, the framework law is an improvement, as it opens up the energy market. Concerning the particular case of regulation policies, the CNPDER is part of a working group working on the details for this part of the law that is not yet in application.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">Even though the CSOs are engaged in the working group and hence have some influence on the content of the decrees to be developed, it is very difficult to influence the speed, which is completely in the hands of the Government. The target of 4 is therefore based on hope, rather than rational analysis, which is very difficult to estimate.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">This indicator is linked to policies on the regulation of the RE sector in General. It takes into account issues of taxation, certification and quality for example. ANEREE is progressing in the regulation of the ER sector and energy efficiency, but is slowed down by internal tensions. Also projects of regulation of the sector namely: the project of standardization of the market of the ER; the project for the certification of actors in RE is hampered by a conflict of mandate and objectives in terms of standardization between two State structures (ABNORM and ANEREE)</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">10-04-2020: Burkina Faso has marked great progress in terms of policies on the regulation of the RE sector in general. Indeed, the Council of Ministers of November 13, 2019 issued a decree adopting the statutes of the National Agency for Renewable Energies and Energy Efficiency (ANEREE). The adoption of this decree allows the ANEREE to comply with law n &#xB0; 014-2017 / AN of April 20, 2017 on general regulations for the energy sector and the regulatory provisions on public establishments in the State in providing this structure with management bodies to carry out its missions. The ANEREE through this decree is officially instituted as the structure in charge of the questions of taxation, certification and quality. This decree comes to definitively resolve the conflict of mandate and objectives in terms of standardization and regulation between state structures (ANEREE, ABNORM, DGER, DGEE). As a result, there should be a significant advance in 2020 in the process of regulation and standardization of the RE market.</narrative>

RE CSOs aroused reflections on the issue of RE sector regulation, organized actors around the issue and created synergy between actors.
The CSOs through a press conference drew the attention of the Ministry of Energy to the need to clarify the missions of ANEREE and the general directorates of the ME with respect to those of ABNORM. CSOs organized a national forum to reflect on the operationalization of RE regulation.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">04-07-2018: The private sector working in the ER sector is not yet organized. APER exists, but has not been visible in the field during the whole of 2017. In fact, many initiatives on forming professional RE associations have failed over the years, in most cases as a result of leadership problems. Our strategy has gone in the same direction as we organized the CSOs, namely the signature of a chart, stating the engagement of the signatories in providing quality ER services and products. So the signatories of the chart don&apos;t have to be organized obligatory in a formal association. A first workshop with a number of private sector actors has taken place in 2017. In 2018, the objectif is to develop a chart in collaboration with them.</narrative>

The Chamber of Commerce has specific groups to influence policies. Since private actors are not organized, their concerns are not taken into account during negotiations with the government.

The objectives of these meetings are to come to the effective elaboration of RE curricula. Target stakeholders are actors in private sector (energy and education), in the educational sector (including government officials at the relevant Ministries - youth &amp; employment and national education) and the Ministry of Energy. There are two levels of curricula, one for public schools and one for private schools. It is expected that the curricula for private schools / training centers will be easier to finalize as less bureacracy is needed. More in general, the meetings have also the objective to better position the CSO coalition as an influant actor in the sector.</narrative>

The latter in particular related to vocational training in RE, with the concrete outcome of the development of a roadmap towards a coordinated elaboration of curricula. All Government agencies from different Ministries (Basic education / Youth and employment / Energy / Scientific research) that have been more or less working / reflecting on this issue have been involved, as well as a relevant number of identified public and private schools / training centers with activities or interest in the matter.  But also in a more general way the CSOs improved their knowledge and reinforced their position as an actor in the sector. A study trip to Benin in company of an agent of the Agency for Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency (ANEREE) gave inspiration on the regulation of the electricity sector through meetings with different public and private actors, in particular the agency for controling the quality of electricity installations (CONTRELEC).</narrative>

2) A presentation was given during the International Fair on Renewable Energy in Ouagadougou (SIERO). 
3) AGEREF and OCADES participated in regional and local Council meetings and have stressed the importance of renewable energy targets in decentralized policy.
4) CEAS has made two interventions in presence of the Minister of Energy, one during the signing ceremony of the chart (see explanation at outcome D1), and one during the handing over of the chart to the Minister in presence of a CSO delegation.

5) The CSO coalition was invited and participated in the working group meeting for the regulation of the RE sector and gave their inputs in line with our advocacy theme.
6) The CSO coalition was invited at the launch workshop of ROGEP, a program on off-grid energy access initiated by ECREEE and funded by the WorldBank.

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">10-04-2020: At these various meetings, CSOs stood out for the quality and relevance of their interventions. Indeed, they always build their arguments based on the evidence produced, as well as a critical analysis of the evolution of their advocacy environment. We can cite some relevant examples:
&#xA0;- During the 3 regional fairs for the promotion of quality RE equipment and services successively in Manga, Tenkodogo and Fad N&apos;Gourma, CSOs took the floor to raise awareness on the interest of using RE equipment and services quality through a radio program.
&#xA0;- During the ECOWAS Forum on RE in Accra (Ghana), from October 22 to 24, 2019, CSOs shared their experience of V4CP in Burkina. They clearly displayed their position with regard to the quality of RE equipment in the ECOWAS area. They challenged ECOWAS on the need to better deal with intermediate level training in RE in the ECOWAS region. They participated in the creation of a network of sub-regional CSOs.
&#xA0;- During the follow-up workshop on the implementation of the commitments made by MENAPLN, the MJPEJ, the CSOs presented, in terms of reminders, the commitments made by these two ministries. They also asked the ministries for their update on the state of implementation of these commitments. MENAPLN presented CSOs with the list of curricula already amended in the framework of diploma training in RE, notably the BAC pro and the BEP. The MJPEJ presented the curricula available for qualifying training in RE, in particular BQP and CQP in RE.</narrative>

At the advocacy and capacity-building workshop of the 13 Regional Council Presidents (RCPs) in Bobo-Dioulasso, the CSO representative presented the reality of the poor access of the population to energy, the poor quality of services and equipment in RE on the market and expectations of the RE thematic for PCRs. He also challenged the RCPs on the importance of their roles and missions in supporting the advocacy of CSOs during their mandate. In terms of results achieved, RCPs signed the pledge to support advocacy to achieve the expected results.</narrative>

For example during meetings with WorldBank on the development of their Rural Offgrid Electrification Program (ROGEP), we addressed the importance of qualified technicians in addition to the distribution of RE products. During the meeting with LuxDev on their intention to train the trainers, we stressed the importance of looking further than technicians for large powerplants, but also take into account lower qualifications for household applications. Our comments were well noted and gave room to debate. The target has been over-achieved, because opportunities came up that were not planned (invitations to meetings such as ROGEP and LuxDev)</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">28-10-2020: In terms of accountability mechanisms, the MOE involves CSOs on several levels. Indeed, CSOs are involved in the formulation, adoption, implementation and monitoring of energy policies. This involvement led to the drafting and adoption of the benchmark at the sector level, which is the strategy in the energy sector that covers the period 2019-2023.
CSOs also participate in the Boards of Directors of the Energy Sector (CASEM). The CASEM is a framework for exchanges and validation of planning documents such as the Annual Work Plan and Budget (AWPB), PTBA activity reports. These CASEMs are held twice a year.
The Ministry of Energy involves CSOs through the semi-annual review of Sectoral Frameworks for Industrial and Artisanal Transformation Dialogue (CSD-TIA). Indeed, decree n &#xB0; 2017-0004 / PRES / PM / MINEFID establishing, attributions, organization and functioning of the monitoring and evaluation system of the National Economic and Social Development Plan (PNDES) provides in its article 5 for into account of civil society.
Likewise, the Week of Renewable Energies and Energies of Africa (SEERA), an international forum organized every year by the Ministry of Energy, this forum which brings together several participants including CSOs, the private sector, technical and financial partners, was in its third edition in 2019. The fourth edition was scheduled for April 2020 but the context of COVID 19 forced the ministry to postpone the event for 2021.
In addition, in the promotion of RE, the ME uses several communication tools, to reach the greatest number of targets. This communication takes place through urban and local radios (Advertisements or broadcast), Televisions, both private and national (Citizen Dialogue), social networks (Facebook) or the written press (Newspapers). In addition to these tools, the institution has made the Energy Code available since January 2019. This is a document edited by the Ministry of Energy with the support of the Electri ...</narrative>

At the MENA level, for example, the budget allocated for vocational training is presented in a comprehensive way for all the sectors so that it is not possible to know the share of the budget allocated to the RE. Faced with this complexity which does not allow to extract the part of the budget devoted to training in RE, we decided to make a qualitative follow-up of investments in favour of vocational training in RE. An example is the introduction of a BACpro training in solar energy in a pilot school (in Dori), which indicates that a budget is earmarked (of which one does not know the height), which shows that efforts are made in terms of budget allocation , which is a positive result</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">30-04-2019: The institutional inking of the vocational training component is very vague: the short-term trainings are the responsibility of MENA, the training in the trades is the responsibility of the MJFIP and the training of the higher cycle and the Organization of the sector RE return to the ME.  At the MENA level, for example, the budget allocated for vocational training is presented in a comprehensive way for all the sectors so that it is not possible to know the share of the budget allocated to the RE.In the face of this complexity which does not allow to extract the share of the budget devoted to training in RE, we decided to make a qualitative follow-up of investments for vocational training in RE. An example is the introduction of a BACpro training in solar energy in a pilot school (in Dori), which indicates that a budget is earmarked (of which one does not know the height), which shows that efforts are made in terms of budget allocation , which is a positive result</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">04-07-2018: In August 2017, 19 CSOs have signed a chart and so formed a coalition of CSO promiting renewable energy (CNPDER). This coalition has been the fruit of activities under 3 different projects. First of all the DGIS funded &quot;engaging civil society in SE4ALL&quot; project, implemented in Burkina Faso by SNV, had resulted in the mapping of CSOs in Burkina Faso with an energy focus. Secondly, the project &#xAB; Acc&#xE9;l&#xE9;rer l&apos;application des politiques r&#xE9;gionales sur l&apos;&#xE9;nergie propre en Afrique de l&apos;Ouest (ACE-WA)&#xA0;&#xBB;, financed by the Danish organizations Sustainable Energy and INFORCE, and implemented by the V4CP partner CEAS, started working with these CSOs for the implementation of this (advocacy) project. When looking for synergies, the idea was born to more or less formalize the collaboration between the CSOs by the signature of a chart. The V4CP CSOs have taken the lead in realizing this, and the event of the signature of the chart, in presence of the Minister of Energy (who also co-signed) has been organized and financed by V4CP. Even though the coalition is not formally recognized in the sense of being registered, it has been recognized through the signature of the Minister of Energy on the chart.</narrative>

Also, it has set up through the ANEREE, a Committee for the development of curricula in ER; installed 368049 led lamps in households at national level; In 2017, the Minister of energy was assessed.
