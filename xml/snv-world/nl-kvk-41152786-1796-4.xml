   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Through the &#x2018;Voice for Change Partnership&#x2019; (V4CP) programme, SNV works to strengthen civil society organisations (CSOs) in their role as advocates and lobbyists. We work together with IFPRI and over 50 CSOs to foster collaboration among relevant stakeholders, and influence decision-makers with solid and contextualized evidence to get the interests of communities embedded into government and business policies and practices. For this specific project in Kenya, our advocacy activities focus on Food &amp; Nutrition Security (FNS), in particular horticulture.</narrative>

  <description akvo:type="8" type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">We aim to improve food safety and reduce food losses in the domestic horticulture value chain. This will be achieved through an enhanced enabling environment emanating from concerted efforts in evidence-based advocacy by CSOs, which promotes consumer awareness, collaboration between actors (government and private), harmonized policy frameworks and implementation, investments, accountability and of food safety and food loss reduction systems.</narrative>

Through community of practice events and technical working group forums,  SOCAA was able to engage and receive input from county government officials, regulators and private sector (KNCCI County Chapters) on Food Safety initiative in Nakuru, Murang&apos;a, Nyandarua and Laikipia Counties.  In addition forums were provided for SOCAA and other CSOs to present and explain proposals for the County Integrated Development Plans in Nakuru, Murang&apos;a and Laikipia Counties. 

SACDEP Kenya community champions attended a public baraza in Nakuru and Nyandarua counties. The baraza acted as a platform of sharing with public the food loss related issues and also a forum where communities were able to voice their concerns to the local administration and government to address issues on potato loss.On 5th December, 2018 the Minister of Agriculture while addressing milk farmers at the Brookside Raw Milk Supply Award noted the need for farmers to embrace safety  in food as a priority, which in turn would lead to reduced food loss.

In Laikipia County a partners day was held in December 2018  that allowed CSOs and NGOs to share updates of their programmes/ initiatives in the county  to the Governor. SACDEP shared food loss agenda  champions at this forum.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">With increased visibility of Food Safety issues in policy dialogue spaces and evidence products to work with CSO interventions are expected to increase in advocating for inclusive business and increased invested, increased budgetary allocations as the budget planning cycle for the 2020-2021 FY starts with analysis of current spending and allocation from FY 2018-2019 and FY 2019-2020 respectively.  

It is anticipated that there will be more engagement by a wider cross-section of Stakeholders on the KFDA process with a view to greater inclusivity in the process and final result, wider engagement with the KS1758 standard as a result of the ASTGS and Big 4 agenda related activities at national and county level and with the expected release of revised Horticulture regulations under the Crops Act. 

At county level the inputs from food safety champions will be crucial in multi-stakeholder forums towards making the case for increased investment, inclusive policies and frameworks following up from development of food safety committees and action plans that will revolve around food safety gaps and opportunities and how these are addressed through initiatives building on principles of assured produce schemes as captured in the ASTGS.

 &gt;Sharing of information and continued  collaboration with private sector and consumer groups to enhance inclusivity and accountability between food business operators and consumers as well as increased participation of these constituencies in the policy making and implementation processes associated with the NFSA/KFDA, horticulture regulations and KS1758. SOCAA has been instrumental in the ASNET platform, in use of social media for consumer awareness and engagement and in sharing of information on various food safety aspects through animations and e-posters covering the different food safety issues.                                                                    &gt;At County level the food safety committees are recognized as key platform for food safety issues engagement and coordination. In Nyandaraua and Nakuru the committees are in the process of development of food safety policies and SOCAA has been a key partner in development of the draft policy. Key private sectors are part of the committed membership and recently consumer CBO was included in the committee to strengthen the voice of consumer in Nakuru County.

Due to delayed evidence delivery SOCAA was not able to engage effectively . The national reference group that would mirror the national food safety coordinating committee was not formalised in the year due to delayed evidence that would inform discussion. The reference group was meant to address evidence products wholistically to enable strong, targetted CSO advocacy. SOCAA however did establish regular interactions with Govt (Ministry of Agriculture and Ministry of Health) on the food safety agenda and was able to share its agenda at the at the fruits and vegetables conference,  Horticulture Crops Directorate (HCD) on the horticulture  domestic standard KS 1758; Private sector &#x2013; KNTWG and Kenya Private Sector Alliance (KEPSA) where  SOCAA is now formally present within the Agriculture Sector board. These engagements remain to be strengthened.
Counties:
Focus on the 4 counties (Murang&apos;a, Laikipia, Nyandarua and Nakuru). County government officials have  generally been receptive but for various reasons, counties rate differently for level of CSO  influence.
Murang&apos;a - 2; Laikipia - 1; Nyandarua- 0; Nakuru - 0.
Murang&apos;a: Although the horticulture sector contributes significantly to the county&apos;s economy, its profile on the county agenda remains low. SOCAA together with other CSOs worked to establish a technical committee on food safety and loss but a lot remains to be done to raise the profile of the hortculture sector especially for the domestic market.   SOCAA  was however invited to provide inputs to the county integrated development plan (CIDP) which provides promise for the sector if inputs are adopted  .

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">&#x2022;Through increased involvement of supporters in key institutions and organizations that SOCAA has engaged with and the sharing of evidence in planned forums organized by SOCAA in collaboration with other key stakeholders influence on agenda setting is expected to increase at both National and County levels. Partnerships with other food safety focused initiatives in convening stakeholder platforms for advocacy will be increasingly important to cushion against resources constraints and limitations. 

&gt;At National level the Ministry of Agriculture&#x2019;s initiative for Horticulture through the Horticulture Technical Working Group provides a point to leverage additional influence on the KFDA processes. The rapport and current engagement with private sector KNTWG for horticulture will be influential and SOCAA will continue to share evidence and advocate at KNTWG convened platforms. 

&gt;At the County level through Food Safety Committees engagement and the input of food safety champions who have been capacity built through the interventions of CSOs processes related to implementation of food safety action plans by county governments and collaboration between private sector, consumer group and governments is anticipated to yield more influence on agenda setting. 

&gt;Sharing of information and continued inclusion with private sector and consumer groups will continue in order to further support inclusivity and accountability between food business operators and consumers as well as increased participation of these constituencies in the policy making and implementation processes associated with the KFDA, horticulture regulations and KS1758. 

&#x2022; SACDEP aims to continue working with County governments and organizations such as NPCK and AGCK to advance the issue of posharvest food loss especially for the potato value chain by participating in the county potato strategic plan development ( Nakuru and Nyandarua) and lobbying adoption of the 2019 Irish potato regulations</narrative>

Meetings with government on the national food safety policy have however been few due to separate sector priorities that leave little time for the multisector meetings. KEPSA (Kenya Private Sector Alliance), a respected private sector umbrella body in Kenya has tasked SOCAA to attend technical committee meetings as its Agriculture sector board representative. The CSO has brokered partnership between development partners and industry players (Fresh Produce Exporters Association of Kenya) to host a national conference for Fresh Fruits and Vegetables.

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">25-10-2020: Review of 2020-2021 National Budget Proposals in light of CADDP recommendations for Food Safety indicated a reduction of budget allocated to the Food Nutrition security sector in FY 2020/2021. Budgetary allocations to agriculture are low and continue to decline. The agricultural sector, which is primarily responsible for food and nutrition, has been allocated KES 52.8 Bn, a decrease of KES 1.1 Bn or 2 percent from FY2019/2020. The sector allocation is low against the required budget of KES 97.7 (according to the BPS 2020) and therefore slashed by 46%. Growth in budget allocations to the sector is not keeping pace with the growth of the total budgets over the last 5 years.  This is down from an allocation of 3.4% of the Total Voted Budget in FY 2013/2014. 

CSOs have not actively been able to engage with National Treasury in regards to allocation of budgets to Food Safety at National level. There has been a shift of allocation from traditional budget lines to institutions responsible for Food Safety and Post Harvest loss at National level such as HCD, KEPHIS for development of food safety legislature and food safety coordination units such as NHTTWG.  At National level, allocation of 10% of national budget/public spending as per CAADP to agriculture is still being tracked an Ministerial level(Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock with no conclusive report yet to be released.</narrative>

This was reflected in Nakuru County 2020/2021 budget plans through public participation forum held early this year which stipulated various activities geared towards creating awareness on food safety such as consumer awareness drives. 

SOCAA participated in Nakuru County Pre-budget public forums and facilitated public participation  of consumers through training on budgets using the IFPRI budget tracking tool and providing resources for consumers to attend forums with county govt, private sector and consumer actors for more effective participation in the budget setting for the county. 

SOCAA has facilitated County FSC formalisation with full support from the County, developed action plans and lobbied for budgetary allocation to enable the FSCs undertake coordination of food safety initiatives in the county.

SOCAA has been instrumental in the development of the draft Nakuru County Food Safety Policy through the Food Safety committee through the provision of technical inputs into the document and putting in resources to support webinars and conferences for the review of the policy

At the county level, SOCAA facilitated Budget Allocation webinars that centered discussions around the allocation of budget to food safety supported by the County Executive Committee Member of Agriculture, Dr. Immaculate Maina. Resolutions from the webinars were to put forward discussions to the department of planning to allocate budget towards food safety initiatives</narrative>

Currently the policy is yet to be enacted but discussions are on going at Ministry of Health level on the formation of a National food safety Agency that would be responsible for implementation of the Policy.

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">26-04-2020: Athough County Executives in charge of Agriculture have indicated support for Food Safety initiatives in direct engagement, some via media outlets (Nakuru) county, results from policy maker rating focusing on CECs Agriculture , Health and Trade Departments across the 4 counties shows no change in support for food safety in 2019. 
Governors and MCAs from the respective counties were also rated on support for food safety; increased support was observed from Nakuru MCA and from Governors in Laikipia and Nyandarua Counties.  

&gt;SACDEP activities were mainly focused in Nyandarua and Nakuru county in 2019; on the potato regulations stategic plans for the value chain. Although the policy maker rating was not conducted for postharvest loss agenda, there is observed increased support form the CES in Trade and Agriculture across the 2 counties. For example in Nyandarua both the CEC Trade and Agriculture were present during launch of the potato regulations and made remarks in support. In Nakuru County both CECs are in support of PHL managemennt in the potato value chain e.g. officers from the Trade dept. have started enforcing regulation on 50kg potato bag size (leading to some arrests for those found in contravention); The CEC Agriculture in Nakuru has attended many meetings for the potato value cain during which she expressed concerns that losses from the potato value chain were afffecting county revenues and committed her department&apos;s support for the strategy and regulations to streamline activities in the value chain.</narrative>

Minister - On 5th December, 2018 the Minister of Agriculture while addressing milk farmers at the Brookside Raw Milk Supply Award noted the need for farmers to embrace safety  in food as a priority (http://www.industrialization.go.ke/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=385&amp;Itemid=211) ; Minister  Health  - Involved in the development of the KFDA; Minister Trade - applauding role of standards in driving competitiveness of the food industry
The pronouncements by the Ministers were as an indirect result of V4CP as the food safety agenda has gained traction as  food safety becomes a National concern.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">26-04-2020: CS Health gave support for food safety strategies categorising food handlers according to risk.  However no clear action plan was issued thereafter.  CS Agriculture constituted a multi-agency taskforce to review horticulture food safety concerns.   A conclusive legislative process towards a Food Safety Authority has however lagged behind despite these initiatives. Senior political leadership continues to stress support for Food and Nutrition Security which is captured in the government Big 4 agenda. However the specifics are not clearly addressed in public statements but where instances of Food Safety concerns have risen through the media there is response to the same though not much different than those currently in public domain.</narrative>
