   <narrative xml:lang="EN">EOWE will target:

&#x2022; National-level organisations (listed under actors) for capacity to implement gender-sensitive laws and inform the rules of the game for female businesses.

&#x2022; National and local-level CSOs to initiate advocacy on gender norms and demand for implementation of gender-sensitive policies.

&#x2022; Existing and new women-led enterprises in agriculture and renewable energy value chains for increased business performance.

&#x2022; Other value chain service providers for access to resources and assets, leadership capacity, financial services, and market integration.

&#x2022; Local sub grantees to implement programmes and institute good M&amp;E system for shared learning and adapting actions.</narrative>

  <description akvo:type="6" type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In 2014, SNV programmes have increased incomes and economic participation of 200,000 women in Kenya and Vietnam. With nearly 50 years of experience in women&#x2019;s economic empowerment, we have learnt that economic growth alone is not enough to address gender inequality; the structures that underpin them have to be addressed: women and girls should be able to expand their economic opportunities, have access to resources and participate in decision making. Without these, the structures that cause inequality remain intact. A growing body of literature demonstrates the profound impact of women&#x2019;s empowerment on human and socio-economic development, benefitting societies at large. In the agriculture and renewable energy sectors, where a significant share of rural women are engaged in economic activities, inequality is manifested most profoundly in income distribution and control of resources, division of labour and associated time burdens, decision-making power, gender-based violence, and restrictions in socio-economic and physical mobility.</narrative>

  <description akvo:type="8" type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Inspired by SNV&#x2019;s global practice on gender in Agriculture, namely balancing benefits in agriculture and Renewable Energy, namely health and wealth from clean energy, SNV propose an integrated strategy, tailored to the target group&#x2019;s needs and capacities, and

complementarity with ongoing initiatives.

These are:

&#x2022; Increasing capacity of government actors to implement and localise female entrepreneurshipfriendly

policies and institutions.

&#x2022; Increasing capacity of local actors, including CSOs, to create bottom-up pressure for women&#x2019;s economic

empowerment and leverage existing policy frameworks to enhance the enabling environment.

&#x2022; Challenging gender norms inhibiting women&#x2019;s access to economic opportunities through behavioural change.

&#x2022; Increasing women&#x2019;s capacity and confidence to lead successful businesses.</narrative>

  <description akvo:type="9" type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Our intervention model is built on the premise that political and legislative environments continue to be favourable for gender-equitable economic participation. Additionally, the changes we aim to influence require initiative from actors involved. We assume that there are sufficient incentives for all actors, including men, to engage and change behaviours. Most importantly, we premise that women&#x2019;s economic contribution to their families, especially where there is a male head of household, will provide the incentive for men to share decision-making power with women. We premise that empowered women will continue to challenge gender

norms and values that will in turn benefit more women, while women&#x2019;s success in leadership will reinforce positive gender norms and lead to the emergence of new relationships between men and women and their positions within institutions.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">30-04-2018: Women and men indicate that following the Household Dialogues, there is increased Awareness of the work women do (inside and outside of the home), as well as men taking up household tasks to support their wives. For instance, cooking, feeding animals and some cleaning activities. What motivates men to do these changes, is that they notice a change in their relationship, that their wives (and sometimes children) seem happier. What also helps to keep doing traditionally female tasks, is the appreciation wives show to their husbands, even if the husband is not performing the task very well (e.g. cooking salty food, breaking glasses, etc.) | 30-04-2018: The Most Significant Change pilot is finalised and the secondary reporting on this will be finalised in time for Annual Reporting due in April 2018</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">29-04-2019: The original target of 11 partners increasing at least 2 out of 5 capabilities is not feasible, because of the following reasons: 
&#x2022; The project is currently working with 5 partners (National Women Union and Provincial Women Union of 4 provinces) to increase their capacity to advocate on women&#x2019;s economic issues, who all have capacity building plans for 2017, 2018 and 2019. 
&#x2022; Since 2017 they have involved in different training and learn events under EOWE. However, it takes time to increase their capabilities, especially under the circumstance of system change and staff rotation. 
&#x2022; Among 5 units, Quang Binh_Womens Union and Ninh Thuan_Womens Union increased 2 out of 5 capabilities from the 5C tool in 2018. Binh Thuan_Womens Union and Binh Dinh_Womens Union have 1 capability increased. It may take more time to allocate budget and qualified staffs in these unions to implement the Women start-up program. The National Womens Union had relatively high scores in 2017 (good and very good), therefore, these scores did not change in 2018</narrative>

None of the advocacy partners rated themselves higher on one of the 5C tools after 1 year, due in part to increased understanding of what these capacities really entail. However, the role and capacity of cooperatives have been significantly addressed and strengthened towards recognising leadership and economic roles of women in the operation of cooperatives and crops production. Intense advocacy meetings led to an agreement set-up between local partners (e.g. DARD, AEC, WU) and around 40 cooperatives to ensure a facilitating environment for women farmers to grow and lead farmer groups and services. | 30-04-2018: 13 partners are being trained in Vietnam: 4 Women Unions and 9 government parterns.

i) Lack of feasible business plans/strategies
ii) Lack of proper financial records to prove the effectiveness
iii) Lack of mortgages
iv) The hesitation of members on the risks of market fluctuation, crop failure, unpredictable weather
v) The unwillingness to release the loans from the banks due to strict regulations on credit policies, the nature of agricultural production</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">16-04-2021: Over the project lifetime, we reached 9,230 women in Vietnam, of whom 7,306 women were able to improve their income from business (79%). This is 75% of the overall target. Of which 236 in 2020, 334 in 2019, 2820 in 2018 and 3916 in 2017. On average, the EOWE project worked with a woman in Vietnam for 3 years and 7 months. And in that period, a woman was on average able to increase her profits by 8.5%. 

In 2020, we worked with 45 cooperatives, of which 7 were new (627 new women) and 38 received continued support. In 2020, 4,720 women across the 45 cooperatives were able to increase their income from business. This is 51% of the women EOWE worked with. COVID-19 and a typhoon with subsequent flooding has severely impacted the provinces in which EOWE works and the livelihoods of women, leading to 49% not being able to realise an increase.</narrative>

From qualitative work, several explanations might be possible: (1) women quality assure the household tasks men do (don&apos;t do it as well yet) and want to stay in control, (2) household chores never end, so women find new things to do now that men take over some tasks, (3) household chores are done together as bonding activities. Therefore, decline in overall empowerment of workload does not necessarily have to be negative. More indepth discussions with beneficiaries is necessary to understand this further.</narrative>
