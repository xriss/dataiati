   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Through the &#x2018;Voice for Change Partnership&#x2019; (V4CP) programme, SNV works to strengthen civil society organisations (CSOs) in their role as advocates and lobbyists. We work together with IFPRI and over 50 CSOs to foster collaboration among relevant stakeholders, and influence decision-makers with solid and contextualized evidence to get the interests of communities embedded into government and business policies and practices. For this specific project in Burkina Faso, our advocacy activities focus on Resilience.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">We aim to improve the living and working conditions of pastoralists and agro-pastoralists in the context of climate change and decentralization. This will be achieved through improving service delivery by the government, local authorities, private sector and TFPs; increasing budget allocation by MRAH, local authorities and donors; adapting inclusive policies and laws taking into account climate change and decentralization; and implementing pastoralism policies by the government, local authorities and the private sector.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">11-10-2019: Since the adoption of the decentralization policy in Burkina Faso, the Orientation Law on Pastoralism (LORP) has not been re-read to take into account the requirements of this new policy. It is the same for the consideration of gender. Since 2017, following advocacy by CSOs in the elaboration of the 2nd National Rural Sector Program (PNSR 2), the process of revising the Orientation Law on Pastoralism (LORP) was finally launched under the impetus of the RP group, supported by the Directorate General of Spaces and Pastoral Arrangements (DGEAP) who instructed his lawyer to develop a reference term for the establishment and functioning of the Reflection Committee on the review of the LORP.
The influence of CSOs including Alliance CSOs contributed significantly to the adoption of the 4 decrees implementing the agro-silvo-pastoral, fisheries and wildlife law (LOASPHF) in April 2019. At the same time, PASMEP and APESS presented the Memorandum on World Milk Day to the Minister of Animal and Fisheries Resources and an influential customary authority (Larl&#xE9; Naba), ambassador of the &quot;my milk is local&quot; campaign and three others Ministers in charge of finance (MINEFID), transport (MTMUSR) and trade (MICA) during the National Farmers&apos; Day.
So pastoral CSOs have always advocated for regulation against the misuse of chemicals and pesticides. In April 2019 a bill was passed by the National Assembly to this effect.</narrative>

1) Review of public expenditures for pastoralism in Burkina Faso. The brief has been provided by RESAKSS and CSO used it in their agrument with the parliamentarians.
2)  The Role of the Tradition of Pastors and Cultural Institutions in the Resilience of Climate Change in West Africa. The brief has been provided by IFPRi, but the CSOs do not use it because they do not understand the context of the brief and they need a presentation of the brief.
3) CSO also provided a comparative study on pastoralism law in Burkina to bring out the contradiction between these laws according to pastoralist activities. They present the result of the study at national level with the most important stakeholders involved in pastoralism issues.
Despites these 3 evidences produced, CSOs were expecting from IFPRI the briefs listed below that have not be developed:
-Link with ILRI to get evidence (briefs, reports..) on pastoralism. 

CSOs also shared some knowledge products they developed with other partners: declaration  by representatives and allies of milk producers and processors coming from Burkina, Niger, Mali, Senegal. They call the national governments, the regional organisation (ECOWAS) and european organisation (UE) to give more space to local producers and processors by taking into account mini dairies contribution to economy. A policy brief on milk has also be shared by APESS within the thematic group and with the DGPA

This increase was expected following the national consultation workshop on pastoralism in December 2019 where the recommendations focused on increasing the budget of the MRAH in favor of pastoralism. However, CSOs expect the RMRA to make effective use of this budget because, since 2016, the RMAF has still recorded poor execution of the budget allocated to pastoralism, which fluctuates between 49.14% and 88.37%. This weak budget execution leads to a drop in the level of pastoral public expenditure.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">09-04-2020: At each meeting, the CSOs intervened verbally. The relevant points of intervention are linked to the conditions of access to public funding for women and pastoralists, which are categories often excluded from current funding methods. Likewise, the issue of social inclusion of young people, affected by the difficult socioeconomic and security context, was argued through the consideration of their problem in the agro-pastoral sectors and the establishment of social dialogue was addressed.
Improving pastoralists&apos; conditions requires a national and local environment favorable to pastoralism. To this end, the interventions of CSOs have emphasized the need to popularize the Fisheries and Wildlife AgrosylvoPastoral Orientation Law (LOASPHF) and the Law of Orientation Relative to Pastoralism (LORP) including the modalities and stages of the proofreading were discussed; on the role of the National Land Security Policy in rural areas (PNSFMR) and law 034 on pastoral land. They insisted on the need for a good articulation between the laws relating to land. CSOs took part in a panel where they defended land tenure security for pastoral households in Burkina Faso on the basis of available evidence, on the need for the participation of pastoralists and agro-pastoralists in decision-making bodies, taking into account the pastoralism in Communal Development Plans (PCD / PAI), on the institutionalization of a consultation framework.
In addition, CSOs have greatly contributed to strategic debates on the coordination role of the RMAH, the coordination and monitoring and evaluation mechanisms of the 081 budget program, on the operationalization of the development and securing of pastoral spaces using the evidence. V4CP seized these spaces to share its experience in mobilizing actors to influence decision-makers to support pastoralism</narrative>

In each encounters  they  asked questions for more clarification and also defended pastoralism&apos;s position where needed by  explaining what they usually do  within their organisation. They presented the activities plan under the project V4CP. For exemple during the PNSR session with all the rural actors (minities, TFP, NGOs, CSOs,)  3 persons of the 2 CSO made verbal interventions for securing pastoral area and corridors at country level and also sub regional level. They plead for more rights for pastoralists during their transhumance, they are victims of harassmemnt despite the existence of legislation within cities and countries they  crossed.  They also make verbal interventions in front of the parliamentarians to explain them the living conditions of pastoralism in Burkina despite its contribution to the GDP. More need to do to provide more service for pastoralists.

 -  loi 034/2002/AN du 14 Novembre 2002 portant loi d&#x2019;orientation relative au pastoralisme au Burkina Faso ;
-  loi 034/2009/AN du 16 juin 2009 portant R&#xE9;gime Foncier Rural ;
- loi 002/2001/AN du 16 juin 2001 portant loi d&#x2019;orientation relative &#xE0; la gestion de l&#x2019;eau ;
-  loi 070/2015/CNT du 22 octobre 2015 portant loi d&#x2019;orientation agro-sylvo-pastorale, halieutique et faunique au Burkina Faso ;
- loi 006/2013/AN du 02 avril 2013 portant code de l&#x2019;Environnement au Burkina Faso ;
- loi 003/2011/AN du 05 avril 2011 portant code forestier au Burkina Faso ;

- loi 034/2012/AN du 02 juillet 2012 portant R&#xE9;organisation Agraire et Fonci&#xE8;re (RAF).

During the validation workshop most of the relevant actors involved in pastoralism promotion participated 
 MRAH, GRAF, Ministry of the Environment, DGFOMR, SP / CPSA, AMBF, CPF, Swiss Cooperation, PRAPS, PNGTII, PACOF, Pastoral CSOs, IGOs and NGOs. the discussions were very constructive and the participants made very pertinent recommendations that helped to improve the quality of the final document.
