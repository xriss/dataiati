Here is the example that support the selected level; 

Imbaraga organized a meeting with the governor of eastern province to discuss on the agro inputs distribution channel that always takes time to reach farmers and delays planting and hence negatively affect harvest. The governor has then change to use private agro-dealers in order to speed up the distribution reach farmers on time.
While developing the new nutrition policy, MIGEPROF through NECDP involved CSOs from the identification of the consultant, review the draft policy document and technical validation of the policy.&quot;</narrative>

These levels of the scoring rubric describe scenarios in an accountability process, reflecting the theory of how changes in accountability processes occur. In this reporting period, the target was to reach the level 2 of the scoring rubric where CSOs are consulted through ad-hoc fora in which they provide information to decision makers. The results are showing that CSOs have gone beyond being informed about the decision taken by the government and the private sector, they are now consulted in advance and they provide ideas and information to decision makers. 

This selected level is supported by cases which include among others the fact that during the development of the 4th Strategic plan for agriculture transformation (PSTA4), CSOs were invited in a number of consultative meetings organized by the Ministry of Agriculture and Animal Resources (MINAGRI). The purpose of these consultations was to gather information and views from local Civil Society Organizations working in the field of Agriculture and Nutrition. CSOs partners in the voice for change project have taken this opportunity to highlight the need of an increased production and consumption of various nutrition and bio fortified food, the need of an increased accessibility and use of fortified products, the need of an improved coordination and service delivery in agriculture and nutrition as well as the need to increase  the budget allocated to nutrition sensitive interventions.</narrative>

In October 2018, Gatsibo district authorities accepted to enhance citizens&apos; participation in the whole development process including planning and budgeting of food and nutrition security related interventions and this is due to an event organized by RDO on citizen participation in district target setting and prioritization while developing district budget. 

In June 2018, key challenges such as seeds and fertilizers access affecting farmers&apos; livelihoods and agriculture production in Kayonza and Nyanza Districts have been taken into consideration within 2018-2019 performance contracts planning  process. IMBARAGA has influenced this change by actively participating in district performance contracts planning process.  Their comments and interventions emphasized on the need to improve the services related to distribution of seeds and fertilizers.  With the inclusion of these in the district performance contracts, authorities will become more accountable and make sure that farmers get seeds and fertilizers on time.</narrative>

RDO was invited in the workshop aimed at validating of the District Development Strategy (DDS) in Kayonza District. DDS is a key element of the District&#x2019;s development, it sets the goals of the District in a 7-years local development strategy and reflects the district&#x2019;s priorities. This has been a good opportunity for RDO to raised issue related to women empowerment in agriculture and nutrition. RDO was also invited in a similar workshop in Muhanga District. 
Caritas Rwanda was invited to participate in the elaboration of the DDS in Rutsiro District. One of interventions made by Caritas was about the need to strengthen integrated agriculture and nutrition interventions in the district.</narrative>

This will influence the policies and decisions makers to make a reflection on the advocacy issues, in addition the debates through the mass media such as TV on food and nutrition sector and more specifically on Crop diversification, budget allocation, food fortification, coordination mechanisms will enhance the understanding of a wide population including the policy and decisions makers about the issues of nutrition. Despite their high involvement in sharing their ideas, the level of influence of the CSOs to the agenda setting related will remain at level 2 due to the fact that in this period a lot of political changes are expected in the policy and decision makers at national level such as election of the president, appointment of new cabinet. However we also expect our CSOs to have influence on the review in terms of sharing their ideas to the National strategies, plans and policies under process related to food and nutrition.</narrative>

In June 2018 key challenges (seeds and fertilizers access) affecting farmers&apos; livelihoods and agriculture production in Kayonza and Nyanza Districts have been taken into consideration within District Performance contracts for 2018-2019. This partly resulted from advocacy interventions conducted by IMBARAGA one of the CSOs partner of V4CP program in these districts.

In June 2018, 11 districts representatives (Gatsibo, Rwamagana, Kamonyi, Muhanga Ruhango, Nyamagabe, Nyaruguru, Ngororero, Karongi, Rutsiro and Gicumbi), committed to increase the community awareness on FNS related issues and to invest more in FNS activities. This was during a meeting organized by Caritas Rwanda and evidences were presented to representatives of these districts. 

During a DPEM committee meeting organized by DUHAMIC ADRI in Kicukiro District, they highlighted kitchen gardens and nutrition education through village general assembly meetings that took place twice a month as one of the ways to improve the nutrition status of vulnerable households in the district. Thereafter, the district bought the idea and committed to upscale this practice through community health workers and agriculture extensionists.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">20-08-2019: To determine the degree of influence, we used the scoring rubric which unpacks the indicator in different levels of success. The target for this reporting period was to maintain the level 3 whereby CSO&apos;s interest are put on the agenda and are discussed among stakeholders in government and the private sector at district  level. The scoring was jointly done by CSOs and SNV advisors and results for this reporting period show that CSOs have managed to maintain the level 3, the issue of production and consumption of diversified and bio fortified food is being discussed at district level.

Here is an example supporting the selected level:
In March 2019, The vice Mayor in charge of Economic and Finance development affairs in Rutsiro District committed to increase the number of fortified iron beans producers in agricultural season 2019B for over 2 tons of seeds.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">17-04-2019: In 2018 through the capacity development trajectory, CSOs where trained and coached on different aspects of leadership, organizational development, advocacy and use of evidence and thematic knowledge. In order to measure improvements in CSOs capabilities we have conducted a capacity development survey through google surveys. For the analysis, a CSO is considered to have increased or decreased its capability when the average score for 2018 is +0.25 or -0.25 compared to the previous year. 

Regarding advocacy and use of evidence capabilities, the target for 2018 was that 4 CSOs will demonstrate increased skills in this area.  The survey result shows that 5 CSOs have increased advocacy and use of evidence capabilities while for 1 CSO there has been no significant change. To achieve this,   In 2018 CSOs were trained on the approach of using evidence to support their advocacy interventions and how to engage media in the process of advocacy. Furthermore, CSOs were trained on how to use the budget tracking tool which generated the information on how much the government of Rwanda is allocating to food and nutrition sensitive and specific interventions. This has enabled CSOs to be more confident in their advocacy and they have influenced the agenda at central and local level. For Example with the training provided to CSOs on media engagement in advocacy, they have held a press conference with journalist from Rwanda Media Commission and the latter has expressed interest on partnering with the CSOs in advocacy. For the use of evidence CSOs were able to effectively use finding from the budget tracking conducted by RDO in partnership with IFPRI, a number of advocacy events were organized at central and local level in which findings were presented by CSOs. From this authorities have committed to pay more attention to food and nutrition specific sensitive and interventions when preparing their budgets.

For the analysis, a CSO is considered to have increased or decreased its capability when the average score for 2018 is +0.25 or -0.25 compared to the previous year. 

For leadership capabilities, the target was that 4 out of 6 CSOs will increase their leadership skills. The result from the survey showed that in 2018 5 CSOs have increased their leadership capabilities compared to 2017 while one CSO demonstrated no significant change. The success factor about this increase is associated to coaching which built on experiences learnings from 2017.  The main areas of leadership covered was coaching on emotional intelligence and knowing the organization. This included self-awareness, self-managing, self-motivation and understanding others as stated by Daniel Goleman. As expressed by CSOs in assessment, the knowledge gotten has empowered CSOs to make changes and build by building on their strengths and identifying areas that need improvements. Furthermore, CSOs members that benefited from coaching on leadership are now contributing to a better work environment for themselves and their coworkers and they are able to do what needs to be done without the influence from other people and/or situation. 

Reflecting on capacity development methods, on the job training and coaching were much appreciated by CSOs as they get enough time to understand and critically reflect on different topics covered. It also enable SNV advisor/Coaches to take each case separately considering the background of CSOs members and their needs in terms of capacities to improve.</narrative>

In 2019 a workshop on FNS thematic knowledge will be organized to deepen CSOs understanding on different food and nutrition concepts.</narrative>

The results for the organizational sustainability survey shows that 3 CSOs have had significant increase in their capabilities. Other 3 CSOs had increase less than 0.25 which was considered as no change. Most of the CSOs that did not demonstrate significant increase in 2018 were already having a quit high score in 2017 (Greater or equal to 3.5). The main organizational development topics covered in 2018 include: Strategic planning process, identifying contradictions and setting clear strategic directions and actions and deep insights on Business Model Canvas and its application in CSOs context. As a result 2 CSOs have reviewed their strategic plans by setting cleared vision, mission and objectives. Other CSOs will apply the acquired knowledge when developing their next strategic plans.

Due to the newly established company AIF, the production in 2017 will increase by 955%, (the current production will multiply by ten times) due to the 40000 metric tons planned production by AIF. However we assume that our contribution will  be 0 since we didnt influence on the production of AIF, the production from other  componies will not change as the policy of mandatory fortification is still dormant and no incetive created  yet from the government to mobilize the investors in this sectors. Also apart from the organizations (WFP, UNHCR, MINISANTE) purchasing these fortified products for emergencies cases the demand of fortified products from the local community is absent. there will be mobilization of the governemnt and the private sector to show the opportunity in the fortification sector while also working on behaviour change of the community to trigger the demand of the products.</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">19-03-2018: &quot;In 2017, the production of fortified food has considerably increased with the contribution of the newly established food processing company (Africa Improved Foods Rwanda Ltd) having a capacity of producing a total of 40,000 metric tons. This production is 10 times higher than what was produced by SOSOMA Industries Ltd and MINIMEX. However a big percentage of this production is the special commands from the government (MINISANTE), WFP, and other development partners mainly aimed at addressing severe malnutrition cases in poor households. This means that when there will be no special commands, the level of production will reduce given that the demand of fortified products from the community is still low. This has resulted in AIF getting the Investor of the year award by the private sector federation (PSF), the firm was selected due to its proven impact of their investment in Rwanda. 

However in order to continue increasing investment in fortification, the CSOs have and will concentrate the efforts in creating demand of fortified food from the consumers and putting fortification on the national agenda by building a good relationship with food processing companies showing the role that the latter have to play in the process of increasing the accessibility and use of fortified products.&quot;</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">20-04-2020: &quot;In order to determine the number of decision makers that demonstrate the increased political will in support of the issue of accessibility and use of fortified products, we have used the policy maker rating tool which is a qualitative method to analyze the support for a particular advocacy issue among a defined group of policy /decision makers. The information for this indicator were collected considering the support demonstrated by influential decision makers in the government and the private sector.
 
At central level, National early child hood development program, has accepted to support Rwanda development organization (RDO) in advancing the advocacy for more nutrient dense crops (bio-fortified) in order to reduce government expenses on the importation and distribution of micro nutrient and hence families dependency on supplementation of micro nutrients thus ensuring sustainability 

ADECOR and NECDP, have signed a memorandum of understanding to work together on nutrition behavior change and food safety, this has increased collaboration between government and civil society as both are major actors in nutrition, this collaboration will increase consumption of nutritious foods and awareness on nutrition practices

On private sector part, in a public campaign on awareness on food and nutrition security, food processing companies, MINIMEX, African improved and SOSOMA were invited among other stake holders of nutrition stakeholders and they promised to increase investment in order to ensure availability and accessibility of fortified foods.

The budget tracking using the tool initially developed in partnership with IFPRI, it has been realized that an increase of 2.3% compare to previous year (2018/2019). The reason of budget increase is mainly decentralization of budget; most of budget lines were shifted from central to decentralized level. Much money to deal with Food Security and Nutrition was transferred to district levels.

      <narrative xml:lang="EN">One of the major functions of the ministry of finance and economic planning is to review and approve proposed budgets from all government institution taking into consideration the government spending priories and the available budget. In 2018 IFPRI in collaboration with RDO has initiated the tracking of the budget allocated by the government of Rwanda to support nutrition interventions in the country. To come up with weights for nutrition sensitive and specific budget lines, IFPRI and RDO have involved different MINECOFIN and other relevant actors in the area of food and nutrition security in Rwanda. 
Findings from the budget tracking finalized in June 2018 have revealed that for the current fiscal year 2017-2018 the government have allocated 7.7% of its total budget on food security and nutrition at the central government. This figure will be considered as baseline. From July 2018 CSOs have been engaging with different authority at the central level emphasizing on the need to increase the budget allocated to nutrition specific interventions.  In July 2019 when another approved budget will be approved, another tracking will be conducted to see whether there have been an increase or not.</narrative>

On average, 1 article was published by CSOs, the target for this reporting period was not achieved because CSOs still have limited skills in writing articles and the use of social media. With the help of SNV communications advisor, CSOs will be trained on how to write and publish articles as well as the use of social media. 

Even though the target was not achieved, some CSOs have published articles in newspapers and websites.

Here are the examples supporting the selected level:

While presenting the findings of food processing mapping, private companies have expressed their commitment to keep the good collaboration that was seen in the development of fortification law and invest more in fortification but requested government to ensure everyone is complying with new law, something that the government have promised by presenting 109 food inspectors hired specifically for that purpose.
Though business activities have been closed for some months due to lockdown, CSOs kept working remotely with both private sector and government officials and examples are where CSOs advocated for vulnerable families and three companies (AIF, MINIMEX and SOSOMA) provided fortified maize flour, poridge flour to 3000 families. &quot;</narrative>

For this reporting period July &#x2013;December2019 CSOs had the target of reaching the level 4 of the rubric whereby follow up actions including the CSOs interests will be undertaken by the government at central and district level and the private sector. The result from the scoring jointly conducted by CSOs and SNV advisors showed that the CSOs have reached the level 4 of the scoring rubric, now follow up actions that are related to increasing the production and consumption of diversified nutritious food, increasing the food and nutrition security budget, improve the coordination and service delivery in nutrition and promoting food fortification are undertaken by the government at central and district level and the private sector.

Here are the examples supporting the selected level:
From the general assembly meeting of national food fortification alliance organized by ADECOR in partnership with food and drug authority and Global alliance for improved nutrition from which processing companies such as Africa Improved Food (AIF), MINIMEX ltd, AZAM lts etc. attended, the role of the alliance in accelerating reduction of malnutrition was discussed and at the end of the meeting, director general of food and drug authority expressed that Rwanda government is fully committed to fight malnutrition in all its forms and the partnership between public, private and civil society is the key tool to reach the goal.

By these regular meetings, CSOs will share some of the knowledge products and evidences which will be made available. However due to the to the fact that in this period a lot of political changes are expected in the policy and decision makers at national level such as election of the president, appointment of new cabinet we expect that the level of collaboration during this period will remain at 2 with little consideration of CSOs&#x2019; ideas in the plans.</narrative>

This score was confirmed after series of discussions between CSOs and SNV advisors, here are some facts that justify the selected level: 

At National level, the Ministry of Agriculture and Animal Resources (MINAGRI) has invited CSOs in the Voice for Change Partnership project in the validation meeting of the final draft of Strategic Plan for Agriculture Transformation 4. This shows that the Ministry value the role our CSOs are playing in the process of developing long term strategies aimed at ending hunger and undernutrition. 

At district level, during a meeting with nutrition civil society actors in RUBAVU district, the vice mayor in charge of social affairs requested SUN Alliance to review the functionality of DPEM in the district. SUN Alliance was also requested by Burera District the support in planning and coordination of a one month nutrition campaign held in all administrative sectors of the district. Furthermore, DUHAMIC ADRI has supported Huye and Nyamagabe District to organize DPEM meetings aimed at reviewing how nutrition interventions are coordinated and implemented at district level; one recommendation that came up from these meetings was to improve collaboration between nutrition actors.</narrative>

This is the 4th strategic plan for agriculture transformation that was approved by the cabinet in July 2018.  

In this strategy, the Ministry of Agriculture and Animal resources will work in partnership with the Ministry of Health, Ministry of Gender and Family Promotion and the Ministry of Local Government to identify and address specific dietary gaps through district investments in agriculture and rural development.  

The adjustment made is that this strategy has now given more room to nutrition and CSOs in V4CP such as IMBARAGA farmers organization, CARITAS Rwanda and RDO are among the local organizations that were consulted when developing, reviewing and validating this strategy. Their inputs were around how this strategy can be more nutrition sensitive. specifically for IMBARAGA and Caritas, in the preliminary phase of developing this strategy they were tasked by the Ministry of Agriculture and Animal Resources (MINAGRI) to collect the views from local farmers on what should be considered in the strategy and in the report shared with MINAGRI,  giving more room to nutrition came out clearly.</narrative>

This indicator was measured using the scoring rubric where the indicator of the progress in developing, adopting and implementing the mandatory food fortification was unpacked in 5 levels. 

For this reporting period, CSOs working on the issue of fortification mainly ADECOR and DUHAMIC ADRI had the target to reach the level 2 of the scoring rubric where the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MINICOM) has to consider a new or adjusted regulation on mandatory food fortification by milling plants. For this purpose, CSOs have organized a number of advocacy activities in which they met with authorities in MINICOM and the Ministry of Health. These encounters have made food fortification to be put on the agenda and CSOs have gotten the by-in from MINICOM. The latter has even provided a recommendation letter to ADECOR as support to its advocacy activities around food fortification. Other efforts were put in the process of formalization of the National Food Fortification Alliance (NFA) which is a platform in which all stakeholders in the government and development partners with interest in food fortification meet to discuss issues related to fortification and propose potential solutions.</narrative>

In 2017, CSOs were at level 1 where through different consultations and meetings held in the process of reviewing the Strategic plan for Agriculture Transformation, different interventions were conducted by CSOs on how this long term strategy have to give more room for nutrition sensitive agriculture. The ideas provided were considered by the Ministry of Agriculture and Animal Resources (MINAGRI). 

The target for 2018 was to maintain the achieved level 1 however the result shows that CSOs have now achieved the level 3 whereby in the final approved 4th Strategic plan for agriculture transformation (PSTA4), nutrition sensitive agriculture was included and highlighted as key. The aim of nutrition sensitive agriculture in PSTA4 is to make sure that agriculture contributes to enhanced dietary diversity and quality at national and household levels. The CSOs in V4CP were among the organizations consulted in the state of development, review and validation. Their intervention were around how agriculture can contribute to improving nutrition outcome by giving more room to the production of diversified nutritious food.</narrative>

Target for the 2019 was to reach the level 5 of the scoring rubric whereby the adjustments made in the PSTA4 would have to be effectively and equally applied across all regions of the country. With the efforts invested by CSOs to ensure the district development strategies are in line with the agriculture sector strategy have resulted in achieving level 5 whereby now all the districts especially those with high prevalence of malnutrition are considering NSA as apriority in their plans and performance contracts. The CSOs jointly have held number of interventions by helping district technical team to develop action plans by embedding NSA interventions in their plans.

CSOs 100% have developed action plans that are related to their specific advocacy topics. This has made the CSOs work to be more oriented and has facilitated the achievement of the medium and long term outcomes in the project theory of change. It is unfortunate that during the course of the year, one of the CSOs (SUN ALLIANCE) did not comply with the signed agreement and its contract was prematurely terminated based on various warnings with no change/improvement.
