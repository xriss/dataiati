   <narrative xml:lang="EN">SNV Uganda was awarded a Grant for TIDE-2 project from the Embassy of the Kingdom of the Netherlands.  TIDE II is a 4 years project (1 January 2020 &#x2013; 31 December 2023) and the project&#x2019;s overall goal is to contribute to sustainable dairy intensification and inclusive business models, creating shared value for different actors along the dairy value chain - also expressed as sector transformation. 

**Specifically TIDE II is aiming at;**

&#xB7; Doubling incomes for 5,000 farmers (reached in TIDE 1)

&#xB7; Improving incomes for 2,000 new farmers (those who never benefited from TIDE I)

&#xB7; Creating new employment/jobs for 1,000 individuals along the dairy value chain

&#xB7; Contributing to improved nutrition for an additional 500,000 children in schools.</narrative>

     <narrative xml:lang="EN">This is a count of farmers who have increased milk production per season. To determine the increase in milk production, one has to aggregate the volume of milk produced per season on each individual farm.  

++**Increase in Milk:**++ Increase in milk is calculated as Total volume of milk produced in the current season of the year minus total volume of milk produced in a season in the previous year.  

++**Number of farmers with increase in milk production:**++ Once the increase in milk production is determined per season and at each farmer level, then sum up all farmers who have increase milk production.

When collecting data for this indicator, it is important to document the number of animals one has on the farm as well.</narrative>

Of those who increase milk production 16% (322) are female owned farms while 81% (1625) are males owned farmers. The success in increase in milk production at farm level was due to the intensive investment by the farmers to adopt improved farming technologies that boosted their milk production. Additionally, the use of RUMEN 8 to demonstrate to farmers the relevancy of efficient animal feeding enabled farmers realize increase in milk production. This increase was coupled with the strengthen cooperative movement, which has encouraged farmers to sell more milk to cooperatives, this farmer operating with an assurance that their milk has market.</narrative>

     <narrative xml:lang="EN">**Definition:** This indicator counts farmers whose milk sales have increased as   a result of TIDE II project activities. To compute the number of farmers who have increased milk sales, one has to start by determining what farmers were previously earning from milk   sales(Baseline) in the past year (at individual farmer level) then minus the   current total annual sales( revenue from milk sales) for the reporting   years(at each individual farmer level). 

++**Computation of increase in sales:**++

The Increase in sales is; Current Annual   sales - Previous annual Sales

Note that farmers with a negative change   in sales will not be included in the count of those who have increased sales.   Sales is the revenue acquired as a result of selling Milk.

++To factor in inclusiveness,++ data will be disaggregated by gender and age group of the farmers   making milk sales per year. Farmers need to be profiled to provide   information on their farm size- number of animals, sex, age, location among   others. 

++**Baseline value of milk:**++

Dry season production is 70Ltrs/day while   wet season is 120ltrs/day

++Expected increase by end of project   time++ is 150ltrs/day in dry season and 250ltrs per day in wet   season</narrative>

       <narrative xml:lang="EN">06-05-2022: During 2021, several farmers began selling milk through cooperatives due to the strengthened cooperatives functionality coupled with intensive investment by farmers in using improved dairy feeding practices and increasing milk prices offered by the cooperatives. As a result, this led to a 96% (1,244 farmers) achievement of the targeted (1300) farmers who increased annual sales of milk. Further analysis of the data reveals that, 54% (676) of the farmers sold milk through cooperatives and selling each litre at UGX: 1000 shilling by the end of 2021, while 36% (442) sold locally to vendors selling at UGX: 800 to 850 shillings per litre, 6% (72) to both local market and cooperatives and 4% (54) selling directly to processors. Looking at the data, by the year ending 2021, farmers were selling to cooperatives at an average of UGX: 1000 shillings per litre of milk while the year ending 2020, they sold at an average of 850 shillings per litre.  Increase in annual milk sales by farmers can be attributed to the strengthened functionality of dairy cooperatives that have interested farmers to sell milk through cooperatives and the strengthened cooperation between cooperatives and processors as result of integrating a quality-based milk payment system in the structure of processors to reward cooperatives and farmers selling good quality milk.</narrative>

++**Additional children**++ mean NEW children enrolled on the SMP program i.e. those who are joining the SMP for the first time. Note these could be from the old schools and the new schools.

Analysis of the data shows that at first visit enteric methane at cow level (g/ltr of milk) was 20.3% and by the 11th follow up visits of farms closely monitored the enteric methane was at 18.6% reflecting an 8% reduction in enteric methane emissions.</narrative>

As result this led to 2,122 farmers adopting better farm management practices including CSA practices. Of those that adopted the practices, 19% are female owned farms while 81% are male owned farms. Some of the technologies adopted included use of improved pastures for animal feeding, use of fodder for animal feeding, use of silage both from fodder and maize, rainwater harvesting among others.  Due to increased interest of farmers in adopt better dairy cows feeding practices, a total of 1,127 acres of land have been put under fodder (630), maize silage (180), forage production (248) and 69 under pasture improvement practices.</narrative>

Further review of the data shows that 73% (743) are youth below the age of 30 years while 27% (280) are persons above the age of 30 years old.  The success in jobs creation on farm is mainly due to the increasing need for investment on farm as well as increasing adoption of improved dairy farming practices.
