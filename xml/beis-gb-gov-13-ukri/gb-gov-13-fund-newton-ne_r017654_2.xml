   <narrative xml:lang="EN">P&#xE1;ramos are high mountain grassland-peatland biomes (3000m-4000m) that cover a total area of circa 35700km2. They are crucial for the livelihoods and wellbeing of millions of people living in Colombia and neighbouring Northern Andean countries (Venezuela, Venezuela, Ecuador and Peru). P&#xE1;ramos are the main source of water in these regions, are used for crop cultivation and grazing and contain a unique source of untapped genetic diversity. While the P&#xE1;ramos have the potential to support, through the exploitation of its biodiversity, local and regional development, the combined pressure of land use and climate change has already degraded many P&#xE1;ramo areas and their potential demise is a cause for concern for many, including local communities, regional and national policy and decision makers and researchers in Colombia. All agree that any future exploitation requires a sustainable approach and that the management of these systems should enhance the P&#xE1;ramo&apos;s resilience to climate change.  However, there is still very much which is not known about the functioning of the P&#xE1;ramos and without this knowledge there is a risk that interventions which are designed to achieve sustainability and enhance resilience are not effective or worse detrimental. P&#xE1;ramos are described as sponges that capture and store water from the atmosphere. Few quantitative studies have investigated the mechanisms behind this process and even less is known about the relative role of the plants and the soil of this complex system. Also, P&#xE1;ramos are socio-ecological systems that have been shaped by the human populations that have inhabited them over several centuries. This interaction is continuing to date with local communities relying solely on the P&#xE1;ramo for their livelihoods. This interdisciplinary 3 year project aims to, jointly with Colombian collaborators, establish how the diversity of habitats and of plants within the P&#xE1;ramos contributes to water regulation, via direct storage in live and dead vegetation and via the supply of organic matter in the soil. We will carry out a large field and drone campaign in the Colombian P&#xE1;ramo Guantiva-la Rusia to collect and analyse data on plants, soil and hydrology. We will carry out satellite image analysis to map landscape scale land cover and peatland condition and improve models so that they better represent the hydrology of the ecosystem. The project will also identify how local P&#xE1;ramo inhabitants, particularly crop and livestock farmers, interact currently with the P&#xE1;ramo ecosystem through their day-to-day farming practices. We will invite local people to participate in workshops and storytelling to jointly discover how they understand they are affecting and are affected by the P&#xE1;ramos&apos; water regulation. We will, as we learn more about the functioning of the P&#xE1;ramo, feedback our findings to the local people and so help them initiate more sustainable solutions.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="Obj1: Establish and quantify how species- and habitat-diversity and management affect catchment-scale capture and release of water from wetland systems within the P&#xE1;ramos.  Obj2: Assess mechanistic links from plant functional type (PFT), necromass and soil composition to generation of baseflows, and peakflow attenuation.  Obj3: Incorporate key mechanisms into a combined model of vegetation/soil processes, hydro-physical properties, and spatially-explicit catchment hydrology, to enable upscaling and forecasting of land use and management effects on water yield.  Obj4: Use hyperspectral and RGB drone remote sensing to map PFT traits and necromass.  Obj5: Use satellite interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) to characterise the shrinking and expansion of wetlands in the P&#xE1;ramos as they store and release water, and as peat is accumulated or lost over longer timescales.  Obj6: Quantify impacts of current and potential future uses of the P&#xE1;ramos on water provision by incorporating local ecosystem service evaluations into an economic production function.   Obj7: Understand, the impact of humans on P&#xE1;ramos&apos; functioning by establishing an informed knowledge of current land uses, social practices, and cultural and historical geographies.  Obj8: Use storytelling to acquire and share knowledge between stakeholder groups and scientists."></capital-spend>
