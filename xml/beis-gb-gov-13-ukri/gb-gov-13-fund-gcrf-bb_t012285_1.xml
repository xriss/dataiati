   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Cattle vaccination against malignant catarrhal fever: balancing pastoral livelihoods, food security and ecosystem integrity in the Serengeti, Tanzania</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Malignant Catarrhal Fever (MCF) is a fatal disease of cattle, caused by alcelaphine herpesvirus-1 and transmitted from wildebeest, which are asymptomatic carriers.  The disease poses a substantial burden on the livelihoods and food security of pastoralists in East Africa and is an important factor driving land-use conflict at the borders of wildlife-protected areas.  Our recent research has demonstrated the safety and efficacy of an attenuated MCF vaccine for cattle, which has many potential benefits for livelihoods and nutritional status of poor livestock-keeping families and the sustainability of mixed livestock-wildlife land-use system.  However, widespread cattle vaccination could also have some adverse environmental and conservation consequences which might need to be managed or mitigated. As a result of our earlier research, an MCF cattle vaccine is likely to become commercially available, which could lead to significant livestock productivity gains and land-use changes around wildlife-protected areas.  In anticipation of this, and to generate data that will allow preparation and planning by wildlife, livestock and village authorities, this study aims to carry out an observational study in the Serengeti ecosystem of northern Tanzania to examine revealed preferences for MCF vaccine use and the consequences of vaccine use on MCF incidence, milk availability to family members, cattle movements and management, livestock-wildlife interactions, vegetation productivity and human-wildlife conflict. The study will involve household surveys, analysis of remote-sensing data on the environment, livestock movement studies and analysis of wildebeest movement and behaviour patterns.  The project team comprises an interdisciplinary partnership involving veterinary epidemiologists, MCF vaccine specialists, environmental and ecological scientists, environmental economists and social scientists from the UK, working together with government and non-governmental partners in Tanzania.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The aim of the project is to support sustainable livestock-wildlife production systems in protected area ecosystems of East Africa through introduction of new cattle vaccination strategies that allow more efficient utilisation of rangeland resources.  This project aims to translate our past BBSRC-funded work on malignant catarrhal fever (MCF) and build on our network of stakeholders to investigate uptake and impacts of MCF vaccination on livestock productivity and ecosystem health in Tanzania.  Our BBSRC-funded research has demonstrated the safety and efficacy of a new MCF vaccine for cattle, which has many potential benefits for the livelihoods and nutritional status of livestock-dependent families. However, MCF vaccination could also result in changes to livestock management practices which might have environmental consequences and which might need to be managed.   Following our earlier trials on vaccine safety and efficacy, an MCF cattle vaccine is likely to become commercially available and, in anticipation of this, our project aims to generate data that will allow preparation and planning by wildlife, livestock and village authorities.  The project aims to examine revealed preferences for MCF vaccine use in the Serengeti ecosystem, Tanzania, and the consequences of vaccine use on disease incidence, milk availability to family members, cattle movements and management, wildebeest movements and behaviour, and pasture productivity.   The project has the following specific aims:  (a) To derive a robust predictive model of MCF vaccine uptake and quantify the effects of offering a subsidy for vaccine purchase; (b) To determine the safety of MCF vaccine and the incidence of fatal MCF cases in vaccinated herds; (c) To assess changes in milk availability and household livelihoods following adoption in MCF vaccine; (d) To assess changes in livestock management and movement patterns arising as a result of vaccine use; (e) To investigate environmental impacts of MCF vaccine uptake through analysis of pasture quality; (f) To investigate behavioural interactions between wildebeest and vaccinated livestock.</narrative>
