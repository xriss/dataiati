  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Aims and objectives 1. The study will investigate and understand the experiences and perceptions of the impact on men and women with disabilities during COVID-19 and particularly the hard lockdown phases 3, 4 and 5. The primary objective is to is collect robust data to reveal the impact of the pandemic on this population and to support actions to ensure that PWD&apos;s rights are realised during further COVID-19 lockdowns, future pandemics and similar events in SA and the region. 2. Secondary objectives: a. Examine and review policies/legislation and literature regarding COVID-19 lockdown and pandemics in SA and Africa and the inclusion or exclusion of persons with disabilities in actions taken to support populations and mitigate risks to socio-economic status, wellbeing and human rights realisation. b. Determine the profiles of the respondents (disaggregate demographics) c. Explore people with disabilities&apos; awareness/knowledge of COVID-19 risks and safety measures. d. Gather experiences of accessing specific services required by PWD during the lockdown and subsequent COVID-19 time. e. Understand the socio-economic, health, psychosocial and wellbeing impacts of COVID-19 on individuals with disabilities and their families f. Gather perceptions of the support provided by government agencies, disability support organisations and others to this population. g. Gather perceptions about the potential future impacts of COVID-19 and other pandemics from a personal perspective and how individual and community resilience can be built. h. Explore perspectives on whether and how the rights of people with disabilities have been impacted by the COVID-19 situation and related events including through legislation and practices. i. Gather recommendations for strategies and actions that would mitigate the negative impacts on PWD during COVID-19 future pandemic or similar shock events in SA and which may be applicable in the region. j. Use the data collected to advocate, lobby and engage with relevant government agencies to ensure recommendations are taken forward to inform a new disability inclusive framework for action during pandemics and other shock events. k. Share our findings with other countries, regions and globally, in order to learn lessons, compare with the experiences of people with disabilities in other contexts, learn and exchange recommendations about ideal planning frameworks, policies and actions. l. Learn more about and share our experience of using distance/online ICT methodologies in inclusive ways in order to collect data from marginalised and excluded groups, when face to face research methods are not possible. m. Provide a model for team working between research institutions and disability advocacy and service organisations working together to carry out inclusive research which has an action-orientated purpose.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">People with disabilities (PWD) are recognised globally as a large but often excluded and disadvantaged minority. The South African White Paper on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (WPRD) (DSD 2016) estimates 12% of South Africans live with a disability. The South African (SA) government has ratified various international and regional disability treaties, but has no specific legislation for disability rights, these being dealt with in general antidiscrimination legislation. Thus, SA does not have the necessary frameworks to monitor, intervene, enable and provide justice for PWD (Sibanda 2015). This has become more apparent during the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown in SA in March 2020. Much information has been gathered on how South Africans generally are experiencing the COVID-19 outbreak and the subsequent lockdown, but this does not gather the experiences and circumstances of PWD. Some COVID-19 studies relating to this population focus on specific impairments, on selected locations, or on particular challenges such as communication or mobility, but there is no countrywide data. A current international survey has recruited less than 50 PWDs in SA (Global Disability Rights Monitor 2020). Uniquely, we will do a national survey with people with all types of impairment, aiming to identify experiences and challenges PWD face during COVID-19. We will explore whether the SA National Disaster Management Act is seen to be compliant with the UN Convention on Rights of Persons with Disabilities (2017) and South Africa&apos;s WPRD. We will produce new comprehensive data revealing impacts of COVID-19 on PWDs and thus provide the Ministry of Women, Youth and PWD (MWYPD) with evidence to inform the development of a monitoring framework for the inclusion of PWD in mitigations during and after pandemics, shocks and crises.  This study will investigate the experiences of people with diverse impairments (PWD) during COVID-19 and hear their perspectives on what could be improved, revealing whether they feel their human rights have been upheld or denied during this time of uncertainty. These findings will then be used to mobilise/influence the SA government to address any rights-based concerns and exclusionary oversights across sectors. It will provide evidence and recommendations to inform the development of a framework (already recognised and documented as needed by MWYPD) to ensure the realisation of the rights of people with disabilities during future national disasters, shocks and crises such as pandemics and similar. After initially reviewing relevant literature, we will refine our survey tool and conduct the first national disability survey asking PWD for their views, with a sample size of approximately 4000 PWDs in South Africa. Mobile phone and online platforms (ICT) will be used to administer remotely, an electronic quantitative and qualitative survey, adhering to COVID-19 lockdown regulations. IDS and HSRC will work in partnership with member organisations, affiliates and partners of the National Council of and for Persons with Disabilities (NCPD) to design the survey and recruit participants. We will ensure that a wide cross-section of this subpopulation is reached (balancing disability type, race, class, gender, age), respondents being adults with disabilities (or parents and caregivers) who volunteer to participate. Personal information will be protected as per the Protection of Personal Information Act (2013). The 9-month study is unique in focussing specifically on the perceptions of South African PWDs and their concerns during COVID-19  and related events and then lobbying for their recommendations to inform a new framework to guide improved disability inclusive practices generally and in future crises. Findings will be shared nationally, regionally and globally to a range of formats (verbal and written), for various including disability interested audiences, activists, academics, service planners and policymakers</narrative>
