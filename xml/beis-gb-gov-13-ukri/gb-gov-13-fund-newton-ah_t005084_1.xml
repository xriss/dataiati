   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed multi-disciplinary network will focus on the nexus between Indian Diasporas, identity formation, cultural heritage and performance, with special attention paid to questions of representation in an increasingly globalised visual culture. Its focus is on performance, dance, theatre, story-telling, music and scenography, and how these practices are imagined, embodied and understood across these communities as vital components of Indian cultural heritage. The research begins from the premise that sharing how performative representations of Indian cultural heritage, both within India and between India and the Indian Diaspora, are conceived and perceived, which will lead to better understanding of how these conceptions contribute to the formation of identities and subjectivities in both constituencies. This becomes critically important when a rising tide of nationalisms as well as racial and religious stereotyping sweep across the globe, which carry with them an emphasis on identity, culture and heritage as spatially and temporally fixed, leading to reductionist and essentialist conceptions of the &apos;other&apos;. To avoid these notions of fixity, the project adopts Arjun Appadurai&apos;s preferred adjectival application of the term &apos;cultural&apos; in Modernity at Large (1996), understanding it to be &apos;a realm of differences, contrasts, and comparisons&apos; (12). We also understand heritage as having meanings that are temporally fluid and, while often associated with space and place, it is not anchored by them. In this context, the primary question the network will seek to investigate is: to what extent are ahistoricised, abstracted, colonial fantasies of India perpetuated through performative representations of Indian cultural heritage in the Diaspora, and how can we instigate better ways of reading through these &apos;fictions and fantasies&apos; in an era of mass communication? A secondary aim will be to test the efficacy of practice-led performance research as a mode of knowledge production with relation to cultural heritage, with the Indian Diaspora bringing a new critical and analytical lens to this area, potentially opening up new methods of enquiry for diasporic studies more widely.  The proliferation of images in a mediatised culture is one of the means by which narratives of power are maintained. In the face of unitary and homogenised representations of cultural heritage between India and the Indian Diaspora, the performing arts can either re-enforce this hegemonic discourse or offer up alternative perspectives. In order to achieve this, we first need to develop more critical ways of seeing and reading the meanings inherent in the way Indian cultural heritage is visualised and experienced between these two constituencies. The network will initiate collaborative partnerships and exchange visits between the TrAIN Research Centre (UAL), the Sarojini Naidu School of Arts &amp; Communication (University of Hyderabad), and arts and community organisations concerned with cultural heritage, identity and community-formation across the sub-continent and in the UK. Adopting an innovative approach, academic institutions, arts organisations and community groups will be linked through a series of practical workshops. Two multi-disciplinary symposia will furthermore extend and contextualise the findings of the workshops. The symposia, one in London and one in Hyderabad, will be organised around three key themes: Stereotypes in the representations of cultural heritage; the invisibility of local specificity inherent in transnationalism; further collaboration and discussion of methodologies that make more effective engagement possible. Outcomes will be disseminated online, through pop-up exhibitions and a performance in the public domain, and through published articles in relevant international journals.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="This network will be jointly led by Professor Jane Collins (PI) of TrAIN (Transnational Art, Identity and Nation) Research Centre based in Camberwell, Chelsea and Wimbledon College of Arts (CCW), University of the Arts London (UAL), and Professor B. Anandhakrishnan (PI), Head of the Department of Theatre Arts, Sarojini Naidu School of Arts &amp; Communication, University of Hyderabad, India.   The project will connect a transnational, inter-generational network of artists, scholars, citizens and community activists, practitioners from the humanities and the social sciences, partners and stakeholders in education as well as the general public through a series of workshops and symposia, which will:  Connect artists, academics and community activists in the UK and India to consider the role and status of Indian cultural heritage in the collective imagination of a selected group of diasporic British Indians and amongst a group of young arts practitioners in Hyderabad.  Identify and document how a group of first-generation, London-based British Indians imagines their cultural heritage in relation to integration and identity formation.   Consider the representation of Indian cultural heritage in the global cultural arena, and the affect this is having on local subjectivities in the UK and on the subcontinent through practical workshops and symposia.  Practically explore how students of the arts in India extend their imaginations to assimilate and demonstrate unfamiliar classical forms of Indian cultural heritage through their bodies.  Examine the strengths and limitations of existing scholarly practice with regard to readings of cultural heritage as expressed in the performing arts between India and the Indian Diaspora.  Engage with the problematic of conservation, hybridisation and continuity in relation to Indian cultural heritage across diasporic communities in an increasingly globalised cultural realm, and the implications of this for arts education.    Look to the future performance, activist and scholarly agenda that will enable the network to formulate a bid to the AHRC and other funding bodies to support research and practice that will enable informed critical readings and positive interventions in the &apos;circuit of culture&apos; between India and the Indian Diaspora with regard to heritage."></capital-spend>
