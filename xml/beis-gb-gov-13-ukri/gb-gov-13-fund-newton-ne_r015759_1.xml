   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Food security is consistently seen as one of the key global challenges for the coming decades. Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC), currently representing 13% of total food trade, could contribute to solving this challenge given its comparative advantage in terms of water and land availability. Agricultural exports and increasing global food demand represent a big opportunity for the economic development of LAC countries. In the last decades, governments have designed programmes, regulations and institutions aimed at increasing agricultural productivity in countries like Ecuador and Peru. However, there is some evidence of this agricultural expansion already causing some environmental problems (e.g. aquifer overexploitation) and impacts on sectors competing for the same resources (energy). Getting the Water-Energy-Food-Environment (WEFE) nexus right is crucial for LAC countries to ensure the sustainable development of agriculture and the economy without compromising natural resources availability for present and future generations. NEXT-AG&apos;s aim is to provide policymakers in those countries with the needed evidence base that allows them to develop new coordinated policies and programmes for increasing resilience and promoting sustainable economic growth in the context of increasing national and global food demand. The project has five main areas: 1) Data collection; 2) Policy and institutional mapping; 3) Modelling and integration; 4) Dissemination and outreach; 5) Project management. The core part of the project is the modelling of the different components of the WEFE nexus, done in collaboration with stakeholders, and their integration, which results will form the needed evidence base to inform future agricultural policies. Specifically, the project team will 1) collect and synthesise evidence on available water and energy resources and their use in agriculture and interaction with other sectors, showing key dependencies and trade-offs, and how the most relevant national policies and development plans might be influencing those links; 2) develop a participatory modelling framework to study the trade-offs between food production and key biophysical and environmental nexus components under contrasting climate, policy and socio-economic scenarios; 3)  inform policymaking on how to better integrate nexus thinking into future coordinated policies and development strategies. The outcomes of the project will not only be relevant for Andean countries, but for other developing countries where food exports are one of the key economic activities.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Securing a sustainable supply of water, energy and food while at the same time protecting the environment is a key global issue.Traditionally, policymaking for each sector (food, water, energy and environment) has been designed largely in isolation, without consideration of the synergies and trade-offs between them, leading in some cases to overexploitation of natural resources, increasing competition between sectors and negative externalities. This has been the case of the agricultural expansion planned in Ecuador and Peru during the last decades to take advantage of a growing international market. By unpacking synergies and trade-offs through a WEFE (Water-Energy-Food-Environment) nexus approach, the aim of the project is to provide policymakers in those countries with the needed evidence base that allows them to develop new coordinated policies and programmes for increasing resilience and promoting sustainable economic growth in the context of increasing national and global food demand. Focusing on Ecuador and Peru, this project will: a) Study the implications of increasing food production and associated policies on availability of water, energy and other natural resources for other sectors and the environment; b) Develop an integrated modelling framework in collaboration with stakeholders to evaluate how current and future policies will impact on the WEFE nexus for food provision services and the trade-offs in the context of increasing food demand and exports to international markets; c) Inform future WEFE policies in the countries under study, leading to the sustainable use of natural resources and economic growth. The NEXT-AG research agenda will increase our understanding of how agricultural expansion policies are impacting natural resources availability and security for other sectors; how participatory modelling techniques could contribute to producing useful outputs that can be used by policymakers in reality; and how to better integrate WEFE and economic modelling tools to assess the trade-offs between food production and the other WEFE nexus components.</narrative>
