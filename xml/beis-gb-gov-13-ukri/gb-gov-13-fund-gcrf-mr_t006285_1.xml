   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Long-term health after malnutrition: the role of the pancreas</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This proposal is the first, development, stage in our aim of improving understanding of a) the long-term consequences of severe acute malnutrition (SAM) suffered in childhood or adulthood, b) diabetes in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), and c) potential causal links between the two. The work will contribute to general understanding of metabolic aspects of non-communicable diseases in LMICs and will help explain long-standing observations of unusual presentations of diabetes in LMICs.   The hypotheses we plan to test in a later multicentre (Tanzania, Zambia, India and the Philippines) cohort study are:  1. Severe postnatal malnutrition has long-term detrimental effects on pancreatic function, both endocrine function (beta cells - insulin, alpha-cells - glucagon) and exocrine function (pancreatic enzymes) associated with increased risk of diabetes. 2. The pancreatic damage is worse when malnutrition occurs earlier in life and is aggravated by subsequent exposure to diets high in fat and sugar.  We plan to investigate these hypotheses by addressing the following objectives in the multicentre study: 1. In cohorts of adults or adolescents who previously suffered SAM at different times during the life course, to investigate endocrine and exocrine pancreas function by assessing: a. Pancreas size, gross structure, and microarchitecture; b. Faecal elastase; c. Hemoglobin A1c; d. Glucose, insulin, glucagon and other hormones affecting glucose metabolism during oral glucose tolerance tests and arginine stimulation tests; 2. To use causal inference analyses with the above data to determine whether prior SAM is associated with endocrine or exocrine pancreatic abnormalities, controlling for age, sex, severity of SAM, and other risk factors or potential mediators of diabetes.  This development stage proposal is designed to finalise objectives and methods for the larger project. Activities in the development stage are: 1. Train study clinical investigators in modern techniques for assessing pancreas function. 2. Visit the proposed sites to engage with clinicians, health officials and our current cohort participants to:  a. understand knowledge about and attitudes to diabetes and facilitators and barriers to its treatment;  b. determine feasibility and acceptability of the planned study tests;  c. finalise food frequency questionnaires to capture intake of local foods high in fat and sugar; d. determine training needs, including MSc and PhD as well as specific on the job training, for the study.   3. Finalise the conceptual framework, analysis plan, data needs, standard operating procedures, and proposal for the larger study. 4. Build new and strengthen current partnerships by meeting at the sites and in London.  Thus, a development grant would enable us to address key aspects of the planned research outlined above, by enabling site visits and detailed planning for the main research across all cohorts and sites.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">With current global changes in diet and lifestyle, even low- and middle-income countries are experiencing the &apos;double burden&apos; of undernutrition and overweight. Both conditions can be found within communities, families and even individuals at different times over their life course. It is well established that malnutrition in pregnancy, resulting in an infant born with low birth weight, can increase the risk of diseases such as diabetes, heart disease and cancer in adulthood. However, the consequences of malnutrition after birth are much less studied. Severe acute malnutrition in childhood, indicated by extreme thinness, remains common in Africa and Asia. In addition, substantial numbers of adult patients with tuberculosis or HIV, diseases which are common in Africa and Asia, may become severely malnourished. We are interested in diabetes, which in Africa and Asia affects people at younger age and lower weight than in Europe. There is evidence from epidemiological studies that severe malnutrition in childhood and possibly in adulthood increases the risk of later diabetes but there is little information as to the mechanisms involved. We wish to focus on the pancreas which is a key organ in digestion and metabolic processes, especially in relation to diabetes. We will investigate pancreas size, microscopic structure, hormone and digestive enzyme production, and the body&apos;s response to these hormones among groups of people in Tanzania, Zambia, India and the Philippines. These groups have participated in the research team&apos;s previous studies of malnutrition and were severely malnourished before birth, as children, or as adults. They now live in places with a wide range of access to foods high and fat and sugar which could affect their risk of diabetes. We will use modern clinical methods to compare their pancreas function to that of never-malnourished controls at each site. We will use advanced statistical methods to understand the links between early malnutrition and later diabetes, taking into account the factors often associated with diabetes such as current overweight and high intakes of fat or sugar.  The research will lead to improved understanding of both the long-term consequences of malnutrition and the presentation and underlying metabolism of diabetes in Africa and Asia. Thus, it will lead to improved health care for both malnourished and diabetic people even if we find no important link between early malnutrition and later diabetes.</narrative>
