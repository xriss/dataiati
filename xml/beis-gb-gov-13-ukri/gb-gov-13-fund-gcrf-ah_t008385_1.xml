   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Customary law in South Pacific marine resource governance: addressing gender inequity in achieving sustainable food security</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Focusing on Sustainable Development Goals 2, 5, 14 and 17, this proposal aims to address the global challenge of gender equity, poverty and food security linked to marine resources in the Pacific Islands of Fiji, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu, where gender inequality results in women&apos;s experiences, insights and narratives  not being heard when traditional knowledge, custom and customary law are utilised to inform pluri-legal policies and sustainable management strategies for these resources. Yet women bear the greatest burden of providing food for their families. It is women in coastal villages who are engaged, on a daily basis, in activities such as reef harvesting and often fishing. It is they who experience first-hand the consequences of food insecurity.   South Pacific island countries, all of which are LMIC (low or middle income countries) face many global challenges, not least the sustainable management of  terrestrial and marine resources.These countries also have legal systems - largely as a result of colonialism, in which there are a number of sources of authority which govern the lives of Pacific Islanders and determine rights over land and coastal resources, including unwritten customary law and practices.     The value of engaging with indigenous traditional knowledge, experience and practice in managing the use of marine resources has long been recognised at a local and regional level and increasingly acknowledged in international discourse. In the Pacific, especially in the Melanesian countries which are the focus of this proposal, gender-inequality is culturally and socially embedded so that when an holistic approach is being sought to address contemporary resource challenges it is usually men who speak and who give their version of customary law, which is then used to inform the management strategies that are supported by local and national government.  Women&apos;s voices are not heard. This knowledge-gap has been clearly identified by the regional network: the Locally Managed Marine Areas Network (LMMA).    This project aims to address that gap by providing an opportunity to hear women&apos;s voices by linking a network of women to that of the LMMA, empowering women through skills training to present their narratives and bringing these to the attention of policy makers in the region and the wider community, through the various outputs from the project, so that more inclusive approaches to marine resource management can be developed.     This will be done by:  1. building on existing personal contacts with the University of the South Pacific (USP), the LMMA, NGOs and individual Pacific researchers to establish localised links through field work among coastal communities in Fiji, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu; 2. to then bring women delegates from the field work villages to a training and knowledge exchange workshop run at USP, in Fiji; 3. to fund a delegation of Pacific women drawn from the workshop, to attend and present their narratives to an international audience at the Commission on Legal Pluralism and Unofficial Law conference, hosted in 2020, at the University of Queensland; 4. to publish outputs  - in print, audio and visual recordings and workshop packages,  and disseminate these to network participants, researchers and educational institutions, such as the University of the South Pacific, websites - such as that of the LMMA, and (as executive briefs, gender equity check lists and model questionnaires) to government ministries and departments engaged in developing policies for Blue/Green economies in line with national and regional agendas (for example the Blue Pacific agenda of the Pacific Forum). By making policy-makers aware of women&apos;s narratives, the aim of the project is to encourage those engaged in such policy making to audit their own gendered approaches to customary law in the context of marine resources and to build in-country capacity through contributing to existing initiatives of USP and the LMMA.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Focusing on the Pacific, drawing on the research experience of the PI and Co-I and supported by literature that identifies the challenges of gender equity in the context of customary law particularly with reference to land and natural resources (See eg Bolabola 1986, Brown 1999, Singh 2001, Singleton 2008, Slater 2011, Crook, Farran and Roell 2015), this project  builds on  contacts and networks with the University of the South Pacific (USP) and the Locally Managed Marine Areas Network LMMA), to address an identified gendered knowledge gap in narratives of customary law, by:      Providing an opportunity to hear women&apos;s voices and narratives in the context of using customary law and custom in developing a plural and holistic approach to the sustainable management of marine resources essential for food security. It does this through networking with women in coastal villages to hear their narratives, developing  the capacity of women from these areas to be heard and thereby make a difference to on-going thinking in Pacific institutions such as USP and to policy-planning by governments in this important area of sustainable development.    To do this the project proposes four phases across twelve months:    1. Field work trips to coastal localities in Fiji, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu to establish the foundations of the network and explain the project. The objective of the fieldwork is to use the Pacific method of story-telling (Teaiwa 2007) and informal interviews to  ascertain the main challenges that women experience in making their voices heard in strongly patriarchal societies and their experiences of customary governance of marine resources. 2. Women nominated during the fieldwork will be invited and funded to attend a workshop at USP. Working with the Oceania Centre for Performing Arts at USP these participants will receive presentation capacity building and confidence skills training at the networking workshop. They will also participate in the collaborative design of material that can be used by government  to inform future policy-making and gender audit current policies.  The objective of the workshop is to empower women to speak out. 3. Pacific women nominated from the above workshop will be funded to attend the Commission on Legal Pluralism and Unofficial Law conference in Brisbane in July 2020.  The objective is to give Pacific women the opportunity to present in their own voices, performances and presentations their experiences of the relationship between food security and customary law and the challenges facing them as food providers in Pacific islands.     4. Drawing on the above three phases the project will publish by open access: pod-casts, recordings, website posts and written case studies - including journal articles and executive briefs. The objective of this phase is to disseminate widely and produce outputs for government ministries and agencies to inform national policy in Fiji, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu on implementing the Regional Roadmap for Sustainable Pacific Fisheries (2015); to build Melanesian and South Pacific capacity to engage in and progress these issues including in-house experience and continued thinking in regional institutions such as the University of the South Pacific (the School of Government, Development and International Affairs and the Oceania Centre) and the Locally Managed Marine Areas (LMMA) Network. The outputs presented by network members will also provide  knowledge transfer materials for training workshops and teaching materials for students at USP, thereby building local knowledge and awareness among young Pacific Islanders.    The insights and knowledge acquired through this network in the context of SDGs, 2, 5, 14 and 17 in this area of the world, will provide valuable foundations for developing further GCRF bids in collaboration with network partners, in order to addressin innovative and relevant ways challenges that are specific to this region.</narrative>
