   <narrative xml:lang="EN">At one point or another, most language users rely on dictionaries as authoritative source of lexicographical information. The first recorded dictionaries date back to Sumerian times (3rd millennium BCE) compiled in the course of the linguistic convergence (&apos;Sprachbund&apos;) between Akkadian and Sumerian. Since then, dictionaries have played a key role in intercultural communication and advanced scientific research across languages and nation states. Modern-day lexicography still serves these goals, but its methods have changed beyond recognition. Card catalogues have given way to databases and digital resources that offer access to a much larger pool of linguistic data. Today, practically all lexicographers deploy text corpora and corpus querying tools, both to sharpen the empirical base of definitions and to provide contextual examples for the end user. We propose to take advantage of these developments to create a corpus-based diachronic lexicon of Tibetan verbs.  Verbs play a central role in most sentences. Knowledge of the meaning of a verb leads to the arguments it requires and to the semantic roles the arguments, in turn, assume. Our lexicon draws on these links. It will allow the user to infer the complete structure of a sentence, based primarily on the terminal verb and the type of accompanying arguments. Furthermore, it charts the morphological and semantic changes of the verbs from the earliest records of Tibetan in the 8th century CE to contemporary times. Each verb is tracked to its earlier occurrence in the Old Tibetan material within the corpus and then compared with its applications in Classical and Modern Tibetan. Some of the existing dictionaries contain sporadic diachronic information, but this is never analysed or juxtaposed with other data. We propose to identify, examine and contextualise the diachronic evidence in a systematic fashion in order to obtain a better grasp of the evolution of the Tibetan language overall.  Corpus resources and processing tools constitute indispensable components in modern lexicography. For Tibetan, some of these tools are now available. &apos;Tibetan in Digital Communication&apos; produced a large corpus of Tibetan language material, with part-of-speech-tagging, spanning Old, Classical and Modern Tibetan. For the lexicon, we mine its content by running a series of automated queries drawing on Natural Language Processing (NLP) software. At first, we create an internal workflow tool. This allows us to categorise, both systematically and comprehensively, all the Tibetan verbs within the corpus. The different forms of the verbs are then grouped together in discrete entries; we analyse in depth verbal stems that display semantic ambiguity, repeated change or morphological irregularity. In parallel, we identify and label the arguments connected with each verb. We use this data, individually and cumulatively, to generate the citations and definitions for the lexicon.  The verb lexicon will become an indispensable asset for students and scholars alike, working on any one of the many facets of Tibetan culture, past and present. Outside academia, through its modern component, the lexicon improves access to Tibet-related content in the political and economic sphere. Development aid, humanitarian assistance, medical provisions and educational support are best delivered in conversation with the recipients. These conversations must be conducted in Tibetan. Very few Tibetans are fluent in English and most do not wish to communicate in Chinese. The software we create also advances the creation of new digital tools for Tibetan speakers. The IT sector is reluctant to invest in the language of a people that holds little political or economical influence. Its speakers are excluded from the vast resources of the web. Key to such technologies is the availability of a Basic Language Resource Kit (BLARK).  The lexicon and predicate software bring us one step closer to the completion of a BLARK for Tibetan.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="The project possesses four principal objectives:   (1) The creation of a digital, open-access diachronic lexicon of Tibetan verbs. For the compilation of this lexicon we draw on a corpus of Tibetan texts spanning Old, Classical and Modern Tibetan. It will include, apart from the diachronic Tibetan/English entries example sentences and notes for each verb. It is published as a web service launched from the websites of several organisations with strong links to Tibet, including Esukhia, Tibetan and Himalayan Library (THL) and the Tibetan Buddhist Resource Centre (TBRC). The lexicon serves scholars working with Tibetan language materials of any genre, old and modern, in a wide range of disciplines, including anthropology, history, religion, literature and linguistics.  (2) The annotation of the verbal argument structures of 50,000 Tibetan sentences through the production of a predicate-argument labelling workflow software. Each verbal occurrence will be linked via dependency tags to its nominal arguments. The sentences, indexed to the three periods of the Tibetan language, are extracted from a digital corpus that we created for an earlier research initiative. They serve as a training cohort to develop an application able to label the predicate structures of unannotated Tibetan texts with minimal human intervention.  (3) The production of new research into Tibetan linguistics. To begin with, we investigate verb and noun lemmatisation, followed by a study of noun-phrase construction. As a last step, we examine verb valency and grammaticalisation across the history of Tibetan. These enquiries inform the production of the lexicon and lead to a series of separate publications.  (4) The lexicon, with its tools, is intended to strengthen the presence of Tibetan on the web and to improve access, through its bidirectional query capacity, to English language resources for Tibetan speakers in China. Here, Tibetan continues to be disadvantaged since it is perceived to be a vehicle for political independence and cultural identity.  The compilation of the lexicon draws on the resources and expertise generated for &apos;Tibetan in Digital Communication&apos; (TDC), AH/J00152X/1, 2012-15). TDC produced a large Tibetan language corpus together with a word segmenter and part-of-speech tagger. The production of the predicate-argument labeling software will significantly advance Tibetan natural language processing capabilities. Verbs anchor Tibetan sentences; the syntactic links between verbs and their arguments are key to the preparation of more advanced language technologies. These, in turn, pave the way for an increased online presence of Tibetan through their contribution to the production of a Basic Language Resource Kit (BLARK) for Tibetan. BLARKs are required for many practical language applications, including text summarisation and machine-aided translation.  The research that guides the production of the lexicon closely aligns our objectives with issues of scholarly significance. (1) The lemmatisation is a first attempt to draw up a set of algorithmic principles to group together the inflected forms of Tibetan verbs and nouns. (2) The investigation of noun-phrase syntax, necessary to determine the heads of noun-phrases and thus the nominal dependents of verbs, requires a systematic and hitherto unrivaled, examination of noun phrase structures, spanning 1200 years of Tibetan. (3) The examination of verb valency calibrates our understanding of Tibetan grammar and helps us chart its changes through time. It supplies important new empirical data to map the grammaticalisation of content verbs into auxiliary verbs. (4) Our work holds a number of practical applications in the digital humanities. For example, the creation of profiles of diachronic verb valency patterns would allow scholars to date texts of contested origin and thus advance our understanding of early Tibetan history, a much debated issue among China&apos;s contemporary Tibetologists."></capital-spend>
