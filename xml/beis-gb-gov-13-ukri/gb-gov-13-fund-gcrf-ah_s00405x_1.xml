   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Arts and conflict transformation in Myanmar. Participatory workshops and peace education in minority areas</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The objective of this interdisciplinary research networking project is to use academic and arts participatory workshops to generate new knowledge about conflict transformation, widen access education via informal and digital learning environments and thereby empower groups and communities traditionally marginalised in contemporary Myanmar. Attention will especially focus on south-eastern Myanmar (Karen, Kayah, and Mon states and Bago region), as these areas, different in ethnic and religious composition and in terms of their experience with conflict, offer diverse vantage points on Myanmar&apos;s complexity and current development challenges.  Core project objectives include the following:  1. Take stock of current grassroots initiatives by local artists in the conflict and post-conflict regions of Myanmar. The project will draw on a team of local and international researchers to collect evidence on local interventions drawing on Myanmar&apos;s own experience, traditions and institutions promoting dialogue and reconciliation. 2. Use arts participatory workshops to co-produce knowledge and research evidence of educational intervention in conflict and post-conflict settings. The project will draw on arts research and practice to build on and extend social science approaches to conflict and conflict resolution.  3. Empower local artists and give voice to artists and visibility and resonance to artistic outputs around themes of inclusion, tolerance, and diversity.  Through a small number of exploratory participatory workshops and performances the project will reach out to and engage segments of the population that are normally marginalised or even excluded by formal education. 4. Enhance quality education in Myanmar.  The education sector has undergone serious transformation since liberalisation started in 2011, and even more so since 2013, but remains top-down and focuses on the priorities of the ethnic majority group. The project will develop innovative approaches to education that are sensitive to the concerns of communities whose concerns and needs have been neglected in those broad reforms. 5. Establish a highly collaborative international and inter-discipinary research network to develop research insights and shape new research agendas that reflect Myanmar&apos;s own experiences and that might also be of value in broadly comparable contexts.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project uses academic and arts participatory workshops to generate new knowledge about forms of conflict transformation in contemporary Myanmar. To do so, the project develops a network around the collaboration between researchers, artists and education practitioners working in conflict and post-conflict regions. The purpose is to generate knowledge  about how artistic interventions transform conflicts, develop innovative educational material and widen access to quality education among marginalised communities.  Since attaining independence in 1948 Myanmar has experienced a high number of domestic conflicts and armed insurgencies. After more than five decades of authoritarian rule the military handed over government to a formally civilian government in 2011, which embarked on wide-ranging process of political and economic liberalisation. Despite the landmark elections of 2015, which brought to power the long-time opposition party, National League of Democracy, political transformation remains largely incomplete. The military remains in charge of key sectors of government. The 2017 Rohingya crisis in Rakhine state and the 2018 crackdown in Kachin state serve as stark reminders of the challenges the country is confronted with and their seemingly intractable nature. Building peace remains a tall order. Progress in other key areas, such as welfare and economic development, hinges on tackling that challenge.  Efforts at reconciliation and conflict resolution in Myanmar have typically been top-down and have focused on high-level political dialogue. This project complements such approaches by exploring the potential of bottom-up participatory initiatives by local artists, civil society and researchers to promote dialogue, reconciliation and social justice. As such it is innovative in its emphasis on co-production of knowledge among artists and researchers and and crosses boundaries among disciplines as it places the arts at the very centre of a field traditionally dominated by the social sciences.  The project focuses on four different regions of south-eastern Myanmar: three have a long history of armed conflict (Karen, Kayah and Mon states), whilst one has been largely peaceful (the Bago region). The regions are home to some of Myanmar&apos;s largest ethnic groups (the Karen, Kayah and Mon communities), they show religious diversity (Kayah state is evenly split between Buddhists and Christians, Karen is predominantly Buddhist with Christian and Muslim minorities, Mon is predominantly Buddhist with some Muslim minorities). The population in Bago region is mostly Bamar and Buddhist, and the area has not experienced the conflict of nearby territories. Myanmar has a vibrant arts scene, and many initiatives blur the lines between arts and active citizenship and social reflection. Through the development of arts participatory workshops local artists will co-produce knowledge with local organisations and international partners to widen access to innovative and quality education. Furthermore, the ethnic and religious complexity of the country and the specific dynamics of each conflict will help the project participants to appreciate the importance of local context and local experiences at reconciliation, serving as cautionary notes against rather abstract macro-level approaches.  The project enables a partnership between the Thabyay Education Foundation, a Yangon-based NGO with a strong experience in providing peace education to marginalised communities and the UK-based PI as they build a network with a wide range of local and international researchers, peace educators and artists.</narrative>
