   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Whole systems care for post-stroke management in older adults: exploring the options for integration of health and social care systems in China</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">As a result of social and economic change over the past few decades, a number of low- and middle-income countries have rapidly ageing populations who are more vulnerable to long-term health conditions.  To date, there has been little exploration of how the experiences of high-income countries that have developed models of integrated health and social care might inform strategies in low- and middle-income countries with growing numbers of older adults.  This development grant seeks to build evidence towards development of a stroke care system for older adults in Guangdong Province, China.  China&apos;s population is rapidly ageing, and approximately half of adults over 60 are living with chronic diseases.  High blood pressure is the main risk factor for stroke which is  leading cause of death and disability in the country.  Family structures, levels of social support, and access to health insurance for older adults have changed due to the &apos;one-child policy&apos;, internal migration, and health reforms since the late 90&apos;s.  Older adults in rural and urban settings have different levels of health awareness and support and seek health care differently, but overall, the care they receive is inconsistent and patchy.  This project focuses on stroke care to explore how health and social systems are working to enable or hinder continuity of care for older adults with chronic disease conditions.  First, we aim to distil the lessons learned from the international literature on stroke systems of care for older adults and examine their applicability in the Chinese health systems context.  Second, we will conduct field research involving data collection with older adults, lay caregivers, and professional health and social care providers in an urban and a rural prefecture of Guangdong Province (Guangzhou and Meizhou respectively) to document experiences, patterns of care-seeking, and perceived needs for chronic disease management.  A specific focus on stroke patients&apos; journeys through recovery and rehabilitation will allow us to identify how the systems currently work, and to what extent they hinder or facilitate integrated care.  Third, we will examine and summarise the data collected in the form of a model that illustrates how health and social care systems currently respond and interact to meet the needs of older patients who are recovering from a stroke.  Finally, we will disseminate results through a participatory workshop that includes key individuals from health and social care institutions in order to discuss and make recommendations regarding the potential strategies that can integrate elements of current health and social care systems to improve the care of older stroke patients.  This work will inform the development of a  larger proposal that can implement and evaluate one or more of the  strategies identified to support development of a stroke care system in China.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Integrated care for older patients is highly topical in a number of high-income countries, yet there has been little exploration of how experiences and models developed in these countries might apply to low- and middle-income countries like China, which are undergoing rapid demographic and epidemiological transitions.  In light of the urgency of developing models of care to respond to the growing burden of chronic disease, specifically stroke, in older adults in China, our objectives are:   1. To distil lessons learnt from the international literature on integrated stroke systems of care for older adults with a view to their relevance and applicability in the Chinese context 2. To document  experiences, patterns of care-seeking, and perceived needs of older adults in China with respect to chronic disease management, particularly CVD. 3. To model the dynamics of health and social care systems responses to stroke among older adults in China 4. To identify interventions that support an integrated stroke system of care at the community level</narrative>
