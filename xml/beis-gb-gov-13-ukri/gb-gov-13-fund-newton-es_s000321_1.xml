   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The containment of AMR is a multi-faceted task that needs a one-health approach as suggested in the World Health Organization&apos;s (WHO) 2015 Global Action Plan (GAP) on AMR. Countries including India have aligned their National Action Plans (NAPs) on AMR with this international guidance. One of the important links for various activities for AMR containment is the appropriate use of antibiotics to reduce selection pressure on microbes. According to the GAP, effective regulation will be a key tool for ensuring that national standards aimed at optimising the use of antimicrobial medicines in human and animal health are followed in practice. The academic literature suggests, however, that the Indian government faces a number of challenges in the regulatory sphere. Regulations may be fragmented or incomplete in relation to AMR-relevant sectors, Furthermore, empirical studies demonstrate that effective state-level regulation can be impeded by a range of systemic problems, including human resource constraints, ambivalence in the roles of regulatory organisations, ineffective co-ordination between regulatory groups and the contestation of regulatory policies by private stakeholders.  Fundamental questions therefore arise about whether a credible and enforceable AMR regulatory framework can be developed for India, and if so, how best to tackle this complex challenge. The core idea of this project is to apply the ideas and methods of &apos;smart regulation&apos; to better understand the underlying problems and co-produce innovative regulations with regulators and regulatory subjects that will likely lead to mutually acceptable regulations and improved compliance. Three central design principles of smart regulation include: a) the use of a range of &apos;softer&apos; regulatory options to shape behaviour in conjunction with &apos;traditional&apos; regulatory measures of fines and legal penalties; b) effective stakeholder engagement and input into regulation; and c) an emphasis on identifying win-win outcomes in regulation. We will implement the &apos;smart regulation&apos; approach through, inter alia, interactive workshops that bring regulators and other stakeholders in AMR-related sectors together to share perspectives and discuss viable regulatory options. We will focus on four particularly important sectors for AMR containment (antibiotic sales over-the counter at pharmacies, hospital AMR containment use of antibiotics in poultry farming and antibiotics in pharmaceutical industry effluent).   Our project has been designed to have significant impact on the Indian regulatory environment. By engaging with regulators and subjects of regulation in the two selected Indian states and in central government right from the start, the project will encourage &apos;buy-in&apos; and enable us to develop a rich understanding of the situated positions of the key actors in the field of AMR regulation in India. The regulatory options emerging from the collaborative spirit of the workshops will be acceptable to regulators and other stakeholders, and therefore likely to result in increased compliance. The project&apos;s key outputs will include a user-friendly guidance document to facilitate uptake of the &apos;smart regulation&apos; approach for AMR containment in other Indian states and also internationally. We will also co-design a &apos;Statement of Intent&apos; that we will encourage the regulators (and potentially other stakeholders) to adopt and sign.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="The overarching aims of this project are first, to better understand the various problems surrounding the regulation of AMR containment in India, and second, to improve the situation by applying the concept and methods of &apos;smart regulation&apos;. These broad aims will be achieved through a set of five more specific objectives:  1. We will contribute to policy and practice in the area of AMR regulation through a series of objectives designed to influence the regulatory environment. We will engage with regulators and stakeholders from the early stages of the project to encourage a sense of &apos;ownership&apos; and co-produce regulatory solutions tailored to the Indian context. Semi-structured interviews with key regulators and regulatory subjects will give us a deep understanding of their situated perspectives and interests (both financial and non-financial). The interactive workshops that follow (eight at the state level and one at the national level) will establish a safe and productive environment in which regulators and regulatory subjects can share their situated knowledge and together imagine new regulatory futures that would be mutually acceptable to both sides. By co-designing a &apos;Statement of Intent&apos; with regulators, we will synthesise different perspectives and define and agree a way forward for the four specific sectors. For the final project dissemination meeting, a user-friendly guidance document and animated video will be created to encourage uptake of &apos;smart regulation&apos; for addressing AMR in other Indian states as well internationally.   2. We will contribute to knowledge and understanding of &apos;smart regulation&apos; and its relevance to AMR containment through the publication of four articles in leading journals. These will be co-authored by the Indian and UK team members. Each article will focus in depth on the socio-economic context, regulatory frameworks and application of smart regulation in one of the four sectors studied (i.e. pharmacies, hospitals, poultry industry and the pharmaceutical industry). These articles will fill gaps in the current AMR literature by providing sector-focussed analysis of the regulations &apos;on the books&apos; in India and discussing issues surrounding enforcement. In terms of the theoretical and practical contribution, the articles will highlight how &apos;smart regulation&apos; can fundamentally change thinking about regulation and improve compliance. The four publications will likely be impactful and influential within the growing AMR literature, which to date has not engaged in a meaningful way with important questions surrounding regulation.    3. The project will enable the collection of a new and important body of information. The UK team will prepare a background document for the workshops containing a comprehensive list of Indian AMR policies and regulations within the four sectors, as well as a systematic review of global regulatory best practices and initiatives in AMR containment. The background document will be highly valuable to Indian regulators. It will be submitted for publication and made available on the project website. The list of stakeholder networks and the data from interviews with regulators and other stakeholders in the four sectors will also be significant resources in their own right. Excerpts can feed into later outputs including the journal articles, guidance document and final project report.   4. We will contribute to the development of the theory and methodology of &apos;smart regulation&apos; through its novel application to the AMR regulatory context in India. Reflections on the challenges in transposing smart regulation to this policy domain will be detailed in the journal articles and final project report.   5. By providing training and assisting in career development, we will nurture the next generation of researchers and policymakers working in the field of AMR containment in India and the UK. This is another important route for the project to make a long-term impact on the field."></capital-spend>
