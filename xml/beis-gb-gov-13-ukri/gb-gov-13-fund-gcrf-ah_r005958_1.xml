   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Philippines is a Lower Middle Income Country (LMIC) with a population of 100 million. The country&apos;s geography with many isolated rural areas, the poverty levels (25% live below the poverty line) and the weak infrastructure make equitable access to health care for the population a big challenge. Clinicians in the Philippines usually do not want to work as primary care doctors in rural areas. Only 10% of the country&apos;s clinicians work in these areas where more than half of the population lives. The shortage of primary care doctors in such regions is one of the most urgent challenges for public health in the Philippines. This is also the case in other LMICs as well as countries in the global north. Likewise in the UK there are many rural areas faced with a shortage of health professionals. Another change in the health landscape is that people around the world are living longer and the disease burden is being increasingly dominated by disability instead of people dying early. The main causes of death and disability have changed from communicable diseases in children to non-communicable diseases in adults (for instance, mental health, musculoskeletal diseases, strokes, diabetes). To address these problems in a cost and clinically effective way, strong evidence-based systems of primary care are essential to identify healthcare needs and to develop and implement strategies for addressing those needs.  It is precisely around those areas the partnership will work: equal distribution of health workers and efficient primary care for people with non-communicable diseases. SOLACE brings together researchers from different disciplines (medicine, arts and humanities) who are keen to work with colleagues who they would not normally work with. The partnership activities will allow these researchers from Keele University (UK) and Ateneo de Manila University (Philippines) to learn new research methods and to use original ways to bring the results to several stake holders: academics, governmental and community organisations and, most importantly, the people living in rural and remote areas.  We will establish two SOLACE health hubs in Northern Samar, a rural province in the Philippines. About 60 participants (patients, doctors, community workers and local politicians) will come together for a Cultural Animation workshop in these hubs. Over a period of 10 months all participants will create artistic, personal health diaries. They will also get together every month for a discussion group and will meet a SOLACE researcher on a regular basis who will carry out fieldwork in the participants&apos; home and work environments. The health diaries (in many formats: texts, songs, drawings, films, pictures), the discussion group and fieldwork data will be analysed by the Keele and Ateneo teams. The Keele team will visit Northern Samar for a fieldwork trip and the Ateneo team will travel to Keele for a research and capacity building week. Also two cultural exchange visits with Keele and Ateneo student pairs from medicine, arts and humanities will take place.   The SOLACE website will host a blog and podcasts, photo reportages, audiovisual documentaries and online educational resources will be regularly uploaded. There will be two public exhibitions, in Keele and Manila, showcasing fieldwork photos and artistic health diaries curated by the participants themselves. We will also hold two SOLACE health festivals in Northern Samar, bringing the results back to the local communities and demonstrating why active patient and public engagement is important in health research.  Our ambition is to lay the foundations for a &apos;SOLACE tradition&apos; in global public health which can be expanded to other LMICs. Interdisciplinary research carried out in this tradition will be characterised by sustained and genuine engagement with local communities, dissolving knowledge hierarchies, and co-producing innovative public health initiatives and clinical interventions.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="SOLACE aims to transcend disciplinary and academic boundaries working towards the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). The partnership activities specifically address SDG 3 (&apos;Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages&apos;) by tackling issues of recruitment, development, training and retention of health workers managing the growing burden of Non-Communicable Disease (NCD). The inclusion of a wide range of scholarly expertise extends SOLACE beyond the disciplinary boundaries of medicine and beyond the edges of academia by co-producing knowledge with community partners.   The three interlinked overall aims of SOLACE are:   a) to establish a sustainable, interdisciplinary, cross-cultural partnership which will identify specific public health challenges and solutions faced by those providing primary healthcare and those at the receiving end in rural, remote and underserved areas; b) to co-produce knowledge and raise awareness in multiple formats (artistic, educational, scientific) around the growing burden of common NCDs, specifically musculoskeletal disorders and mental health problems; c) to develop in collaboration with community stakeholders bottom-up, innovative clinical and educational interventions to improve the lives of those with common NCDs in rural areas  These overarching aims will be met through 12 objectives around three core areas: interdisciplinary research (1-5) / interdisciplinary education (6-8) / public engagement (9-12)  1. To co-produce and disseminate interdisciplinary knowledge about the role of primary care in NCDs, with specific focus on challenges and solutions around musculoskeletal disorders and mental health, in rural and remote areas 2. To co-produce and disseminate interdisciplinary knowledge about the working lives of health professionals in underserved and under resourced areas  3. To use scientific and creative outputs to change commonly held perceptions of working in rural and remote areas among future clinical, academic and creative workforces in the UK and the Philippines  4. To develop one innovative clinical intervention based on data generated by SOLACE 5. To foster, synergize and promote research with community stakeholders, via publications of high impact articles and future grant applications around NCDs and primary care 6. To provide cross-cultural learning experiences for arts, humanities and medical students in the Philippines and the UK 7. To develop an interdisciplinary global health learning toolkit for arts, humanities and medical students in higher education 8. To create a sustainable online platform comprising of artistic and educational resources for health and creative workforces internationally 9. To use arts-based methodologies to generate discussion among local communities, health professionals, politicians, policy makers and academics about human health resources in primary care  10. To hosts two public exhibitions, in Keele and Manila, showcasing the creative and co-produced data (pictures, audiovisual stories, artefacts, short films of performances, texts) curated by the participants in the two SOLACE health hubs 11. To disseminate findings, as these emerge, in an intensive social media campaign aimed at a wide range of stakeholders (#SOLACE) 12. To establish, in a culturally sensitive manner, Patient and Public Engagement and Information (PPIE) groups in the province of Northern Samar"></capital-spend>
