   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Healthy housing for the Displaced</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Our vision is to transform the lives of displaced people encamped in extreme conditions through an engineered solution to housing that promotes a new science of shelter design. The project will entail research in five of the world&apos;s largest refugee camps. Zaatari and Azraq (Jordan), Kilis (Turkey), Mae La (Thailand), Nyarugusu (Tanzania). These have populations of up to 250,000 and hence are in many ways cities. They have summer temperatures &gt;35degC and occasionally &gt;40degC; in these conditions un-insulated dwellings are unable to provide safe conditions. In addition, such locations can have 1600W/m2 of solar radiation, further raising the temperature inside a dwelling, and in the case of Jordan winter temperatures of -10degC. In Thailand the high humidity is likely to be of equal importance in placing thermal stress on occupants. In addition, displacement shelters can use polymeric materials which contain a high proportion of VOCs such as plasticisers and release agents, and have poorly ventilated cooking facilities using fuels such as wood, thereby generating particulates.   Camps were once expected to be a short term solution, and this is still true in some settings. However, as witnessed in numerous locations around the globe, encampment often continues for years or decades (for example, the 340,000 strong Dadaab camp in Kenya opened in 1992).  Even in natural disasters delays in rebuilding can lead to displacement camps taking on aspects of semi-permanent settlement. The challenges of survival in the immediate onset of an emergency quickly give way to concerns about the suitability of shelter over a longer timeframe. Such basic dwellings inhibit domestic life, educational delivery to the young, and development of the social relations needed for community cohesion. Often the need of traumatised people for a sense of security and privacy also goes unmet. Unfortunately, even the state of the art in current shelter provision does not adequately consider building physics, thermal comfort and air quality. There is also a general lack of attention to socio-cultural issues. Thus, for example, our pilot study in Jordan has revealed through social surveys a consistent concern amongst the displaced population with the issues of safety and privacy.   Given the diversity of potentially available building materials, climates and cultures, there will be no single shelter solution, but rather a need for a systematic process of design that is cognisant of the climate, landscape, culture, length of time the accommodation might be needed, flexibility as family size changes and portability. This project will develop such a design process by creating a new science of shelter design through engagement with aid agency staff in four countries with diverse weather, cultural conditions and political sensitivities. This will involve 1) wide scale social and indoor environment surveys in five camps; 2) the construction of a series of potential designs in the UK, in a climate chamber and in Jordan; and 3) the production of a multi-language, extreme climate building physics-based, culturally sensitive, shelter design tool for agency field staff.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Research Objectives: The project will lead to a transformative new science of shelter design based on multi-criteria optimisation that puts the social well being, health and thermal comfort of the shelter occupants at the center of the design process and allows an agile response. It uses the current shelter occupants as part of the research team, rather than just a cohort to study. Our research objectives (RO) are: RO1: Complete the largest ever uniform linked thermal, air quality, and social environment study in camps around the world. Collect the views of camp occupants and aid agencies on possible shelter improvements and limitations. (These will form the seed points in the multi-objective process.) RO2: Create an optimisation process that will seek to improve living conditions, reducing mortality and morbidity in displacement camps through the creation of low-cost, easy to construct housing that moderates extremes of temperature while providing the space required for dignified living and customary domestic and intra-community relations. RO3: Prototype, measure, and develop shelter solutions using novel combinations of conventional and non-conventional materials appropriate for a range of climatic, social, political, and economic conditions. RO4: Create a methodology for the progressive creation of new designs as technologies change, new disasters occur and further data is collected by all actors in the sector, including supporting software. RO5: Develop a two-way process of design exchange suitable for working with displaced people who may have suffered personal and societal breakdown.  Output Objectives: 1. First in class survey of this depth completed covering temperatures, social attitude, air quality and lighting in refugee camps.  2. International Repository of Shelter Data created for all those in the field to deposit their raw and processed data, time series etc., both new and historic. 3. Comfort theory expanded into a new, and until now understudied, population. 4. Validated thermal, air quality, and lighting models of common shelter types. Science of shelter design initiated.  5. Twenty possible shelter designs created, all developed to construction detail. All developed with input from aid agencies and refugees  6. Six designs constructed in UK to test construction times; then in climate chamber to validate modelling; then on site in Jordan. 7. Validated, easy to use shelter design tool, tested in use, distributed worldwide.  8. Finalisation of a new transformative approach to transitional shelter design based on robust thermal and social measurement, computer modelling, input from camp occupants, test data from our climate chamber, and test construction trials all of which will be subsequently monitored and measured by testing in real camps.</narrative>
