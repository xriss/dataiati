  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">PSYMAP-ZN is a collaborative 3-year study of psychotic illness in South Africa between the University of KwaZulu-Natal and the University of Exeter. Building on a very successful pilot study in the same region, we aim to produce new evidence that will help to answer some of the following questions:  - How common is psychosis in this population? - What individual factors, and especially what socioeconomic and environmental factors, increase a person&apos;s risk for psychosis in this context? - How do these individual and environmental risk factors impact the illness itself? - How do people with psychosis and their families and caregivers seek help in this community and what role do informal providers such as traditional health practitioners play in this pathway to care?   Importantly, we are asking these questions because there is very little research evidence on psychosis from low- and middle-income countries, especially within Sub-Saharan Africa. Also, we know that formal health and mental health services for people with severe mental disorders such as psychosis are generally inadequate and often inaccessible within this under-resourced region. We also know that people with psychotic symptoms living in especially rural and remote areas, where mental health expertise is often unavailable, very often consult traditional health practitioners seeking help and care. Long delays in accessing appropriate and effective care are detrimental to psychotic illness and are associated with more severe symptoms, more difficult recovery, greater frequency of relapses, and poorer long-term social and occupational outcomes. We will use a multi-disciplinary approach that includes expertise from disciplines of mental health and psychiatry, public health, health geography (and the use of geographical information systems), anthropology and cultural studies; and will work together with service users, caregivers and important community stakeholders such as traditional health practitioners. Our findings will broaden our understanding of: the frequency of and risk factors for this severe form of mental illness; how the environment impacts the illness; and how sufferers and their caregivers seek help. Understanding these key issues will provide a good basis for designing appropriate services and treatments to meet the needs of patients and carers. Some of the benefits we envisage include:  - Enabling service providers, planners and policy makers to quantify the extent of psychotic illness in this population and plan sufficient services to meet the need - Providing a better understanding of individual, socioeconomic and environmental factors that increase risk for psychosis and impact negatively on the illness itself, so that appropriate prevention, screening and early detection and treatment programmes can be planned - Improving knowledge about people&apos;s beliefs, preferences and behaviours in seeking help for their symptoms of illness; and working out how formal health services can best work together with community providers such as traditional health practitioners to improve access to early and effective care.  South Africa is a middle-income country with multiple social, economic and developmental needs. Mental health services for people with severe mental illnesses such as psychosis are inadequate and often inaccessible. Delays in accessing treatments (or not receiving treatment at all) result in increased severity and disability due to the illness. This prevents patients from being economically active, places significant burden on their families and caregivers who often cannot work either due to this burden, and adds considerably to health and social care costs. By addressing the important issues we have outlined above, PSYMAP-ZN will produce important information that can be used to improve the lives of suffers and their families and to reduce the human, social and economic burden associated with psychotic disorders.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The overarching aim of PSYchosis MAPping in kwaZulu-Natal (PSYMAP-ZN) is to generate evidence that will improve our understanding of psychosis within a Sub-Saharan setting.   The main objectives are:  1. To determine the incidence rate of psychosis and the associated incidence risk factors in the Msunduzi Municipality, KwaZulu-Natal, through active case-finding with formal and informal providers of care.  2. To investigate the clinical presentation of psychosis and associated risk factors in this context, including the role of HIV, poverty and violence. Utilization of a novel virtual reality methodology to improve diagnosis and understanding of risk factors in this population will also be used.  3. To determine the impact of the social, economic and physical environment on, risk for and presentation of, psychosis in this context. Innovative spatial epidemiological methods will be used.  4. To investigate the help-seeking behaviours and pathways to care of people with psychosis and their families/caregivers. Qualitative, quantitative and spatial/GIS approaches will be used.</narrative>
