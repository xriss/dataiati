   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Waterproofing Data: engaging stakeholders in the sustainable governance of flood risks for urban resilience</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project focuses on the social and cultural aspects of water-related risks, with a specific emphasis on data practices. Data form a core component of our capacity to identify, monitor, respond to and assess natural hazards and are therefore central to most flood resilience initiatives. Data also flows, through sensors, cables, information systems and screen displays, forging relations between humans and environmental phenomena, and between different groups of stakeholders. In other words, although data are not commonly featured as the object of social and cultural research, they are nonetheless central to how social and natural entities are woven together into specific configurations. Our approach involves rethinking this role of data as a sociotechnical actor. Rethinking how flood-related data is produced and how it flows will enable transformations to build sustainable, flood resilient communities.  In order to achieve this, Waterproofing Data has the following objectives: 1. Make visible the way citizens, local government authorities, and other agencies involved in the management of water-related risks engage with data on flooding. 2. Engage citizens to produce, circulate and embed data, which incorporates and builds upon pre-existing flood memories and local knowledge of flood risk, to increase community resilience. 3. Integrate citizen-generated data with other data sources, such as environmental sensors, socio-demographics and risk mapping, in ways that support decision-making and policy-making on flooding.  Each objective will be addressed through the development of innovative methods:   Using research techniques drawn from the social sciences, we begin by making existing data practices visible through the creation of data diaries to document and analyse the specific flows and contextual uses of data across different sites. Drawing from humanities approaches which stress the importance of local and embedded knowledge of flood memories, we will engage citizens through a flood memory app, online repository, educational programme, and data-driven environmental installations. Citizen-generated data will be integrated with existing sources of flood-related data through the development of three data visualisation interfaces, each tailored to the distinct user needs of the main project stakeholders. To do this, we will rely on methods drawn from the computational social sciences. Waterproofing Data will therefore not only study data as a social actor, but use this quality of data as the basis for a series of transformative interventions. Through making data practices more visible; widening participation in data generation; diversifying what counts as data; increasing data literacy; and altering how data flows, what it &quot;joins up&quot; and how it is communicated, Waterproofing Data will improve the resilience of flood-vulnerable communities and increase the capacity for local government and disaster monitoring centres to know and respond to flood events. Conversely, by making data the means by which we weave a flood resilience network together we will improve the sustainability of flood-related data (by strengthening the networks that produce and receive it). This will be achieved, for example, by &quot;embedding&quot; data into local narratives and material contexts which do not necessarily rely on digital infrastructures.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Waterproofing Data investigates the governance of water-related risks, with a focus on social and cultural aspects of data practices. Typically, data flows up from local levels to scientific &quot;centres of expertise&quot;, and then flood-related alerts and interventions flow back down through local governments and into communities. Rethinking how flood-related data is produced, and how it flows, can help build sustainable, flood resilient communities.   To this end, this project develops three innovative methods around data practices, across different sites and scales: 1) we will make visible existing flows of flood-related data through tracing data; 2) generate new types of data at the local level by engaging citizens through the creation of multi-modal interfaces, which sense, collect and communicate flood data, and; 3) integrate citizen-generated data with other data using geo-computational techniques. These methodological interventions will transform how flood-related data is produced and flows, creating new governance arrangements between citizens, governments and flood experts and, ultimately, increased community resilience related to floods in vulnerable communities of Sao Paulo and Acre, Brazil.  The project will be conducted by a highly skilled international team of researchers with multiple disciplinary backgrounds from Brazil, Germany and the UK, in close partnership with researchers, stakeholders and publics of a multi-site case study on flood risk management in Brazil. Furthermore, the methods and results of this case study will be the basis for a transcultural dialogue with government organisations and local administration involved in flood risk management in Germany and the United Kingdom.</narrative>
