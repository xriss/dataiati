  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Orthotic products are of great importance to a number of people around the world. The process of fabricating orthoses is well established, but depends on a time and resource consuming plaster cast method developed over 100 years ago. This is associated to a number of reasons e.g. the fact that an Orthotist has to shape the patient&apos;s body to define the shape of an orthosis. In particular in the case of children or patients with joint contractures and anatomical deformities, such as those affected with neurological and neuromuscular medical conditions, such as Cerebral Palsy. This issue prevents the efficient application of MRI, CT or optical imaging techniques, because these require extensive post-processing to discriminate between the patient&apos;s body and the Orthotist&apos;s hands. Additionally, such imaging equipment is expensive and requires a highly technicians. Hence, providing orthoses is only possible if, hospitals, expensive medical scanners, consumables, and workshops are accessible. This is not the case in developing countries, consequently orthoses in LMICs are often fabricated form scrap such as old water canisters.  Recently, the development of flexible, soft electronics, as well as the spread of wearable electronic devices has made significant progress. Here we want to develop a smart, portable and stretchable textile sleeve with integrated sensors connected to a smartphone to realize an entirely new, versatile, and wearable body shape imaging technique. The digital limb models by our system can then be used for the computer aided fabrication of customized orthotics, without the need for significant infrastructure. Our smart textile will contain an active array of stretchable strain sensors to measure the deformation of the textile itself. The knowledge of the strain distribution inside the tight fitting stretchable textile when worn over a limb or body part will be used to determine the exact three-dimensional shape of the limb. Any external influence such as the force applied by the Orthotist will also be quantified, but will not interfere with the shape measurement. The development and fabrication of biocompatible, polymer based strain gauges able to measure strain of &gt;200% will be done in the semiconductor manufacturing cleanroom at the University of Sussex. This cleanroom is optimized for the fabrication of flexible electronic thin-film devices on plastic substrates. The sensors will then be unobtrusively integrated into an elastane fabric using embroidery, and interconnected using conductive yarns. We will evaluate the required sensor density to achieve a measurement resolution sufficient for the fabrication of orthotic products. In a next step, the acquired sensor data will be proceed on a smartphone to automatically generate a three-dimensional model of the imaged body part. Hence no professionals, additional infrastructure or consumables are needed to support the Orthotist in treating the patients. The generated digital model can then be electronically sent to a manufacturer or used to produce the orthosis in a mobile 3D printer, whereas printing of a mould for the conventional fabrication of orthoses, and direct printing of an orthosis will be evaluated. John Florence Ltd. will be responsible for the fabrication of the Orthotic products and the evaluation of their quality.  To assess the technology as a whole, and to define workflows for the fabrication of orthotic products in rural areas in developing countries, the Kenya Medical Training College and the Ability Therapy Place will support us evaluate the developed wearable in Kenya. The shape and force sensing technology developed here will not only revolutionise the fabrication of orthoses, but also influence the development of other medical products such as prostheses, monitoring of diseases related to the shape, size or deformation of the skeletal system or soft tissue, and even the realization of artificial sensor skins for interactive soft robots</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project aims for the development of a smart electronic and stretchable sensor sleeve able to quantitatively measure the body shape of patients without the need for expensive MRI, or CT, scanners. The acquired data will be processed to enable the computer aided manufacturing of orthotic products avoiding labour, time and resource consuming plaster of Paris mould approaches.  The smart sleeve will be tight fitting and unobtrusively worn over a limb or body part while a trained medical professional would then manipulate the limb into the corrected position using his hands (this manipulation method is established, reliable, and does not rely on subsequent digital image manipulation to define the final limb position). Consequently, no plaster moulds, or digital limb manipulation software is required. The smart sleeve should acquire a scan virtually instantaneously (&lt;5 s), hence there is no need to hold a potentially painful position over a long time which makes the proposed method in particularly interesting for children. Furthermore the sensor sleeve will be able to measure the pressure, applied by the medical professional. The smart sleeve will be developed and fabricated by the Sensor Technology Research Centre at the University of Sussex. John Florence Ltd. is responsible for the fabrication of orthotic products. The application of the developed sleeve will be investigated, and optimized in collaboration with the Kenya Medical Training College in Kenya.  The main objectives are: To fabricate flexible highly stretchable (&gt; 200%) liquid metal based sensors and InGaZnO thin-film transistors for the measurement of strain. The sensors will be soft, biocompatible and fabricated on large scale elastomer substrates. The different operation modes, sensitivity, and deformability of the sensors will be evaluated and optimized.  To interconnect sensors and oxide based transistors to form a two dimensional active sensor array to map all components of the in-plain strain. Efficient control and conditioning of the array will be done using a customized bare die CMOS multiplexer unobtrusively integrated into the stretchable textile. The multiplexer in conjunction with a specifically developed battery powered and Bluetooth enabled microcomputer will transmit the sensor data to a smartphone for further processing.   To integrate the sensors into a stretchable textile sleeve using embroidery. The sleeve can be worn over a limb or body part and has to adopt to the underlying body shape. Due to the stretchability a large variety of different body shapes and sizes can be covered with one sleeve. Sleeves with different initial diameters can be fabricated to account for different sized young and adult patients, or lower and upper limbs. By measuring the deformation of the textile it will be able to determine its own shape, and hence the shape of the covered limp.  To process the collected data and to generate a three-dimensional digital model of the measured body part using a spring-force model or a global constraint optimisation algorithm. The data has to be visualized in a, for medical personnel, intuitive way. Additionally the out-off-plain strain distribution should (by adding additional flexible pressure sensors to the sensor array) be mapped.  A digital 3D limb model compatible with computer aided manufacturing tools have to be exported. The fabrication of orthotics using the digital model to print a mould for the convention fabrication of an orthosis and direct printing of orthotics has to be evaluated in collaboration with John Florence Ltd.  To evaluate the technology with the Kenya Medical Training College. To demonstrate the operation of the developed textile body shape sensor in an environment with less developed infrastructure. To optimize the performance of the sensor textile, and to evaluate alternative application scenarios such as artificial limbs, monitoring of athletes, or the fabrication of customized clothes.</narrative>
