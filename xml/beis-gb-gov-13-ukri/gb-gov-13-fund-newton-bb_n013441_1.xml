   <narrative xml:lang="EN">CINTRIN has six key objectives divided between six interconnected and collaborative Work Packages (WP). These primary objectives map onto a established, signed agreement between the University of Cambridge and the Government of India Minister for Science. The Objectives are:   WP1 To conduct interdisciplinary research to prime the translation of biological N use. This WP will lead to greater understanding of the underpinning science in developmental N use. It will focus on the genetic regulation of biological N use in model-based systems to prime translation to key crops (wheat, sorghum, pearl and foxtail millet). It will support research on biological N use in model plants (Arabidopsis, Brachypodium) relevant to cereal crop breeding. It will exploit available genome sequencing resources and world-leading expertise in bioinformatics to identify gene networks in models and candidates in wheat, sorghum and pearl millet.   WP2 To define optimal N use by key cereal germplasm for UK and India Natural variation for N partitioning for growth in Brachypodium, wheat, pearl millet and sorghum will be explored using germplasm resources including complementary UK (NIAB) and Indian (PAU) synthetic hexaploid wheats and panels of donor material. Variation for physiological N uptake and use including allocation to grain will be determined using high throughput 13N and 15N partitioning experiments to identify parallels with the developmental ideotypes decribed in WP1.    WP3 To translate N germplasm and knowledge for pre-breeding This WP will prime the translation of variation in biological (WP1) and physiological (WP2) N use knowledge from models to crops via genomics-led pre-breeding. New germplasm and genomic tools will be developed and/or used for uptake into pre-breeding, breeding and production. Validation of key gene candidates from WP1 will be explored using transgenic and gene-editing (CRISPR/Cas9) approaches and  new genomics resources (e.g. TILLING populations).    WP4 To validate outcomes for field-based N use Field scale evaluation of optimal N allocation in novel germplasm and identification of high yield low optimum (HYLO) lines. Pre-breeding germplasm developed/identified in WP2/WP3 will be trialled with contrasting N inputs in field experiments in the UK and India to validate N use type. This will extend knowledge of biological N use to field response, and provide the basis for advice to farmers and plant breeders in the wider CINTRIN network.  WP5 To develop and deliver resources for breeders and farmers - moving to the farmers field KisanHub (SME based in Cambridge and India), in partnership with NIAB, have created a new service for UK farmers allowing them to make informed decisions on their operations. This partnership will create an accessible platform for N use data which will be available to UK and Indian farmers.   WP6 To build and expand the CINTRIN network  CINTRIN will actively engage in training, collaboration and development. This will be achieved via frequent exchanges between partners, and focussed CINTRIN workshops. CINTRIN will also develop a map of the N knowledge base to identify targets for new participants to join the wider network. It will also identify new areas of N research to develop, as well as new sources of funding to expand the network.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Optimising biological nitrogen (N) use is pivotal to maximizing crop yields and ameliorating the adverse environmental impacts of excess agricultural N application. New opportunity exists to provide solutions to cereal crop N use via the translation of basic research into application. The Cambridge-India Network for Translational Research in N (CINTRIN) will establish a complete but flexible pipeline connecting developmental research, crop breeding, agritechnology and extension. The framework of CINTRIN will be provided by the University of Cambridge, NIAB and ADAS, together with ICRISAT, Punjab Agricultural University, NIPGR and the technology companies KisanHub (SME) and BenchBio (SME). The framework partners are widely connected, opening many opportunitites to expand and extend the VJC in future.  CINTRIN will provide innovative approaches to tackle crop biological N use. Firstly, it will promote a new understanding of the underpinning science associated with optimization of crop N use, built on an exciting new discovery of distinct life history strategies for N use in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. This work has identified N sensitive (NS) and N insensitive (NIS) types which vary fundamentally in their developmental response to N.  This work indicates that the ability to protect seed yield under low N supply appears to come at the expense of the ability to exploit high N supply effectively. This model for developmental N use has the potential to revolutionise the way we think about the N requirements and uses of crops.   Within CINTRIN, a translational pipeline will couple the molecular basis of plant development to the physiology of N uptake and partitioning. Through advanced genomics and pre-breeding, new N ideotypes will be defined in crops important for the UK (wheat) and India (wheat, sorghum, pearl and foxtail millet). Field observations and data- driven methods of technology transfer will allow dissemination of the results and ultimately advice on cultivar-specific fertiliser N application to be offered directly to farmers. Secondly, the exchanges in personnel between India and the UK via CINTRIN will enhance the skills of the next generation of plant technologists and provide an exemplar for building capacity in fundamental plant sciences and translation into germplasm and agronomic outputs in both the UK and India. Thirdly, CINTRIN will build on the enterprise and spin-out capacity associated with existing Cambridge and India SME alliances, whereby knowledge can be harnessed by industry to develop wealth and employment in the agri-tech sector.   Overall, the vision for CINTRIN is that networks of applied expertise will feed-forward from advances in developmental biology, through to genomics-led pre-breeding of cereal crop staples with optimal biological N use.  The JVC will assimilate feedback from CINTRIN translational and outreach activities which relate to sustainable intensification and yield resilience, particularly via farmer networks in the UK and India. In the UK this will be linked to the Defra Sustainable Intensification Platform (SIP; NIAB leads Project 1, investigating Integrated Farm Management for improved economic, environmental and social performance with a group of 30 partners spanning universities, research institutes, farming industry and environmental organisations).   CINTRIN will deliver a translational pipeline to produce new ideotypes for optimized N use in agriculture. It will provide training in developmental research, and new knowledge relevant to underpinning optimal biological N use for sustainable intensification. It will promote excellence in science in both the UK and India and provide innovation for application in commercial farming activities.</narrative>
