  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The overarching aim of our project is to enhance pastoral resilience &amp; through this to facilitate realisation of economic &amp; other development goals &amp; policies in our case study countries, Kenya &amp; Mongolia, wherein pastoralism remains a significant livelihood strategy. In our project we speak particularly to the following GCRF Building Resilience Call themes: i) underlying drivers of disaster risk; ii) communication; iii) governance; iv) cultural implications in building resilience; v) improving effectiveness of research engagement &amp; uptake, with particular emphasis on ii), iv) &amp; v).  Thus in ODA terms we will directly contribute to addressing poverty &amp; development challenges &amp; goals in case study countries. We will do this within the context of building resilience through make important contributions to understanding user needs; &amp; through trialling, developing &amp; evaluating new data products with users, thus enhancing knowledge translation, research uptake &amp; impact in the future. To do this we ask: i. What are diverse stakeholder/ cultural meanings of environmental change &amp; resilience? ii. What information requirements do pastoralist communities have in relation to environmental risk that are appropriate to their livelihoods &amp; would help them build (locally meaningful &amp; culturally appropriate &amp; desirable forms of) resilience to both short &amp; longer term shocks? iii. To what extent have previous projects/ donor initiatives delivered these &amp; been taken up pastoralists &amp; policy makers? iv. How can new datasets &amp; innovative methods &amp; approaches be used to develop richer understandings of pastoral resilience, facilitate uptake &amp; ultimately support pastoral resilience &amp; policymaking in the future?  v. How can these lessons be scaled up nationally &amp; through organisations such as WISP/ taking into account both different cultural scenarios &amp; different types of pastoral environments? Our specific objectives, linked to the above research questions are:  i) to provide new understandings of pastoral resilience from genuinely interdisciplinary &amp; local/indigenous perspectives;  ii) through attention to cultural meanings &amp; contexts of resilience, histories &amp; understandings of human-nature relationships, &amp; innovative methods, integrated with new remote sensing datasets, to enhance understanding of barriers to &amp; thus to enhance uptake of research data in the future, supporting positive/locally desirable dimensions of resilience; iii) to examine &amp; test ways to enhance relevance of datasets &amp; outputs to pastoralists &amp; policy-makers, including through examination of newly available remote sensing datasets; iv) to derive comparative insights into pastoral resilience across diverse countries &amp; pastoral systems;  These interlinked objectives are listed in terms of priority. We will realise these objectives through engagement with diverse stakeholders through four interlinked work packages, comprising WP1: Development of draft &apos;pastoral resilience&apos; framework &amp; sample datasets; WP2: Evaluation of framework &amp; stakeholder engagement; WP3: Fieldwork with i) local pastoralist groups &amp; ii) policymakers in which we will explore (barriers to) uptake of previous project outputs; use innovative methodologies to explore cultural dimensions &amp; meanings of resilience &amp; implications for policy; &amp; assess the ways in which new datasets can best facilitate resilience building &amp; be translated through &amp; combined with cultural norms, knowledges &amp; understandings; WP4: Analysis &amp; testing of emergent ideas &amp; results; generation of outputs.  The expected outcomes of the study will be i) enhanced understanding of the problem in terms of existing work on pastoral resilience (research &amp; knowledge translation gaps); ii) development of new interdisciplinary approaches &amp; knowledge products to address i); iii) development of a new interdisciplinary research network to undertake further work in the future.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project focuses on the challenges of building resilience in pastoralist communities, with reference to case study countries of Kenya &amp; Mongolia, &amp; to other countries in the Global South, through global pastoralist networks. Through integrating newly available remote sensing (RS) datasets, with innovative approaches &amp; methodologies for understanding cultural dimensions, meanings &amp; practices of resilience &amp; evaluating barriers to research uptake &amp; data needs of both pastoralist &amp; policy communities, we will lay the foundations for real transformations in pastoral resilience. This is vital not only for pastoralist communities&apos; livelihoods, but for realisation of current national economic development plans &amp; aspirations. In order to realise our project&apos;s goals we bring together an interdisciplinary team which combines expertise in remote sensing techniques; rangeland management; socio-economics &amp; governance of pastoralism; assessment of risk &amp; hazard; human-environment relations in rangelands; &amp; cultural geographies &amp; anthropologies of pastoralism.  The wider context for this work is the importance of pastoralism as a central livelihood strategy for some 500 million people worldwide, typically in marginal dryland environments highly susceptible to climate change &amp; who often number amongst the most vulnerable communities. Enhanced understandings of pastoral livelihoods &amp; resilience are also central to contemporary global development priorities, as emphasised by UNEA (2016) resolution on sustainable pastoralism &amp; by donors&apos; positioning of contemporary pastoralism as essential to achievement of Africa 2063 as well as UN 2030 Development Agendas (FAO, 2016).  Specific challenges &amp; issues include the lack of attention to culturally specific meanings, practices &amp; priorities around pastoral resilience, &amp; the linked challenge of a lack of engagement &amp; uptake of previous research &amp; datasets by pastoralist communities &amp; policy-makers. There are thus marked challenges in knowledge exchange, communication &amp; translation, which hinder local development of culturally meaningful &amp; effective resilience &amp; policy support for this. There is also a lack of understanding of why this is the case, in other words of what stakeholders want that is not being delivered, &amp; how can this be addressed. Our objectives are thus i) to provide new understandings of pastoral resilience from genuinely interdisciplinary &amp; local/indigenous perspectives; ii) to derive comparative insights into pastoral resilience across diverse countries &amp; pastoral systems; iii) to examine &amp; test ways to enhance relevance &amp; uptake of datasets &amp; outputs, including through examination of newly available remote sensing datasets &amp; iv) through attention to cultural meanings &amp; contexts of resilience, histories &amp; understandings of human-nature relationships, &amp; innovative methods, integrated with new RS datasets, to enhance understanding of barriers to &amp; thus to enhance uptake of research data in the future, supporting positive/locally desirable dimensions of resilience. Through realisation of these objectives, our work will benefit local pastoralist communities, through enhanced understanding &amp; provision of data &amp; knowledge exchange to support resilience. For policymakers, donors &amp; NGOs our work will provide clear guidance on the information needs &amp; requirements of pastoral communities, barriers to uptake of research outputs &amp; how these can be overcome; policymakers will also benefit from working with the project team on application of results to specific development policies &amp; agendas pertinent to enhanced pastoral livelihoods in the future. For all beneficiaries, but especially academics, donors &amp; NGOs implementing work on pastoral resilience, they will benefit from the new methods &amp; interdisciplinary approaches trialled &amp; developed during this project. The project will also make important contributions to ongoing debates across the natural &amp; social sciences, arts &amp; humanities.</narrative>
