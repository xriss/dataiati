   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Pneumonia, malaria and diarrhoea are major causes of death in African children under 5 years of age, yet if diagnosis and treatment are available the majority of these deaths can be prevented.  Children with these diseases should be seen and treated within 24 hours of becoming ill but affordable diagnosis and treatment are often not available close to home. Patients who do seek help often do so from retailers who sell medicines but do not provide diagnosis. In these situations, many children with serious diseases either receive the wrong treatment or the severity of their illness goes unrecognised. A simple solution, called integrated Community Case Management (iCCM), has shown encouraging results in improving diagnosis and treatment of these diseases when it is used by community health workers (volunteers who provide health services) in rural areas.  The iCCM strategy has not been tested in urban areas, but this is increasingly important because the population of African cities is expanding. Generally, this urban expansion is unplanned so living conditions and sanitation are poor, placing children at increased risk of disease. Providing better services through retail outlets is one possible way to ensure access to affordable basic health services. However, this is subject to some debate on whether retailers can provide health services of acceptable quality and price.   We plan to conduct a study in order to develop a community-based mechanism to deliver iCCM services that is suitable for urban areas. The study will be conducted in unplanned urban areas surrounding the Ugandan city of Kampala This site was chosen because it has many features of rapidly expanding cities: low socioeconomic status, unplanned housing, poor sanitation, poor provision of clean water and limited access to health services.   During the study, we shall consult with local stakeholders (local communities, drug shop vendors, health staff and national authorities) to explore which of two alternative strategies to improve access to health care in urban areas would be most feasible and acceptable to the local population and national health authorities. In these two strategies, either community health worker volunteers (CHWs) or drug shop vendors would be trained by the Ministry of Health to diagnose and treat three key childhood diseases: pneumonia, malaria and diarrhoea, and to refer patients with severe or unknown illness to local health centres. A key aim of the study is to identify the most suitable way to supervise and support community volunteers and drug shop vendors, how to integrate them into the local health system, and how to assure the quality of the services they provide.   We shall also conduct a small pilot study in 10 drug shops to measure the accuracy of diagnosis and quality of service provided after training. Drug shop vendors will be asked to record details of patients they see, including the symptoms, diagnosis and what actions were taken. This will be backed up by other methods of assessment by health professionals to assess whether the drug vendor used the iCCM guidelines and prescribed drugs correctly. The research team will also observe what happens when a sick child is treated in a drug shop, and carry out interviews to learn what providers, patients and local leaders thought of the treatments received in trained drug shops, and to explore the benefits and costs of the new approach to patients and drug shop vendors. We shall also measure how much it costs the Ministry of Health to support this approach.   The data collected will be used to inform the development of a new intervention strategy to improve access to treatment for children living in unplanned urban areas, which will be tested in future studies.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="African cities are expanding with large increases in population often in unplanned settlements. This trend is set to continue. In this setting, there is little evidence to support best practice for delivering health care and improving access to treatment for three childhood diseases of high morbidity and mortality: malaria, pneumonia and diarrhoea.   Aim: To develop a health systems strategy and community-based mechanism to deliver integrated Community Case Management (iCCM) services to increase access to prompt effective treatment for acute childhood infections in peri-urban areas.   Objectives: i.  To investigate the feasibility of two alternative community-based mechanisms (community health workers or licensed private sector drug retail outlets) to deliver iCCM services in peri-urban areas   ii.  To develop mechanisms for governance, quality assurance of services, regulation, linkage with public health system (supervision, referral, health management information system) and financial sustainability, that are acceptable to treatment providers, patients, local and national authorities and regulators  iii.  To explore the acceptability and perceptions of a private sector delivery strategy amongst providers, users, national authorities and policy makers  iv.  To assess quality of iCCM services provided by trained drug retailers through a small pilot study, with a focus on accuracy of diagnosis and adherence to treatment guidelines  This will provide evidence in three main areas:  1) Integrated Community Case Management (iCCM): iCCM is a newly improved clinical algorithm designed for use at community level to address the joint burden of pneumonia, diarrhoea, malaria and malnutrition in children. It has been tested and accepted for use in rural settings, and is being increasingly encouraged as policy at national level in Africa. Despite the potential gains inherent in the approach, iCCM cannot be scaled up successfully unless supported by sound and rigorous research to guide implementation. The international CCM Taskforce has identified a number of critical questions that remain to be addressed (see Hamer et al, 2012), including: - identification of effective mechanisms to achieve adequate coverage - how to effectively engage with the private sector to expand delivery of iCCM - how to scale up the approach whilst ensuring quality of care and patient outcomes The proposed research will generate evidence in all the areas listed above, drawing insights from a range of disciplinary perspectives, including social science, health systems, economics and clinical medicine.   2) Private sector: Although a major provider of healthcare in urban settings, the private sector often provides inadequate care. It is a diverse sector ranging from unlicensed drug peddlers to authorised clinics and hospitals. In Uganda, a large proportion of patients seek care from licensed drug shops, with fever, respiratory symptoms and diarrhoea the major reasons for visits in children. However, only 10% of children attending drug shops receive appropriate treatment within 24 hours. Inappropriate and inadequate treatment in the private sector represents a lost opportunity, and highlights the potential for major impact if it were possible to successfully implement iCCM in drug shops.  3) Quality of service provision: The study will also focus on quality of service provision, particularly examining accuracy of diagnosis and adherence to treatment guidelines. Combining ethnographic, economic, and clinical findings will generate improved understanding of factors and processes that shape treatment practices and quality of care. Given supportive training and job aids, our research group has previously shown that licensed drug shops can perform diagnostic testing and make appropriate treatment decisions for malaria. Whether this can be extended to the more complex algorithm of iCCM is less certain, and is one purpose of the proposed study."></capital-spend>
