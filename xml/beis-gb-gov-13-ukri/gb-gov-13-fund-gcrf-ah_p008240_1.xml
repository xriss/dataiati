   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Revolt in the &apos;Square&apos;: Spatial Modelling of Urban Stability in Modern Cities New insights and approaches for preventing conflict and violence</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Revolt, demonstration and protest in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) has led to unprecedented political and socio-economic crisis in the region leading to state failure and grave humanitarian consequences. Since the Arab Spring an economic and development downturn in many states has cost over &#xA3;550 billion and weakened stability. The MENA area accounted for 50% of global fatalities in 2015 and the majority of 46 million displaced citizens. Many key socio-economic and political indicators that gave rise to widespread protest in public &apos;Squares&apos; which remain unresolved and exacerbated. This project seeks to address one dimension of the policy challenge that exists at national levels in MENA states by employing a multi-disciplinary methodology to engage in Spatial Modelling of Urban Stability to gain critical insights of the disturbing impact of conflict and violence and opening proper communication channels and dialogs with NGOs, community-based organisations and policymakers.   This project develops an evidence-based visual platform, comprising mapping of urban unrest that elucidates characteristics and patterns of urban change and stability using data-integrated systems, calibrated to a pre-defined 10-point scale based on detailed analysis of patterns of protesting in Beirut, the pilot study. We propose five emerging indicators: 1) Social Justice and Economic Stability (SJES); 2) Liberal culture and Freedom of Speech (LCFS); 3) Popular Art Performance of Dissidence (PAPD); 4) Spatial Action &amp; Protest (SAP); and 5) Political Response and Adjustment (PRA). The project will develop a series of collaborative events, activities and fact-finding research into mapping and digitising patterns of urban unrest whereas the indicators primarily integrate several sets of data and measures that interrogate the state of stability. The project also envisages building a beneficiary consortium, in a novel manner, between specialist researchers and entrepreneurs from Politics, Architecture, Virtual Modelling, Data-Mining, and Visualization to generate innovative and interactive spatial mapping of protests in Beirut. We anticipate that the spatial modeling could become a credible reference to understand future state of unrest by using pattern recognition techniques which could be applied at early stages. The main aims are:  1. Building a multi-disciplinary partnership and database of expertise and projects in the field of Politics, Architecture and Spatial Modelling. The projects will identify factors that contribute to effective use and occupation of the Martyr Square in Beirut and in facilitating spatial actions of dissidence that defy state authority and control.   2. Establishing methodologies that offer inventive opportunities for visualising spatial dissidence within urban environments. This objective underlines the interdisciplinary nature of methods of documentation and gathering evidence on the physical and virtual landscape of unrest and development of Spatial Action and Protests over a specific time span preceding an event of unrest in Beirut. This would involve reconstruction of the events leading to unrest, its spatial narratives, frequency and nature of events of aggression, and associated socio-political and economic conditions etc.  3. To develop appropriate innovative platforms of Spatial modelling of urban stability and acts of dissidence in the public space in light of the political and security instability in the region. There is need for engagement with policy makers on national and international levels to invest in areas of understanding and learning from past practices of unrest and generating new interactive visual interfaces that would display models of urban unrest and vulnerability to a state of revolution and political change. Our Advise Note to policymakers will show how we could detect progression to unrest and recommendations for conflict prevention which is core to economic development and welfare.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Urban revolutions have been envisaged as hybrid, unpredictable and somewhat incidental in the political arena. In some cases, political instability, mass protests, riots, revolt erupts as a reaction to a particular event, while in others it gathers momentum over a period of time and following a sequence of progression and acts of dissidence in the public space. This project aims to explore, map and visualise patterns, modes, and state of development of urban unrest in Beirut Martyr Square during three major pretesting events (2006, 2011 &amp; 2015) to develop a Spatial Model of Urban Stability (SMUS). Using five indicators of urban stability that involve socio-economic, political and spatial factors, a 10-point scale of urban unrest will be designed to trace and understand, through time and space, patterns of spatial unrest in Lebanon during this period. The project will reconstruct historical events and narratives and use spatio-temporal analytics to relate frequency of acts of dissidence to the social-political and economic condition of that time. This approach could later be applied to other cities/contexts facing situations of conflict and revolt. Analysis of causes of conflict and its damaging consequences on local communities and their cities are generally presented from a one sided point of view which is governments and authorities in charge of maintaining order and law. But in this work, we aims to bring and present another side of the narrative and other viewpoints of other players witnessing these incidents (NGOs, communities, Political analysts etc) in order to avoid biased analysis and move towards more reliable predictors of stability. The SMUS will enable analysts, decision makers, planners and activist groups to trace and reflect on previous practices, pattern of escalation, time span of revolt or unrest through intelligible visual maps and supporting datasets. The project will also enable policy makers to consider the economical and physical disturbing effects of such patterns and actions of unrest not only on the city&apos;s future development, but on the local communities living facing massive drop in providing minimal infrastructure services e.g. waste management problems. We plan to run interdisciplinary and interactive workshops in Beirut and Belfast to bring together a multidisciplinary team including the humanities and social sciences.   This project seeks to generate data that can enable governing authorities as well as non-governmental actors to engage in conflict prevention to prioritize a systematic approach to the collection of information on how urban spaces such as public Squares becomes sites of conflict from protest. The project will allow such information to inform policies and support community stakeholders to an understanding of what might be done to allow protest but prevent conflict in such important public spaces.  The project will explain indicators of unrest and the viability of statistical information derived from credible governmental/international agencies and independent NGOs in Beirut, along with spatial patterns of movements and occupation. This will enable unrest actions to be verified and analysed in line with changing political situations in the pilot case study city. This project will be supported and facilitated through a series of workshops and focus groups, visual displays and a conference to effectively communicate the findings to policymakers and maximise the potential for impact, through advocacy for the adoption of implementable measures that increase opportunities for protest without conflict.</narrative>
