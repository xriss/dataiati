  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">T-SUM is an interdisciplinary and cross-sector collaborative project that aims to identify the conditions under which pathways to sustainable and inclusive transport and land use development can be accelerated in growing cities in the Global South. This project will initially focus on Maputo, Mozambique, and Freetown, Sierra Leone, as relevant examples of growing urban economies in Sub-Saharan Africa and other parts of the Global South.  The project relies on building and strengthening partnerships between civil society, non-governmental organisations, private and public sectors, and academia to examine the multiplicity of needs, challenges and opportunities for securing inclusive and sustainable development in the two case study cities; tailoring insights and learnings to the specificities of each case study; and facilitating a mutual learning process with local communities and both local and international actors involved in sustainable mobility development.   Detailed objectives include: - To initiate participative governance processes to foster new models of development, based on a sustainable urban mobility trajectory, through evidence-based engagement with public and professional stakeholders across levels of governance and sectors. - Through multi-disciplinary and cross-sectorial collaboration, to co-produce a conceptual framework for the understanding of the socio-economic, environmental, spatial and governance base underpinning mobility and land-use development. To apply it to two case studies in Sub-Saharan Africa (Maputo and Freetown) with a view to identifying the potential to accelerate sustainable and inclusive mobility development pathways in growing cities. - Through a participatory process involving local residents, transport providers, sectorial experts, local and national stakeholders, to identify the roles that accessibility, mobility, land-use and their governance play/could play in past, current and future sustainable mobility development in Maputo and Freetown.  - To identify, from a review of practices and participatory consultations with international leaders in sustainable mobility, a set of practical tools and actions to produce evidence-based knowledge informing urban mobility participatory governance processes. - To pilot participatory methodological approaches to finding viable solutions to the challenges and opportunities for sustainable and inclusive mobility identified in each locality. - To share with key stakeholders at the regional and national levels, methodological and policy approaches drawn from the two cases with the potential to be rolled out to other cities facing similar challenges and opportunities for the development of sustainable and inclusive mobility pathways comprising systems, policies and practices.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">There is evidence internationally that there is a positive association between an increase in GDP per capita and growing car use in cities. However, car-oriented urban development results in strong negative externalities, such as high C02 emissions, air pollution, congestion, road accidents, urban sprawl, social exclusion, spatial segregation and sedentary lifestyles. These lead to poor accessibility and inequity and affects socio-economic development. Most Global North cities with high levels of motorization are now attempting to constrain and reduce traffic levels and move towards sustainable mobility and more liveable cities. Cities in developing countries are faced with a stark choice of repeating the evolutionary mistakes of many of the cities in more developed countries, or &apos;leapfrogging&apos; car-oriented mobility to directly develop cities around the principles of sustainable mobility and liveability. Growing urban economies have an opportunity to establish innovative solutions for achieving sustainable and inclusive mobility and land use patterns; thus, avoiding being &apos;locked-in&apos; to a car-oriented development trajectory - which can prove very difficult and expensive to rectify at later stages of development. T-SUM is an interdisciplinary and cross-sector collaborative project that aims to identify the conditions under which sustainable and inclusive transport and land use development can be accelerated in growing cities in the Global South. It is grounded in the observation that, in the context of still-low-but-rising levels of motorization, economic growth and increasing social and spatial inequalities, the formulation and implementation of policies, practices and partnerships that can support an accelerated implementation of sustainable mobility structures is an urgent concern for rapidly developing cities. This project will initially focus on Maputo, Mozambique, and Freetown, Sierra Leone, as relevant examples of growing urban economies in Sub-Saharan Africa and other parts of the Global South.  Challenging the traditionally assumed links between economic growth and car-based urban transport, alongside documenting the socioeconomic and spatial inequalities stemming from current urban transport systems in Sub-Saharan Africa, requires rethinking some of the knowledge and methodologies produced about cities of the region. This proposal seeks to contribute to this debate through three objectives: firstly, to develop a conceptual framework based on alternative development trajectories for (un)sustainable urban transport, drawing on data from cities across the Global North and the Global South; secondly, to assemble and co-produce evidence by interrogating urban transport and land use data in two rapidly developing cities in the region, Maputo and Freetown; and thirdly, to initiate participative governance processes to foster new models of development based on a sustainable mobility trajectory, through evidence-based engagement with public and professional stakeholders across levels of governance and sectors. The process will rely on collaborations across disciplines, with government and with local communities; and ultimately will produce evidence-based knowledge for informing policy and accelerating sustainable and socially inclusive transport development in Sub-Saharan African cities, and beyond. Expected impacts include: Improved urban governance processes and institutional capacity-building in the cities of Maputo and Freetown;The introduction of a tradition of citizen engagement and co-production; Accelerated urban transport development pathways based on sustainability and inclusivity principles, resulting in improved physical and mental well-being, increased prosperity, reduced C02 emissions, air pollution and energy consumption, improved accessibility and social inclusion in cities; A legacy of data and analytical toolsthat will assist both cities in their future sustainable mobility planning and implementation.</narrative>
