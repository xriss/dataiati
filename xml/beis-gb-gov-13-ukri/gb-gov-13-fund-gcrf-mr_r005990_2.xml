   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Far too many newborns continue to die in early life, particularly in low-and middle income countries (LMIC). Many die from infections, some of which could be prevented. During the late stages of pregnancy, antibody is transferred across the placenta from mother to child, providing protection to the infant in the early weeks of life. However, if the mother has insufficient protection against certain infections, the infant will also not be protected.   Vaccinating women in pregnancy can enhance the level of antibody in the mother, thereby protecting the mother, and increasing the amount of antibody transferred across the placenta - protecting the infant from birth too. This concept has already been successfully established for the prevention of tetanus, influenza and pertussis (whooping cough). Many investigators and stakeholders are interested in using this strategy to protect infants from other serious infections, for example group B streptococcus or respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and vaccines against these infections are in development. Some fundamental gaps in our understanding remain about the immune response to vaccines in pregnancy and in newborn infants which are essential for us to address in order to accelerate development of new vaccines. It is also very important that the scientific community tackles how best to implement such vaccine programmes in both high-income countries and LMIC.   Our unique inter-disciplinary network represents stakeholders from basic science, immunology, vaccinology, social sciences, industry, public health and national and international policy makers who have come together in order to tackle the key challenges in the best use of vaccines in pregnancy and in newborns, and in the long term, improve maternal and newborn health.     Specifically, the IMPRINT network will implement collaborative research projects to answer fundamental biological questions about antibody transfer of antibody across the placenta, how to induce the &quot;best&quot; antibody, and its effect on the maturing newborn immune system. We will investigate if maternal vaccines interfere with the way in which the baby responds to vaccines later in infancy and childhood, to ensure that protection is not compromised at any stage. Co-factors such as nutrition or other infections might also change the way in which mothers and infants are protected by vaccines. Hence we need to take them into consideration if we are to ensure optimal protection of vaccines in pregnancy and early life. We will also find out why women decide to receive or not to accept vaccines in different countries in order to optimise the uptake of current and new vaccines. We will endeavour to work out how vaccine safety and effectiveness  can be best monitored, given the different health care systems in different countries. Addressing these implementation challenges will enable us to better understand the issues and site-preparedness in the many geographical areas and populations in which IMPRINT investigators work.    IMPRINT is a multi-disciplinary network linking investigators in Europe, Africa and Asia and can therefore address these questions comprehensively. We are uniquely set up to investigate these challenges through the diversity of expertise, availability of samples and datasets already available through our collaboration, which the members are happy to share. Through our network, we will train researchers in LMIC to take forward these important questions, and we will be the forum to provide the best evidence for the safe and efficient use of vaccines in pregnancy and newborns for the ultimate goal of lowering maternal and newborn deaths from infections.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="Over 40% of deaths in young children now occur in the neonatal period and further progress in decreasing child mortality depends on reducing the 2.9 million annual neonatal deaths, a priority for international health, particularly in lower and middle income countries (LMIC). Around a quarter of these are directly attributable to potentially preventable infections.  Vaccinating women in pregnancy to prevent infections in the newborn period is a feasible intervention with proven effectiveness for preventing tetanus, pertussis and influenza.  Neonatal vaccination is another strategy which has successfully been applied to prevent other infections, such as Hepatitis B.    Novel vaccines with a specific indication for use in pregnancy are in phase II/III trials (group B streptococcus and respiratory syncytial virus [RSV]) and other vaccines designed to prevent congenital and neonatal infections are in earlier phases of development (cytomegalovirus [CMV] and Zika virus).    However, a number of scientific and programmatic challenges must still be addressed before the full potential of this  approach can be achieved. These can be met through a better understanding of:  1. maternal immune responses and transplacental antibody transfer in the context of vaccination in pregnancy   and in the presence of different co-factors such as nutritional status and co-infections;  2. neonatal immune ontogeny and the impact of maternal and neonatal vaccines on subsequent immune responses to childhood vaccines  3. safety, efficacy and acceptability of vaccination in pregnancy and early life   The specific objectives of the IMPRINT are:   - to establish an international network of multi-disciplinary investigators with a track record in maternal and neonatal immunisation strategies, working in partnership with relevant stakeholders    -to identify key scientific challenges which the network is uniquely placed to respond to through its research and collaborations    - to enhance our insights into the functional development and specific adaptations of the immune system in pregnancy and the neonatal period    - to employ state of the art technologies to address the identified challenges through collaborations within the network    - to develop collaborative scientific projects aimed at enhancing our understanding of the effects of vaccines on pregnant women and newborns    - to provide start up funding to begin to address the prioritised challenges     - to link vaccinology expertise in the UK to ODA eligible countries    - to set up an international postdoctoral fellowship scheme that centres on maternal and neonatal immunisation challenges and enables specific training for fellows from LMIC: the IMPRINT Fellowships    - to reach out to international stakeholders in public health institutions    - to reach out to policy stakeholders in the field of vaccinology with an emphasis on maternal and neonatal immunisation, such as SAGE, WHO and the Brighton Collaboration    - to reach out to industry partners to inform vaccine development aimed at pregnant women and infants    - to  seek further independent funding for our program of work  All investigators in our network have a proven track record in the field, with access to relevant technical and policy platforms, providing us with the unique ability and opportunity to these specific objectives. Investigators will share existing data, samples and expertise, conduct fundamental experimental science, leverage additional funding and offer mentorship and training to developing vaccinologists from LMIC settings."></capital-spend>
