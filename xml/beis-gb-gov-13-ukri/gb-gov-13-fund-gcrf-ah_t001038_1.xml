   <narrative xml:lang="EN">1. To locate, secure distribution rights, digitally restore and subtitle three key but largely overlooked films from the history of Moroccan cinema. This would involve working with rights holders and film archives in Morocco, as well as experts in digital restoration and transfer to produce a high-quality, future-proof digital cinema package (DCP) of the films. Copies of the DCPs can then be screened at festivals, viewed online and housed in film archives in Morocco and across the world for researchers and the general public to access. 2. To disseminate digitally these restored films to an international online audience, working with a series of online &apos;influencers&apos; (filmmakers, critics, film agencies, film schools) to maximise the potential reach of the films to a diverse range of audiences (cinephiles, students, researchers, festival goers, the general public). 3. To curate and deliver a series of screenings of the restored Moroccan films at four festivals in the UK and two in Morocco. In the UK the films will be screened via TANO, the UK network of four African film festivals: Africa in Motion (Glasgow and Edinburgh), Film Africa (London), Afrika Eye (Bristol), and Watch-Africa (Cardiff), during the festival cycle in October and November 2019. In Morocco, the films will be screened at the Tetouan International Film School Film Festival (FIDEC) in November 2019 and the Moroccan National Film Festival, Tangier in March 2020.  4. Alongside the screenings of the films in Edinburgh, to host two European festival programmers and a representative from the Arab Cinema Centre at the Africa in Motion film festival in Scotland. Activities will include a one-day industry workshop and a discussion/Q&amp;A event for the general public following the screening of the three restored Moroccan films. The purpose of this initiative is to promote the visibility of curation and programming of Moroccan cinema on the international film festival circuit. 5. Alongside the screenings at FIDEC in Tetouan, to host two workshops involving project partners at the London Film School and the documentary filmmaking programme at the Abdelmalek Essaadi University in Tetouan. The first workshop will assist emerging Moroccan filmmakers to develop their film projects as well as facilitating transnational talent development between tutors and students from film schools in Morocco and the UK. The second will involve a discussion of the three Moroccan films in order to deepen emerging Moroccan filmmakers&apos; understanding of their own film history as a source of inspiration for their own film practice.  6. Alongside the screenings at the National Film festival in Tangiers, to broker a meeting between the Moroccan Film Council (CCM) and the British Film Institute to discuss ways to further and deepen further collaboration between Moroccan filmmakers, UK film festivals and the industry more widely. 7. In collaboration with Professor Catherine Grant (a leading video essay practitioner) to produce a video essay inspired by the three restored Moroccan films.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project builds on unplanned opportunities for impact and engagement activities beyond academia that have emerged during the AHRC-funded Transnational Moroccan Cinema research project.  It aims to provide a greater visibility to Moroccan cinema by bringing three artistically innovative but little-known Moroccan films (one narrative feature, one documentary feature and one short film) to the attention of a diverse range of audiences in Morocco, the UK and internationally (via online distribution). This will be achieved by working with film archives and Moroccan filmmakers or producers to locate the films, secure the rights to screen them and then work with specialists in digital restoration as well as subtitlers to produce  a high-quality digital cinema package (DCP) of each films. The films will then be launched across the network of four UK film festivals specialising in African or Arab cinema and at two festivals in Morocco before being made available for free online for a period of 12 months. Using a group of online &apos;influencers&apos; to bring these films to the attention of a transnational audience online, the intention is to reach as wide and diverse an audience as possible, not just researchers and cinephiles who may already be aware of these films and filmmakers. In essence, this project is a response to the challenge laid down by filmmaker and critic Mark Cousins for researchers, translators and film archivists to make significant but little known films from across the world more visible to as wide an audience as possible.  Disseminating these films to an online audience will therefore enhance the understanding and appreciation of Moroccan cinema more generally. However, this project also focuses on how the wider recognition of these films can act as a catalyst for a series of more targeted initiatives. A second stage of this project will thus build on the visibility given to these lost classics of Moroccan cinema in order to:  (a) allow the films to be used as a focal point for emerging Moroccan filmmakers to better understand their own film history and how such an understanding can inform and enhance their own filmmaking (b) offer a space for encounter between film schools in Morocco and abroad (more specifically the UK) that can develop collaboration, networking, training and a sharing of knowledge in what might be described as a process of transnational talent development for emerging Moroccan filmmakers (c) encourage new initiatives and collaboration between the film industry, festival organisers, and policy makers in Morocco and the UK relating to international co-production and new strategies for distribution  (d) produce a video essay inspired by the three digitally restored Moroccan films that offers an innovative way of thinking about these films will bring the films to the attention of cinephiles, researchers and students of world cinema, who may be aware of their existence, and the diversity of Moroccan cinema more generally.</narrative>
