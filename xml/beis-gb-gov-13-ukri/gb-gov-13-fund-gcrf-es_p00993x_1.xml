   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This interdisciplinary research documents the customary sustainable lifestyles of indigenous and rural groups of South America, examining how their models for sustainability and wellbeing can be effectively integrated within the Global Sustainable Development Goals and passed onto future generations. The project includes a book publication that documents and analyses, from a health perspective, a remarkable facet of Amerindian life: the amount of time and effort dedicated to facilitating personal growth, for both oneself and for others. Throughout the life cycle, and especially during early perinatal life, a wide array of &apos;humorally&apos;-informed hands-on techniques and practices are used to ensure that people achieve their potential to be robust, attentive persons, mindful of their wider environment. Taking as its subject the northwestern Amazonian Brazilian Warekena, the book examines how they manage to achieve this aim. The book engages multidisciplinary audiences by addressing the broader topics of a) indigenous mindfulness practices, in society and in education, b) inequitable interethnic relations and their transformation over time, c) passing sustainable environmental practices across generations. The project also builds on this work, by further interdisciplinary publications that unfold in conversation with International Development, and education in particular. In so doing, it addresses the Rio+20 project for &quot;Sustainable Development&quot; (SD), a term familiar to us since Rio 92 (the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development), which aims to integrate environmental, social and economic objectives. Since then, and under the influence of the Indian economist and philosopher Amartya Sen, sustainable development has increasingly been conceptualized as people-centred and promoting of a better quality of life for all while living within the limits of supporting ecosystems. Building on and aligning my research with this Global Challenge, this project builds dialogues and opens avenues to pioneer truly holistic education initiatives that have sustainability and wellbeing at their core.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="The project&apos;s principal objective is to tackle the Global Challenge of supporting the long-term, equitable and sustainable resilience of indigenous and peasant communities. The discipline of anthropology, with its qualitative methods and the privileging of actors&apos; perspectives, is uniquely placed to engage in the interdisciplinary research required when addressing this global challenge.   The principal objective is achieved by producing academic publications for an interdisciplinary audience, attending conferences, initiating collaborations with research users and developing associated transferable skills as well as through the building of international networks. The specific objectives and activities achieved by the end of this fellowship include: 1) Publishing my first monograph (based on the DPhil thesis) Biosocial resonances: Xi&#xE9; river dwellers mindful relation to health, reproduction and perinatal care, with the Berghahn Books (Epistemologies of Healing Series). This monograph locates itself at the interface of sustainable environmental practices, inter-ethnic relations and health and wellbeing. This part of the project requires a return trip to my field site to secure copyright permissions. 2) finalising a co-authored publication, with Bernd Brabec de Mori, Breathing Song and Smoke: Ritual Intentionality and the Making of an Intersubjective Realm, for a Special Issue of the peer-reviewed journal Body and Society. 3) preparing for publication The fluvial island of Tunu Cachoeira: a plentiful and civilized place to live? as part of Ilan Kelman&apos;s (UCL) planned Special Issue on Islands, Climate Change and Global Health (provisionally with the peer-reviewed journal BMJ Global Health). 4) developing avenues for collaboration and enhancing transferable skills through research consolidation and training in the perspectives of International Development. This is achieved through on-going conversations with Laura Rival, her team and colleagues and sees me presenting my work at an ODID seminar. 5) developing the research field by directly engaging with the latest pioneering research in microbiology and the neurosciences. This involves training (Mindfulness Masterclass at the Oxford Mindfulness Centre with pioneer Tania Singer), literature recommendations and reading. This culminates in the publication of an article Growing certain types of people: health-promoting techniques for the local biologies of Xie dwellers of the Brazilian amazon), with editor Kate Fayers-Kerr currently conversing with the journal Medicine, Anthropology, Theory (MAT). 6) to engage mindfulness researchers, and mindfulness educators and clinicians, with my research into biosocially specific, hands-on, indigenous and folk mindful practice. This involves attendance (and presentation), at the Bangor University 2017 Conference, Mindfulness and Society. 7) to develop my understanding of the needs and challenges faced by pioneering holistic (sustainable and glocal) educators, working in South America. This includes a placement at the intercultural bilingual research initiative FORMABIAP in Iquitos, Peru and a research trip to the Acadia project in Brazil (S&#xE3;o Paolo). It also involves discussing research with stakeholders in S&#xE3;o Gabriel during my return trip to my field site. 8) to apply my research and build an international community of glocal educators. This is achieved via the Global Environment&apos;s Network and later, through an Oxford workshop on Glocal education and the establishment of the edu-cere: a biosocial education website. The latter engages international ODA communities in developing their own Glocal education. The project culminates by drawing together the various interdisciplinary fields in an article in the International Journal of Educational Development and by influencing policy through a UNESCO report."></capital-spend>
