   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Sustainable Use of Natural Resources to Improve Human Health and Support Economic Development (SUNRISE)</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Globally, human societies face a burgeoning challenge of achieving sustainable use of natural resources to provide food, fuel, water and amenities for an increasing population under the context of climate change. At its most fundamental, this will require achieving food and water security of supply without threatening the ability of the environment to support future generations.    An increasingly urbanized and wealthy population is driving a growing and changing demand for food, water, land and other natural resources and contributing to environmental degradation. These demands combined with climate change, and its associated natural hazards, were critical considerations in the development of the UN&apos;s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs, 2015).  The challenges posed by the SDGs require long term national scale research-based solutions. SUNRISE seeks to improve livelihoods and wellbeing through reduced environmental risk, improved environmental quality and improved reliability of the supply of food, water and other natural resources by providing the evidence and advice needed to improve management of the wider environment. SUNRISE will address local issues and research needs in China, India, Indonesia / Malaysia, Kenya and other countries in sub Saharan Africa and address SDGs 1, 2, 3, 6, 13 and 15.  SUNRISE builds on the research themes that formed the basis of the approved NC-ODA Foundation Award with activity currently in progress: (1) developing hydro-climate services for improved water resource management and flood and drought forecasting and preparedness; (2) restoration and remediation of degraded resources and environments to improve people&apos;s health and economic security, and; (3) management of land resources to ensure environmental sustainability and economic growth and resilience.  These will be developed and delivered in partnership with in-country partners and stakeholders to address their most pressing environmental needs.   Hydro-climate services are tools and methods that translate data and knowledge of current and potential future hydrological conditions into information that will inform better water policy, planning, management and decision-making.  The science challenge is to adapt CEH&apos;s models and understanding to perform at an acceptable level of uncertainty in data sparse regions.  In meeting this challenge we will both advance UK research capabilities and provide tools, methodologies and assessments to reduce the impact of extreme events on people and their livelihoods and increase the reliability and resilience of water supplies for people, livestock and businesses on a day to day basis. Restoration and remediation options require research aimed at understanding and quantifying the key factors and processes that cause environmental degradation and upon which mitigation measures rely.  This theme will seek to fill a knowledge gap by determining the key factors that affect the rate and stability of recovery as systems are restored, and the resilience of restored systems to future change.  In investigating this knowledge gap in real-world situations the findings will advance science knowledge and inform new policy and management approaches needed in India, China, Indonesia, Malaysia and Kenya but with global relevance. Increasing agricultural productivity sustainably is a clear priority both for food provision and also as a pathway to alleviating poverty, particularly for the 83% of the global agricultural population who rely on smallholder agriculture.  Small holder agriculture is often not as productive as it could be: working with local agronomists we will investigate new approaches to achieve ecological intensification, through diversification of smallholder land, water and livestock management to deliver improved productivity, resilience and sustainability.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The overarching objective of SUNRISE is to improve the livelihoods and well-being of poor people in ODA countries. Through our proposed programme of collaborative research, training and knowledge exchange targeted at India, China, Indonesia, Malaysia and Kenya (among other sub-Saharan African countries), we aim to help reduce the poor&apos;s exposure to environmental risk, enhance the quality of their environment and improve their access to clean freshwater and food.  The programme will achieve this under three Themes: Hydro-climate Services for Water Management; Restoration and Remediation of Degraded Resources / Environments; and Managing Land to Ensure Environmental Sustainability.    In the Hydro-climate Services area (Theme 1), our objective is to provide tools for improved water resource management and flood and drought forecasting and preparedness, ensuring that our collaborators eventually have both the capacity and capability to support their own water resource policy, planning and decision-making. To deliver this we will, in collaboration with relevant partners:  1.1  Deploy COSMOS technology to explore how improved understanding of soil-moisture dynamics can benefit water management in sub-tropical and tropical environments (first in India then, if possible, Africa);  1.2  Enhance hydro-climate science by exploring how established methods for flood and drought risk estimation can be applied in areas where data are sparse and of inferior quality (initially in India and China, then Africa);  1.3  Develop quantifiable indicators to describe the status of water resources at a variety of spatial and temporal scales, to help users make more robust decisions on water management;  1.4  Develop and test seasonal (1 - 3 months&apos;) hydrological outlooks at the national scale, for India and China, and globally, to provide early warning of future hydro-climatological disasters in developing countries. Under the Restoration area (Theme 2), we seek to fill a knowledge gap by attributing the main causes of degradation in our study systems and determining the key factors that affect both the rate and stability of recovery of water, soil and air.  To deliver this we will:  2.1  Quantify major rural emission sources that contribute to poor air quality and affect human health within cities in China and India, and scope out need and opportunities in African nations.  2.2  Develop scientific understanding of recovery processes in lakes and rivers in China, India and Africa and thereby produce an evidence-based, ecologically robust and sustainable approaches and tools to enhance freshwater resources.   2.3  Develop the underpinning science needed to maintain soil quality and productivity to deliver an improved knowledge framework for tropical land use management, including options to restore productive agricultural functions to highly degraded land.  Theme 3, Managing Land for Environmental Sustainability, seeks to enable the development of local management systems for small-holders that are resilient to environmental change.  To deliver this we will:  3.1  Develop tools and capability to evaluate options for ecological intensification and diversification of land management, including agroforestry, to increase ecological and socio-economic resilience of smallholder agriculture in Kenya.  3.2  Investigate ozone effects on Kenyan and Indian agriculture and horticultural crops to develop our flux-based risk assessment methodology and develop an ozone action plan for implementation at the farm scale.  3.3  Model the dynamics (seasonal, annual, inter-annual) of key livestock and zoonotic diseases in relation to wide ranging social, host, climate and ecosystem factors to generate risk maps and forecasting systems, and build capacity in India.</narrative>
