   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Solar Powered Horticulture Cold Chains (Sol-Tech)</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Globally food chains experience substantial losses which for horticulture products can be as high as 70% of production. This represents 8 percent of global Greenhouse Gas Emissions, and substantial loss of resources such as water and energy. Food losses and waste result from to many reasons, which include inadequate infrastructure and lack or unreliable energy supply, lack of skills and access to markets. A key contributor to food loss in developing countries and in particular Africa and India is the very limited availability of cold food chains for the preservation and temperature controlled distribution of fresh produce to markets.   The Sol-Tech project aims to make a contribution to addressing the food waste challenge and key Sustainable Development Challenges and Goals, including halving food waste by 2030, providing access to energy for all and alleviation of poverty and malnutrition. This will be achieved by building on previous and current research to develop to commercialisation stage an innovative but affordable solar powered modular fresh food cold storage and first mile distribution system for application in areas with no or limited and unreliable access to the electricity grid. Sol-Tech will involve collaboration between academic and industry partners from the UK, Africa and India to ensure that the technology development and commercialisation is informed by developing country needs and local political, socioeconomic and market conditions.  The innovation potential and impact of the technology are substantial. Major innovations  include: i) significant, up to 40% reduction of the thermal load of food transport refrigeration insulated boxes;  ii) the use of solar energy to power on-board refrigeration systems and hybrid electrical and thermal energy storage to eliminate fossil fuel demand for precooling, storage and distribution of fresh produce; iii) adaptable on-board microclimate control and communication system to minimise transpiration losses, increase shelf life and maximise product quality at point of delivery.  The project will also investigate and develop appropriate business models and commercialisation strategies tailored to specific local markets to ensure successful product commercialisation and maximum impact.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The overall objective of the Sol-Tech project is to develop to commercialisation stage a low cost but highly efficient solar powered off-grid modular and mobile fresh produce storage and first mile distribution system for rural farmers and communities in developing countries.  Specific objectives include:  i) Development of an innovative modular insulated wall construction for temperature controlled boxes (reefers) that will offer substantially lower thermal losses compared to current practice that can be interchangeably used for precooling, temporary on farm storage and distribution of fresh produce. ii) Integration of solar PV, on-board refrigeration, hybrid thermal and electrical storage systems and a smart control system to enable off-grid operation for at least 48 hours during the night and overcast conditions and continuously optimise operation to ensure maximum product quality and shelf life. iii) Development of appropriate business models and a commercialisation strategy, initially for the partner countries in Africa and India, to ensure wide acceptance and rapid penetration of the market. iv) Exposure and engagement of all genders, including teenagers to the advanced but user friendly technology and high value agricultural activities to improve skills,  income and livelihoods. v) Establishment of strong relationships and collaboration between the partners and stakeholders to ensure long term impact through the Sol-Tech and other solar based technologies in the future.</narrative>
