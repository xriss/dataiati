  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">SA President Cyril Ramaphosa proclaimed GBV a national crisis and introduced a 5-point plan to ensure women&apos;s security, which forms also our project&apos;s central objectives: 1) Prevention: Central to this project&apos;s prevention strategies is a shift in focus from seeing women exposed to GBV as victims to seeing them as survivors, actors and agents of change, with a strong emphasis on women empowerment and agency. To meet this objective, AmaZizi Women&apos;s Commission (AWC) will secure AmaZizi women&apos;s political participation and influence in GBV prevention programming at regional and national levels. AWC will also lead &apos;Community Strategies for Change,&apos; an initiative whereby members attend key events in Eastern Cape (EC) to discuss the project and its research and encourage visitors to sign pledges to end GBV. Enough is Enough Festival will address issues related to gender equality in constructive, non-threatening ways, with theatre, painting and music raising awareness and attacking gender stereotypes to audiences of men and women.   2) Strengthen the criminal justice system: South Africa (especially rural regions like EC) suffers from poor enforcement of criminal laws and from diminishing, discriminatory attitudes among law officials. This has resulted in a high level of GBV cases going unreported, a profound lack of confidence and trust by the public in the criminal justice system, and a high percentage of GBV survivors whose needs for support are neither recognised nor met. To address these failings, this project has established Police Response, a series of arts-based workshops to equip Dutywa law enforcement (the central police station serving AmaZizi is in the town of Dutywa) with skills and tools necessary to explore GBV from more culturally-competent, community-based perspectives.   3) Enhancing legal and regulatory reforms: Strengthening the legal and policy framework forms an important part of this project&apos;s aim to prevent and more effectively respond to GBV. To meet this objective, we will put forward with the National House of Traditional Leaders (which advises the President on matters relating to customary law) an Action Framework that addresses GBV prevention from traditional perspective, to be presented to Parliament as a fast-track initiative through Operation Phakisa. 4) Ensure adequate care, support and healing for victims of violence: In the immediate term, the effects of GBV have to be tackled: survivors have rights to protection and access to support. To meet this objective, we will establish Intervention Workshops (IW), which, led by AWC with assistance from local NGOs experienced in supporting and servicing GBV survivors through the arts, will use the practical arts to help women work through traumatic experiences, reduce stress and gain self-esteem as a community of survivors. IW raises women&apos;s collective consciousness about violence, a precondition to them challenging violence in their own lives; and helps them build-up social assets and increase their agency, thereby helping them to more readily respond to safety threats and feel safer in their communities.  5) Improving economic power of women: Given that GBV is linked to gender-based power inequalities, a key in sustainable GBV prevention is to increase women&apos;s economic empowerment. To meet this objective, Women Leadership Training will offer IW participants intensive entrepreneurial training on how to turn their newly-acquired creative skills (learned through IW) into economic businesses.  Their art works will also be on display (and sold) at gallery exhibits as well as on the projects website. While such efforts could contribute to increased violence in the short term due to gender ideals linking masculinity to provider roles, this is mitigated by having the project endorsed by Dutwya law enforcement, and by AmaZizi&apos;s trusted traditional leader, who also serves as Co-I. Increasing women&apos;s economic empowerment is crucial for longterm prevention of GBV.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">South Africa (SA) has one of the highest rates of gender-based violence (GBV) in the world: a woman is murdered every three-hours, and gendered assault is 5x higher than the global average (STATS-SA 2019). GBV is recognised not only as a serious violation of human rights, but also as a significant public health concern that includes injuries, gynaecological disorders, mental health disorders (including depression and post-traumatic stress disorder), adverse pregnancy outcomes, and sexually-transmitted diseases, including HIV and AIDS. GBV is also a barrier to social and economic development, rendering many survivors unable to work or otherwise move freely in society.        On 9/11/2019, SA President Cyril Ramaphosa proclaimed GBV a national crisis, promising government debate to revise domestic violence laws and to initiate a national intervention plan that challenges patriarchal norms and engages at community levels. This project comes in response to his call, introducing arts-based interventions to provide support to GBV survivors, shift societal norms by promoting gender equality and behavioural change, strengthen law enforcement, improve economic power of women and take steps to enhance GBV legal and policy frameworks.       It is the first primary preventative and support strategy for GBV in rural Eastern Cape, with actions taking place in the AmaZizi chiefdom, which, located within the AbaThembu Kingdom, Eastern Cape, comprises nine villages: kwaZangashe, Ngcobo, Ngqamakwe, Ugie, Elliot, Maclear, Cala, Idutywa and Gcuwa. Arts-based actions planned will help improve response services for survivors through capacity-building workshops, support communities to re-evaluate the social norms that lead to GBV through art exhibits and festival, strengthen legal and policy frameworks by facilitating evidence-base reform and amendments to current policies and providing training to local law enforcement, and improve the economic power of women through arts-based entrepreneurial training. Although AmaZizi is the target population, this project will serve as a test-bed for building support for wider GBV policy changes across South Africa, particularly in rural regions, and informing future prevention efforts globally.     This project is led by ethnomusicologist and anthropologist Nanette de Jong (Newcastle University), who has worked extensively in South Africa for 15 years and is an expert on gender, culture and community, having carried out interventions that mitigate contextual influences on HIV/AIDS and GBV.  The Co-I is AmaZizi traditional leader, Chief Pokwana ka Menziwa, who also serves as chairperson of the NGO, Vusizwe Foundation, chairperson of South African Society of Archivists, Head of Research and Development with Oral Historical Association of South Africa, Advisory Board member of the Department of Arts and Culture and member of African Diaspora Forum.  Partners include Dutwya Law Enforcement, Department of Social Development, Department of Arts and Culture, AIDS Alliance, as well as Eastern Cape-based NGOs Impendulo Foundation, Theatre for Life and Ngcobo-Zintombizodwa, which work with GBV survivors in the region through the arts-based interventions.</narrative>
