   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Considerable amounts of antibiotics are used in the rearing of livestock and the use of these antibiotics leads to the selection of bacteria that are resistant. There is some evidence that these bacteria may contribute to resistance levels in bacteria that cause human disease. This research aims to investigate if antibiotic resistant strains of bacteria found in farms are also found in cases of human disease in a region of North East India. This project will also record the use of antibiotics on farms, and to investigate the human behavioural and animal health factors that influence antibiotic use. The study combines microbiological and social science research methods. Agriculture in this area consists mainly of smaller livestock enterprises typical of many rural settings in India. The aim is to provide a comprehensive description of the distribution of resistant bacteria in humans, livestock (including aquaculture) and the environment together with a thorough study of the context which leads to the selection of these bacteria in order to understand which antibiotics (and the quantities) are used and why. The project also aims to increase the research capacity in India to continue this work through increased experience and training in the application of DNA sequencing and social science methods for research into antibiotic resistance.  The specific research work that will be performed is:  1. Sampling on farms in order to bacteria from animals, people, the environment and retail meat products, together with bacteria from cases of human disease from local hospitals.  2. Collection of data from farms to record antibiotic use, how and why decisions are made to use antibiotics, which individuals are influencing these decisions, and what factors affect the decision-making process (to include how presumptive diagnoses are made, societal hierarchy, prior knowledge, education, attitudes, and economic factors) using established social science research methods .  3. DNA sequencing of the bacteria in order to characterise the mechanisms responsible for antibiotic resistance, and to compare the relatedness of agricultural and hospital bacteria. This enables us to determine if there is transmission of antibiotic resistance from farm animals to people.  4. To develop antibiotic stewardship advice, materials and programmes that are tailored to a rural Indian context in order to maximise animal health and ensure rational use of antibiotics.  Good quality scientific evidence is needed to ensure that any restrictions on antibiotic use on farms are rational, and targeted appropriately. Regardless of any contribution to human antibiotic resistance better antibiotic stewardship in agriculture will reduced levels of resistance in livestock and lead to improved animal health.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The primary aims of the proposed research is to test the hypothesis that AMR bacteria in livestock are transmitted to human hosts, to record the use of antibiotics on farms, and to investigate the human behavioural and animal health factors that influence antibiotic use. The study undertake intensive and thorough sampling in a narrow geographic region in NE-India combining microbiological and social science methodology. Agriculture in this area consists mainly of smaller livestock enterprises typical of many rural settings in India. The aim is to provide a comprehensive description of the distribution of resistant bacteria in humans, livestock (including aquaculture) and the environment together with a thorough study of the context which leads to the selection of antibiotic resistance (i.e. to understand what antibiotics are used and why). A secondary aim of the proposed work is to increase the research capacity in India to extend this work through increased experience and training in the application of next generation sequencing in molecular epidemiology, and social science research.  The specific research objectives are:  1. Undertake systematic longitudinal sampling on farms in order to collect bacterial isolates from animals, people, the environment and retail meat products, together with human bacterial isolates from co-located healthcare facilities.  2. The collection of data on farms to record antibiotic use, how and why decisions are made to use antibiotics, which individuals are influencing these decisions, and what factors affect the decision-making process (to include: how presumptive diagnoses are made, societal hierarchy, prior knowledge, education, attitudes, and economic factors) using Rapid Ethnographic Assessment (REA) and Participatory rural appraisal (PRA).  3. DNA sequencing of isolates and environmental metagenomes and subsequent bioinformatics in order to identify AMR lineages &amp; AMR genes, perform phylogenetic analysis, and identify population level transmission.  4. To develop and pilot antibiotic stewardship advice, materials and programmes that are tailored to a rural Indian context in order to maximise animal health and ensure rational use of antibiotics.</narrative>
