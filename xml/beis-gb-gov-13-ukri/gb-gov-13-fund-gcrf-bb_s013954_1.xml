   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Iron deficiency remains the most prevalent nutritional deficiency worldwide, affecting an estimated 4 to 6 billion people. Iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) is the largest nutritional deficiency disorder in the world and one of the five leading causes of global disease burden. At any given moment, more individuals suffer from IDA than any other health problem with a staggering 1.24 billion affected individuals worldwide.  In developing countries, millets are the most common form of cereals, often cultivated by female small holders in semi-arid tropic regions. Their resistance to drought and climate variability, along with nutrient dense characteristics, is attracting an increasing number of small scale farmers and governments in Sub Saharan Africa. While the nutritional value of millets has been identified, there has been limited progress on the creation of functional foods that are readily acceptable to populations. Biofortification of millets is also an emerging area research for enhancing nutritional quality. The goals of the two-year MillNETi are to tackle the major issue of iron bioavailability (relative to biofortification) by promoting the use and preparation of pearl and finger millets, initially in Ethiopia and The Gambia, but of  wider relevance for many semi-arid regions of Africa. The programme has been co-created with colleagues in India, Ethiopia and The Gambia, and a consortium of UK expertise and will undertake fundamental scientific investigations for the GROWTH, PROCESSING and monitoring of iron BIOAVAILABILTY, allied to social science methodologies to disseminate knowledge and improved practices in cultivation and food preparation (EXTENSION) to regional populations. The programme builds on an existing programme of biofortification (ICRISAT), bioavailability testing (MRC- Gambia), and social science studies indicating that rural - urban migration is creating a demand for more nutritious foods such as millets both in The Gambia and Ethiopia.  We will explore the basis of variation in crop iron uptake and availability traits in millets from contrasting regions and cropping practices (GROWTH: NIAB, UCAM, ICRISAT, EIAR). Additional research in Ethiopia on food preparation and processing (PROCESSING: BDU, ICRISAT, UCAM, MRC-Gambia) will be linked with a programme of internationally-validated human nutrition intervention studies (BIOAVAILABILITY: MRC-Gambia, UCAM), analysing plasma bioavailability of iron in healthy adult female representatives from local populations. As well as outreach to improve the nutrition and health of rural communities (EXTENSION (CGE/JeCCDO, BDU, UCAM: CGC, GFS IRC, CAPREX) additional insights from MillNETi on rural-urban linkages will be associated with the practice of food remitting, and potential role in food security, improved nutritional status and marketing opportunities for rural populations. These highly original observations will be of international significance for many populations in Africa and India, where the rural-urban divide represents a complex and interlinked reality of &apos;stretched&apos; or &apos;multi-nodal&apos; households.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="The overall objectives of the MillNETi partnership is to undertake fundamental science to translate micronutrient BIOFORTIFICATION in newly generated millet varieties into BIOAVAILABILITY, when processed as food for communities in The Gambia and Ethiopia. This is a critical because micronutrients may be sequestered or leached during most conventional food preparation methods, thereby not providing the nutritional benefits for females and their neonates. The core scientific programme will be associated with crop genetics and the enhancement of micronutrient recovery in grains, and their bioavailability and absorption tested during human (female) nutrition and biointervention studies in the Gambia. Associated with this primary scientific objective are a number of extension, translation and engagement with rural communities. Lessons from millet grain processing (specifically fermentation in Ethiopia) to enhance iron bioavailability will then be applied to the currently preferred crops (finger vs pearl millet) and potential to gain acceptability in both Ethiopia and The Gambia. Specific Measureable Objectives for each of four Flagship Projects are as follows: FP1(i) to trial novel pearl millet germplasm developed by ICRISAT and HarvestPlus along with finger millet varieties developed and registered in Ethiopia for assessment of agronomic performance and farmer acceptance traits across contrasting regions, soils and cropping systems in Ethiopia (ICRISAT); (ii) to generate sufficient seed of selected varieties, for Bioavailability testing (in FP2) and Processing (in FP3) from representative production environments and conditions (ICRISAT). (iii) to assess the genetic and physiological processes associated with variation in production and biofortification traits, including agronomic variation (e.g. life cycle duration) and differences in the uptake and redistribution of iron and zinc in a panel finger and pearl millet breeding lines (NIAB/RRES/UCAM).   FP2(i) analyse bioavailability of Fe from ICRISAT&apos;s bio-fortified millet when fed to healthy, pre-menopausal women in The Gambia (where research governance and ethical requirements are in place for human nutrition intervention studies);  (ii) Test how different combinations of millet grain preparation, milling and fermentation processes affect iron bioavailability;  (iii) use a higher throughput in vitro screen to compare iron content and select key samples for detailed analysis. FP3 Ethiopia (i) Determine the fermentation kinetics and optimal processing time to increase bioavailability during traditional fermentation of finger millet (dough) to prepare injera; (iii) Evaluate the bioavailability of minerals during processing of finger millet and pearl millet to injera (iii) determine impact of growth of millets for female empowerment, sustainable cropping and development of marketing opportunities;  The Gambia (iv) analyse millet varieties and use across ethnic communities; (v) quantify extent of food remitting and social changes (eg. adoption of processing practices, movements between rural and urban lifestyles) affecting nutrition from millet.  FP4(i) Assess whether novel technologies and approaches for millet cropping and grain processing are context and gender appropriate as alternative foodstocks and food preparation methods; (ii) use an Innovation Community co-creation process to test for transferability between India, West Africa and Ethiopia; (iii) to  deliver farmer and community training  to disseminate knowledge for improving nutrition; (iv) to promote the distribution of promising registered millet varieties with yield stability and Iron bioavailability to smallholder farmers in Ethiopia and The Gambia in collaboration with ICRISAT and NARES (v) to formulate policy outputs from outreach and engagement activities on the best means to enhance adoption of new crops (pearl vs finger millets) and food preparation to enhance nutritional returns to communities."></capital-spend>
