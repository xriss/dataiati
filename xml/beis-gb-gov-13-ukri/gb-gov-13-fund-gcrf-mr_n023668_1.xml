  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Despite remarkable progress achieved in decreasing HIV transmission and AIDS-related deaths in the last decade due to development of over 30 antiretroviral drugs, HIV continues to spread in a virtually uncontrolled manner. An effective HIV vaccine remains one of the priorities of HIV/AIDS research and will always be the best solution and likely key to any strategy for halting the AIDS epidemic. The biggest challenge in developing such a vaccine is the enormous HIV variability, which dwarfs that of any other virus except hepatitis C virus. However, all parts of HIV cannot easily change; to remain alive, HIV has to keep some smaller regions of its proteins more or less constant to maintain function. Our vaccine strategy takes advantage of this and focuses the body defenses on these conserved parts of HIV, its Achilles heel. Because conserved regions are common to most of the global HIV variants, the vaccine, if successful, could be used in Africa, Asia, Europe, America and Australia: it would be universal. The 1st generation conserved-region vaccine was very safe and induced strong immune responses in adult volunteers in the UK and Africa. In 2014, the pharmaceutical company GSK acquired a small biotech company, which developed one of the benign viruses we used for vaccine delivery, and unilaterally decided that we could no longer use the jointly owned vaccine in high risk people. Thus we needed to switch to an alternative vaccine virus and this provided an opportunity to also substantially improve the 1st generation vaccine.  These modifications are based on our experience from human vaccine testing and other developments in the HIV vaccine field over the last 10 years since its original design. Thus, the 2nd generation vaccine was born, using a new vaccine virus (ChAdOx1) owned by Oxford University and combining conserved regions with computer-designed proteins (mosaics), which significantly increase the vaccine match to global HIV variants. (Note that even the highly conserved regions are still somewhat variable.) Vaccines should match circulating HIVs as much as possible to stop them efficiently. The 2nd generation vaccines have been constructed, shown to induce strong immune responses in animal models and are now bound for testing in human volunteers. The requested funds will allow to us see how well the 2nd generation vaccine works in trying to get rid of HIV from already infected individuals and for larger scale testing in HIV-1 negative healthy volunteers in Africa. The latter study will aim first evidence that the vaccine can stop HIV from infecting healthy people. The funding will also allow clinical testing of the vaccine enabling further improvements including some new aimed at keeping ahead of HIV.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Objective 1. Characterization of T-cell responses elicited by tHIVconsvX vaccines in human recipients: breadth, epitope definition, depth, clonality, functionality, memory phenotype, in vitro inhibition of HIV-1 replication and in vitro killing of reactivated virus. There are a number of trials in the pipeline that will assess the safety and basic immunogenicity (ELISpot assays) of the 2nd generation conserved mosaic vaccines in both uninfected and HIV-1-positive, early-treated individuals. These will generate PBMC samples for mining much more detailed information on the vaccine-elicited responses in terms of their breadth, epitope definition, depth (number of recognized variants of the same epitope), clonality, functionality, memory phenotype, in vitro inhibition of HIV-1 replication and in vitro killing of reactivated virus. Emphasis will be on the CD8+ T-cell effectors, but CD4+ T-cells will be also characterized. The experiments are extremely important for establishing how efficiently the tHIVconsvX-elicited human T cells recognize HIV-1-infected cells and supress HIV-1 replication, which can only be done with PBMC from vaccinated human volunteers. The results will critically inform further vaccine development. Objective 2. Optimizing vaccine vectors, immunogens and regimens: alternative vectors and their combinations, early evaluation of surrogate efficacy, effect of vector delivery on induction of bnAbs. The subunit approach is favoured for development of HIV-1 vaccines. It employs HIV-1-derived immunogens, which determine the specificity of the vaccine-elicited responses and must contend with HIV-1 variability. Combinations of vaccine modalities are then used to present the immunogens to the immune system, influencing the magnitude, type, location and durability of the elicited effector functions and subsequent immunological memory. The quality of both the immunogens and their delivery is critical for achieving protective immunity: suboptimal design of either may cause vaccine failure. Novel vectors with T- and B-cell immunogens will be tested alone and in combinations. Objective 3. Studies of non-canonical CD8+ T-cell responses restricted by HLA-E: detection and induction of HLA-E cell-surface expression, processing of HLA-E-restricted epitopes, characterizing HLA-E-restricted CD8+ T cell responses. Persistent RhCMV68-1/SIV vaccine induces and maintains persistent effector memory T cells, which were associated with complete control of pathogenic SIVmac239 infection in over 50% of challenged rhesus macaques and led to complete SIV clearance. This vaccination resulted in induction of CD8+ T cells recognizing peptides presented by HLA class II and non-canonical HLA-E molecules. Although to date, there is no evidence for correlation of these responses with the protection against SIV challenge, there is a growing expectation that particularly HLA-E presentation contributed to the protection. We shall study HLA-E-restricted responses in volunteer vaccine recipients.</narrative>
