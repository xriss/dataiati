   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Migration for Inclusive African Growth Network</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Migration for Inclusive African Growth - MIAG - network concerns the nature of new migrant flows to and within Africa and their impacts on the continent&apos;s inclusive growth. As such it addresses two of the GCRF&apos;s thematic foci - migration and foundations for economic growth. Inclusive growth is growth that creates opportunities for all in society and where the monetary and non-monetary benefits are fairly distributed. Our linked contributions are: first, with the decline in value from commodities the services sector holds the key to Africa&apos;s future growth; second, North-South and South-South migration flows are increasingly significant for African countries; third, regional and internal migration can contribute to economic growth rather than being only crises responses; and fourth, these migrant flows contain entrepreneurs who invest in the service sector, particularly areas of importance for development, and also bring new forms of economic social and cultural capital that could enhance local capabilities and so support inclusive growth. Yet knowledge of these migration flows is limited. The network addresses this by building international, interdisciplinary capacity to investigate the extent to which these various migration flows can foster inclusive growth across 4 African countries - Nigeria, Ghana, Kenya and Mozambique.   The aim of the MIAG network is to:  Bring together researchers, policy makers, migrant groups, professionals, entrepreneurs and business representatives from Africa and beyond to share existing knowledge on contemporary North-South and South-South migration flows to and within the continent, and to design an interdisciplinary research and impact agenda to better understand these flows and how their contribution to more inclusive growth via the service sector can be enhanced through policy and practice.  This aim will be achieved through a series of linked objectives:  Conceptual &amp; methodological advancement 1. Map existing knowledge and identify data gaps through an innovative but tested method for multi-stakeholder engagement - evidence caf&#xE9;s - in Africa; 2. Refine a theoretical and methodological framework that captures global, regional, national and sectoral trends as well as the motives and experiences of individual migrants, through the evidence cafes and 3 co-authored papers; 3. Develop an interdisciplinary research agenda that brings together work on internal, regional and inter-continental migration to explore through a comparative framework: 3a. The role of migration to and within Africa in the continent&apos;s development, particularly in the context of new global mobility and investment dynamics; 3b. The roles of professional and entrepreneurial migration in promoting service sector investment and engendering inclusive growth.  Proposal development to grow MIAG activity 4. Co-design a series of large, inter-disciplinary proposals to gather data on new migrant flows, service sector engagement, and their impacts on inclusive growth in Africa.  Impacts on capacity and capabilities 5. Strengthen the academic linkages between, and research capacities of, established and early-career academics in the UK and Africa through a series of evidence caf&#xE9;s, co-design of research activities, and co-authoring of papers; 6. Enhance the understanding of the changing nature of migration to and within Africa among policy makers and development actors through face-to-face interaction and published and electronic media; 7. Co-create processes, products and platforms that facilitate knowledge exchange between migrant entrepreneurs and local stakeholders through technology-mediated methods; 8. Engage the GCRF in establishing a programme of research and impact around the importance of migration to inclusive growth and development, through a report; 9. Outline the efficacy of evidence cafes as a tool for knowledge exchange between academics and non-academics for development.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The link between migration and development is well-established in theory and policy circles. However, the focus has been on migration from the global South to the global North, underplaying the importance of North-South flows and migration within the global South. These alternative flows have important implications for inclusive growth, understood as economic growth that creates opportunities for all in society and where the monetary and non-monetary benefits are fairly distributed. The Migration for Inclusive African Growth network will look at how inclusive growth is, and can be, strengthened through inward investment by migrant groups in the service sector of 4 African countries: Nigeria, Ghana, Kenya and Mozambique.   There are 3 factors which suggest that this is an important focus. First, the economic downturn revealed the fragility of the growth experienced by many African economies over the past decade. Too much of this growth was based on commodity exports whereas recent academic and policy analysis suggests that services may hold the key to future growth. Second, alongside growing migration within Africa, we are also seeing a rise in new migration flows into Africa, both from the highly developed economies of the global North and the emerging economies of the global South. Third, these migrant flows contain entrepreneurs and professionals who not only invest in the service sector, particularly areas of critical importance for development such as health, education, and ICTs, but also bring new finance, knowledge and social networks that have the potential to enhance local capabilities and thereby support inclusive growth.  While these new migration flows have the potential to generate more inclusive growth in Africa, our knowledge of their size, motives, organisation and impacts is fragmented and largely anecdotal. Therefore, the central aim of the network is to bring together Northern and Southern researchers, policy makers, migrant groups and business representatives to generate and share existing knowledge on contemporary South-South and North-South migration flows to and within Africa and design a research agenda to better understand these flows and how their contribution to inclusive growth can be enhanced through policy and practice.   The network assembles expertise in migration research to, from and within Africa. The co-applicants in each country have a track record in policy-relevant research and are well networked nationally and regionally with academic, business and policy actors. The network will interact through a mix of virtual and face-to-face means - what we call evidence caf&#xE9;s - across a 17-month programme of work. These will be organised by the African partners in Africa and supported by the Open University which has experience of organising such learning events.  Our hypothesis is that new migrant communities in Africa have the potential to make important contributions to inclusive growth and economic competitiveness in the countries and locales where they settle. In order to assess whether and how such benefits may be occurring the co-applicants in the 4 African countries first have to map existing data in order to gain a much clearer picture of what gaps exist and where our research energies should be focused. The focus will be services since this is a growth sector where migrant participation appears highest and within this the African co-applicants will identify the 3 most relevant sub-sectors in their contexts from education, health, ICTs, and cultural industries.   The outcome will be a new international research network and advice to GCRF on migration&apos;s role in inclusive growth. We will also develop a series of collaborative bids to GCRF and other funders in 2018. The network will innovate by using the evidence caf&#xE9;s and distributed academic and practitioner networks to meet the learning needs of migrant investors in Africa as well as local actors who engage with them.</narrative>
