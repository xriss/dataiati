  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">A multidisciplinary network of Indian and British academics will collaboratively investigate the impact of social inequalities around religion, ethnicity and gender on lived experiences of discrimination and equality on HE campuses in India. The network will contribute to improving HE access, experiences and outcomes for minority students and economic mobility of the communities these students come from.  INTELLECTUAL PARADIGMS: The network will uncover and unravel the impact of existing intellectual paradigms around religion, ethnicity and gender on knowledge production and minority student engagement on campus.  (i) Re-imagine and visually chart (on the network website) the evolution of higher education in India through the lens of religion, ethnicity and gender by undertaking an in-depth literature review.  (ii) Core meeting 1 will focus on the discursive interrogation of the social and intellectual hierarchies that promote and nurture institutionalized expressions of discrimination and unfair treatment on the pretext of knowledge and knowledge production in HE contexts in India.  (iii) During Workshop 1 (WS1) the network will interrogate how existing intellectual paradigms and their associated activities use university spaces either to include or exclude minority students LIVED EXPERIENCE: The network will examine how wider political discussions around nationalism, citizenship and international relations shape the identity of minority students marginalised on account of their religion, ethnicity or gender and their experiences of discrimination and equality (i) By surveying and documenting news reports of student activism, the network will map the complex underpinnings of student activism on campus laying particular emphasis on political culture of social spaces in HE to analyse intersectionality in students&apos; identity and (on campus and off campus) stimuli. (ii) At workshop (WS2) the network will map locally-contextualised experiences of belief, explore inter-religious relations on campus and analyse the impact of students&apos; intersectional identities on their sense of belonging, or alienation, on campus  (iii) Interrogate the impact of HE as a tool for social and economic mobility of minority students and their communities INCLUSIVE NARRATIVES: Consider the potential impact on students of inclusive narratives (including decolonised approaches, both conceptual and lived, of HE. A 2-day symposium and linked edited volume will  (i) Critically interrogate differing understandings of &apos;inclusive narratives of higher education&apos; and the changing socio-political contexts within which HE must function to produce both efficient employees and educated citizens  (ii) Interrogate the student voice through activism as an enabler or not of inclusive campus environments (ii) Widen the geographical and theoretical scope of the project by including research narratives relating to campus experiences in other South Asian countries and to South Asian international and diaspora students studying in Western universities SUSTAINABILITY: Grow the network over the course of two years into a multi-disciplinary, multi-nation virtual e-network of academics and practitioners interested in questions of discrimination, marginalisation, inclusivity, opportunity to progress on campus based on minority religion and gender identity. This will facilitate inter-cultural learnings, exchanges and collaborations that extend beyond the funded lifetime of the network.  (i) Lay the intellectual and methodological foundations for future research by undertaking a literature review of academic and non-academic approaches to the study of religion on Indian campuses, focusing on issues of gender, belonging and inter-religious relations.  (ii) Identify further avenues to raise the impact of future network activities</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The research network will examine minority students&apos; lived experiences of discrimination and marginalisation on higher education campuses in India. The India higher education (HE) sector has much to celebrate - 903 Universities, 39050 Colleges and 10011 Stand Alone Institutions; 36.6 million students and 12,84,755 teachers. However behind these successes are the campus experience of minorities that, despite some evidence of social mobility bought about by higher education, is also characterised by marginalisation and discrimination. Latest statistics from the All India Survey of Higher Education Report (AISHE) 2017-18 show all minority-religious groups are underrepresented in HE. HE can enhance the social and economic mobility of minority students and their communities, yet these very students are often marginalised within the university system. Over the last five years there has been an increase in violent activism on university campuses in India. While this violence is reported as being underpinned by changing politics of nationalism in India and right-wing activism, it also has strong undertones of the marginalization (and indeed victimization) of minority faith groups. Despite the significance of such violence in undermining both academic freedoms on campuses and democratic political processes, this is an area that remains under-researched. For this network &apos;minority students&apos; broadly encompasses religious minorities (Muslims, Christians, Sikhs, Buddhists) and ethnic minorities (Dalits and Tribes). The network will also explore how male and female students experience campus differently. Through its emphasis on equality and inclusion on campus and gendered identity, this research network directly addresses UN Sustainable Development Goals 4, 5 and 10 around Quality Education, Gender Equality and Reduced Inequalities. Against a backdrop of fast-changing, violent student activism and nationalist politics on campus, a multidisciplinary team of Indian and British academics will collaboratively investigate minority students&apos; lived experiences of discrimination and equality on campus. It will examine what forms this discrimination might take and how different campus stakeholders (students, staff, managers) negotiate diversity on campus. The discussions that this network facilitates will focus on both structural (as related to the institutions and curricula of HE) and the social (linked to lived experiences) of discrimination. To enhance the welfare of minority students and the developmental potential of Higher Education (HE) as a tool for their social and economic mobility, we propose to critically engage with institutional culture, procedures, customs, practices, and social spaces - as these institutional expressions could be viewed as agencies of discrimination. Women, trans and sexual minorities will be part of our analysis as our exploration will be gendered. The network will use a post-colonial approach to create safe, knowledgeable and &apos;authentic&apos; (virtual and real) spaces where difficult questions around political dissent, freedoms and constitutional rights on campus can be investigated. It will contribute to improving HE access, experiences and outcomes for minority students and the social and economic mobility of the communities these students come from.  The main beneficiary of this research network is the HE sector in India. Two workshops and a symposium will facilitate discussions. The network outputs will include: an edited book, a journal article and two digital virtual outputs - (1) a visual timeline that illustrates minority contributions to the Indian HE sector, which will be informed by an in-depth literature review conducted as part of the network activities and (2) a mapping of student activism that will be underpinned by a survey of print and digital reporting around student activities.</narrative>
