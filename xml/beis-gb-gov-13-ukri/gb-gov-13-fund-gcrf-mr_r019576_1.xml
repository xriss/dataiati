   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Capacity building in dietary monitoring and public health nutrition in the Eastern Mediterranean Region Countries</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In common with many Western countries, the Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR) has a major problem with obesity and the associated public health issues. The World Health Organization (WHO) has been developing new health policies to lower intakes of sugar, saturated fats, trans fats and salt with the aim of reducing the risk of non-communicable diseases (diabetes, cardiovascular disease and obesity) in children and adults. To implement these policies successfully it is essential to have high quality food composition and food intake data to underpin research into the links between diet and health and to enable effective dietary monitoring and policy development. Most EMR countries use international food composition tables that include foods consumed in western diets with different nutrient composition, especially for mixed and traditional dishes. Some of these data from other countries are outdated and do not reflect the composition of foods currently consumed in EMR countries, meaning that calculated nutrient intakes are inaccurate. Methods of measuring dietary intake also need to be up-to-date and use appropriate food information. This project intends to provide technical and scientific support for researchers (mainly food and nutrition experts) in LMIC countries in the EMR, and will also provide training in the use of improved standardized methods for production and management of food composition and food intake data and also identify appropriate biological markers of food nutritional value and measurements of health outcomes. A review will be undertaken of food and nutrient intakes in the LMICs to develop strategies for reducing sugary and fatty foods in these diets based on new WHO guidelines. The Quadram Bioscience Institute, that aims to develop solutions to worldwide challenges in human health, food and infectious disease and non communicable disease, will lead the project in partnership with the WHO EMR office. The latter will help to coordinate and co-align regional activities to ensure public health priorities are targeted effectively. Three main activities will underpin capacity building in the EMR with a focus on 10 target LMICs (Morocco, Tunisia, Egypt, Jordan, Palestine, Sudan, Lebanon, Pakistan, Iran &amp; Afghanistan). The project will build on existing links with the WHO EMR and will develop and extend activities with LMIC in the EMR. Four main activities are planned: (1) Training and knowledge exchange workshops; (2) Short-term exchanges of researchers; (3) Development and application of harmonised protocols for pilot sample collection, food analysis, data generation and creation of online regional food composition datasets; (4) Development of possible dietary and other strategies to support reduction in intake of sugary and fatty foods. The main outcomes will be to build capacity and practical skills in the LMIC to improve production, management and use of food composition and dietary intake data, and biomarkers. Knowledge of European and International standards will be disseminated, with support from WHO, to experts across the region. Networks of expertise within the region will also be an important outcome leading to increased collaboration and effective data sharing. The project will enable more efficient use of better quality, region specific, food composition and intake data that can be used for research, monitoring and policy development. This will benefit LMICs in the region by providing data and tools that can encourage reduction of sugar, saturated fat, trans fats and salt and thereby reduce the incidence of diet related disease.</narrative>
