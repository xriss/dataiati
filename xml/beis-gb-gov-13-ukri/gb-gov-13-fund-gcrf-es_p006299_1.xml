  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The network will define a new research agenda that considers how inclusive growth and structural economic transformation are related in different contexts; and the implications of that for reducing global poverty.   The driving ambition of the network is to establish and build the intellectual foundations and academic and non-academic network necessary for a future comparative research project with associated methodologies to be submitted as a large grant or centre application.  The network will assemble a highly international group with academics, policymakers in international aid agencies (the World Bank, the IMF, the UNDP and UNDESA) and bilateral aid agencies and networks (the UK-DFID and the OECD-DAC) and civil society organisations from emerging economies (via Oxfam&apos;s Inequality in Emerging Powers Civil Society Network), bringing together perspectives from political science, economics, public policy and development studies. The network will also actively disseminate the research to a wider academic, policy and civil society audience via a dedicated website, social media and academic associations. These different stakeholders will co-produce the new research agenda.  The network will be based around the following activities: a launch meeting and two substantive international workshops, a set of papers for a journal special issue and accompanying briefs, and a set of concept/regional and country notes; a dedicated website with project outputs and annotated literature searches; literature summaries and relevant datasets.  The proposal is directly and primarily relevant to the development challenges of the countries listed because it is about maximising poverty reduction; the project is about inclusive - shared - economic growth and is concerned with maximising the poverty reducing power of sustained, structural change-driven economic growth.   The project addresses a point of tension in the developmental objectives of these countries around inclusive growth and structural change which are linked by the dynamics of inequalities. The project will help understand better the inequality dynamics of inclusive growth and structural change and in particular identify how and what policy interventions governments of globalised economies can introduce or adjust or change to seek to balance their developmental objectives of inclusive growth and structural transformation, maximising poverty reduction and attaining the sustainable development goals that relate to poverty.  The following countries will directly benefit: India, China, Nigeria, Indonesia, Brazil, South Africa and the Philippines. This list of 7 countries is home to two-thirds of the world&apos;s extreme poor. The project would also be of relevance to a range of other new middle-income developing countries as well as established middle-income developing countries. It will also be of relevance to low-income or least developed countries considering pathways and policies for inclusive growth, structural economic transformation and poverty reduction.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The primary aim of the network is to establish and build the intellectual foundations and academic and non-academic network necessary for a future comparative research project with associated methodologies to be submitted as an ESRC large grant or centre application in 2018. The network will achieve this aim through five inter-related objectives: first, the network will assemble a highly international network of academics, civil society organisations and policymakers in international and bilateral agencies and in doing so bring together perspectives from political science, economics, public policy and development studies. Second, the network will conduct a launch meeting and two substantive international workshops. Third, the network will deliver an agenda-setting set of papers on the state of the art and future avenues for research in a journal special issue. Fourth, the network will build capacity at partner institutions in the seven countries in terms of early career researchers&apos; capacity to publish in international journals and engage and write large, collaborative, cross-country grant proposals; and also develop the capacity of CSOs in the seven countries to engage in co-production of evidence with academics. Fifth, the network will disseminate the outcomes of activities to a wider academic, policy and civil society audience via a dedicated website and social media.</narrative>
