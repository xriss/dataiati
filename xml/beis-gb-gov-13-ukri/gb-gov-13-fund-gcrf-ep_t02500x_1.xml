   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Antibiotic medicines are a vital resource for treating bacterial infections both in humans and in animals. Unfortunately, all around the world, some infections are becoming resistant to the antibiotics used to treat them. This could lead to a future scenario in which illnesses last longer, deaths increase, and the cost of treatment rises. Resistance additionally threatens livelihoods due to farmers&apos; reliance on antimicrobials in livestock production to meet growing demand. Under this scenario, the greatest impact will be felt in low-income countries, where infectious diseases are common and many families lack financial security. Antibiotic resistance is now considered to be one of the biggest threats to global health. The UN General Assembly has called for concerted action by every national government to limit the development and spread of drug resistance. The World Health Organization advocates urgent action, research and investment, through both the development of new antimicrobials and more responsible use of existing drugs.  Poor prescription practices such as overuse of antibiotics, partial doses, or non-adherence to the full treatment course, all create situations which are conducive to the selection and spread of resistant mutations. Health workers, pharmacists, farmers, caregivers and patients can all help tackle resistance by only dispensing antibiotics when they are truly needed, and by using the right drug in the right quantities. Improving the use of antibiotics thus ultimately involves developing effective interventions to guide the treatment decisions made by health workers, patients and farmers to discourage indiscriminate use.   The private sector plays an important role in provision of health care in many low-income countries, with a majority of patients and farmers depending on drug shops and informal providers for medicines - and cannot be overlooked in strategies to control misuse of antibiotics. Neither can antibiotic resistance be addressed by focusing on one sector in isolation - a holistic approach is needed for the effective control of antibiotics in animals and humans. Yet regulation of the private sector is an acknowledged weakness of the health system in many low-middle income countries.   The proposed cluster aims to address this challenge. We shall pool the knowledge and insights that have been generated in six projects previously funded by GCRF, to compare the situations, norms, experiences, and motivations that affect antibiotic use in humans and animals across a range of countries in Africa and Asia - to identify processes that can deter misuse of these valuable medicines and/or incentivize good practice. Our particular focus will be on antibiotics purchased from drug shops and informal providers in rural agricultural areas with limited access to healthcare. Our projects also look at the influence of interactions between private providers, government health workers and public officials, to gain a better understanding of how health systems in low-income countries can more effectively raise the quality of care available from private providers and improve treatment practices. We shall use this collective evidence to design an overarching intervention strategy, comprised of mutually-reinforcing components, aimed at combatting misuse of antibiotics purchased from drug shops and improving rural treatment services for humans and animals. This strategy will be tested in future studies.   Ultimately, the intervention strategies we develop are intended be of value to national governments, Ministries of Health and Ministries of Agriculture, in low-middle income countries in the formulation and enactment of national plans to counter the threat of antibiotic resistance.  Our findings can also be used to strengthen health services in rural areas.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="Our cluster will focus on global health and food systems in agricultural communities, as they constitute half the population in many countries of Asia and Africa. These communities face a dual challenge of (i) weak health systems with poor access to medical and veterinary services, as well as (ii) high levels of antibiotic misuse and overuse in humans and animals, widely regarded as a major driver of the rise and spread of antimicrobial resistance. Our previous studies (across a wide range of countries) have confirmed that the private health sector is a significant provider of healthcare for humans and animals in rural communities, including drug sellers and other providers that are outside the formal system and not easy to regulate, and the practice of  self-medication is common. Several projects have also noted the occurrence of crossover-use (antibiotics formulated for humans being used in animals, or humans using antibiotics formulated for use in animals), particularly where policies are weak and supply chains overlap between the medical and veterinary sectors, underlining the need for unified One Health approach to address antibiotic use.  There is a critical and urgent need for innovative thinking to disrupt this cycle of antibiotic misuse and poor access to good quality healthcare. Yet evidence of the kinds of interventions that could be implemented is scarce, and understanding of the incentives and barriers that could affect effectiveness and sustainability of interventions remains limited.   However, this knowledge is currently being generated by a number of GCRF-funded projects. This cluster aims to bring these projects together, through interactive workshops and knowledge exchange to conceptualise pragmatic interventions for the short, medium and long term.  Principal aim:  To design effective antibiotic stewardship interventions to curb misuse and overuse of antibiotics in animals and humans, while ensuring access to essential antibiotics and good quality of healthcare from private providers, in low-income agricultural communities.  Objectives:  1) To compare and contrast  emerging knowledge from recent and ongoing research across selected countries in Africa and Asia about (i) antibiotic usage in humans and animals in agricultural communities, (ii) antibiotic distribution and value chains and their influence on antibiotic use, and (iii) policy and regulatory strengths and weaknesses in relation to local social, economic and political realities.  2) To identify the key priorities to be addressed, potential points of nexus, and critical barriers and enablers to antibiotic stewardship interventions in agricultural communities across the different country settings.   3) To catalyse novel thinking to develop a theoretical framework that can facilitate the design of a common overarching intervention strategy which can be adapted to the different spcial, economic and political settings.  4) To undertake small-scale development research to explore the feasibility of proposed interventions with community-level stakeholders in India and Uganda   5) To draw up a broad research plan and set of protocols to test the intervention in selected countries of  South Asia and East Africa. This will form the basis of a future grant application.  This critical synthesis of evidence will (i) support quality improvement in the private sector and (ii) promote responsible use of antimicrobial medicines in agricultural communities in low-middle income countries.   This information is highly-relevant and timely for current strategic planning by national governments engaged in the elaboration of national plans to counter antimicrobial resistance. The project will also identify opportunities to build synergy across sectors, inform current debates on the role of the private sector in healthcare provision, and help shape models for future implementation"></capital-spend>
