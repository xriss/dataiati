  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Africa, the world&apos;s least urbanised region, is experiencing the fastest rates of urban growth on the globe. Although partly a consequence of natural population increase and reclassification of previously rural areas as urban, in many cities in-migration constitutes the dominant source of urbanisation. While this trend has potential to contribute to economic growth and dynamism, rapid urban population growth can leave already overstretched municipal authorities unable to catch up, leading to massive failures in infrastructure and service provision, proper tenure documentation, and regulated settlement patterns.   Africa&apos;s urban dwellers are increasingly vulnerable to risks relating to demographic pressure, impacts of climate and environmental change, and social, economic and political hazards. A significant proportion of Africa&apos;s urbanites are likely to settle in slums, with uncertain property rights and public services, and will struggle to secure a decent life in contexts of few employment opportunities. All too often these processes also produce increasing social tension, conflict and violence. These dynamics have direct and wide-ranging ramifications for the delivery of SDGs, most notably in terms of keeping up with service delivery demands and providing decent, well-paid jobs to a rapidly increasing urban population (SDG 8). This potentially translates into increasing vertical inequality (SDG 10), as well as difficulties in building sustainable cities (SDG 11) and ensuring peace, justice and the rule of law (SDG 16).  Yet despite the widespread consensus that urban sustainability and inclusion are now crucial for future stability and wellbeing in most African countries, the ways in which migration feeds into current urban challenges is poorly understood. Urban in-migration has complex and contradictory consequences in contemporary Africa, and is all too often associated with &apos;crisis narratives&apos; and disorder in the absence of an adequate knowledge base on when and how migration leads to conflict. Some existing research has explored changing rural-urban migration dynamics, while other research examines the rise in different forms of urban violence - but very little research has explored the crucial inter-relationships between all three phenomena (urbanisation, migration and violent conflict) in a sustained and comparative way. These relationships are however only like to rise in importance in the context of population growth, increased pressure on land, and displacement related to climate change.  MUCA will address this gap, providing an evidence base to facilitate a better understanding of the conditions under which migration combines with other factors to worsen urban conflict - or indeed to alleviate it. This will be pursued through a structured comparative research design that involves nine cities covering three very different kinds of migration-affected cities spread across the three research countries of Ethiopia, Nigeria and Uganda. These countries are chosen to offer a spread of Eastern and Western African cases and different legacies of conflict and population movement. The three city types are i) large &apos;primate&apos; cities affected by competition over high value land, high ethnic diversity and conflict over lucrative resources in the informal economy;  ii) secondary cities affected by major industrial investments (historically or more recently) that are seeing new forms of in-migration and conflict relating to tensions around employment, land, and service delivery; and iii) cities experiencing a major influx of people displaced by regional or international conflicts.    Through an exploration of the migration-conflict-urbanisation nexus in these cities, guided by the aims and objectives set out in the section on &apos;objectives&apos;, MUCA will  provide evidence for development agencies, urban planners, and policy makers to build a more peaceful urban Africa in the years to come.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project&apos;s overarching aim is to promote peaceful urban development in African countries experiencing rapid urban growth and extensive urban in-migration. All three of the case study countries have histories of extensive violent conflict which to varying extents are also shaping the present, and they all face intensifying risks of conflicts linked to migration and urban growth. Our aim therefore is to conduct a programme of research that can help to minimise such conflicts and promote peaceful African urban futures.   To realise this aim, the project has six key research objectives:   i) to investigate the main causes and drivers of urban conflict within African cities of differing sizes, demographic and socio-economic profiles, and experiences of migration;   ii) to explore how conflicts over control of key sectors of the informal economy manifest in these cities, and how these conflicts are affected by rural-urban migration;  iii) to explore how factors such as land rights, informal economies and governance, and resource and service availability and access influence resilience and vulnerability to conflict;   iv) to identify the main forms and manifestations of conflict that emerge in urban centres experiencing various forms of in-migration;   v) to examine how differing experiences of migration - and migration-related tension and conflict - inform understandings and practices of (exclusionary) urban citizenship; and   vi) to identify successful examples of community, and urban-scale, conflict-prevention/resolution and peacebuilding practices within African cities.   In addition to these research objectives, the project has a number of broader objectives:  - to support the co-development of three ARUA Centres of Excellence and deepen knowledge exchange between Eastern, Western and Southern Africa, as well as between these regions and the UK  - to help to build the capacity of ARUA universities, non ARUA &apos;young&apos; African universities and the University of Sheffield to engage in interdisciplinary, comparative and contextually-sensitive research in African cities  - to establish a global network of researchers with an interest in the intersection of migration, conflict and urban development in Africa, which can form the basis for continued research, capacity building and policy influence in the future.</narrative>
