   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Delhi was rated the most polluted city in the world for ambient air pollution by the WHO in 2014.  Some 46 million people live in and around Delhi - 18m in the city, and the remainder in the surrounding National Capital Region (NCR).  Annual mean levels of particulate matter (PM), the most important air pollutant for health in Delhi, exceeded WHO guidelines by a factor of 15 during 2014, and are responsible for very substantial chronic and acute health impacts, with attendant economic costs.  Development of effective strategies for improvement in air quality requires  quantitative understanding of the sources, formation processes, regional budgets and chemical and physical nature of airborne particulate matter; however, such knowledge is not yet available.   ASAP-Delhi addresses this requirement:  The project will provide a quantitative assessment of the sources, characteristics, abundance and formation processes for PM in Delhi and the surrounding NCR.  The project is designed to address key science questions (below), with a philosophy of obtaining insights into pollutant sources and budgets from high quality direct observation - i.e. based upon measurement of the species actually present in the air at ground level within Delhi, without dependence upon other data.  The project represents a focussed collaboration between leading researchers from the UK (Birmingham, Surrey) and India (IITD, NPL), who have a track record of successful joint collaboration and publications from previous funded air quality projects in Delhi.  ASAP-Delhi will (i) perform the most detailed physical and chemical characterisation of PM present in Delhi, and in the surrounding National Capital Region (NCR) to date; (ii) produce source profiles (chemical signatures) for the principal PM sources in Delhi; (iii) identify and quantify the contributions of different sources to the PM burden in Delhi (and the NCR) - for both PM mass concentration and particle number [with differing implications for health], by application of multiple, independent, established and novel receptor modelling approaches, such as chemical mass balance, radiocarbon, and number size distribution based source apportionment; (iv) estimate the impact of NCR emissions upon air quality in Delhi (key to effective regional air quality policy)  and (v) evaluate a series of new hypotheses for the formation of PM during pollution episodes, essential for accurate model predictions of future PM levels.  We will address these objectives through a series of field observations, combining online measurements with state-of-the-science offline analyses, in Delhi (urban background locations - year round sampling combined with two &quot;intensives&quot;), the surrounding NCR (seasonal measurements at five sites) and a rural background location (150 km upwind).  Our measurement strategy combines (i) established methodologies - to deliver a high quality, systematic, coherent measurement dataset, with a novel spatial distribution - and (ii) new state-of-the-science tools and analytical approaches.  This provides a balance between international quality observations (in support of ASAP-Delhi and other programme components) and novel metrics, whilst also recognising the realities of fieldwork in such environments.  ASAP-Delhi will draw upon results of other projects in the APHH India programme, and will provide the key observational insights in support of air quality model development, evaluation of human health impacts, and development of mitigation policies in the wider programme.     In addressing public health, policy and development issues, and providing a platform to enhance air pollution research in India, ASAP-Delhi addresses the ODA support categories of (i) people and (ii) research programmes, in addition to providing a step-change in understanding of the sources of PM in Delhi (the key insight required by policymakers).</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="ASAP-Delhi will provide an authoritative assessment of the sources, formation, characteristics and burden of air pollutants in Delhi, and the influence of the surrounding NCR (National Capital Region) city clusters, with a particular focus upon particulate matter (PM2.5 and nanoparticle abundance) as the pollutants with the greatest impact upon human health.    This project (ASAP-Delhi) addresses aspects of theme 1 (Sources &amp; Emissions) and theme 2 (Pollutant Processes) of the overall programme on Atmospheric Pollution and Human Health in an Indian Megacity, and comprises both stand-alone science objectives, and inputs to the wider programme.    The specific science objectives of ASAP-Delhi are to:  1) Characterise the abundance, chemical and physical properties of particulate matter (PM) in Delhi, and the surrounding NCR city clusters, with a focus on PM2.5 and particle number. 2) Produce source profiles including molecular markers for selected key particulate matter sources in Delhi, via targeted field observations, existing partner data and secondary data analyses. 3) Directly quantify the sources of PM (mass and number concentration) in Delhi and the surrounding national capital region city clusters using a suite of independent, established and novel receptor modelling methods. 4) Assess the impacts of the NCR City Cluster pollutant burden upon air pollution levels in Delhi (and vice-versa), via novel analyses of existing and new spatially-resolved observations.  5) Elucidate the formation mechanism(s) of particulate matter during severe pollution episodes in Delhi, by evaluation of a range of new and recently suggested hypotheses.   In addition to these self-contained science objectives, which address key current research questions and stakeholder needs, ASAP-Delhi will produce observational datasets for use in other components of the overall programme, and exploit results from other projects:  -ASAP-Delhi will exploit measurements made in DELHIFLUX (laboratory emissions signature characterisation; site provision); PROMOTE (online organic PM characterisation) and AIRQUALNET (PM spatial distribution).  -Outputs from ASAP-Delhi will support DELHIFLUX (emissions); PROMOTE and CADTIME (pollutant characterisation and seasonal, spatial distribution; process understanding; NCR PM budgets and regional import/export; model development and validation; mitigation policy development and evaluation); AIRQUALNET (sensor validation; pollutant spatial distribution) and DAPHNE (health-related pollutant characterisation, notably nanoparticles).    We will maximise the impact of our findings through collaborations with a range of stakeholders, from other researchers to policy makers, as outlined in the Pathway to Impact and overall Programme Integration Plan.     Note on Proposal Updates  ASAP-Delhi has been updated in response to the Integration Workshop held in mid-2016, and moderation panel feedback.  Principal changes to the programme of work relate to (i) expanded use of state-of-the-science online PM methodologies (WP1a) and new offline PM analyses (brown carbon, WP2); (ii) modifications to sampling sites and scheduling to integrate with other projects; and (iii) specific actions on data quality / assurance measures (WP1c).  Additional proposal changes provide expanded detail on areas highlighted at the Workshop discussion: Location and integration of the NCR sampling sites vs. those operated by the various pollution control boards (CPCB, DPCC, UPPCB, HPCB) and the SAFAR network, including a map, and refined project management to reflect the structure of the wider programme.  The overall goal, specific science objectives, and core funding request (staffing) remain unchanged, in keeping with the panel feedback."></capital-spend>
