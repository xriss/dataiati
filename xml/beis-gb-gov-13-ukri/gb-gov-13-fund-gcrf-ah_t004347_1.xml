   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Cultures of expertise: Academics in exile and their role in the future food security agenda for Syria (SyrianFoodFutures)</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Aims: The SyrianFoodFutures project aims to establish a network of diverse expertise between Syrian, Turkish &amp; UK researchers, practitioners &amp; decision-makers so that local cultural &amp; technical knowledge &amp; experience can be incorporated into socio-economic development &amp; reconstruction programmes to ensure a successful transition away from humanitarian provision of short-term food supplies &amp; agriculture inputs towards long-term contingency planning for food security &amp; adequate nutrition.    The Challenge: Sustainable Development Goal attainment is severely compromised not only in fragile &amp; conflict-affected countries (FCAS, such as Syria) but also in LMIC countries which host their refugee populations (such as Turkey, Jordan &amp; Lebanon). Under conditions of protracted conflict, food production, availability, distribution &amp; consumption is  compromised with attendant effects on food insecurity &amp; malnutrition. There is also extensive loss of in-country human &amp; intellectual capital as academics are displaced from high risk areas as a matter of safety &amp; security. Local knowledge, connection &amp; expertise offered by Syrian academics in exile in the Levant is a major part of Syria&apos;s intellectual &amp; cultural capital that has so far, been largely ignored by the intelligence gathering &amp; analysis activities informing humanitarian responses to the crisis. Furthermore, certain cultures of expertise (such as the arts &amp; humanities) are often de-prioritised by decision-makers &amp; funding bodies in favour of investments in projects which improve physical capital (infrastructure, technology &amp; agricultural inputs) &amp; natural resources to address immediate humanitarian food &amp; health security needs. As a result, relevant, context-specific intelligence &amp; expertise may be neglected or excluded from IGO, NGO-  or government-led social &amp; development programmes. The consequences are that some interventions may not be compatible with consumption habits, local practices, or growing conditions; agricultural inputs (such as new cultivars) may be supplied in advance of suitability testing &amp; without knowledge of any long-term unintended consequences on local species.    Anticipated Outcomes: This project will strengthen partnerships between UK researchers at the Universities of Edinburgh, Kent &amp; Aberdeen, &amp; Syrian academics Council for At-Risk Academics (Syria Programme) who are living in Syria &amp; in exile in Turkey, Jordan &amp; Lebanon. It will facilitate opportunities to build trusted relationships between scientists, academics &amp; decision-makers to promote integration of cultural &amp; technical knowledge &amp; expertise in international decision-making &amp; strategy development efforts for long-term future of Syria. We will use foresighting approaches (e.g. scenario planning) to create a platform for dialogue between diverse groups of stakeholders, in which we will explore a diverse set of plausible long-term futures for agriculture &amp; food production in Syria. This will allow us to co-construct sustainable, locally-informed strategies for research &amp; education to meet future needs. This approach will be informed &amp; grounded by foundation research led by Syrian academics (from the arts &amp; humanities &amp; agriculture &amp; food security networks within the Cara Syria Programme) to explore the history &amp; impact of cultural &amp; religious practice on agriculture &amp; food production, preparation &amp; consumption through different disciplinary lenses  - including Syrian folklore &amp; music. This will be complemented by ethnographic research about the impact of the conflict on current food environments (in Syria, Turkey, Jordan &amp; Lebanon). The Syrian Humming Project will seek to commemorate the accompanying emotional &amp; psychological aspects of food (in)security through an interactive online soundscape developed from a collection of hums &amp; related ethnographic narratives from displaced Syrian communities so that these collective memories, will not be forgotten in the future.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Vision: Our goal is to establish a network of diverse UK- Syrian-Turkish expertise which can sustainably connect with decision-makers in local &amp; international NGO/IGOs to identify priorities in research, training &amp; education &amp; provide a robust evidence-base for interventions to improve the long-term future of food security in Syria (SyrianFoodFutures Network).  Aims: To utilise innovative, transdisciplinary foresighting approaches to explore a diverse set of plausible long-term futures for agriculture &amp; food production in Syria in order to develop sustainable, locally-informed strategies for research &amp; education to meet these future needs. This approach will be informed by foundation research led by Syrian academics into the history &amp; impact of cultural &amp; religious practice on agriculture &amp; food production, preparation &amp; consumption through different disciplinary lenses  - including Syrian folklore &amp; music.   Strategic Objectives: 1. Collective Memory: To understand historical drivers of agriculture &amp; food production, preparation &amp; consumption, &amp; the response of this sector to historical shocks including drought &amp; war. 1.1 Foundation research: To forge interdisciplinary connections between Syrian academics in the arts &amp; humanities, food security &amp; agricultural disciplines to explore: a) the impact of modernisation &amp; conflict on gender roles &amp; identities in food production, preparation &amp; consumption; b) the history of agriculture in Syria (through the lens of Syrian folklore) &amp; lessons learned from previous &quot;shocks&quot; to the food system such as drought &amp; war; c) the impact of religious practice on the emergence of different types of food production/preparation pre- &amp; post- conflict. We will collaborate with the Forgotten Foods Network to disseminate relevant outputs. 1.2. Current food security environment: Ethnographic fieldwork (complementary to 1.1) will be conducted to identify knowledge gaps &amp; gather information from Syrian academics &amp; their extended networks (in Syria &amp; receiving host countries: Turkey, Jordan &amp; Lebanon) about their local agriculture &amp; food environments pre- &amp; post-conflict.  1.3. Syrian Humming Project: To explore, share &amp; commemorate the emotional &amp; psychological or &quot;felt experience&quot; of food (in)security through a series of participatory artistic interventions (including an interactive online soundscape developed from a collection of hums &amp; related ethnographic narratives/personal stories about food production &amp; preparation from displaced Syrian communities in receiving countries). This will be showcased at the end of the project both online &amp; in a residential art space in Istanbul, Turkey.  2. A Future Vision of Agriculture for Syria: To use foresighting tools to develop relationships, strengthen partnerships &amp; create a platform for dialogue between academics, decision-makers, practitioners &amp; lay people in order to facilitate integration of local knowledge &amp; expertise to improve decision-making &amp; strategy development for long-term &amp; highly uncertain futures.  2.1 Training: To deliver training to Syrian academics in foresighting techniques such as horizon scanning, &amp; scenario planning through access to online learning materials &amp; a 2-day face to face interactive meeting between collaborators. 2.2 Scenario Planning: To co-create with Syrian academics, practitioners &amp; decision-makers, a set of long-term &quot;what-if&quot; scenarios &amp; stakeholder-led strategies as part of a broad interdisciplinary futures toolkit for agriculture in Syria. This process will be designed to think about different strategy options around: livestock restocking, recovery of assets, land rights, access to markets, increasing social capital, promotion of knowledge &amp; technology innovation &amp; exchange, &amp; development of education &amp; training programmes to increase technical competence &amp; capacity at a local level to address short- &amp; longer-term Syrian stakeholder needs.</narrative>
