   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The exploration activities will build on prior participation by the audience at a workshop in June 2016 in South Africa which identified the top level programme challenges for HPC, Big Data &amp; Cloud services. In July 2016, those attendees who expressed a desire to play an active role in the development of the on-ramp use cases (hereafter known as SCIOP &quot;partners&quot;) were further engaged. SCIOP will therefore focus on two main activities:  1) A two-day integration exploration workshop with academic &amp; industry SCIOP partners in South Africa will develop &amp; integrate the research &amp; training activities that SCIOP must undertake beyond the exploration phase of delivery into a series of on-ramp use cases. These use cases will particularly target SMMEs (typically up to 50 employees) as this is where the greatest opportunity exists for capability improvement through training &amp; research in data science.  This workshop will be facilitated by Principal Investigator, Dr Anna Scaife at UoM with support from Project Partner Axillium Research who will generate the detailed scope and activities needed to launch a wider SCIOP engagement in 2017.  2) A full report, written over 4 weeks following the workshop, will summarise the workshop outcomes &amp; identify where innovation can be brought into SCIOP. Peer review of this report by the wider SCIOP stakeholder community will ensure that each use case maximises impact in the stated areas and is aligned to ODA guidance &amp; UN Global Goals.   During the workshop and subsequent analysis SCIOP will assess and review each use case against fully detailed, planned objectives, responsibilities and measurable outcomes to meet defined outcomes set by the UN Global Goals for (4) Basic Education, (8) Decent Work &amp; Economic Growth &amp; (9) Industry Innovation &amp; Infrastructure.   This exploration activity, to develop &amp; evaluate the integration &amp; operational aspects of the use cases, identifying touch points with existing SCIOP partners &amp; establishing where wider research partners in both SA &amp; UK are required, will be conducted in parallel to the development of a GCRF EOI.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="The proposed Exploration Project will further develop outcomes from a review carried out in June 2016 by the British High Commission to identify where the UK application of STFC-funded science, technology, applications and expertise in sub-Saharan Africa could contribute to African Big Data Strategy.   This application seeks to explore partnering opportunities between the UK &amp; Africa in Big Data, HPC &amp; Cloud services to address potential impact through SCIOP, the Smart Connected Innovation On-ramp Programme. With support from the British High Commission in South Africa, the programme has already developed the concept of an &apos;on-ramp&apos; which will support companies through the engagement process with HEI and government laboratories. SCIOP is now seeking to further explore the challenge of enabling African nations to translate scientific research in High Performance Computing, Big Data and Cloud services arising from STFC funded aspects of the Square Kilometre Array programme, and beyond, into wider high value industries.  The core aims of the programme are to; build long term relationships between industry &amp; academic stakeholders; &amp; identify opportunities for the UK to contribute to the African Big Data Strategy via partnering opportunities between the UK &amp; Africa in Big Data, HPC &amp; Cloud services. The programme is seeking to develop &amp; deliver the core objective through three foci:   i. Ensure inclusive &amp; equitable quality education &amp; promote lifelong learning opportunities in the fields of Big Data, HPC &amp; Cloud services - aligned to UN Global Sustainable Goal #4 ii. Enhance scientific research, upgrade the technological capabilities, encourage innovation &amp; substantially increase the skill base - aligned to UN Global Sustainable Goal #9 iii. Increase economic productivity through diversification, access to technology &amp; innovation; encouraging the formalization &amp; growth of micro-, small- &amp; medium-sized enterprises (SMMEs) - aligned to sustainable UN Global Sustainable Goal #8  Each on-ramp use case will be developed in line with the UN&apos;s Global Goals to increase the innovation, skills &amp; knowledge base for sustainable development &amp; Human Capital Development (HCD) in Southern African countries including Botswana, Ghana, Kenya, Madagascar, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, Zambia &amp; South Africa.   Core activities will focus on understanding impact, value &amp; the importance of Skills: Preparatory research has shown that human capital development is central to the next generation of data science applications both in the SKA programmes but also in the growing African markets of telecoms, cloud services &amp; online business. The project will explore a number of initial use cases which have been defined by Axillium Research working in South Africa with 6 key African institutes and 4 SME&apos;s which have already committed to support and develop the SCIOP programme alongside the University of Manchester.   SMME engagement is centrally important in Africa, where higher levels of skills are crucially important for employment and growth of the overall economy. As African science matures, these companies are also likely to be integrated into multiple supply chains of larger businesses and so SCIOP proposes to develop a baseline review of the economic benefits in social and economic terms through this exploration activity.  Across Africa as a whole there are currently neither sufficient training courses nor staff to support the development of the required people with skills &amp; talent to address the scientific challenges and so the SCIOP partners propose to develop the Use Case concepts further by detailing the integration between each use case and the impact criteria for scaling each one. We will then down-select a nominal number of key use cases to support the programme development through further funding, ideally GCRF."></capital-spend>
