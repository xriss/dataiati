  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">As digital technologies - the internet, web, mobile phones, social networks, 3D printers, etc - spread around the world, both work and business are changing via creation of digital economies. There has already been impact in developing countries: thousands of digital startups, millions working in the ICT sector, millions more undertaking online work for platforms like Upwork. And the potential is even greater: hundreds of millions could access online work platforms, digital businesses like Uber and Airbnb are spreading rapidly, demand for digital enterprises is high, 3D-printing could level the manufacturing playing field, etc. But problems are also arising: most digital startups and digital careers fail; most citizens are unable to participate in digital economies; the benefits of digital work and trade seem to flow more to big corporations in the global North than to workers, enterprises or governments in the global South. The speed of change means much of this is happening in a knowledge vacuum. Researchers are playing catch-up to try to understand these new trends in the global North, but very little research on digital economies looks at developing countries or is done by researchers in those countries. As a result, there are four knowledge gaps about digital economies in the global South. We don&apos;t know: - what&apos;s going on and where;  - the development impact e.g. whether digital economies are increasing or reducing inequalities;  - what governments, NGOs and businesses should be doing to create an effective &quot;digital ecosystem&quot; that works for the benefit of all. And as researchers we are not sure what concepts and methods to apply. The &quot;Development Implications of Digital Economies&quot; (DIODE) Strategic Network aims to help fill these knowledge gaps. It has three main objectives: - To assess the current state-of-play and identify a future research agenda around the four knowledge gaps above. - To create a research network with the capacities to implement this research agenda on digital economies and development. - To develop specific research proposals that address identified research priorities. The network consists of senior and junior researchers from the UK, developing countries and other locations around the world who - along with those working in digital economy policy and practice - will work together to fulfil these objectives. Following initial synthesis studies to understand the current state-of-play, we will meet in four workshops - two in developing countries, two in the UK - each of which will address particular knowledge gaps through presentations and working group sessions. Alongside the network itself, by the end we will have produced a final report that provides a future research agenda; a strategy brief to guide those involved in digital economy policy/practice; and a set of research proposals that can put the agenda into practice. Initially, the main beneficiaries will be network members: we will have a far better understanding of what to research next and how to research it, with stronger capacity to undertake this work, and dense contacts to ensure our research is relevant to policy and practice. We will have created research capacity within and between developing countries, so that work on this important and growing phenomenon can be driven from and undertaken in those countries. GCRF and other researchers - especially in developing countries - will benefit from having a clear sense of research priorities and tools, but also from understanding how important digital economies are becoming in the global South. Digital economy policy-makers, entrepreneurs, worker organisations and other practitioners will understand what good-practice actions to take. Through that policy/practice connection, and through the outputs from later implementing our research agenda, we will make a difference to development:helping ensure digital economies work to deliver development goals.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">As digital technologies diffuse ever-further into developing countries, there are signs that a new &quot;digital development&quot; paradigm is emerging (Heeks 2014). A core component is growth of digital economies with a series of imbricated phases: from the digital enterprises of the ICT sector through digital labour from the Web 2.0 era, and emergence of digital work and digital platforms which are extending to become quasi-enclosed digital economies such as those operated by Upwork, Uber and Airbnb (Gregory 2016, Graham et al forthcoming). Together with trends of digital fabrication and trade, these sit within multi-layer digital ecosystems. Through digital enterprise and digital labour, digital economies already create livelihoods for millions of people in developing countries (Heeks forthcoming). Future potential is great: to expand online outsourcing / micro-work opportunities to tens of millions more (World Bank 2015), to catalyse formation of digital startups including those in the data economy, to build opportunities around new technologies like 3D printing, etc (MGI 2016). But there are two key development concerns about digital economies (World Bank 2016). First, that their transformative potential is significantly unrealised. Second, that they are generating new inequalities between capital, state and labour, including livelihoods that are precarious and unsustainable, and economic systems from which state and civil society institutions are increasingly excluded. Such concerns at present are largely hypothesised: what limited research there is has been almost entirely focused on the global North. Knowledge gaps exist in relation to all parts of the development value chain: the ecosystem inputs and innovations required to maximise potential; current practices, processes and business models; and impact on inequality, growth, livelihoods, capabilities, etc. New research is urgently needed, but there is a capacity gap to undertake that work, particularly within developing countries, and a theory/methods gap on how to undertake such research. The &quot;Development Implications of Digital Economies&quot; (DIODE) Strategic Network aims to help fill these gaps. It has three main objectives which are shaped to fit GCRF Strategic Network priorities: A) To assess the current state-of-play and identify a future research agenda around four knowledge gaps: mapping current activity; determining key development issues linked to innovation, growth and inequality; identifying the policy and practice requirements to maximise developmental value from digital economies; developing the right theories and methods to research this topic. B) To create a research network with the capacities to implement this research agenda on digital economies and development. C) To develop specific research proposals that address identified research priorities. The DIODE network will fulfil these objectives by bringing together a multi-disciplinary group of senior and junior researchers and practitioners from global North and South, with a particular focus on connecting and capacity-building those based in developing countries. It will undertake a small set of synthesis studies and then hold four themed symposia including action-planning workshops that will deliver a set of co-produced knowledge outputs including: - a Final Report that provides a future research agenda and also identifies key research challenges, capacity-building needs, and next action steps; - a Strategy Brief to guide those involved in digital economy policy/practice;  - a set of research proposals that can put the agenda into practice; and - a series of working papers and journal articles on digital economies and development.</narrative>
