   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Peacekeeper Fathered Children in Haiti</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">As of April 2016, a total of 103,510 uniformed personnel from 123 countries were serving in 16 peacekeeping operations around the world. Where foreign soldiers - during war, occupation or peacekeeping operations - are on foreign soil, military-civilian relations develop, including those between soldiers and local women. Peacekeepers have increasingly been associated with sexual exploitation and abuse of the vulnerable populations they had been mandated to protect. Many of the intimate relations between peacekeeping personnel and local women, of both voluntary and exploitative nature, have led to pregnancies and to children being born. These so-called &apos;peace babies&apos; and their mothers face particular challenges in volatile post-conflict communities, reportedly including childhood adversities as well as stigmatization, discrimination and disproportionate economic and social hardships.  This project proposes an in-depth-study on the situation of &apos;peace babies&apos; conceived by personnel from or associated with the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH). MINUSTAH is among the missions associated with allegations of misconduct, not least related to sexual and gender-based violence and consequently the unintended legacy of children fathered by UN personnel. The UN has recently acknowledged that &apos;peacekeeper babies&apos; exist. Yet, an evidence base relating to the welfare of children fathered by UN peacekeepers (globally or in Haiti) is virtually non-existent, and it is clear that the existing UN policies and support programs are inadequate.  The proposed study addresses this critical knowledge gap through the following original contributions:  - Theoretical contribution - analysing the lack of accountability of the UN and its personnel for children fathered by UN peacekeepers by introducing a victim-centred approach;  - Empirical contributions: i) exploring the gender norms, and the socioeconomic, cultural and security circumstances that contribute to unequal power relations between UN personnel and local civilians; ii) mapping the whereabouts of &apos;peace babies&apos; in Haiti through a situational analysis of the areas surrounding six UN bases and exploring the circumstances around their conceptions; and iii) investigating the life experiences of women raising children fathered by peacekeepers; and  - Methodological contribution - using an innovative mixed quantitative/qualitative research tool, Cognitive Edge&apos;s SenseMaker, to provide a more nuanced understanding of these complex issues.  The multidisciplinary collaboration between scholars from the University of Birmingham, Queen&apos;s University, Kingston, the Centre of International and Defence Policy, and Haitian-based Enstiti Travay Sosyal ak Syans Sosyal (ETS), along with civil society organisations, the Institute for Justice and Democracy in Haiti and Haitian-based Bureau des Avocats Internationaux, will address this knowledge gap and enhance our understanding of the challenges faced by peace babies and their families as well as the obstacles to accessing support. Beyond the core UK-Canada-Haiti partnership, the project will include further  ODA-recipient countries (among others Cambodia, Bosnia, Liberia and the DRC) and in a final project conference will apply insights from Haiti to Peace Support Operations (PSO) more generally in discourse with academic and non-academic participants from  other countries with extensive PSO experience.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Children born of war (i.e. fathered by foreign soldiers and born to local mothers) have become the subject of considerable academic interest in the past decade. Yet, the UN, member states, and indeed academia, have all but ignored the need to understand and address issues concerning women who bear and raise &apos;peace babies&apos;, children fathered by UN peacekeepers. Although the UN has acknowledged that children fathered by peacekeepers should have access to support, only ad-hoc measures have been offered, and laws and policies in place at both the national and international levels are widely judged to be inadequate.  The proposed project complements a pending AHRC network application submitted under the recent Global Research Challenges Highlight with the network focussing on the development of a sustainable international cross-sectoral collaboration and this project on co-production of knowledge, methodology development and data collection.  This project has six key objectives:  1. To explore and analyse, through an innovative collaboration between the PI (Lee, UoB) and CoI (Bartels, Queen&apos;s University, Kingston) and a broader, cross-disciplinary network of scholars from the global north and south, the challenges faced by peacekeeper-fathered children due to their biological origins and resulting life circumstances. In doing so, the project will challenge and reframe contemporary scholarly and policy perspectives on the nature of &apos;human security&apos; and provide empirical data on local experiences and perceptions of peacekeeping  and peacekeepers&apos; children in Haiti which are largely absent from peacekeeping studies.  2. Through adopting a novel methodology for data collection based on CognitiveEdge/Sensemaker narrative (http://cognitive-edge.com/sensemaker/) to arrive at a more nuanced understanding of the complexities of post-conflict societies in order to prompt debate and reflection within policy and scholarly communities about vulnerabilities in PSO (Peace Support Operations)-host communities as well as to raise awareness of the challenges faced by peacekeeper-fathered children and their mothers.   3. To bring together and consolidate an inter-disciplinary network of researchers, policy-makers and practitioners interested in the project&apos;s themes from a number of perspectives and disciplinary approaches. A core group of six will take part in the majority of workshops across the project&apos;s lifetime to build coherence and to provide space for dialogue and the production of joint outputs. Apart from the co-design and co-creation of knowledge and outputs, another key objective is to take the project&apos;s concerns further through a larger funding application in which the project&apos;s finding in the Haitian context can be tested in other geopolitical contexts and analysed comparatively following the project&apos;s conclusion.  4. To co-develop, co-design and co-produce the project&apos;s methodological and epistemological framework and its outputs with academic and policy colleagues from across disciplines and from institutions in the global south and north.   5. Through inclusion of local Early Stage Researchers in the in-country data collection to build research capacity among Haitian ESRs in order to enhance local capacity sustainably.    6. To produce outputs authored and co-autoried by PI and CoI and other members of the core project team over the course of the project (see Case for Support and Pathways to Impact) - and beyond - to steer and influence critical academic debate on peacekeeper-fathered children and the societal impacts of peacekeeping on host countries more generally. Outputs will include four articles based on the study data and workshop discussions, briefing notes and blog pieces. PI and CoI will work with key members of the group to tailor outputs to specific groups of stakeholders, including the UN, local NGOs and local/regional policy-makers who are less often targeted in academic dissemination strategies.</narrative>
