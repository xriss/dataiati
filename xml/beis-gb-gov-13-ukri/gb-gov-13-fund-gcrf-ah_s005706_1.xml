  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Building on the successful AHRC funded StoryLab International Film Development Research Network project (storylabnetwork.com) that was delivered by Professor Erik Knudsen (University of Central Lancashire, UK) and his team, Dr Nico Meissner (Griffith Film School, Australia), Dr Carolina Pati&#xF1;o (University of Ibagu&#xE9;, Colombia) and Sarah Kuntoh (National Film and Television Institute, Ghana), in the ODA countries of Malaysia, Ghana and Colombia during 2017, this proposed StoryLab Skills Training for Democratised Film Industries project will build on the experiences gained, methodologies developed and the network of independent filmmakers with whom the project engaged, to research and develop a scaleable skills training impact strategy and framework to be rolled out across Colombia. Where the AHRC network allowed us to explore the content and styles of the stories being expressed in the 3 ODA countries, a Follow-on Funding for Impact and Engagement grant would allow us to venture into new unexplored territory of seeking an understanding of how the methodologies developed in the AHRC Network project could be applied to economic and cultural benefit through innovative skills training and understanding the importance of the role of cinematic storytelling in economic and cultural development.  While there are many existing programmes that target technical (digital) skills training, young people, globally, increasingly have advanced digital skills, but lack experience of original ideas generation and storytelling skills. These are essential skills that underpin any technological knowledge and lead to advanced development of creative craft skills that can be deployed in a variety of employment contexts. The focus of this skills training research project will therefore be on story and narrative skills, contextualised within creative entrepreneurial skills, including presentation, planning and communications skills.  Three research questions lie at the heart of the project:  a) How can original creative ideas generation and storytelling skills be embedded in a skills training programme for young people that takes advantage of democratised access to the filmmaking medium and industry in low to middle income countries? b) In what ways can entrepreneurial skills related to the articulation, selling and development of narrative ideas and stories be embedded in story and narrative film training for young people to empower and enable effective engagement with, and meaningful work within, emerging film industries? c) How can local and regional universities, training partners and policy makers work together to create a sustainable learning environment and what might this scalable, social networked and mentored platform look like and how can these services transcend class, gender and cultures to contribute to the development of a vibrant creative economic sector within a low to middle income economy?  Using interdisciplinary approaches inspired from music and anthropology, the StoryLab Skills Training for Democratised Film Industries project will utilise a methodology developed out of the AHRC funded StoryLab International Film Development Research Network entitled Ethnomediaology. Ethnomediaology is an interdisciplinary approach inspired by practices in Ethnomusicology and Autoethnography. Ethnomediaology involves the active and immersive participation of researchers in the research culture and process, using this active personal engagement as a basis for knowledge generation, data gathering, evaluation and impact implementation. In the case of skills training, it will involve the active participation of local and regional Colombian Filmmaker-Mentors, who will deliver the core workshops, local or regional University Partners and strategic local or regional Film Sector Partners.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The StoryLab Skills Training for Democratised Film Industries project aims to:  a) encourage and build the confidence in young men and women in Colombia to develop their cinematic storytelling skills, enable them to articulate, present and manage their ideas and product outcomes with a view to making them attractive to employers in the media sectors and clients in need of media products; b) empower young men and women in Colombia to fully participate in the emerging film production, film dissemination and film consumption economic sectors with a view to engaging with meaningful work and careers; c) develop a training model that will make use of existing independent filmmakers in Colombia in a mentor based approach to skills training in cinematic storytelling and creative entrepreneurship; d) provide a starting point for a scaleable national and international network, framework and platform for local and regional educators and policy makers in Colombia and beyond to build on to provide ongoing accessible skills training in cinematic storytelling and creative entrepreneurship.  Key objectives include:  1) StoryLab will work with strategic university partners, Griffith Film School, Australia, University of Ibagu&#xE9;, Colombia, and the University of Ghana, to deliver the research project; 2) Engage with strategic Film Sector Partners in Colombia and local and regional Policy Makers who will provide access to selected communities of young people seeking meaningful work and careers in film and will be beneficiaries of the impact aims; 3) Working with Colombian Filmmaker-Mentors selected from participants in the AHRC StoryLab International Film Development Research Network (a network of about 45 filmmakers, of whom about 18 are Colombian) the StoryLab Research Team will research and develop mentoring and training capacity in Colombia through an advanced series of training the trainers workshops; 4) Colombian Filmmaker-Mentors will deliver StoryLab training workshops to groups of Young Filmmaker-Mentees and Trainees in Colombia; 5) Filmmaker-Mentees in Colombia will, as part of their training, produce creative outputs that will be shared across the overall community of the StoryLab project, including members of the extended network in Malaysia and Ghana; 6) The StoryLab Research Team will critically reflect on, and analyse, initial creative research materials and findings and develop an evolved skills training strategy that would be applicable in other ODA countries, such as Malaysia and Ghana; 7) Deliver an International Symposium in Colombia to involve Partner Universities, Film Sector Partners, Policy Makers and Filmmaker - Mentor participants from Colombia to share best practice, establish international collaboration and strategies sustainable implementation of outcomes, including the unique lateral collaboration between academics and filmmakers across ODA countries of Malaysia and Ghana independent of relationships to the developed world (UK).</narrative>
