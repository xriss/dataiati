   <narrative xml:lang="EN">From local roots to global branches: making NDCs work for Blue Carbon at three different levels</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Blue Carbon habitats - mangroves, seagrass meadows and salt marshes - are unusually important and beautiful ecosystems. Stopping and reversing their loss commands the enthusiastic support of economists, ecologists, development experts and the millions of people who rely directly on their services. Blue Carbon habitats are also championed within climate change policy (such as the Paris Agreement) and international initiatives, because of the exceptional power of these places as natural carbon sinks. Two developments have the power to transform Blue Carbon conservation and management: Community Based Management (CBM) and Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) towards achieving the Paris Agreement. Our team brings unique expertise in both of these areas, with the aim of facilitating the fair, transparent and scalable incorporation of Blue Carbon into NDCs. Local projects lack global impact; international targets and top-down management can stifle and expropriate local innovations. Bringing our experience at local, national and international levels, our work will support the dynamism and justice of small CBM projects but link these with the global scale of international commitments. We will work at the local and national scales in Kenya and communicate lessons-learned to the international community.  Working with community, government and NGO stakeholders , the project has the following objectives:  1) To research, document and disseminate best practice for CBM projects in Blue Carbon habitats          specifically with the aim of assisting the establishment of new projects in East Africa which will act          as living models for local implementation of NDCs. 2) To work with the Government of Kenya in incorporating Blue Carbon into their NDCs in ways that          are sensitive to local needs and opportunities, as a case study for other nations. 3) To develop and disseminate best practice guidelines for other developing nations, and for the          developers and supporters of local Payments for Ecosystem Services CBM projects, in NDCs and          Blue Carbon to encourage synergy between local, national and international practice and policy.  Kenyan workstream milestones and outcomes of benefit to end-users  1) Clear explanation in policy of how current, local Blue Carbon projects (such as Mikoko Pamoja and          VBF) will complement NDCs without threatening local autonomy and development. 2) Kenyan Blue Carbon ecosystems acknowledged within NDCs and opportunities for conservation and          restoration identified. 3) Kenyan case study presented and published as an exemplar for other nations, with hard copy and          online outputs aimed at general (informed) and policy (expert) audiences. This will include the          specific example of how VBF is shaped to complement national NDC approaches, producing a          resource of vital relevance to community-based PES projects and their supporting NGOs and          validators (e.g. our partner, Plan Vivo Foundation).   International workstream milestones and outputs of benefit to end-users  1) Workshop to inform associated policy and media materials for a global audience 2) Policy brief(s) targeted to the international climate policy community at the UNFCCC and especially          beyond, to ensure national, cross-ministerial information sharing and capacity-building 3) Information brief(s) on practical advice for voluntary carbon offset projects 4) Media outlet detailing why and how to incorporate BC into NDCs, targeted at a policy and general          audience, with long term hosting on project charity site, as well as the dissemination via the          websites of NGO partners 5) Peer reviewed publication that supports and contextualises briefings</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Mangroves, tidal marshes and seagrass beds are beautiful habitats that support wildlife, protect coastlines and provide livelihoods to millions of people. They are also very powerful natural carbon sinks; for this reason they are known as Blue Carbon habitats. Under the Paris climate change agreement, signatories are obliged to submit Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) every five years. These detail the commitments of the countries to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Developing nations that have significant areas of Blue Carbon habitats could include the management, conservation, restoration and expansion of these areas as part of their NDCs, because Blue Carbon habitats are able to trap large amounts of carbon which is released as carbon dioxide when they are destroyed. Hence the NDC process offers a new opportunity to work towards the global conservation and sustainable management of Blue Carbon habitats, for the benefit of the people and wildlife who rely on them and for the climate.  Incorporating Blue Carbon into NDCs may be difficult, however, and could bring problems to existing conservation projects. It is a technical process relying on expertise not common in developing countries. If governments decide to include all their Blue Carbon habitats, that may interfere with projects already running successfully, diverting funds from local people to central bureaucracies. Hence incorporating Blue Carbon into NDCs offers a major opportunity but has technical and resource challenges as well as risks of inappropriate top-down control.  The local roots and global branches project team brings unique expertise in Blue Carbon ecology, management and policy at local, national and international levels. We include experts who have developed world leading local mangrove conservation projects, who have helped changed national practice and who have studied the international policy agenda and identified global opportunities. We will apply this expertise to achieve the following objectives:  1) To research, document and disseminate best practice for community based projects in Blue Carbon          habitats, working with a new project in Kenya that will act as a living model for local implementation          of NDCs. 2) To work with the Government of Kenya in incorporating Blue Carbon into their NDCs in ways that          are sensitive to local needs and opportunities, as a case study for other nations. 3) To develop and disseminate best practice guidelines for other developing nations, and for the          developers and supporters of local conservation projects, in NDCs and Blue Carbon to encourage          good co-ordination and support between local, national and international practice and policy.  Our work will have direct impact on the local community in Kenya (where our focal project is based) and the Kenyan government and people (since we aim to directly assist them in preparation of their NDCs). It will also have broader, indirect impact by acting as a model for other developing countries and we will actively disseminate lessons learned at appropriate international fora. Our project partners are: Kenya Forest Service - the lead Kenyan agency with responsibility for mangrove conservation. Save Our Mangroves Now! - an international campaign led by NGOs including World Wildlife Fund and IUCN aiming to achieve global mangrove conservation. Plan Vivo Foundation - charity specializing in supporting community based forest conservation projects.   In addition we have stakeholders including the Kenya Marine and Fisheries Research Institute, IUCN, the Association for Coastal Ecosystem Services, Edinburgh Napier University and the National University of Singapore.
