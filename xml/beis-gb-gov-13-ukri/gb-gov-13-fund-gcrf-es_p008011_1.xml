   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Drug-resistant tuberculosis (DR-TB) is a major threat to global public health, causing one in four estimated worldwide deaths attributable to antimicrobial resistance. In South Africa, DR-TB transmission within clinics, particularly to HIV-positive people, is well-documented. Most TB transmission happens before people start TB treatment, but DR-TB transmission may continue after treatment is started, raising concern as DR-TB services in South Africa are decentralised from hospitals to primary care clinics. The extent to which exposure in clinics, as compared to other community settings, drives ongoing transmission of DR-TB requires better definition, to mobilise necessary resources to address this problem. Guidelines for clinics concerning infection prevention and control (IPC) measures to reduce DR-TB transmission are widely available. There is ample evidence that recommended measures are not put into practice, but limited understanding of the reasons. A comprehensive approach to understanding barriers to implementation is required to design effective IPC interventions for DR-TB.    Failure of IPC measures for DR-TB is often attributed to health care workers (HCW) failure to adhere to guidelines. Cognisant that HCW are part of a health system with specific organizational features, we examine how the health system as a whole supports IPC measures. We investigate the biological, environmental, infrastructural, and social dynamics of DR-TB transmission in clinics in two provinces in South Africa (KwaZulu-Natal and Western Cape). Our aim is to provide evidence for effective ways to improve IPC for DR-TB, addressing not only behavioural factors, but also the ways in which clinic space, infrastructure, work and patient flows are managed, and a rights-based occupational health ethos might be cultivated.  Our innovative approach brings together a team from several scientific disciplines.Taking a &apos;whole systems&apos; approach, we will use methods from epidemiology, anthropology, and health systems research to understand the context, practice, and the potential for effective implementation of IPC for DR-TB. We will examine how South African policies on IPC for TB have evolved and been implemented. The epidemiological context will be defined by estimating how much DR-TB transmission happens in clinics compared to other community locations. We will estimate the risk of contact between people with infectious DR-TB and other clients within clinics, and separately estimate, among community members, the frequency of social contacts in clinics as compared to other settings where people meet.  We will use structured and in-depth qualitative methods to document IPC practice in health clinics: the role of clinic design, organisation of care, work practices, as well as HCW, manager, and patient ideas about risk and responsibility in IPC. In collaboration with key stakeholders, we will use health systems mapping and model-building exercises to visually document the environmental and organizational barriers and enablers to implementing optimal DR-TB IPC.  Synthesis of all these data will lead to development of a package of health systems interventions to reduce DR-TB transmission in clinics, adapted to the constraints and opportunities of the South African health system. We will use mathematical and economic modelling to project the potential impact of interrupting clinic-based transmission on community-wide TB incidence, and the consequent economic benefits for health systems and households.  In addition to significant academic, policy and programme-relevant outputs, the project will create an interdisciplinary platform for future implementation and evaluation of health systems strategies to improve IPC. It will stimulate discussion between researchers working on DR-TB and other drug-resistant infections, and foster greater public awareness of the importance of systems that minimize the risk of airborne infections in health facilities.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="This project employs an interdisciplinary whole systems approach to examine the social, biological and infrastructural dynamics of nosocomial transmission of drug-resistant tuberculosis (DR-TB) in two provinces in South Africa, with the aim to inform health systems interventions for improving infection control for DR-TB.  Our objectives are grouped in three successive phases of research that address the macro-, meso-, and micro-levels of the health system:  I. Policy and epidemiological context Objective 1. To trace the evolution and implementation of policies on infection control for DR-TB in the context of primary care reforms in South Africa Objective 2. To estimate the extent to which transmission of DR-TB within health facilities contribute to DR-TB transmission at community level   II.  Infection control in practice Objective 3. To examine the influence of clinic design, organisation of DR-TB care, and working practices on infection control   Objective 4. To elicit health worker and patient understandings of risk and responsibility in their accounts of infection prevention and control for DR-TB  III.  Infection control interventions and impact Objective 5. To determine what kinds of behaviour change or health systems interventions are most likely to be feasible, affordable, and sustainable to improve IPC within the existing South African health system ?  Objective 6. To project the likely impact of reducing nosocomial transmission of DR-TB (and DS-TB) in South Africa on DR-Mtb (and DS-Mtb) transmission overall.   Objective 7. To estimate the economic impact of reducing nosocomial transmission in South Africa from a health services and household perspective"></capital-spend>
