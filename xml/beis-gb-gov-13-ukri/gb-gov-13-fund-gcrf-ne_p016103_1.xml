   <narrative xml:lang="EN">MANTRA: Increasing maternal and child health resilience before, during and after disasters using mobile technology in Nepal</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In emergency situations, women of childbearing age do not stop becoming pregnant or giving birth. However, humanitarian emergencies often negatively impact health care systems, through damaged or destroyed critical infrastructure which restrict perinatal women and their newborns access to reproductive and maternal health care. This is particularly the case in rural remote regions, such as mountainous areas of Nepal, where frequent earthquakes and landslides pose significant hazards to an already limited healthcare infrastructure. Understanding the needs of perinatal women and newborns in emergencies and developing adequate interventions to increase their resilience (i.e. their capacities to protect themselves and recover), should be part of any Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) planning or response and yet these needs are often unmet. In such crises, Female Community Health Volunteers (FCHVs), who generally support mothers and encourage them to seek care in the perinatal period, may themselves be cut off from the health facilities that they serve and may be struggling to cope in the same way as other community members. Urgently needed information and knowledge may exist but be inaccessible for a number of reasons including: inappropriate use of technical language, text-based information inaccessible to those with low or no literacy, denigration of local knowledge, restrictions on the freedom of movement or access to communications of women and girls, and infrastructure damage that obstructs travel to and from healthcare services.  Empowering women to improve their health has been successfully implemented by UCL IGH, in partnership with Nepalese NGOs, by training FCHVs to run participatory learning and action women&apos;s groups focused upon maternal and newborn health. This community-based intervention was found to reduce mortality in the first month of life (i.e. during the neonatal period) by 30% in Nepal (Manandhar at al 2004) and has been effective in reducing neonatal and maternal mortality (Prost et al 2013). However, to date this approach has not been oriented towards resilience during emergencies, and neither has it been adapted to take advantage of the rapid growth in access to mobile technology in developing countries. Therefore, this project investigates how to improve access to information and communications to support maternal and child health before, during and after a disaster. It aims to do this by developing mobile technology to support and expand existing participatory learning public health interventions and social protection mechanisms, especially in rural areas of Nepal. By doing so, this initiative addresses some of the priorities highlighted in the UN Sustainable Development Goals, and the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030 to support maternal, newborn and child health, as well as sexual and reproductive health. This research combines geosciences (e.g. scientific knowledge of natural hazards and risk assessments based on satellite imagery), social sciences (e.g. attention to gender, vulnerability and health in the context of disasters), technology (e.g. mobile apps) and arts (e.g. through participatory learning, and visual and textual health care communications) to devise new ways of rapidly deriving data from satellite interpretation and fieldwork that can be developed into a meaningful risk interpretation for local communities. Through adding a mobile phone &apos;app&apos; the objective of this project is to make evidence-based information (e.g. oral survivor accounts, locally-generated photographs, drawings, videos, stories, and historical recollections) and learning wider-reaching and accessible, especially when paper booklets or picture cards might be unavailable or damaged and when disasters have cut off lifeline infrastructure.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Objective 1: Understanding and characterising risk, culture and knowledge.  1.1a Characterise the environmental risk in one high-risk region heavily impacted by the 2015 earthquakes. Interpretation of post-earthquake satellite imagery with field investigation to ascertain ground truths to identify areas of highest residual hazard. Identify appropriate forms of messaging to communicate particularly risky locations and environmental signs and draw up guidelines for risk reducing behaviour. 1.1b Develop a methodology and roll out the risk assessment techniques with local geo-specialists.  1.2 Assess the acute needs of perinatal women and newborns and FCHVs, and evaluate how and where mobile technology may be an appropriate support mechanism. Recruit local FCHVs and a cohort of women who were pregnant, delivering or recently delivered at the time of the earthquakes and those who were supporting such women. Use focus group discussions (FGD) and one-to-one interviews, to provide a detailed understanding of risk knowledge and understanding, health and other needs at the time, and opportunities to strengthen readiness to respond during humanitarian emergencies.  1.3. Explore how learning through, and improving communication with, mobile technology might be applied in emergency as well as non-emergency situations, so as to be ready to respond.  Objective 2: Songs, stories, oral histories and images of risk and risk reducing behaviour.  Based on the Photovoice approach which aims to support people record their community&apos;s strengths and concerns, build knowledge on important issues through photographs, and reach policymakers (Wang and Buris, 1997), we will collect oral, textual and visual materials to use as an evidence base of the resilience of pregnant and lactating women during previous disasters and the factors that helped them cope and recover. Through combining old pictures with new visual evidence collected by the research participants through participatory photography, the project aims to set up a photographic exhibition on communities&apos; resilience with a focus on maternal health. This collaborative exhibition between the project researchers, local photographers and FCHVs will be  staged locally, in Kathmandu and subsequently in London; as well as in digital and paper form to showcase to a wider public.   Objective 3: Communicating risk, resilience and response. Method: Technology pilot development and participatory learning and action. This objective is to tie the visual, oral/aural and textual evidence to guideline messages for recognizing local risks and signs; and preparing for emergency and health and risk reduction needs of perinatal women and children, in a locally contextualized form.  The project will develop and pilot a platform for interactive learning for FCHVs, women and other community members using mobile applications. Existing digital educational content from tested women&apos;s groups and newly gathered local knowledge will be turned into interactive, pictorial and multimedia training resources, specifically designed for low levels of literacy, that can be rapidly disseminated and used for community health education and applied before, during and after emergencies. It will also enable women to create content themselves (such as home made films, pictures, stories and text) and communicate with other groups to seek support and improve resilience. A back end &apos;dashboard&apos; will be piloted for collecting and disseminating new evidence to the app users.</narrative>
