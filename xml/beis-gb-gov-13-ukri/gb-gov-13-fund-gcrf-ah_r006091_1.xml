   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Development of an intervention to support reproductive health of women after seeking medical abortion in Cambodia</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The aims of this partnership are to:  1. Develop a long-term research collaboration between the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) and the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS) in field of mobile/digital health in LMICs, particularly in Southeast Asia. The goal of the partnership is to integrate findings, methods, and research projects from the public health field, the area of focus of LSHTM, with the regional, linguistic, and cultural expertise of SOAS. This grant would allow the two institutions to start a joint exploratory research project to test, in the field, how to integrate respective methods and perspectives while focusing on a specific research question.   2. Develop a joint research project between LSHTM and SOAS to study reproductive health after abortion and mobile phone use among factory workers in Cambodia from a medical, cultural, and information-sharing practices perspectives. The project responds to the problem of a decrease in interdisciplinary collaboration particularly evident in health-related research by bringing together three different approaches to researching health issues in LMICs:  1. public healthcare;  2. information circulation and sharing, and trust building among marginal communities;  3. linguistic and cultural adaptation of communication models.   3. Integrate project-based qualitative methods used in the medical field with the long-term orientated ethnographic methods and linguistic approaches from the humanities, to better understand the socio-cultural implications of digital technologies in healthcare in LMICs. In particular, the project aims at integrating ethnographic and linguistic research methods with Intervention Mapping (IM), a method commonly used in health research to develop health behaviour change interventions. IM is an iterative and cumulative process that consists of the following steps: (1) needs assessment; (2) specifying behavioural change to result from the intervention; (3) designing the intervention; (4) producing and refining the intervention content; (5) planning intervention implementation and (6) planning intervention evaluation. This project will focus on steps 1-4 and will bring a cultural, linguistic and sociological perspective to these phases.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The aims of this partnership are to: (1). Develop a long-term research collaboration between the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) and the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS) in field of mobile/digital health (delivering health care via mobile phones) in low and middle-income countries (LMICs), particularly in South-East Asia. (2). Conduct a joint research project between LSHTM and SOAS to study reproductive health after seeking induced abortion for unintended pregnancy and mobile phone use among factory workers in Cambodia from holistic medical, cultural, and information-sharing practices perspectives; (3). Integrate project-based qualitative methods (such as interviews and focus groups) used in the medical field with the long-term orientated ethnographic (observational) methods and language approaches from the humanities, to better understand the socio-cultural implications of digital technologies in healthcare in LMICs.   Understanding Cambodian female factory workers reproductive health needs after medical abortion (MA), together with understanding how people seek information, share information and use mobile phones could help inform the development of a relevant and highly used intervention to support comprehensive post-abortion care (such as support for side-effects or health issues and contraception use). In order to do so, however, it is necessary to understand (1). Women&apos;s current behaviours in information seeking and sharing; (2). The way in which people currently use mobile phones, and how they fit within off-line practices of information sharing; (3). Cultural challenges around reproductive health, both also mobile phones; (4). Linguistic challenges around mobile phone use, e.g. language input, or oral versus written practices. A partnership between LSHTM, with medical expertise, SOAS, whose specialisation is on socio-cultural and language aspects of mobile phone communication in Asia, and Marie Stopes International, a Non-Governmental Organisation long involved in the field and active in Cambodia, would allow understanding of the situation, challenges, and potential solutions from a truly holistic perspective.   The partnership will involve activities in the UK and Cambodia with the following goals:  (1): In London, develop research collaboration between LSHTM, SOAS, and Marie Stopes in the field of Digital Health and in the context of South-East Asia through (a) inter-disciplinary Digital Health research seminars, to be held monthly at LSHTM and SOAS, about themes arising from the research project and open to staff, students and NGOs (specifically this will involve the expansion of the LSHTM eHealth group (http://ehealth.lshtm.ac.uk/) to SOAS with a new name and website e.g. a &quot;Bloomsbury Digital Health group&quot;); (b) collaboration between PhD and MSc/MA students at the respective organisations by involving them on the research project and seminars; (c) monthly meetings between the four named UK-based project staff to review progress and plan next steps of the project and potential future projects.  (2): In Cambodia, develop a common field work approach based on research methods from both disciplines, in order to: - understand current behaviours around post-MA information sharing and seeking (both with and without mobile phones)  - design a pilot intervention delivered by mobile phone to support reproductive health of women who work in factories around Phnom Penh.   In London and in the academic community, the partnership will benefit both the wider Digital Health and reproductive health research and practitioner groups through research seminars, peer-reviewed publications and conference presentations, and student training. In Cambodia, Marie Stopes staff and research assistants will be trained in qualitative research methods skills that are transferable across disciplines, and that can create more culturally sensitive interventions.</narrative>
