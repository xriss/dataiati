   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The ability of fungal pathogens to survive the armoury of defences employed by the human immune system is vital for such pathogens to cause life-threatening infections. These defences include the production of highly toxic oxidants which damage all of the main components of the fungal cell leading to cell death. The laboratory headed by Professor Jan Quinn has extensive experience in studying how certain fungal pathogens mount responses to these oxidants, to allow the pathogens to evade immune-cell killing mechanisms. In particular the Quinn lab have studied stress responses in the major human fungal pathogen,  Candida albicans, which has provided much  insight into stress adaptation of this fungal pathogen to the host environment. In contrast, much less is known about stress response mechanisms in fungi belonging to the Sporothrix schenckii complex, which are the causative agent of sporotrichosis - a prevalent frequent fungal disease in Latin America. Two such fungi, S. schenckii sensu stricto and S. brasiliensis have been associated with endemic areas in Brazil. It is likely that such pathogens need to mount robust stress responses to survive host defences, and the overall goal of this research partnership is to facilitate a molecular study of stress responses in the emerging pathogens S. schenckii sensu stricto and S. brasiliensis.</narrative>
