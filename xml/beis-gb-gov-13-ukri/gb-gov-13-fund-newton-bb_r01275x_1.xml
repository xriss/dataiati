   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Broadly protective vaccines for porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome and swine influenza virus infections</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Pig production is the fastest growing livestock sector across Southeast Asia and intensification of pig production has led to an increase in diseases, including respiratory diseases, which are a major cause of economic losses in the pig industry worldwide. Two viruses, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus and swine influenza virus, are major contributors to respiratory disease in pigs. Prevention of infection with the two viruses would significantly improve the welfare of pigs in Thailand and minimise economic losses due to respiratory disease. To do this, we will collaborate with Thai scientists to test innovative new vaccines against these two viruses, which will prevent infection and disease.  Because there are many strains of both viruses, the vaccines need to be tailored to the virus strains that circulate in Thailand. Our Thai partners have used their detailed knowledge of these strains and sophisticated molecular biology methods to make vaccine candidates that have the best chance of protecting against the diversity of local viruses. The candidate vaccines will be tested in the UK to determine whether they stimulate a powerful immune response. Thai scientists will come to the UK to learn these immunological methods. The candidate vaccines that stimulate the most powerful immune response will then be tested in Thailand to see if they can protect pigs against infection with the viruses both under laboratory conditions and in the field. We wish to understand why these two viruses predispose pigs to severe respiratory disease. To study this question, pigs will be infected with each virus separately or together and the immune responses to each virus will be analysed in detail to learn how the immune response is altered leading to exacerbated disease. The project will develop broadly-protective vaccines tailored to Thai virus strains and will transfer expertise in immunology and vaccinology to Thai scientists to facilitate the implementation of vaccine programmes for porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome and swine influenza viruses in Thailand. These technologies can then be adapted to other pathogens and livestock species.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) and swine influenza A (SI) viruses are major contributors to the porcine respiratory disease complex (PRDC), which is responsible for large economic losses to pig farmers worldwide. Implementation of a successful vaccine strategy to combat these pathogens in Thailand and Southeast Asia would contribute greatly to animal welfare, the livelihoods of smallholders and the competitiveness of the nascent pig industry.  The principal objective of this proposal is  to test innovative candidate PRRS and SI vaccines based on strains of these viruses circulating in Thailand. For PRRS, a consensus sequence strategy has been employed to produce a recombinant chimeric live attenuated candidate vaccine, while for SI, a recombinant live attenuated vaccine candidate has been produced by codon de-optimisation of the non-structural (NS) gene segment.  Because PRRS and SI infection predisposes pigs to secondary infections with other pathogens and disease associated with the PRDC, we wish to understand the effects of co-infection with these viruses on immune responses. Specific objectives: 1. To determine protective efficacy of novel PRRSV-2 and SI vaccine candidates against infectious challenge.  This will be achieved in three steps: 1.1  Establish assays for immune responses to the vaccine candidates.  1.2 Determine protective efficacy of vaccines under laboratory conditions and establish which immunological parameters are correlates of protection.  1.3 Determine vaccine immunogenicity and assay correlates of protection in the field.  2. To determine the immunological consequences of co-infection with PRRSV-2 and SI. To do this pigs will be infected separately with each virus or with both concurrently. We will also test the effect of infection with SI on the response to PRRS vaccination. 2.1 Effect of co-infections on disease and vaccine-induced immunity.  2.2 Establish mechanisms of altered immune responses.</narrative>
