  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project aims to bring together the work of two top urban research institutions in the UK - Urban Big Data Centre (UBDC) and the Applied Quantitative Methods Network (AQMeN) and to extend the research on the interconnected issues of urban development including infrastructure initiatives, migration, segregation, and inequality to Chinese cities by developing collaborative links with academics at the leading national Institute of Urban and Environmental Studies at CASS. It aims to develop fresh ideas, new methods and analysis through comparative studies on the impact of migration on cities and related social and spatial segregation problems and the challenges for integration and dealing with inequality. It will address the following main research questions: What kind of social and spatial segregations and inequalities are created and transformed through the process of rapid urbanization and rural to urban migration in China?  How could these patterns of segregations and inequalities be explained economically, social demographically, politically and culturally?  What type of new governance methods are required to alleviate urban segregation and inequality in Chinese cities and other fast changing societies?  The main objectives of the collaborative and comparative research activities are:  1) develop in-depth understanding of the trend and patterns of urban development, migration, migrants&apos; integration and social network in Chinese cities; 2) reveal the interrelationships between migration and social and spatial segregations in major cities and their implications to managing urban inequality and diversity and compare these with established migration and segregation theories and perceptions at the international level; 3) audit and compare the urban data sources in UK and China and examine the potentials and approaches in using Urban Bag Data for research in these topic areas and beyond; 4) test and adapt cutting-edge research methods to Chinese cities on measures of segregation, spatial concentration and inequality developed and applied in AQMeN, and looking at the impact on various outcomes such as infrastructure and transport requirements, employment, health and crime; 5) establish and consolidate the long term collaborative relations between CASS Institute and two of the top urban research institutions in the UK.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Urbanization and urban transformation in China is one of the most important aspects of global development in the 21st century. The fast speed of changes and the complexity of development in major Chinese cities pose a great challenge to urban researchers in China. This proposed International Centre Partnership will bring together researchers from three leading urban research organisations: the Urban Big Data Centre at University of Glasgow, the Applied Quantitative Methods Network at University of Sheffield, and the Institute of Urban and Environmental Studies at CASS. It will conduct collaborative and comparative research on three important and interrelated urban development issues of migration, segregation and inequality, and will make significant contributions in research findings, new methods, theoretical development and policy impact. This partnership will fulfil the core aim of the Newton Fund, trough the development of close scientific and innovative research collaboration and promoting the economic development and welfare of Chinese people, especially the 250 million migrant workers living in cities and towns.  In order to achieve the above aim and project objectives, our partnership activities will include research training through workshops, summer school and international symposium with people mobility in both directions in every year; a series of collaborative and innovative pilot research projects; and several important knowledge exchange and impact events and activities to influence future research agenda and government policy development. The partnership include a total of 27,  from University of Glasgow, University of Sheffield, and Institute of Urban and Environmental Studies of Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. It will involve a large number of other researchers, early careers and PhD students from these institutions and beyond, and government officials, policy makers, and civil society representatives.</narrative>
