   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Context Maize is the most important cereal crop in southern Africa but without new management practices in the face of increasing occurrence and severity of drought and low soil nutrient availability, yields which are already low are predicted to further decline. It is critical that new approaches are developed to ensure food security, and help alleviate poverty of smallholder farmers. Breeding for new maize cultivars with greater tolerance to drought and enhanced ability to take up nitrogen holds much promise to transform these cropping systems, but first we need to understand how these crop plants interact with the soil, the microorganisms in the soil, and with management to confer benefits for crop production, that will help ensure food security.     Aims and objectives Our research aims to address whether considering the nature of interactions between crop genetic make-up (genotype), soil microorganisms and the processes they undertake provides a viable approach for future maize breeding programmes to help ensure yield stability and resilience to low nutrient availability and drought in southern Africa. We will firstly undertake, under controlled environment conditions, a detailed screening of a wide range of maize genotypes from the CIMMYT germplasm collection to establish the extent of variation in influence on soil nitrogen and carbon processes. This screen will include varieties characterised by CIMMYT as being tolerant of low soil nitrogen or drought stress conditions. From this screen we will select lines to examine in more detail, and look at how they shape the microbial populations that undertake these processes, and gain understanding of plant-soil interactions underpinning sustainable production and soil health. We will then select six maize lines to establish consistency of interactions, established in controlled environments, under field conditions across CIMMYT farmer&apos;s network in Zimbabwe. Understanding these interactions will tell us if there is potential in using different maize genotypes to influence the soil microbial community, or future breeding for particular characteristics, to promote more effective nitrogen use and to confer greater resilience to drought.   Potential applications and benefits Demonstrating variation of maize for impacts on soil microbiota and processes is an essential step to developing strategies to exploit these traits for enhancing crop yields in combination with sustainable management practices. We anticipate that this foundation award will lead in the future to the development of a framework to inform future maize breeding initiatives or cultivar selection for southern Africa, that is based on the ability of crops to enhance and capitalise on soil health in terms of sustainable nutrient acquisition thereby helping ensure more reliable yields and greater resilience to changing environmental conditions.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="Our previous research in the UK with barley has demonstrated significant variation in important root-soil interaction traits across closely related genotypes. This leads us to hypothesise that (i) maize germplasm will exhibit analogous variation in root-soil interaction traits, (ii) that this will be associated with recruitment of distinct root-associated microbiomes, (iii) that this genotype-specific variation will have significant impacts on microbial functions mediating soil C and N cycling processes, and (iv) that these interactions will also vary as functions of environmental constraints and management practices.   We will test these hypotheses in linked WPs, addressing the following objectives:  O1: To establish the extent of variation within maize germplasm relevant to cultivation in southern Africa, with respect to shaping root-associated microbial communities and impacts on soil functions underpinning productivity; Genotype (WPs 2, 3). O2: To characterise root and microbiome traits of maize varieties identified as being tolerant of drought or low nitrogen availability; Genotype x Environment (controlled) (WP 3) O3: To quantify interactive effects of agricultural management and genotype selection on soil carbon and nutrient cycling processes in on-station and on-farm trials in southern Africa; Genotype x Management (WPs 3, 4).  O4: To establish the extent to which maize genotype and management interactive effects on soil microbiota and processes are conserved across contrasting soil types, managements and climate gradients; Genotype x Management x Environment (WP4)."></capital-spend>
