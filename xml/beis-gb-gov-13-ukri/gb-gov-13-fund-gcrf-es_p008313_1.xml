   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Optimising antibiotic use along surgical pathways: addressing antimicrobial resistance and improving clinical outcomes.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Context of the research:  Antibiotics are important to prevent infections after several types of surgery. The growing number of infections that cannot be treated with antibiotics may mean that many basic types of surgeries cannot continue. Around the world a large amount of all antibiotics are used during the surgical process. Antibiotics in surgery are used to prevent infections from happening after surgery (it is called &apos;prophylaxis&apos;) and for the treatment of infections after surgery. Infection after surgery is a growing concern in many countries. 23 million infections after surgery (or &apos;surgical site infections&apos;, SSIs) lead to 2 million deaths every year. Using antibiotics in the right manner is a sure way of preventing infections after surgery. For example, if the right antibiotics are given at the right time before surgery, then up to seven times less antibiotics are needed after surgery because less people get infections.    Aims and objectives:  The care before, during and after surgery (inside and outside of hospital) must include using the right antibiotics at the right time for the correct amount of time, making sure that there are no missed or late doses. The wellbeing of patients including nutrition and ability to move about can also affect how quickly they recover if they do get an infection. To get this care right at each stage, a lot of coordination and communication is needed between all the different health professionals (nurses, surgeons, anaesthetists, pharmacists), patients and carers involved. Because so many key parties are involved in this process, it is an ideal place to do research to understand ways of thinking about the correct use of antibiotics and behaviours such as hand hygiene which can prevent infections from happening in the first place. This study will use social science research to find out what helps individuals, teams and patients to practice safely and use antibiotics in the right way as described above.   The study will research these issues in England and Scotland as they each have different ways of organising and managing surgery. We will also carry out research in countries where there are less resources but they still manage surgery in the same way (India, South Africa and learning from Rwanda). The studies in countries outside of the UK will also tell us how behaviours can be changed when different health professionals are involved, and when antibiotics are less available within hospitals but also available from other sources.   Methods: The study will last four years and will start with an analysis of all factors within and outside of healthcare organisations which may influence how antibiotics are used. The methods we use at the moment to change behaviours of professionals and patients will be evaluated. New methods will also be designed, developed and also evaluated, and may include using new technologies such as computers or smartphones. We may also change the roles and expectations of different professionals within teams or changing the incentives or penalties associated with proper use of antibiotics. Some of these may involve patients and carers taking a more active role.   Potential applications and benefits:  By understanding the full context where surgery occurs, we will cover aspects of care within and beyond healthcare settings. As we will understand factors such as availability of antibiotics, financial pressures, regulation as well as what patients expect of their healthcare system and professionals, the solutions we will propose will be tailored for each setting. As we will be looking at how professionals, patients and carers behave and use antibiotics, it is likely that the new solutions that we propose would become part of routine practice, helping us to keep antibiotics working for much longer.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The overarching research question is: How can antibiotic use be optimised along the entire surgical pathway through context specific, (at country and organisational level) behavioural and organisational interventions aimed at providers and patients?  The question will be answered through the following objectives, and the project delivered through five work-packages (WPs) (see Figure 2 technical appendix).  1. Investigating the macro level economic, regulatory and policy drivers and constraints which result in prioritisation, competition or integration of Infection Control and Antimicrobial Stewardship at each point in the care pathway at the organisational level. (WP1)  2. Characterising cultural norms, established hierarchies, team roles and methods of communication around Antimicrobial Stewardship and Infection Control which operate within specific surgical/healthcare environments (WP 1&amp;2).   3. An assessment of patient-provider co-production models which may be supported by the outer and inner contexts investigated through objectives 1 and 2. (WP1, 3, 5)  4. Development of theory based innovative solutions (WP3).  5. Evaluating the operational and cost effectiveness of existing and new interventions using a systems thinking modelling approach (WP 2, 3 &amp; 4).</narrative>
