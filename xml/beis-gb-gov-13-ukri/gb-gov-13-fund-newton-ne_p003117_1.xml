   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The monsoon supplies the majority of water in South Asia. This project is a large collaboration between leading Indian and UK scientists, which aims to make substantial improvements to the forecasting of the monsoon from days to the season ahead. A significant obstacle to making improvements is the lack of observations of the monsoon and so the project will involve the UK&apos;s FAAM large atmospheric research aircraft operating alongside a comprehensive programme of Indian measurements made form the ground. The project will lead to a new Indo-UK forecasting model applicable down to scales of 100m over India.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="The monsoon supplies the majority of water in South Asia, and the growing population and economy therefore make understanding and predicting the system vital. Modelling and forecasting the monsoon from days to the season ahead is limited by large model errors that develop quickly, with significant model-to-model differences pointing to errors in physical parametrizations such as convection, boundary layer and land surface. At the same time, a lack of detailed observations is preventing a more thorough understanding of monsoon circulation and its interaction with the land surface. This project will support and develop modelling capability in Indo-UK monsoon research, including test development of a new 100m-resolution model over India. The first UK detachment of the FAAM research aircraft to India, in combination with an intensive ground-based observation campaign, will gather new observations of the surface, boundary layer structure and atmospheric profiles to go with detailed information on the timing of monsoon rainfall. The observational analysis will allow a unique and unprecedented characterisation of monsoon processes that will feed directly into model development at the Met Office and NCMRWF, through model evaluation at a range of scales and model improvement by working with parametrization developers. The project will institute a new long-term series of measurements of land surface fluxes which will allow testing of land surface initialisation in monsoon forecasts and improved land-atmosphere coupling."></capital-spend>
