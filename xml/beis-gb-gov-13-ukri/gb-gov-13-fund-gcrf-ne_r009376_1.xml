   <narrative xml:lang="EN">International Innovation Project on the Computer-aided High Throughput Development and Upscaling of Tailored Zeolites as Waste Water Filters in Ghana</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Illegal gold mining operations are a growing problem in Ghana, owing to the practice of alluvial mining techniques and the heavy use of toxic chemicals, which leads to significant pollution by cyanide, mercury, other heavy metals and organic contaminants, of the water sources that serve the local population. The mining and other local communities are thus deprived of access to clean water, leading to serious health problems. In addition to any chemical treatment of the effluent water, there is an urgent need to develop physical absorbents to remove the pollutants, which, however, need to be both efficient and cost-effective. Microporous zeolite materials are very effective absorbents and ion exchangers, which can be tuned to be highly selective towards adsorbate(s) of interest, with the accompanying release of non-toxic ions into the environment. They can be synthesised from readily available materials and are compact, cheap and simple to maintain in full-scale operations.   This cross-disciplinary project will bring together an experienced team of geochemists, physicists, computational and materials scientists from academia and industry to develop efficient synthetic zeolites, made from naturally available minerals, for the cost-effective treatment of waste water from gold mines, before its discharge into the environment. The zeolites will be characterised and tested on a laboratory scale before up-scaling both synthesis and filtration process into an operational treatment plant to serve a local metropolitan population.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The overall aim of the proposal is to achieve high throughput production of tailored zeolites with high selectivity towards toxic chemicals, such as mercury and cyanide, from illegal mining operations in Ghana. The mining waste water is  discharged untreated into rivers used by the local population as sources of drinking water. The zeolites will then be incorporated into a physical filtration bed to be tested in a proto-type water filtration system at a community dump site in Kumasi, the second largest city in Ghana.  Specific objectives of the project are: (i) Application of computational screening protocol to identify zeolite structures/compositions for the selective absorption of specific contaminants, i.e. mercury and other toxic heavy metals, cyanide and related organo-nitriles; (ii) Synthesis, testing and characterisation of tailored zeolites from computational screening; (iii) Up-scaling of the lab-based synthesis into high-throughput production of the most efficacious zeolites (iv) Integration of the zeolites into a pilot filtration system to decontaminate water containing multiple pollutants; (v) Incorporation of physical filtration system within a proto-type water decontamination plant and trialling of the integrated treatment system at an operational effluent site.</narrative>
