   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Seeds are the natural means of species regeneration, the product of pollinator activity, the basis of agriculture, a type of non-woody product and a source of essential protein and vegetable fat (seed oil) with many potential uses (industrial oils, biofuels, cosmetics). Consequently they are one of the mainstays of continuing ecosystem services. The Amazon is one of the most biodiverse regions of the world and the forests near Manaus are considered priority conservation areas. Therefore, ecological research in the region is fundamentally important to the sustainable and innovative use of species and yet the scientific capacity in seed biology in the Amazon region is extremely limited.   BESANS will train 20 members of the Amazon Seed Network or students, 9 staff and up to 60 seed/seedling producers in Amazonian species seed biology, and upskilling in conservation biology. The partnership is sector specific, linking plant science institutes and aiming to understanding the seed supply chain (seed development, yield, processing and storage) associated with the nascent seed trade in the Amazonas. Research on seed biology is critical to accessing species for various development activities (food/energy security, ability to mitigate/adapt to climate change) and the collection and conservation of germplasm, the sustainable exploitation of biodiversity and restoration of degraded land are key objectives of the Ministry of the Environment (MMA) and INCRA (National Institute for Agrarian Reform). We will ensure the development outcome of a much more functional Amazon Native Seed Centre in Manaus, better able to provide high quality seeds of more species for various industries.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="Plant biodiversity provides ecosystem services that contribute to local food and energy security and adaption strategies for climate change and land degradation. As seeds are the main route to natural regeneration, BESANS seeks:    - to understand and predict how ecosystems work through research on and greater understanding of, seed biology of 20 tropical amazonian species and to share that knowledge so that opportunities for the sustainable use of seeds of key indigenous species for the developing bio-economy are increased (Brazilian CNI, &apos;Bioeconomy - an agenda for Brazil).    - to significantly increase scientific capacity in the sector-specific area of tree seed biology research through training of 20 members of the Amazonian Tree Seed Network or postgraduate students, including two undergraduates, and nine staff (Amazon Native Seed Centre; Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas da Amaz&#xF4;nia; Universidade Federal de Lavras; Universidade Federal do Amazonas) and four Brazilian staff during mobility visits to the UK."></capital-spend>
