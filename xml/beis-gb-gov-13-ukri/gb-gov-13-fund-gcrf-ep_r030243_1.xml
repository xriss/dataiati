   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Creating Resilient Sustainable Microgrids through Hybrid Renewable Energy Systems</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The aim of this research is to develop and experimentally validate a holistic design platform for micro-grids (MG) with hybrid renewable energy systems that enables an end-user-driven, resilient and sustainable electrification of rural communities in the low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) Tanzania, Uganda and Republic of the Congo. We have designed a research programme with three interlinked workpackages (WPs) which addresses the following specific objectives.   1. Develop a distribution system design methodology for resilient sustainable MG that combines both the planning and real-time operational design into a single joint design stage (Work Package 1, WP1). We will work closely with our local LMIC partners and incorporate socio economic factors (Work Package 2, WP2) and energy-resource aspects (Work Package 3, WP3) in the design procedure. The MG prototypes will be experimentally validated in the Smart Grid laboratory at the University of Leeds (WP1). To achieve excellent dissemination and local acceptance of our approach we will develop a design platform featuring an end-user friendly high-level graphical user interface (GUI) and provide a series of examples and training material.  2. Provide a sustainable, reliable and flexible generation pool for the MG on the basis of a hybrid biofuel-solar system (WP3). The aim of this work package is to model the availability of renewable resources capable of contributing to the MG network and understand the capacity for integrated hybrid solutions to provide increased resilience. The focus will be on availability of combined solar and biomass resources, investigating the options for energy generation via either conventional or hybrid technologies, in particular biofuels, to operate multi-fuel gensets and hybrid solar-driven bioenergy options. This will provide an alternative energy storage to batteries, which are expensive and likely to be stolen. Existing and emerging technologies for processing biomass into liquid or gaseous fuels will be assessed and optimum conversion routes proposed. A major focus of this WP is to produce a dataset on the operation and performance of a multi-fuel genset and development of a model to investigate its capacity and performance in providing resilience and flexibility to the MG network. Environmental impacts, ease of implementation and cost will also be considered together with utilisation of waste and resource recovery. The availability of resources will be derived from different scenarios based on the model smart MG village and drawing from inputs from the field-work of our LMIC collaborators and partners.  3. Involve end-users in research, design, acceptance and adoption and ensure long-term sustainability and resilience through creation of the appropriate incentive structures to install and maintain the MGs (WP2). The socio-economic WP of the project will consist of five interacting components: evaluating the potential range of energy uses within a community and matching technologies to both present and future needs; involvement of end user participation in research, design, acceptance and adoption; ensuring long-term sustainability and resilience through creation of the appropriate incentive structures and tariffs to install and maintain the MGs; ethical dimensions of the project both in terms of the research protocols and equity distributional aspects of MG design and operation; and capacity building within the partnership. This WP will draw on experience from establishment of MG and private sector investment in the Indonesian &apos;Iconic Islands&apos; programme for electrification of small islands.  4. Train 3 UK-PDRAs (two power and energy systems, one energy socio-economics) in holistic design methods for hybrid sustainable MGs.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Universal access to affordable modern clean energy is goal 7 of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The SDGs state that &quot;Energy is central to nearly every major challenge and opportunity the world faces today. Be it for jobs, security, climate change, food production or increasing incomes, access to energy for all is essential.&quot; In sub-Saharan Africa, more than 625 million people have no access to modern energy services. Most African countries - 42 in all - are net energy importers and fossil-fuel-fired plants account for 81% of total electricity generation, which is mostly in South Africa. Most large infrastructure projects are public investments financed by national budgets. The estimated cost of bringing Africa&apos;s energy infrastructure to modern standard is 93 billion USD/ year. There is a huge gap between energy supply and demand in Africa, and other developing countries, that successive efforts have failed to bridge. The envisioned holistic hybrid MGs will lead to a prototype model for the creation of sustainable and resilient distribution networks for off-grid locations. This approach has the potential to enable electrification of millions of households. Both Tanzania and Uganda are low income &apos;least developed&apos; countries with a high level of rural poverty and very limited grid connectivity. The Republic of Congo is classed as a lower middle income country due to its mineral wealth, but has low grid connectivity away from cities and its research sector suffers from under-investment in research capacity building  This proposal focuses on energy distribution in off-grid communities with a population of around 4000 inhabitants, a size that has been recommended by our African project partners as being the practical optimum for implementation. The research has an integrated approach to ensure that the design of the system is maintainable, has good longevity with low cost, meets diverse community energy needs and is resilient to natural hazards. The overall goal is to enable the development of sustainable and resilient energy distribution grids in rural communities of the low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) Tanzania, Uganda and Republic of the Congo, where currently at most 10% of the rural population has access to electricity. We will achieve this by designing a scalable low-cost MG infrastructure based on a novel planning methodology that incorporates real-time operational strategies and sustainable generation flexibility at the system design stage to reduce the investment requirements and increase sustainability. The MG paradigm will ensure that the research outcomes are also applicable to communities with sporadic grid connections. Building on the existing partnership platform created by the PI&apos;s five year &#xA3;1.2M Royal Society renewable energy capacity building project, the present grant will enable us to realise and experimentally validate a unique, integrated, design platform that incorporates electrical network requirements with hybrid renewable energy generation sources as well as socio-economic and local community-driven considerations. This holistic approach is driven by the understanding that the creation of a truly sustainable, reliable, and locally maintainable energy distribution infrastructure needs to be focused on actual needs and local realities, beyond a purely electrical perspective. This will provide innovative distribution system configurations targeted at supporting the scalable and self-sustainable electrification of rural communities in our three partner countries. An advisory panel drawn from partners of our EPSRC Pump Priming for Global Challenge Research project will ensure that the results are also applicable to LMICs globally.</narrative>
