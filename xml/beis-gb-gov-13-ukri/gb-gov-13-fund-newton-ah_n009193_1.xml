   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Sustainable solutions towards cultural heritage preservation in the Asyut region.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The current proposal aims to establish a new methodological framework to undertake and develop a sustainable conservation policy for archaeological sites using the Asyut region in Middle Egypt, and the village of Shutb in particular, as a case-study. Rather than merely looking upon archaeological sites as salvage missions or academic pursuits, the project appeals to local interests to better the lives of local communities and support that through affiliation with archaeology and heritage preservation. The envisioned methodology promotes the following objectives: 1. integration of preservation and heritage management methodologies and specialists into archaeological fieldwork projects, 2. coordination and collaboration amongst different institutions and agencies concerned with heritage preservation, 3. engaging with local communities, local heritage professionals and other stakeholders through training and capacity building by hands-on experience and implementation of policies, 4. providing a model that can be implemented elsewhere. To achieve these goals, the British Museum will collaborate with an Egyptian-UK based team of Cairo-based consultants and local stake holders to develop a set of protection measures in order to uphold the site&apos;s archaeological value, to prevent further decay of the historic fabric and to enhance the socio-economic (living) conditions of the inhabitants.  To this means, two seasons of fieldwork in Shutb will include: (1) a series of surveys and meetings to assess the impact and perception of the village&apos;s presence on the archaeological remains (2) identifying and prioritizing meaningful ways of intervention and (3) a documentation training mission. The activities will be photo and film-documented. Depending on the outcome of the community meetings and interviews, the project will develop sustainable solutions to the community&apos;s most pressing needs and define programmes to reduce and redirect garbage disposal and improve waste management systems of residential units to reduce ground pollution and increase personal health. Such an all-inclusive approach has never been tested in Egypt, where fieldwork has traditionally been physically and intellectually separated from the surrounding environment and communities. Through collaboration with the Ministry of Antiquities, the impact of the established methodology can be accelerated if implemented at other sites or -even more fundamentally- incorporated into governmental strategies.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The current proposal aims to implement a new approach to fieldwork in Egypt by looking at the broad spectrum of history - up until the present day - at multi-layered sites, including efforts to preserve heritage rather than only researching it. The project will undertake and develop a sustainable conservation policy for archaeological sites using the Asyut region in Middle Egypt, and the village of Shutb in particular, as a case-study. Rather than merely looking upon archaeological sites as salvage missions or narrow-eyed academic pursuits, the project supports local interests to better the lives of local communities so that they can function as working partners in preserving the site. The envisioned methodology promotes (1) better integration of preservation and heritage management methodologies and specialists into archaeological fieldwork projects, (2) coordination and collaboration amongst different institutions and agencies concerned with heritage preservation, (3) engaging with local communities, local heritage professionals and other stakeholders through training and capacity building by hands-on experience and implementation of policies. To achieve these goals, the British Museum will collaborate with an interdisciplinary team of Egypt-based consultants and local stakeholders to develop a set of protection measures in order to uphold Shutb&apos;s archaeological value, to prevent further decay of the historic fabric and to enhance the socio-economic (living) conditions of the inhabitants.  To this means, two seasons of fieldwork in Shutb will include a series of surveys and meetings to assess the impact and perception of the village&apos;s presence on the archaeological remains, identifying and prioritizing meaningful ways of intervention and a documentation training mission. Many of the defined threats to heritage also negatively affect people&apos;s health, such as proximity to garbage disposal and ground and water pollution. The gathered survey data will be used to define programmes to reduce and redirect garbage dumping and improve waste and water management systems of residential units to reduce ground pollution and increase personal health. Depending on the outcome of the community meetings and interviews; the project will develop solutions to the community&apos;s most pressing needs.  Such an all-inclusive approach has never been tested in Egypt, where fieldwork has traditionally been physically and intellectually separated from the surrounding environment and communities. It is, however, an opportune moment to develop more sustainable methodologies as ancient tells are at risk from the forces of nature and the impact of social, political, and economic change.Through collaboration with the Ministry of Antiquities, the impact of the established methodology can be accelerated if implemented at other sites or -even more fundamentally- incorporated into governmental strategies.</narrative>
