   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Our inter-disciplinary project addresses the first challenge of the Colombian Bio Resources call by examining: (1) the socio-ecological system of p&#xE1;ramo habitat in Boyac&#xE1; and Cundinamarca; (2) the value of biodiversity in this system to local communities and wider society; and (3) the response of p&#xE1;ramo ecosystems to environmental change and anthropogenic pressures including social and political change. Through investigating the current and potential value of biodiversity and ecosystem services provided by p&#xE1;ramos, both in monetary and non-monetary terms, the project will promote the economy of p&#xE1;ramos in the Departments of Boyac&#xE1; and Cundinamarca, thereby contributing to economic development and social welfare in Colombia. We will integrate ecosystem-based and historical conceptions of human-nature interactions to reveal how socio-economic, political and cultural changes have interacted with environmental pressures in shaping p&#xE1;ramo ecosystems over time, and use this new understanding to inform future sustainable and equitable governance options. In this way we will address the programme&apos;s challenge of &quot;functioning and resilience of socio-economic systems&quot; by bringing together researchers from natural sciences and humanities.  The history of high-elevation p&#xE1;ramo habitat is fundamental in understanding the pressures this ecosystem now faces. For the Muisca people and for many p&#xE1;ramo inhabitants today, p&#xE1;ramos are sacred places from where the gods came that controlled water and the origin and maintenance of life. To European colonists, p&#xE1;ramos were seen as the source of abundant mineral riches based around the legend of El Dorado. More recently, the critical importance of p&#xE1;ramos in providing fresh water to the growing urban populations of Colombia and supporting unique biodiversity have come to the fore, along with the recognition that the system faces significant challenges from climate change and land-use pressures. These competing pressures are placing increasingly diverse demands on the system, and, despite a number of initiatives both nationally and internationally, tensions over the management and governance of the system persist. The p&#xE1;ramo socio-ecological system is therefore ideal for addressing the challenges of the Colombia Bio Resources programme.   Our project will show how an integrated environmental-historical understanding of p&#xE1;ramo ecosystem patterns, processes and pressures can provide insights to new governance solutions. We will take a 500-year historical perspective to analyse changes in the socio-ecological system of p&#xE1;ramos over time, focusing on the central role of human-nature interactions and how these have changed in response to differing social, political and cultural contexts. We will quantify how p&#xE1;ramo habitat has changed, from decades to centuries. We will consider how these changes have impacted on ecosystem dynamics, and predict what further changes are likely to occur in the future under climate and other drivers of change. We will explore how human-nature relationships in p&#xE1;ramo landscapes have changed and compare the perspectives of local communities with other private and state actors. We will identify the potential for p&#xE1;ramo communities to obtain monetary values from p&#xE1;ramos and the ecosystem services they provide, examining the synergies and trade-offs between different ecosystem services. Our research will provide a unique historical context for the development of future governance options, including new partnerships between different stakeholders underpinned by greater social and cultural understanding. The project will deliver recommendations for mechanisms to promote more sustainable and equitable futures for p&#xE1;ramo landscapes, in the context of key political and social challenges such as post-conflict displacement, illegal mining, changing climate and increasing water demand from urbanization.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="The overarching aim of the project is to integrate an understanding of socio-cultural histories and ecosystem dynamics in response to social, political, economic and environmental pressures to inform the development of a sustainable and equitable future for the p&#xE1;ramos. The research will be of benefit to  to the communities that depend directly on the p&#xE1;ramos for their livelihoods and to wider Colombian society. In order to achieve this aim, we will take a historical perspective, reaching back as far as pre-Hispanic times where records allow to provide historical context, but concentrating primarily on the last 200 years.  We will address the following objectives: 1. Determine how changes in p&#xE1;ramo habitat availability have impacted ecosystem dynamics (focusing on biodiversity of p&#xE1;ramo birds and plants), and project how p&#xE1;ramo habitat may change in the future under climate and other drivers of land-use changes. 2. Understand how cultural values and practices have contributed to, and reflected, changes in human-nature relationships and governance of the p&#xE1;ramos over time, and consider the implications for future governance of the p&#xE1;ramos. 3. Identify present and future governance options for the p&#xE1;ramos, that have the potential to deliver improved monetary benefits to the community while maintaining broader ecosystem service provision and enhancing social equity."></capital-spend>
