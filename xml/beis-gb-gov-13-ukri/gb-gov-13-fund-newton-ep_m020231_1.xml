   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Using Energy Storage for Novel Control of Off-Grid and On-Grid Wave Energy Arrays</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">There are 3 main objectives in this project:  1. Answer the research question: Can energy storage radically improve off-grid and on-grid control in wave energy arrays? How can it be done? 2. Develop an electrical array model for wave energy, with energy storage and co-ordinated control 3. Strengthen the partnership between the UK and Chinese Institutions for future research collaboration  The research question in objective 1 aims to address a very relevant and timely challenge in wave energy conversion. This has been brought about by a need for arrays of smaller wave energy devices to utilise the less-energetic wave resource off the coast of China. For a lower energy resource, control of arrays is even more important in order to optimise performance and to improve survivability. Objective 2 is a particularly comprehensive task as it involves delivering sub-objectives of developing an energy storage model and co-ordinated control models. Objective 3 focusses on tasks that will help to forge a long-term partnership between Edinburgh, Ocean, and Hohai Universities.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This work assesses the feasibility of using energy storage to make a step-change improvement in control for off-grid and on-grid wave energy arrays. This has been brought about by a need for arrays of smaller wave energy devices to utilise the less-energetic wave resource off the coast of China. For a lower energy resource, control of arrays is even more important in order to optimise performance and to improve survivability. As the focus is on future deployment of arrays in China, the step-change is only possible with the expertise in wave climate, off-grid connection of devices and power systems in China; hence this contribution is provided by project partners in China.</narrative>
