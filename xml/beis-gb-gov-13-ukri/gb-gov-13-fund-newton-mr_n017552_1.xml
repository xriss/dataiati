   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The emergence of Zika virus in Brazil: investigating viral features and host responses to design preventive strategies.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Zika virus has now been confirmed in Brazil, where it emerged recently and was not known to circulate before. This project aims to study the presence and epidemiology of this virus in Brazil through development of better diagnostic tools, as well as further understand the immunopathological processes linked to disease and virus-cell interactions such as host response (type 1 interferon antagonism). Moreover, a reverse reverse genetic system is to developed that will support future vaccine development studies and serve to better understand Zika virus gene function and replication.  The aims listed below will address the objectives of the project. Aims 2 and 3 are equal in terms of priority; however given the ongoing outbreak improved diagnostics and characterisation of Zika virus have immediate impact.  Aim 1. Improved monitoring and diagnosis of ZIKV in Brazil  Sub aim 1.1 Phylogenetic characterization of ZIKV. This sub aim will investigate the origins and spread of Zika virus in Brazil, by collecting data of cases and studies of the virus including full genome sequencing.  Sub aim 1.2 Improved ZIKV diagnosis. Here we will aim to develop better diagnostic tools, supported also by a patient cohort of suspected cases, that are more easily and readily applicable than current methods. This is important to understand the spread of the virus, differentiate from other arboviruses and support the Brazilian health system especially in less developed environments.   Aim 2. Immunological studies of ZIKV infection- host responses and patient-specific differences  Sub aim 2.1 ZIKV immunopathogenesis. As immunological and host response processes to Zika virus infection are poorly understood, this aim will use patient material to study immunopathological processes and chemokine/cytokine responses. Moreover a mouse model will be established to expand the results of these studies in a model that is more suitable to work on processes or molecules that could be used as targets for intervention later in patients.  Aim 3. ZIKV reverse genetics and virus-cell interactions  Sub aim 3.1 ZIKV reverse genetics and virus-like particle production. This aim has as primary target the development of a reverse genetics system for Zika virus. This is important to support future studies on Zika virus gene function, virus replication etc but also production of vaccine candidates such as attenuated viruses. Moreover, parts of the system will  be useful to construct a virus-like particle system that may be suitable as vaccine candidate.   Sub aim 3.2 ZIKV interactions with host signaling. Here we will investigate the interaction of Zika virus and individual Zika virus proteins with type 1 interferon responses, which are crucial to host control of virus replication and thus also a target for virus counteraction. In the future, identification of viral proteins with interferon antagonising function and domains/amino acids within can inform vaccine design.  In summary, this projects brings together researchers with different areas of expertise to tackle key questions related to Zika virus in Brazil in an integrated manner. However this virus is found in many parts of the world and we expect that our research will have impact beyond Brazil.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Zika virus is an arbovirus that belongs to the Flaviviridae family and was initially isolated from rhesus monkeys in Uganda in 1947. The most common reported symptoms are rash, fever, arthralgia, and conjunctivitis. The majority of the patients experiences only a mild and transitory disease, but severe neurologic complications have been described. The virus, previously described in Africa and oher parts of the world, has recently emerged in Brazil. It is thus a good example of how viruses can emerge around the world and start transmission cycles in novel environments. Zika virus is predominantly transmitted by Aedes species mosquitoes such as Ae. aegypti. Brazil is a large (8.5 million km2), predominantly tropical area. There are five geographical regions (North, Northeast, Center-West, Southeast and South) and five climate zones: Equatorial, Temperate, Central Brazil Tropical, Eastern Northeast Tropical and Equatorial Zone Tropical. Such characteristics favor the proliferation of Ae. aegypti mosquitoes that are dispersed around all the 27 Brazilian Federative Units in more than 3,587 cities. Besides dengue viruses, other arboviruses are now circulating in Brazil. In 2014, a total of 41 chikungunya importations and 27 autochthonous cases were detected in northeast Brazil. More recently, 34 cases of ZIKV infection have been confirmed by the Brazilian Ministry of Health. The confirmed cases occurred in eight of the 27 Brazilian states and are distributed in the Northeast, North and Southeast regions of the country, suggesting that the infection is widespread. The source of these outbreaks and the potential for virus establishment in Brazil is still not known. Arboviruses such as Zika have the potential to initiate large scale epidemics, and these infections can be extremely debilitating in absence of any specific treatments or vaccine. Thus, this newly emerged arbovirus represents a serious social and economic threat, especially because of the excessive demand on health services by the poor population. Zika virus symptoms are related to already circulating human arboviruses such as dengue and chikungunya. Thus diagnosis of Zika virus infection on the basis of clinical syndromes is not reliable and needs to be confirmed by laboratory diagnosis. Indeed, misinterpretation may have consequences for treatment but also the general understanding of pathogens local populations are at risk from. Current Zika virus diagnosis is based on molecular techniques only accessible to a few highly specialized laboratories. This project proposes to better understand the spread and epidemiology of Zika virus infection by understanding individual cases and analyse full virus genomes to put them into a global context. It will also aim to develop more easily accessible diagnostic tools that can be used in wider settings thus supporting the local health systems.  At this point, it is  also crucial to investigate the underlying biological processes involved in Zika virus pathogenesis and how the virus interacts with host responses, which could lead towards more effective treatment of confirmed cases. Moreover this project aims to develop tools to understand and manipulate the viral genome (called &quot;reverse genetics&quot;) with view of better understanding viral genes, replication etc. These tools can also form the backbone of future vaccines. The strength of this project is the coming together of experts from different research areas to study the questions outlined above with the aim of significantly improving our understanding of Zika virus biology, impact on public health and study this emerging virus. This is highly relevant to Brazil, but also other regions and countries affected by this virus.</narrative>
