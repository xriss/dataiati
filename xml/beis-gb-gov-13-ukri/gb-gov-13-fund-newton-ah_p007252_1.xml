  <capital-spend percentage="The main research objectives continue from the Stage 2 objectives and are to: * Continue to stimulate UK-Brazil research collaboration focused around Development challenges in the specific context of Brazil / Rio de Janeiro by maintaining communication networks and structures between the teams formed at the Creative Lab  * Support the translation of research by providing appropriate resources (partnerships, staffing, resources including funding) to Creative Lab participating researchers (scholars and artists) to realise projects that harness creativity and culture to offer solutions to development challenges  * Enable the continued development of pilot research projects from Phase 1 &amp; 2  that offer potential creative solutions to development challenges in Brazil, focusing on:   - urban migration / the inequality legacies of historical migration, human rights, social welfare, visibility and civic participation of underrepresented groups;   - governance, society and conflict, civil society, effective institutions, state violence, structural inequalities and urban violence;   - urban transformation;   - inclusive economic growth  * Build research and innovation capacity in Brazil by providing continuing opportunities for Brazilian researchers to work with and learn from UK researchers, and with creative entrepreneurs from both UK and Brazil  * Maximise the potential future commercial collaborations generated between UK and Brazilian academics and creatives, and demonstrating good reasons the UK should be a partner of choice for Brazil, by:   - including Brazilian creative entrepreneurs, community-based SMEs, NGOs and commercial organisations as active members in the partnership network;   - working sensitively and with a deep understanding of the context based on QMUL&apos;s/People&apos;s Palace Projects&apos; 15 years of work in Brazil and on CreativeWorks London&apos;s expertise in stimulating and supporting research partnerships with creative innovation;   - brokering stimulating and appropriate matches of skills and research specialisms in the UK with researchers and creatives who are producing new innovations and solutions in the profusely creative context of Rio de Janeiro/Brazil  * Draw on a network of partnerships established by People&apos;s Palace Projects at QMUL and People&apos;s Palace Projects do Brasil, introducing new Co-Investigator academics and UK creative entrepreneurs to these established partnerships to lay foundations for on-going collaborations beyond the timeframe of the project  * Strengthen pathways to impact from the original research by providing a public platform for the research outcomes   * Document and evaluate the process with the aim of enabling it to be assessed and built on as a model for future AHRC Creative Labs."></capital-spend>
