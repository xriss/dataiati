   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Clean Air for Delhi Through Interventions, Mitigations and Engagement (CADTIME) project aims to understand what is required to deliver significant reductions in levels of air pollution, within the confines of factors which are under our control, through affordable, effective interventions that consider and respond to future changes.  CADTIME brings together a consortium of institutions and experts from across both India and the United Kingdom with the goal of addressing air quality issues that affect people&apos;s health in Delhi. This goal will be achieved through the development of an Integrated Action Plan (IAP), detailing strategies and potential interventions for mitigating air pollution in both the city, and surrounding region.   The IAP will be based on development of a sound understanding of the current contributing factors to air pollution across the domestic, transport, industrial and agricultural sectors, for Delhi, as well as forecasting of how those sectors will change across the short, medium and long terms. The plan can only be realised through the contributions of government agencies, local stakeholders and collaboration with population at large. The use of workshops, focus groups and extensive consultation will ensure that proposed strategies are realistic, clearly defined, well targeted and mindful of technological and social constraints. Above all strategies will be economically viable and environmentally sustainable. They will also be far-thinking and cross-cutting, embracing political, technological and behavioural change.     The CADTIME project is envisaged to run over a 48-month period. Initial stages of the project will involve the development of modelling tools, such as collating emissions inventories and dispersion models, as well as the collection of information on current policies and best practice for mitigation within the city and region. The international nature of the consortium will allow a golden opportunity for academics and researchers from both nations to learn from each other. Latter stages of the project will see collaboration with stakeholders coming to the fore, as the IAP takes definition and shape. Care will be taken to ensure that, wherever possible, the strategies defined for Delhi will also have relevance to other major urban areas in the sub-continent. In addition to Delhi, the CADTIME consortium includes the Indian Institutes of Technology of Madras and Bombay. Ultimately, the beneficiaries of the CADTIME project will be the Indian People and Government through a reduction in the burden of ill health that is inflicted upon them by air quality.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="The Clean Air for Delhi Through Interventions, Mitigations and Engagement (CADTIME) project aims to provide a clear understanding of what is required to make significant reductions in levels of air pollution in the Indian megacity. It will suggest and provide interventions to achieve such reductions that are achievable, affordable in both economic and social terms, effective, as well as responsive to future changes through to year 2050.  In order to achieve the global aim of CADTIME, a number of objectives have been identified, which will be delivered through an integrated structure of seven work tasks. In order of priority, these objectives are:  i. Identify key emission sources, emission trends and current scenario analysis. ii. Identify key factors controlling urban air quality legislations/policies/standards. iii. Develop and validate an effective and efficient air quality modelling system for hot spot, local and regional pollution problems identified in consultation with researchers of Themes 1, 2 and 3 of this Call.  iv. Design and quantify impacts of interventions for mitigating air pollution in Indian Megacity Delhi for medium- and long-term horizons (current to 2030 and 2050). v. Compile a range of potential practical interventions with stakeholders through DELPHI methodology, employing both forecasting and backcasting approaches to develop an air pollution pathway; and create a prioritised shortlist of robust solutions with quantified impacts.  vi. Evaluate the reduction in pollution achievable by recommended interventions to 2050. vii. Interact with and integrate research outputs from Themes 1, 2 and 3 to collective benefit.  This project will develop and deliver, a comprehensive novel and scientifically-informed platform that combines the monitoring of major source of emissions; including industrial, domestic and vehicles across regional to local scales; interfaces with models to explore solutions to inform decision-making policy regarding interventions to mitigate air pollution to reduce human exposure. This project focuses on delivering and using the platform to define mitigation measures and uses currently available data and models, the legacy of previous EPSRC and British Council funded projects. However, CADTIME feeds on the emission validation and sources (Theme 1) and interfaces with better understanding of physical and chemical processes (Theme 2) and exposure validation and health outcomes (Theme 3)."></capital-spend>
