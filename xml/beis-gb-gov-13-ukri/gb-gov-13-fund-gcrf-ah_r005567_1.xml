  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">1) To forge innovative ways of engaging new audiences in South Africa with respect to my AHRC Early Career Fellowship&apos;s research on the history of Zionist Christianity in South Africa and the United States, thereby significantly enhancing the research&apos;s value and impact.  2) To create a public engagement strategy that presents my research on the multi-racial, egalitarian values of Zionist Christianity - the largest religious group in South Africa - as an opportunity for South African audiences to engage with high-quality discourse regarding the resources of religious communities to transcend social divides in contemporary society.  3) To enhance impact activities carried out during my AHRC Fellowship (including a historical exhibition for Zionists in South Africa and a public talk in the UK) by using these established networks to identify user communities in South Africa for this proposed Follow-on Funding project.  4) To design and implement an exhibition featuring project partner Sabelo Mlangeni&apos;s photographic depictions of contemporary Zionists in South Africa at the renowned Wits Art Museum (WAM), Johannesburg, South Africa, 1 May 2018 to 30 June 2018.  5) To design and implement a strategy that encourages carefully-selected users and wide-ranging audiences (some already engaged during my AHRC Fellowship) to interact with the exhibition in transformative ways.  6) To work closely with the project partner (WAM) and existing user communities (Zionist religious leaders) to continue to engage key user communities for whom we discern evidence of a well-defined need for engagement with my research via the photographic exhibition.  7) To design tailored programmes for high-quality interaction with the photographic exhibition amongst user communities. These will consist of 1000 secondary school children, 120 Zionist church members, 40 students of photography and at least 3000 members of the South African public.  8) To identify 17 secondary school groups who will benefit from engaging with the exhibition via walk-arounds led by the artist, Mlangeni, and trained volunteers, as well as participation in Q&amp;As. These users will receive take-home booklets featuring photographs from the exhibition and space for their private reflections.  9) To refine and organize an engagement programme for Zionist church members that addresses their need for public reflection on their faith community articulated from within (Mlangeni is a practicing Zionist). This audience will formally open the exhibition and participate in walk-arounds and discussion groups.  10) To address Johannesburg photography students&apos; need for enhanced training by designing a workshop on photography and religion. The artist, Mlangeni, will run the workshop.  11) To meet the need of the South African public for high-quality information on the resources of religious groups in pioneering egalitarian and multi-racial communities in South Africa. To specifically address this need by providing regular walk-arounds, informative text panels and an exhibition catalogue (in English and isiZulu).  12) To appoint appropriate individuals to the part-time roles of curator, project facilitator and educational intern; to design a project plan whereby tasks are divided between team personnel.  13) To closely work with the project&apos;s partners and personnel (WAM, the artist, project facilitator, curator, educational intern) to achieve and evaluate my objectives in a timely manner, including regular meetings of myself with the team on Skype and in person.  14) To collaborate with WAM and the project facilitator to ensure the exhibition and its public engagement programmes receive in-depth coverage in national and international media including newspapers, radio, TV and blogs.   15) To design and implement strategies for measuring the impact of the exhibition upon the user communities, including follow-up questionnaires, focus groups, and monitoring and evaluation of media coverage.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Against the backdrop of the dramatic social and economic divides characterizing contemporary South Africa, my research on Zionist Christianity offers the South African public an in-depth example of religion&apos;s role in pioneering equitable societies. My AHRC Fellowship examines the democratic resources of a transatlantic Protestant faith healing movement called Zionism. I show that in both the United States and South Africa, the Zionist church has been favoured by working-class individuals marginalized by those in power and who, in their conversion to Zionism, found new possibilities for self-assertion. For example, its doctrine encouraged adherents to eschew the expertise of medical professionals in favour of the simple prayer of ordinary people. By the early twentieth century, Zionism had been transmitted to South Africa via American missionaries. Its teachings regarding the equality of all humanity - regardless of race, class or education - meant Zionism found great success amongst black South Africans seeking to claim status and dignity amidst the strictures of a racially segregated state. While the movement declined in the USA, Zionism is today South Africa&apos;s largest religious group, with over 12 million believers. I argue Zionism continues to powerfully shape visions of egalitarian society within contemporary South Africa.  While conducting research in South Africa, I encountered the prize-winning photographer, Sabelo Mlangeni, himself a life-long Zionist believer. Over the past year, Mlangeni and I have developed a proposal for a photographic exhibition at the renowned Wits Art Museum (WAM) in Johannesburg, displaying Mlangeni&apos;s 60 black and white photographs on contemporary Zionists. The exhibition will be entitled Amakholwa, isiZulu for &apos;The Believers&apos;. The photographs foreground the intimate, affectionate ties between Zionist believers. Mlangeni uses close-up perspectives and full-frontal portraits to portray the bonds of support between fellow believers. These photographs also emphasize the egalitarian nature of Zionist community; they depict &apos;the believers&apos; as a group of people amongst whom clerical hierarchies are largely invisible. The overall sense is of a horizontal gathering of young men and women. In this way, Mlangeni&apos;s photographs engage with my research&apos;s exploration of the importance of religious affiliation in transcending social divides by reconstituting individuals as &apos;believers&apos;, erasing former divisions of class, ethnicity and socio-economic status.  In conversation with WAM, the project partner, I have identified four user communities who will benefit from creatively engaging them with the exhibition and the research underpinning it. These include 1000 secondary school students, 200 Zionist believers, 40 photography students and at least 3000 members of the Johannesburg public. With respect to the school audience, we have identified a need for high-quality discourse on the role of Zionism in the public sphere as this is largely absent from religious education curricula. The second audience - Zionist believers - would benefit from a visual representation of their religious identity by an &apos;insider&apos; voice such as Mlangeni. Zionists&apos; knowledge of their origins would be enhanced through their engagement with the exhibition&apos;s text panels and the catalogue. Photography students in South Africa need teaching on the intersection between photographic practice and depiction of religious life, while the South African public would benefit from thoughtful commentary on the significance of religious communities such as Zionism (which receives little coverage in the national media) for transcending social divides. These four audiences will be engaged via walk-arounds, a photography workshop and participation in religious rituals dynamically interacting with the exhibition. Audiences&apos; engagement will be assessed through follow-up questionnaires, focus groups and media monitoring.</narrative>
