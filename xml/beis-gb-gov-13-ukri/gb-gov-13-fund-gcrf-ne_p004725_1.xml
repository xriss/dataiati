   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Coping with El Nino in Tanzania: Differentiated local impacts and household-level responses</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Building on our recent NERC-DfID-ESRC funded work on CBNRM in Tanzania, the overarching aim of this research is to understand how social processes mediate the outcomes of environmental shocks at the local scale, and to apply this understanding to improve the resilience of vulnerable households and communities. Specifically, we examine the impacts of the current El Nino event on poor people living in rural areas of northern and southern Tanzania which offer contrasting institutional and environmental contexts to address three principal objectives: (1) To measure local scale impacts of El Nino in Tanzania, quantifying household-level changes in livelihoods, natural resource use and multi-dimensional wellbeing from our 2014-5 baseline, differentiated by key household characteristics thought to influence vulnerability. (2) To determine how household coping strategies are facilitated or constrained by institutional and environmental context. We focus on the case of Tanzania&apos;s WMAs, a key form of CBNRM which plays a major role in governing local natural resource use, comparing WMA and non-WMA villages from northern and southern areas of Tanzania with contrasting environments and El Nino effects. (3) To investigate the temporal dynamics of household livelihoods experiencing environmental change as they move from a pre-El Nino baseline to El Nino coping strategies, then back to &quot;business as usual&quot; or lead to longer-term changes (e.g. new adaptations or increased vulnerability to future shocks). If the current El Ni&#xF1;o is followed by a La Ni&#xF1;a event within the lifetime of the project, we will additionally examine the cumulative effects of contrasting shocks on households. The outcome will be a new, disaggregated understanding of the social mechanisms driving complexity and differentiation in local-scale outcomes of El Nino events and other environmental shocks. Scientifically, the project will fill an important gap in our understanding of the role CBNRM institutions play in shaping the impacts of environmental change in linked social-ecological systems, making novel empirical contributions to literatures on resilience and vulnerability. Practically, evidence generated by the project will inform the continuing development of existing/planned WMAs in Tanzania, enhancing their sustainability by enabling them to better support communities experiencing environmental shocks, and paving the way for improved targeting of emergency relief towards the most vulnerable households. In doing so, the project meets all requirements of the Understanding the Impacts of the Current El Ni&#xF1;o Event call, providing timely evidence on the impacts of El Nino in a low income country and contributing to increased resilience to future events. To achieve our aims, the project depends on collecting new data on the dynamics of household coping strategies as they develop and is therefore time critical and cannot be supported by traditional funding routes.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">El Ni&#xF1;o is a climatic phenomenon linked to warming of the ocean surface in the eastern Pacific that causes unusual weather patterns across many parts of the tropics and further afield. In Tanzania, El Ni&#xF1;o events typically lead to heavier rain and flooding in northern parts of the country while southern parts experience less rainfall than normal. These environmental changes can have severe consequences for the livelihoods of local people, leading to crop failure and outbreaks of disease affecting humans and livestock and causing significant hardship and loss of life. &quot;Natural&quot; disasters such as these arise when society fails to respond adequately to changes in the environment, but the role human behaviour plays in shaping the outcomes of environmental change is complex and poorly understood.  The impacts of El Ni&#xF1;o are most serious in poor rural parts of the world, where households decisions about how to respond are vital if they are to minimise the harm they suffer. These decisions commonly involve changes to their livelihood activities, selling property or increasing their use of natural resources and are often referred to as coping strategies. The set of possible coping strategies a household can use depends upon the resources they can call upon, and these can in turn be affected by their environment and the existence of relevant institutions. Together these three factors - household level differences and institutional and environmental context - are important determinants of local scale impacts of environmental shocks. In this project, we examine how Wildlife Management Areas - a specific form of community-based natural resource management institution - affect the ability of local communities to respond to El Ni&#xF1;o. In theory WMAs could lessen El Ni&#xF1;o&apos;s impacts if they improve the condition or availability of natural resources at key times, or lessen conflict. However, they could also have a negative effect if they impose restrictions on natural resource use that reduce the set of coping strategies a household can call on. We will investigate this interaction using survey data collected from more than 1,200 households across Tanzania, comparing El Ni&#xF1;o&apos;s impacts in the differing environments of the north and the south and in areas with and without WMAs. In addition, we will examine whether impacts vary between different types of individuals or households within a community (e.g. men and women, richer and poorer households, households relying more or less on natural resources). Our results will provide valuable new insights into the reasons why some households and communities are more seriously affected by environmental change and help communities to become more resilient in the future.</narrative>
