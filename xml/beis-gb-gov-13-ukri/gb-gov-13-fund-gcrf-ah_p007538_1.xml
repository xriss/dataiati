  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Museums in the Pacific region have the potential to play a vital role in the sustainable development of their nations. They are associated with the preservation of tangible and intangible heritage, and have the capacity to communicate customary knowledge of the environment, and local approaches to resource management, work, value and social relations. But they are also institutions of civil society, able to support education and community cohesion. Heritage, in the Pacific, is not exclusively past practice, but the negotiation of identity and the attachment to place in the context of the economic and environmental challenges of the present. While universal models of heritage and of museums are not necessarily appropriate to Pacific settings, museums can constitute spaces of engagement and partnership, in which local values and accomplishments are foregrounded. Already institutions in which culture is represented and celebrated, they have the capacity to become places in which local approaches to the future, including prospective engagement with NGOs and donor nations, are assessed and explored.  This pilot project will focus on two museums within the Pacific: the Solomon Islands National Museum in Honiara, and the Kiribati Cultural Centre in Tarawa. The project will aim to exemplify partnership, as opposed to donor-led, approaches to cultural heritage development projects, and will produce a report and journal articles, outlining the specific needs and goals of each museum, that could be addressed through larger, future projects. The project&apos;s comparative orientation aims to draw attention to the heterogeneity of Pacific settings, and hence suggest ways of assessing the extent to which successful approaches may or may not be transferable. The project will contribute to making displays and testing public and community engagement programs based in the two museums that are socially purposeful, effective and sustainable. The project will also make a concrete contribution to the development of professional capacity in Kiribati and the Solomon Islands, through the Indigenous internships offered, and through cross-cultural knowledge exchange between project staff, museum staff, consulted experts, and local people. The project will result in journal articles targeting scholarly and practitioner communities in anthropology, development studies, cultural policy studies, museum and heritage studies, and Pacific studies, and will generate reports for each of the museums, their stakeholders and for organisations with related interests, that will provide a basis for future work.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project is closely aligned with the call&apos;s fourth strand, &apos;Cultural heritages, interpretation and representation&apos;. It centres upon support for the agency of local populations in conserving, interpreting and using local culture and heritage, particularly in shaping and advancing the work of local museums in the Pacific.  Aiming to lay the ground for comparative understandings salient to the region as a whole, this will be a pilot project, focussing on two museums within &apos;least developed&apos; states: the Solomon Islands National Museum in Honiara, and the Kiribati Cultural Centre in Tarawa, with whom the PI&apos;s research group has ongoing collaboration. This project will ask: 1. What are the current contexts of the two museums, what are they expected to contribute socially by their staff and by stakeholders, and what challenges are they facing?   2. What roles do the museums already play, or have the potential to play, in terms of sustainable development? What goals can museum-based activities support?  3. What is the best practice for conducting consultation-based research? How can this research project provide an evaluative framework, aligned with local perspectives of needs and priorities, that can be used in other Pacific Island communities wanting to identify cultural heritage developmental needs? How can researchers and NGOs most effectively help to build the capacity of local museum and heritage staff? The PI and a research assistant will undertake fieldwork in the Solomon Islands and Kiribati, scheduling a series of workshops and consultations in collaboration with the two musuems, both with professionals and non-professional stakeholders. These workshops and consultations will provide opportunities for open discussion around the roles of the museum and its contribution to sustainable development goals. In particular we will be attentive to local as well as global issues, and intra-museum challenges. Participants&apos; insights regarding these issues will be recorded, but beyond seeking answers to set questions, we would create space for all stakeholders to respond to issues on their own terms.  We will recruit Indigenous interns who may bring local-area and linguistic expertise to the group. They will undergo training with the RA, and extend the capacity of the team, enabling efficient data capture.The project aims to build capacity in cross-disciplinary, experimental museum-based research; it aims to support the career development not only of project staff but the interns in both countries, and the staff at those museums. Staff, interns and interested community members in Kiribati and the Solomon Islands will be invited to join an ongoing dialogue around the project via social media platforms, which will be established prior to fieldwork in the Pacific, in order to generate awareness of, and interest in the project. This pilot project will publish several journal articles targeting museum studies, anthropology, international development, and cultural policy journals taking the project to the widest possible range of cross-disciplinary audiences, and in addition will produce a report that summarises the findings of each in-country consultation that will be given to each museum. These reports will form the basis of future partnerships between the project team and those cultural institutions involved.</narrative>
