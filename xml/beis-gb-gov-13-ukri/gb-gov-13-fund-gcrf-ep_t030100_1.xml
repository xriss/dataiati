   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Air quality in most East African cities has declined dramatically over the last decades and it air pollution is now the leading environmental risk factor for human health.  There is a critical lack of data to assess air quality in East Africa, and therefore to quantify its effect upon human health. Air quality networks in East Africa are still in their early days, with the long term and systematic measurement of air pollutants only available at less than a handful of sites.  Large spatial and temporal gaps in data exist. From a historical perspective, very little is known of air pollution concentrations before 2010. The lack of historical data makes it extremely difficult to assess the deleterious effects of air pollution upon human health. It also poses challenges for assessing the efficacy of air quality interventions. Hence informed decisions about infrastructure, which take air quality into account are difficult to make.   This proposal forms a new network to co-create strategy and protocols to bring together data that relate to air pollution in East African Urban areas. It targets the capitals of Ethiopia (Addis Ababa), Kenya (Nairobi) and Uganda (Kampala). New data science techniques will be developed to synthesize disparate data streams into spatially and temporally coherent outputs, which can be used to understand historic, contemporary and future air quality. The proposal will provide a road map to harness the power of new data analytics and big data technologies.    To design this roadmap, three high intensity workshops and interspersed virtual meetings will be undertaken in Stage 1.  Each workshop will tackle a key knowledge gap or development challenge:   - Workshop 1: Parameterizing the data problem in East Africa for assessing the causes and effects of air pollution (Kampala)  - Workshop 2: Big data approaches to improve East Africa air quality prediction (Addis Ababa)  - Workshop 3: Creating greater capacity and capability in analytic air quality science (Nairobi)   The Stage 1 research outcomes will enable the development of tailored mitigation strategies for improving air quality. The methodologies developed in the proposal will be translatable and scalable throughout urban East Africa.  Hence, the proposal will help realise multiple sustainable development goals (SDGs), including SDG3: Good health and well-being, SDG11: Sustainable cities and communities, and SDG17: Partnerships for the goals.   To ensure the project reaches its maximum potential, it includes an extensive array of research translation activities: workshops with academic and non-academic stakeholders; a professionally designed website, which will hold both academic and non-academic outputs including open source academic papers and presentations; briefing notes directed at a range of external stakeholders, including top down governance and bottom up grassroots organizations.   Project partners from business, academia, governance and public engagement with science are involved and will attend the workshops. They are Uber, Amazon Web Services, PA Consulting, Kampala Capital City Authority, African Population Health Research Centre, Birmingham Open Media, GCRF Multi-Hazard Urban Disaster Risk Transitions Hub, and the Alan Turing Institute. They offer an additional &#xA3;102,951 of in-kind contributions to the project. Their incorporation widens the available skillsets and will help deliver long-term impact in the East African region.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="To be successful, this project seeks to achieve two goals:    - Generate a dynamic and open network with which to advance air quality science in the East African region.  - Embrace the power of digital innovation to overcome current data, capacity and capability gaps.    The overarching objective of this network proposal is to produce a framework through which to generate new data analytical approaches to the problems of poor air quality in East African urban areas with a focus on Addis Ababa (Ethiopia), Kampala (Uganda) and Nairobi (Kenya). In particular, the framework will enable methodologies for reducing the paucity of spatial and temporal information with respect to air pollution in the three cities.   The proposal will be achieved through three high intensity workshops and interspersed virtual meetings in each of the target cities. Each workshop will tackle a key knowledge gap or development challenge:   - Workshop 1: Parameterizing the data problem in East Africa for assessing the causes and effects of air pollution (Kampala)  - Workshop 2: Big data approaches to improve East Africa air quality prediction (Addis Ababa)  - Workshop 3: Creating greater capacity and capability in analytic air quality science (Nairobi)  These networking activities will develop a strong cohort of people, including a sustainable network of East African experts, and ideas capable of providing tailored mitigation strategies for improving air quality in the region using digital solutions. The outcomes to be realized in Stage 2 will be improved health, economic and social outcomes for local populations."></capital-spend>
