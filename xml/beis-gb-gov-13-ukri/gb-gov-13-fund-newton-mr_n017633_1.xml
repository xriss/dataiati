   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Species of Leishmania threaten 350 million people worldwide on four continents. The Leishmaniases are the second deadliest parasitic disease and all pathologies of this diverse disease are present in Brazil. The World Health Organisation estimates 12 million people globally are currently infected and over 1 million new cases occur annually. No vaccine currently exists and available Leishmaniasis treatments are threatened by growing resistances and often overwhelmed by acute epidemics that are increasing in occurrence and severity. New treatments and vaccines are desperately needed and the UK and Brazilian governments are committed to the World Health Organisation&apos;s recent call to further support Neglected Tropical Disease research.  The single-cell Leishmania parasite transforms into many different forms during its lifecycle to adapt to very different hosts; moving from mammals to sandflies and back to mammals by sandfly bites. Only Leishmania parasites of certain lifecycle stage forms can infect and survive in humans. Major changes to the Leishmania parasite&apos;s appearance, metabolism and virulence occur during these transitions that enable them to survive. Gene expression in Leishmania relies almost exclusively upon mRNA regulation. In response to changes in the environment, specific parasite proteins bind mRNAs and target them for protein production to guide and promote adaptation. Proteins that control the adaptation of these parasites enable them to survive in and infect humans. Such proteins are essential for the virulence and spread of the Leishmania parasite infection.   We have recently isolated a major control panel &quot;Regulator&quot; protein, PRMT7, which controls Leishmania parasite virulence in mammalian infections. Very few Leishmania regulator proteins have yet been identified and this finding represents a major leap forward to isolate and examine this regulatory pathway and block parasite virulence. To study the PRMT7 regulation pathway and identify the way this protein functions, we have assembled a team of experts in Leishmania parasite PRMT proteins, RNA regulators and protein interactions. We believe insight into this pathway will enable us to block the parasite from establishing human infections.   We have identified some downstream target proteins of PRMT7 and now seek to determine if they are regulated by PRMT7 and whether they participate in Leishmania parasite virulence. Leishmania proteins are different from human proteins; therefore we can use these differences to target Leishmania- specific virulence factors, block their function and block Leishmaniasis from developing. Significant findings will provide insight to Leishmaniasis research as well as diseases caused by related parasites, Chagas Disease and African Trypanosomiasis.  We propose to find more regulators of Leishmania spp. virulence using the PRMT7 virulence pathway. We will identify how these regulators function, and test whether any are essential for parasite survival. Essential Regulators could serve as potential drug targets to block Leishmania parasite infection.  The novelty and importance of our project is four fold:  1. PRMT7 is the only Protein aRginine Methyl Transferase enzyme that has been characterised in Leishmania spp. parasites thus far and it appears to block virulence (Ferreira et al., 2014).  2. Methylation as a protein modification is uncharacterised in Leishmania spp. parasites.  3. Regulatory RNA binding proteins (RBPs) that are important in parasite lifecycle differentiation, human infectivity and virulence are largely unknown in Leishmania spp. 4. The 3-dimensional molecular structures of RBPs and mRNA:protein complexes are largely unknown in all parasites and are absent in Leishmania spp.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="The Leishmaniases present the second deadliest parasitic disease and ninth largest disease burden amongst infectious diseases. The World Health Organisation (WHO) estimates over a million new cases annually, with no vaccine and limited treatments. Evidence indicates host-parasite interactions have a role in parasite immune response evasion and the environment of the human immune cell triggers differentiation of Leishmania spp. parasites to virulent amastigote forms. Despite extensive investigation in the scientific field, our knowledge of the molecular mechanisms that govern gene expression in these parasites is still incomplete.  Constitutive transcription in kinetoplastid Leishmania parasites necessitates almost complete reliance on post-transcriptional control of gene expression. Precise gene regulation is essential to the infectivity of Leishmania parasites as their lifecycle passages from extracellular promastigotes in the sandfly vector to intracellular amastigotes in human macrophages. Molecular regulators of differentiation promote metabolic shifts, protein signaling and morphological changes that allow the parasite to respond and adapt to the new host environment. As differentiation to the virulent amastigote stage is essential to the survival of Leishmania parasites in human hosts, then blocking trans-regulators or downstream mRNA targets could prevent further infection altogether. Essential trans-regulators present an untapped pool of virulence factors.  We recently demonstrated that the Protein aRginine Methyl Transferase enzyme, PRMT7, regulates Leishmania parasite virulence in vitro and in vivo (Ferreira et al., 2014). Our collaborative study of PRMT7 is the only characterisation of a PRMT enzyme in Leishmania spp. and our preliminary data suggests it directly modifies trans-regulatory RNA binding proteins (RBPs). Arginine methylation in mammals and yeast modify a wide variety of protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions. This suggests that methylation modification could control RBP function in Leishmania parasites, as observed in other eukaryotes. We isolated candidate RBP targets of this enzyme which may be implicit in parasite differentiation and virulence. In Leishmania, mRNP (RBP:RNA complex) regulators of lifecycle progression have yet to be identified and this uncharacterised PRMT7 molecular pathway presents an excellent opportunity to investigate parasite-specific factors fundamental to parasite survival in the host.  The aim of the proposed work is to characterise the PRMT7 molecular regulatory pathway which regulates Leishmania virulence in mammals.  We will use Leishmania major as a genetically manipulable model to: - Dissect the impact of PRMT7 levels upon virulence versus differentiation. - Verify and characterize mRNP complexes regulated by PRMT7: associating trans-regulators and transcript targets - Examine the structural biology of RBPs in presence/absence of methylation, RNA targets and PRMT7.   The bulk of the proposed experiments will use cultured L.major parasites as genetic and biochemical tools are available within the Walrad and Cruz labs at York and Sao Paulo Universities. We will build upon our initial findings to investigate PRMT7-targeted regulatory mRNPs which enable L.major virulence. Essential regulators could serve as potential drug targets to block parasite infection and inform new strategies for control of the Leishmaniases.  Hypothesis: Levels of PRMT7 are inversely proportional to Leishmania virulence as demonstrated in Ferreira et al., 2014. PRMT7 methylates trans-regulatory mRNPs and coordinates differentiation and survival of Leishmania parasites during transmission by the sandfly vector to the human host.  RESEARCH QUESTIONS: 1. How does PRMT7 regulate Leishmania parasite adaptation and virulence in mammals?  2. Which PRMT7-target mRNPs promote Leishmania virulence?  3. How does methylation impact the function and structure of target mRNP complexes?"></capital-spend>
