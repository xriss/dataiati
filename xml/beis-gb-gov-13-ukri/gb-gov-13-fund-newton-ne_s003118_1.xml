  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Half of the world&apos;s cities with populations above 100,000 are located within water basins where over half of the available water supply is depleted for part of the year. These water-stressed cities are finding it extremely difficult and expensive to secure the additional water supplies needed to support their growth. Water security is of particular concern for Filipino cities, which have been designated amongst the worst in Asia for urban water security. Changing climate and increasing urban population density will put more stress on their water resources. Current projections of climate up to 2050 suggest the Philippines will become warmer, with increasing temperature and decreasing rainfall during the dry season and more extreme rainfall events during the wet season. This will undoubtedly exacerbate both water availability during periods of drought and the magnitude of flood events during periods of heavy rainfall. This susceptibility has led to the Philippines being consistently ranked near the top of countries most at risk to climate change. In addition to water stresses from a changing climate, population is expected to increase by ~50% up to 2050, with urban population set to double over the same period. This will further exacerbate pressures on future water resources.  The influence of climate and population change will have an acute impact on groundwater, which currently supplies more than 50% of the potable water supply and 85% of the piped water supply in the Philippines. Groundwater is strategically and economically important to current and future water supply and is the principle source of dry season river flows, which in turn are often used for potable supply. Despite the high reliance on groundwater resources, reasonable coverage of groundwater datasets and several regional-level groundwater management plans, there has been little in the way of real-time monitoring, routine monthly forecasting or impact assessment of climate and population stressors. Through a programme of data gathering, knowledge exchange, fieldwork, numerical modelling and stakeholder engagement the Philippines Groundwater Outlook (PhiGO) project seeks to undertake assessments of population and climate change impacts on regional groundwater resources and translate these into usable forecasts of flood and drought risk. There are two distinct timeframes at which uptake and potential benefits of the project will be realised. Short term, seasonal-scale forecasts will aid in reactive preparedness, whilst long term, decadal-scale forecasts can be used to take proactive steps towards reducing the future physical and economic impacts of extreme hydrometeorological events. To better understand the potential socio-economic impacts of groundwater level extremes and potential water management strategies, PhiGO is also focussed on quantifying the cascading impacts of flood and drought through key infrastructure and analysing the cost-benefit of differing water management and urban planning scenarios.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The key objective is to deliver consistent, accessible and transferable assessments of climate and population change on regional groundwater resources and to assess the subsequent influence on flood and drought risk, and socio-economics. This objective is tightly coupled to the need to better understand and quantify the susceptibility of groundwater to future hydrometeorological and urbanisation extremes, to improve predictions of risk and to quantify pathways for cascading impacts. This will be accomplished through a combination of historical data analysis, real-time observational data, climate downscaling, ensemble-modelling, data assimilation and statistical analysis that bring together the disciplines of hydrometeorology, hydrogeology, water management and socio-economics. The objectives are underpinned by a programme of work in the water-critical regions of Iloilo City and Pampanga in the Philippines. These regions are considered critical given their increasing population, rapidly changing land-use, vulnerability to pollution and salt-water intrusion, and limited water resources. To meet our key objective we have four principle objectives:  1. Provide a better understanding of regional groundwater dynamics and their relationship with hydrometeorological drivers and abstraction strategies.  2. Quantify the impact of projected climate and population changes on future groundwater levels up to 2065.  3. Provide a framework for delivering monthly groundwater flood and drought reports, to better inform stakeholders of risk at local and regional levels.  4. Identify and assess cascading hydrological and socio-economic impacts, to guide further research and aid in decision-making.</narrative>
