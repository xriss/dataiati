   <narrative xml:lang="EN">African Space Weather Workshop</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The main objective of this proposal is to build new capacity and research collaborations with low income countries by organizing an African Space Weather Workshop in the UK.  The workshop will facilitate the formation of an international collaborative team to monitor space weather over the African equatorial region and formulate plans to mitigate adverse space weather conditions in the region.  Fundamental to the proposal is education and training at all levels from secondary school to senior researchers.  The main objectives in order of priority are:   1) Organize a week-long African Space Weather Workshop at the University of Leicester.  To our knowledge this is the first time an international African space weather conference has been organized. The aim of the workshop will be to design a road-map to plan capacity building for African space weather monitoring, education, research and training. 2) Form an international team of scientists and engineers to build capacity for African space weather monitoring.  The workshop will enable networking and capacity building between UK and African scientists and engineers 3) Scientists and engineers to share their areas of expertise, this will enable strengths and weaknesses to be identified within the international team. 4) Key stake-holders in the area of African space weather monitoring to be identified. 5) To define space weather and identify how space weather adversely effects the equatorial African region, in particular examining the role of the equatorial electrojet. 6) Work in collaboration with key stake-holders to identify the key requirements for African space weather monitoring. 7) Identify possible sources of funding and how these should be applied to. 8) Work in collaboration with key stake-holders to identify identify key training needs necessary for African space weather monitoring.  This could involve planning further workshops, colleagues giving guest lectures, visiting lecture tours and research scientists working between several institutions.  Additional plans could also involve joint supervision of PhD students and international exchange of undergraduate and postgraduate students. (9) Identify key instruments required to monitor African space weather and identify sites where these instruments can be located.  (10) Discuss issues associated with locating instruments, bearing in mind that this may well need permission from local community leaders. (11) Discuss how knowledge gained and data will be shared amongst the team (12) Design a road-map for further collaborations.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">We seek funding to support an African Space Weather Workshop aimed at developing an international team to enhance capacity in space weather monitoring in low income countries.  The proposal seeks to utilise the world-leading capability of the UK in the field of space weather monitoring to investigate and address a specific issue impacting on countries on the DAC list. Space weather is a term used to describe the how solar-driven variations in the Earth&apos;s magnetosphere-ionosphere system can impact modern technology and thus human activity. To date space weather has primarily been studied over the polar regions. However, new emerging economies necessitates the elucidation of space weather in the equatorial regions. The most serious space weather threat to modern technological infrastructure is posed by geomagnetically induced currents (GICs) at the Earth&apos;s surface. GIC are driven by solar-wind/magnetosphere interactions which driven varying electric and magnetic field in space which again induce currents on the ground. Particularly powerful solar storms have resulted in power and communication failure. GIC can also result in currents being induced in oil and gas pipelines, leading to their degradation, of particular concern to oil-producing nations like Sierra Leone and Nigeria.  Further, changes in space weather will affect radio communication, as varying ionospheric conditions result in scintillation of radio signals. This can result in GPS and HF radio signals being absorbed, and significant GPS position and timing error. A particular challenge in the equatorial regions are high-density equatorial plasma bubbles which may span the horizon during severe space weather events.   Unique to equatorial region there is an ionospheric current system called the equatorial electrojet which may amplify space weather effects.   Disruption of radio communication will adversely affect both everyday life, commerce and disaster relief in equatorial regions. The University of Leicester are world-leading experts in space weather monitoring, using both ground-based and space-based instruments to probe space weather in the polar regions.  The research they produce is of an international excellent standard.  In this proposal we aim to utilise the University of Leicester&apos;s expertise in this area to bring together an international team of scientists and engineers for a one week African Space Weather Workshop at the University of Leicester.  The aim of the workshop is to form an international team focussed on increasing capacity for space weather monitoring, instrumentation, education and research in Africa.  The workshop will enable international networking, communication and knowledge exchange.  The workshop will identify the key challenges associated with African Space Weather Monitoring and develop a road-map for further collaborations.  The workshop will discuss how adverse space weather affects the African equatorial region, funding requirements, instrument development and deployment, and the steps needed mitigate serious space weather situation over the African equatorial region.  There will be a strong focus on identifying the training and education needs of scientists and engineers in the physics and engineering requirements associated with space weather monitoring.  This could involve planning and seeking funding for joint PhD projects between African and UK universities, academic exchanges, lecture tours of African and UK scientists, identifying instrument requirements associated with the monitoring of space weather, and engaging with local populations in building and deploying such instruments.   There will also plans for talks and activities to engage local schools and the general population in order to engage and inspire the next generation of scientists and engineers.</narrative>
