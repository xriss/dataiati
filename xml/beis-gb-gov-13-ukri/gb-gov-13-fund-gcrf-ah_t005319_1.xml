   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The ENGAGE Network aims to develop an evidence-based understanding of the role and potential of heritage sites, practices and communities in developing long-term sustainable and inclusive peace across conflict-prone border regions through creative modes of cultural productions, education, tourism, interdependent economy and social justice. Designed around the notion of &apos;humanitarian heritage&apos; as common endeavour of humanity that is indiscriminate about human race, culture, ethnicity or religion, the Network anticipates developing transferable models and forums of &apos;humanitarian heritage partnerships&apos; as a long-term reverse mechanism for conflict prevention and counter-terrorism strategy in vulnerable and neglected border regions. It will advance discourse and policy on cultural heritage as a source of economic prosperity,transcending political and cultural barriers. It will investigate strategies to counter cultural conflict rhetoric through inclusive education, heritage-centred growth, rural development and infrastructures of peace. The purpose of ENGAGE Network is to re-contextualise heritage to mobilise discussion regarding its common elements - as meeting places, trading points, sites of shared enjoyment - and as a catalyst for much needed economic and social development and Social Justice. The Network&apos;s research programme is designed around five themes: Infrastructures and Models of Regional Partnerships for Inclusive Growth; Sustainable Heritage of Hospitality Across Borders; Creative Art, Craft and Cultural Co-production; Heritage Education for Inclusiveness and Diversity; and Navigating Narratives of Displacement, Slavery and Shared Grievances in Border Conflicts.   The ENGAGE Network will work within 2 areas - The Middle East and North Africa (Egypt, Libya, Tunisia, Jordan, Lebanon, Palestine, Iraq and Iran) and Southern Asia (including Bangladesh, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Pakistan, and India). These regions/countries have been chosen due to sustained and recurring armed, cultural, or ideological conflicts.  The Network activities will operate via 5 Regional Partnership Hubs in the designated areas: Tataouine (Tunisia), Baghdad-Erbil (Iraq/ Kurdistan), Umm-Qais (Jordan); Jaffna (Sri Lanka); and the Greater Lumbini Area (Nepal), reaching out to communities in all  beneficiary countries through the Network capacity-building funded projects programme.  This GCRF Development Award project will take the form of a pilot study to test the ENGAGE Network&apos;s research framework and methodology through the development of 3 of the 5 the proposed Regional Research Partnership Hubs - Iraq, Tunisia and Southern Nepal. The project will develop and increase links and knowledge transfer between the ENGAGE Network&apos;s international partners, PI and UK and overseas co-investigators. The award will also enable 3 collaborative workshops with stakeholders, research partners and community representatives from the regions. These workshops will explore research methodologies, approaches and challenges to the models of partnership hubs. They will take place in Tataouine (Tunisia), Baghdad-Erbil (Iraq/ Kurdistan), and the Greater Lumbini Area (Nepal). The workshops are designed to operate a number of engagements, meetings and focus group interviews to map local and regional perspectives in the co-design and co-production of the ENGAGE Network&apos;s research agenda, methodology and delivery plan. This Development Award will enable and facilitate collaborative research with partners and stakeholders in the global south to investigate strategies to counter cultural conflict rhetoric through inclusive education, heritage-centred growth, rural development and infrastructures of peace. The multi-disciplinary team includes specialists from politics, social sciences, human rights, heritage, tourism, archaeology, architecture, economics, museums and education.</narrative>
