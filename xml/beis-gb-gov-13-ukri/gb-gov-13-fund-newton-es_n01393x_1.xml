  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">1. Through 10 reciprocal PhD Student exchanges, annual cross-site meetings, and cross-site visits of individual PI&apos;s, to further develop the existing highly productive research collaboration between The University of Manchester&apos;s Faculty of Medical and Human Sciences and the Department of Medicine at the University of Cape Town.   2.  To develop partnerships in translational medical research benefiting the South African population in combating cardiovascular diseases of high morbidity and mortality in South Africa: particularly rheumatic heart disease, congenital heart disease, and peripartum and other types of cardiomyopathy.   3.  To develop a critical mass of young South African researchers in the nationally declared priority area of cardiovascular health. 4.  To build on existing areas of mutual internationally recognised strengths in the study of inherited causes of blindness, inherited hearing loss, and inherited skin disease.  Apply findings to benefit both UK and South African families with these rare inherited conditions.  Establish an internationally leading North/South collaboration in rare inherited disease research. 5.  Aid the development of a cadre of junior South African scientists with high level skills in bioinformatics and genomic medicine, which will attract international academic and industrial partnerships for precision medicine that will contribute to economic development in South Africa. 6.  Contribute to the development of scarce human resources for health in South Africa by participation in training basic scientists, clinician scientists, genetic counsellors and clinical scientists.  Thereby, facilitate the conduct of genomic medicine research in South Africa, both utilising domestic samples and internationally available data resources. 7.  Establish a UK cohort of junior scientists with career-long commitment to equitable North/South research collaborations and development of research capacity in Africa. 8.  To share access to and expertise in using state-of-the-art genomic technologies, which will enable their wider utilisation to the benefit of patients and economic development in South Africa.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Novel genomic technologies are in the process of revolutionising care for patients with rare diseases in the Western world, enabling a greater scale of molecular diagnoses among affected people and pointing the way to new approaches to risk stratification and effective molecularly driven therapies.  Nevertheless, there is a risk that the African continent may be left behind in this revolution. Indeed, existing health inequalities may be worsened through lack of availability of genomic technologies and, critically, the human capital to use them effectively in both the research and clinical settings in Africa.  This project will utilise the strengths of its partners to counter that risk by developing an international cadre of trainees committed and appropriately trained to implement genomic medicine in the African context.   The partners are The University of Cape Town, one of the Southern hemisphere&apos;s leading medical research institutions; and The University of Manchester, a leading centre for rare disease research and genomic medicine.  We will develop a cohesive programme of work involving basic science and clinical academic Principal Investigators; clinicians in cardiology, clinical genetics, audiology, ophthalmology and dermatology; health service clinical scientists, and genetic counsellors.  This will as its central goal deliver ten reciprocal PhD student exchanges with the aims of making new genetic discoveries in both South African and UK patients, exploring the pathways to clinical benefit of the knowledge obtained, and laying the foundations for long-lasting South/North collaborations.  Students in the programme will develop international links that will be of use in furthering their careers, and develop lasting commitments to promoting social and economic development in Africa through research interactions and knowledge transfer.  In addition to the student exchanges, annual meetings between PI&apos;s, and longer PI-to-PI visits, will enable the development of major strategic partnerships in this area competitive for international governmental, philanthropic and industrial funding. Of particular note, the diseases we will study include Rheumatic Heart Disease (RHD) and Peripartum Cardiomyopathy (PPCM), conditions where UCT clinical investigators have world-leading reputations and UoM investigators have highly complementary molecular and genetics expertise.  These are neglected diseases of poverty which although rare in the UK have heavy impacts on population health in sub-saharan Africa. In addition to the patient benefits expected to flow from scientific discoveries made about these conditions, this programme will increase their profile with regard to research endeavour, and illustrate the practicality and productivity of a collaborative approach.  This will be a beacon for future partnerships in these and other similarly neglected diseases.  UK students studying with international leaders at UCT will develop deep understanding of conditions they would only rarely otherwise encounter, and gain an awareness of genomic medicine in a social context different from the UK; these will be highly valuable experiences in their future careers.</narrative>
