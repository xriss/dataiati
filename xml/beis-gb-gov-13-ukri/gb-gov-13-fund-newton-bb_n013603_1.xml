   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Molecular Characterization and Genetic Analysis of Nutritional Components of Philippine Indigenous Pigmented Rice Germplasm</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Rice is a staple food for more than half of the world&apos;s population, with more than 90% of rice being consumed in Asia. Pigmented rice, such as black and red rice is traditionally used for food for special occasion. The consumption of pigmented rice is rapidly growing along with the increasing interest in health-promoting functional food. Pigmented rice contains high level of phytochemicals such as anthocyanin, flavonoids and vitamin E. Antioxidant activity of these phytochemicals helps to scavenge radical oxygen species (ROS) in human cell, thus decrease the risk of degenerative diseases such as cancer, high cholesterol and cardiovascular disease. Since the price of pigmented rice is more than twice that of white rice and the potential of pigmented rice in international market is large, growing pigmented rice as an alternative to or together with white rice will give higher income for Philippines farmers.   Currently, the Genetic Resources Division of the Philippine Rice Research Institute (PhilRice) has more than 800 accessions of pigmented rice collected from various regions of the Philippines. These rice accessions may have nutritional and therapeutic components that can be utilized in the breeding and development of new varieties of pigmented rice, but their potentials has not yet been explored.  Through this project the Philippine Rice Research Institute (PhilRice), the National Institute of Agricultural Botany (NIAB) and the International Rice research Institute (IRRI) will collaborate to screen and characterize Philippine indigenous pigmented rice germplasm to discover those pigmented rice accessions that can be utilized as new donors for pigmented rice breeding. PhilRice and NIAB will characterize the variation in agro-morphological traits, grain quality, nutritional composition, seed coat colour, antioxidant activity and phytochemical properties (anthocyanins, flavonoids) in the pigmented rice germplasm. In addition, IRRI will determine the genetic diversity of pigmented rice germplasm through SNP genotyping using Illumina Infinium 6K chip. Based on this phenotype and genotype data we will select a Core collection of pigmented rice accessions.  This Core collection will represent different classes of morphological traits, grain quality, nutritional value, antioxidant activity, phytochemical profiles and genetic subgroup. This Core collection will be used for a thorough study of the antioxidant components within pigmented rice using HPLC and Liquid Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (LC/MS) analysis at NIAB. The genetic basis of the known and potentially novel antioxidant components will be undertaken through a genome-wide association screen (GWAS).  Based on the results from the GWAS analysis we will choose several rice accessions that can be utilized as donors. We will identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are closely associated with the phytochemical having high antioxidant activity and develop trait specific SNP markers for marker-assisted selection. SNP markers have the advantage in that they can be used in high-throughput systems, having fast turnaround times and therefore enable breeders to select desirable plant materials in a shorter time.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The aim of this study is to identify rice accessions that are potential donors of high nutrient and antioxidant traits with good grain quality, and to integrate identified genetic donors into the rice breeding programmes, thereby improving the nutritional value as well as the grain quality of modern rice varieties. NutrientRice will assess the genetic value to rice breeding of Philippine indigenous pigmented rice germplasm. We will measure agro-morphological traits, grain quality, nutrient content and nutritionally valuable secondary metabolites; anthrocyanins, flavonoids and other phenolic compounds. Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) fingerprinting will be used to determine the genetic diversity of pigmented rice accessions. A subset will be chosen to form a Core collection which will be used in a Genome Wide Association Screen to identify genes related to variation in antioxidant components.  Objective 1. To assemble a Core collection of Philippine indigenous pigmented rice germplasm based on genetic diversity and morpho-agronomic variation Activity 1.1. To characterize morpho-agronomic, nutritional and secondary metabolite traits of 800 Philippine indigenous pigmented rice accessions Activity 1.2. To analyse genetic diversity and population structure of 800 pigmented rice accessions using SNP markers on Illumina BeadArray using Infinium 6k SNP Chip Activity 1.3. To select approximately 300 rice accessions of pigmented rice to form a Core germplasm collection based on phenotypic and genotypic data  Activity 1.4. To purify and produce seeds of  300 core germplasm by single-seed descent  Objective 2. To undertake a Genome-Wide Association Screen (GWAS) of the Core collection assessing grain quality and secondary metabolite composition  Activity 2.1.To identify secondary metabolites having nutritional and antioxidant properties in the Core collection of pigmented rice genotypes Activity 2.2. To characterize grain quality traits such as amylose content, gelatinization temperature and gel consistency to determine eating quality of rice genotypes Activity 2.3. To identify the loci underlying secondary metabolite and grain quality traits in the Core collection through GWAS analysis Objective 3. Integration of the Core collection in the improvement of nutritional value of Philippine rice varieties Activity 3.1. To identify genetic donors for improving nutritional value and grain quality of modern rice varieties Activity 3.2. To develop trait-specific SNPs and InDel markers for marker-aided selection Activity 3.3. To develop DNA fingerprinting database that will facilitate authentication of accessions  and essentially-derived varieties</narrative>
