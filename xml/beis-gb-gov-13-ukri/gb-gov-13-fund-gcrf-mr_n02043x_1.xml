   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Streamlining the detection of latent HIV and investigating the causes of ineffective reactivation</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">HIV incorporates its genetic material into that of an infected cell in a process called integration. Some of the integrated viruses can remain inactive, or become &apos;latent&apos;, but remain capable of reactivating later.  These viruses periodically reactivate meaning that, if treatment is stopped they can rekindle the infection, rendering HIV incurable.  One experimental approach to curing HIV is to reactivate these latent viruses whilst administering antiretroviral treatment at the same time, thereby flushing out the latent reservoir. Thus, it is crucial to be able to reactivate latent HIV effectively and measure the latent viral load efficiently.  The current gold standard measure of the latent HIV viral load is complex and labour intensive. It involves isolating the type of cells that harbour latent HIV, seeding them in defined small numbers in tissue culture wells, activating them, detecting proteins from reactivated viruses and working back to calculate the number of latently infected cells.  This process takes many days to yield a result. HIV is genetically diverse and my pilot data show that each latent virus is genetically distinct. Activating a sample will add reactivated viruses to the circulating population. Thus one expects an increase in the number of distinct viral sequences after latent viruses have been reactivated.  I will use modern sequencing methods and recently developed bioinformatics techniques to measure the number of viral sequences and correlate it with the latent viral load. This will reduce the amount of laboratory manipulation required for the assay.  Latent viruses are reactivated by activation of the cells containing them. However, even with the powerful stimuli currently available, only a minority can be reactivated.  I will generate cultures containing latent viruses. Some cultures will have only reactivatable viruses, some only non-reactivatable viruses. I will study why viral reactivation is ineffective, focusing on areas that have been overlooked in previous studies.  There is evidence that some cells can be induced to produce viral RNA, but not virus particles. It is possible that there are additional blocks in the way the cell processes viral RNA and produces viruses.  I will characterise these viral RNAs, sequence them and look for consistent mutations in apparently intact viral sequences that may account for their inability to produce virus.  We can potentially uncover novel viral encoded mechanisms through which RNA processing and production are controlled.  Most integrated viruses are defective or non-reactivatable. Reactivatable viruses constitute a small minority. It is possible that there are special features in the sites into which some viruses are integrated that make them susceptible to reactivation. Data from cell line models are inconsistent, and existing data from patient is derived from unselected cells and non-reactivable infected cells, both contain large proportions of defective viruses.  I will characterise the integration sites of reactivatable integrated viruses and identify features rendering the virus susceptible to reactivation.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">HIV is incurable because the virus can remain latent. The virus establishes latency after it has integrated its genetic material into that of the host. Latently infected cells can persist in an infected patient. The latent viruses can reactivate over time, rekindling the infection and thus necessitating lifelong treatment. Reactivating latent HIV can cause the immune elimination and death of the infected cells. This forms of the basis of the &apos;shock and kill&apos; strategy, which is the main experimental approach aimed at HIV cure. To pursue this strategy requires an effective way to reactivate latent HIV and an efficient method to measure the latent viral load.  The aims and objectives of the project are:  1. To streamline the assay for latent viral load  The virus outgrowth assay is an established way to measure the latent viral load.  It involves selecting resting CD4 T cells, limiting dilution, stimulating these cells to cause T cell activation and in doing so, reactivating the latent viruses. Reactivated HIV is then detected by an appropriate assay.  This method is definitive, but it is extremely labour intensive.  HIV replication is error-prone. My pilot data shows that each latent virus that I have reactivated is genetically distinct from each other. Activating a sample of infected cells will add reactivated latent viruses to the actively replicating population, and will thus increase the repertoire of distinct viral sequences in the sample. By measuring this increase I will be able to infer the latent viral load. This approach circumvents the problems posed by the presence of defective integrated viruses and variations in the burst size of each reactivated infected cell. Whilst the technique will not increase the number of viruses reactivated it will simplify the detection assay by facilitating an earlier readout and reducing the amount of laboratory manipulation.  2. To study the causes of ineffective viral reactivation  It is now clear that even with maximal T cell activation, only a minority of intact latent viruses can be reactivated. I will study the potential causes of ineffective reactivation.  a. Numerous studies have reported that some cells can be induced to produce viral RNA but not virions, suggesting the presence of post transcription blocks in HIV gene expression. I will confirm the presence of these viral intracellular RNAs and characterise them. I will sequence these viral transcripts, seeking mutations that are consistently present in apparently genetically intact viruses.  This can potentially identify viral regulatory elements that are important in virion production.  b. I will study the sites of viral integration.  The site of integration affects the activity of the virus in vitro, but the findings are model-specific. Whilst the integration sites of non-inducible viruses have been studied, the integration sites of reactivatable viruses have not been studied from patient samples. These reactivatable cells are a very small minority of all infected cells. It is possible that the integration sites of reactivable viruses have particular features of importance that permit reactivation which will guide our efforts to achieve total reactivation.    c. I will study the effect of DNA base modifications on virus activity. In vitro studies have shown that CpG methylation is important in the regulation of HIV gene expression.  However, data from ex-vivo studies are conflicting. Existing data have not taken into account that non-reactivable latently infected cells may contain transcriptionally active, defective integrated viruses. CpG methylation is identified by bisulphite genomic sequencing, but this technique does not distinguish CpG methylation and CpG hydroxymethylation, and the two DNA base medications have different effects on transcription.  This is an area of HIV biology that needs investigation and clarification.</narrative>
