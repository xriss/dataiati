   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Between 400,000 and 1 million people die each year in LMICs due to diseases related to mismanaged waste. Waste management is, however, a complex area, which affects multiple stakeholders, such as manufacturers, distributors, retailers, households, the recycling industry, informal waste pickers and local governments, and therefore requires an integrated approach.   Malawi and Tanzania are two of the world&apos;s poorest countries, yet the consumption of plastics has exploded in the last decade. Tanzania and Malawi make important case-study countries because of their recent governmental responses to plastic bags, and their contrasting policy landscapes in terms of tackling plastic wastes. In many cities in sub-Saharan Africa, plastic wastes, and plastic bags in particular, block urban drainage systems. During rain events this leads to localised flooding, with an increased risk of human exposure to raw sewage and the spread of waterborne pathogens within highly populated areas. Plastic waste can also act as a transient receptacle for rainwater and thus provide a larval habitat for mosquitoes. Therefore, the negative impacts of plastic pollution on human health can include the spread of pathogens such as cholera and typhoid, and the provision of transient receptacles for breeding mosquitoes that can carry diseases such as malaria and Zika virus. In parallel, the consequences of living with significant levels of environmental plastic pollution can negatively affect mental health and well-being. However, despite wide-scale recognition of the need for LMIC governments to invest more thoroughly in solid waste management, this remains a low funding priority area, with fragmented responsibility between departments and a lack of time or technical expertise to negotiate suitable waste management strategies. Typically, governments, communities and individuals in sub-Saharan countries prioritise health-care, and food and water security, followed by employment, education and housing. Plastic pollution rarely registers as something important enough to re-direct valuable resources away from these more pressing challenges. However, we argue that waste management is inextricably linked to health and should not be treated as a separate issue. By characterising how people interact with plastics on a day-by-day basis, the SPACES project will provide the framework needed to build circular economies with improved, more sustainable development pathways and new economic opportunities, and have far-reaching implications for human health and well-being, ecosystem services and economic stability in sub-Saharan Africa and beyond.  Quantitative and qualitative mixed methods approaches will be developed to understand what socioeconomic and political obstacles exist for incentivising governments to remove plastic waste and increase sustainable waste disposal. Novel strategies for intervention, mitigation and sustainable adaptation by local communities will be co-developed using extensive behavioural economics and anthropological methods in tandem with environmental, biological, epidemiological and geographical approaches. Working with a range of local recycling associations and entrepreneurs, together with local government and council leaders, the SPACES project will provide both the evidence and incentives that will allow individuals, communities, business leaders and national decision-makers to foster a sustained change in attitudes for tackling the challenges of plastic waste in the environment. In turn delivering a step change towards enabling a cleaner, more resilient and more productive environment.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">We argue that waste management is inextricably linked to the indicators of development and the targets of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly Goal 3 &apos;Good Health and Well-being&apos;, Goal 6 &apos;Clean Water and Sanitation&apos;, Goal 9 &apos;Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure&apos; and Goal 12 &apos;Responsible Consumption and Production&apos;. Rather than being treated as a separate issue, tackling plastic waste should be considered as a key driver for improving health and access to those ecosystem services essential for alleviating social inequalities. Our vision for the SPACES project is to provide a more sustainable framework for plastic consumption together with management that is built upon an understanding of how plastic waste can affect human health and well-being. Central to this vision is the development of mechanisms to involve local communities in decision making about waste collection.  Overarching Aim: to understand the public health risks and environmental impact of plastic pollution in developing countries, and to explore which interventions, policies and regulations best mitigate these risks  Key research objectives:  1. Determine the socio-political obstacles for incentivising governments to remove plastic waste and increase sustainable waste disposal  2. Calculate the spatial and temporal flows of different types of plastics through both cities  3. Characterise the interdisciplinary interactions between the sustainable management of plastic waste and community health  4. Assess the potential for plastic waste to increase the incidence of medically-important mosquito species in urban areas  5. Quantify colonisation of plastics by enteric pathogens and AMR genes, and the potential for microplastics in urban soils to enter the food chain  6. Co-design and test locally-appropriate intervention strategies for reducing plastic consumption and increasing recycling  7. Incentivise local communities to adopt practices of recycling and reuse  8. Co-develop recommendations through a decision making framework to inform evidence-based sustainable waste management strategies  9. Enhance training opportunities to provide a lasting legacy of increased research capacity</narrative>
