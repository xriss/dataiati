   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Develop an interventional study on reducing antibiotic over-prescribing among children with URIs in rural Guangxi, China</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Irrational use of antibiotics is a serious issue globally. It is also very common among children with acute upper respiratory tract infection (URTI).  It left many children suffering from the bacterial resistance due to irrational use of antibiotics, especially in less developed rural area. Antibiotic widely abused in China, more severe in rural areas. However, few studies focused on this area in developing countries including China. We intend to carry out a feasibility study rural Guangxi, China to explore an effective approach of reducing irrational antibiotic prescription for upper respiratory infections (URTIs) among children.  To define the facilitators and barriers that influence antibiotic prescribing for childhood URIs in rural Guangxi, questionnaire will be used to interview policy makers from provincial, county Bureau of Health and leaders from township hospital. We will also interview these policy-makers, clinicians and caregivers to obtain their perspective opinions regarding rational antibiotic use. Then the theory based intervention package, which had been developed in Bangladesh and tested in Zhejiang province, will be evaluated in rural Guangxi once adapted further to be sensitive to the local context. Finally the intervention package will then be tested in 6 townships within one county. Six township hospitals will be divided into three groups. The arm A will be only targeted clinicians, with: operational guidelines and training on rational antibiotic use, mobile message reminder from pharmacist). Group B will be involving both clinicians and caregivers , which will include: the leaflet material and video information on rational antibiotic use, workshops between parents/caregivers and the trained kindergarten volunteers. The usual-care control group C will manage patients according to the clinicians&apos; normal procedures without any intervention.  We will carry out the intervention for 6 months and collect inpatient and outpatient prescriptions for 6 months before and after interventions. A questionnaire survey will be conducted to see the changes among clinicians, caregivers and kindergarten teachers&apos; knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) before and after intervention at each group. Interview and group discussion will be used to see if this study is feasible and acceptable with the intervention package. Also positive and negative factors for the intervention implementation will be carried out.  We will assess effectiveness though the difference in the antibiotic prescriptions rate among all the prescriptions between before and after intervention and between intervention and control groups. Those preliminary data will help us to aid in planning a larger effectiveness study in whole Guangxi province.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">we will explore the effect of a multidimensional intervention on inappropriate antibiotic use for URTIs in comparison to usual care in rural China. At this stage, we wish to conduct a pilot study to test the feasibility of interventions and gain some measure of effectiveness for a larger trial.  Specific objectives:  1, To conduct qualitative studies to define the facilitators and barriers that influence antibiotic prescribing for childhood URTIs and shape the intervention package based on interviews with the local healthcare managers, clinicians and caregivers.   2, To refine the specific interventions based on an integrated theory model from theory of planned behaviour, social cognitive theory and operant learning theory. We will also assess how the intervention will impact the individual levels of attitude, motivation and intention from clinicians and caregivers&apos; sides, the organizational level of policy and the reinforcing factors from leadership and social norms.The proposed interventions will be based on international guidelines (Integrated management of childhood illness (IMCI) and NICE), previously used in Bangladesh by one of our co-investigators, and being piloted in rural Zhejiang China. 3, To measure the feasibility of the interventions through their acceptability, demand, implementation and effectiveness and the KAP of clinicians, caregivers and teachers through qualitative and quantitative methods. Adherence to guidelines and how knowledge is put into practice will be assessed through prescription review. Patient flows will be assessed to inform enrolment strategies and intra-cluster correlation coefficients (ICC) will be measured to inform sample size estimations.</narrative>
