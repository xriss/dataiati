   <narrative xml:lang="EN">All over the world, there is a growing problem with antibiotics: there have been years of misuse by patients, doctors and even farmers seeking greater yields from livestock, with the result that microbes have learned to live with these once potent drugs. This problem is particularly acute in India, where access to professional healthcare is often limited and so ineffective antibiotics are bought and used by patients. For agricultural and domestic labourers, minor damage to the surface of the eye frequently results in bacterial and fungal infections; when not properly treated, this can lead to corneal ulceration and, eventually, to blindness.  In a working-age person, the economic consequences can be disastrous for them and thier families. Given these issues, we are now looking for an alternative route to protect eyes against microbes. We have formed a partnership with a leading eye hospital, LV Prasad Eye Institute. LVPEI have developed a pyramidal structure so that research developed in the advanced research and surgery centre in Hyderabad can rapidly be disseminated throughout their organisation. They have a major drive to develop therapies that can benefit patients in rural villages.  The approach that we have taken came originally from a study of how our cells stick together to form tissues such as skin. There are structures on the surfaces of cells that resemble Velcro,  highly organised patches of adhesive molecules that enable cells to cling tightly together. In some cases, these are long-lasting and static; in other cases they are short-lived and dynamic, allowing mobility, for instance when our white blood cells are travelling through tissues to get to the site of an infection. We discovered that some types of bacteria and yeasts can &apos;hijack&apos; the dynamic sites, to allow them to stick to our tissues even when our natural defences try to dislodge them with tears and blinking. This is the starting point of an infection, when a colony of microorganisms attaches and starts to grow, often then penetrating deeper into tissues to cause serious disease. Even superficial infections can cause problems, leading to ulceration of the surface of the eye and eventually blindness if not properly treated.   Different types of microbes use different types of human molecules to cling to: targeting all of them would be very expensive. Our approach is not to target the molecular hooks themselves, but the material in which they are held to form the sticky patches. On Velcro, hooks are embedded in a baselayer of woven material but on our cells this is formed by a sort of molecular raft called a microdomain. We have discovered how to weaken one type of microdomain, in a way that is analagous to stretching Velcro, pulling the molecular hooks further apart and significantly lowering the stickiness of the patches on cells. By addressing only one type of microdomain, we have found that we do not affect the normal behaviour of our cells but we do make bacteria and fungi much easier to wash away.  Unlike antibiotics that directly target microbes, our treatment targets human cells and so should not lead to new forms of antibiotic resistance. If we can show that it is both safe and effective on the types of microbes that cause eye infections in India, we aim to produce a cheap and simple treatment for people who have injured their eyes, or who have early stage infections. This could be administered by patients or by a network of trained volunteers, easily and quickly. By helping to prevent infection, or giving more time to seek professional diagnosis, we hope to reduce the rate of a common cause of blindness in young people in India.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="WP1 ASSESS EFFECTIVENESS OF PEPTIDES AGAINST A RANGE OF CLINICALLY RELEVANT MICROBES For a treatment that would be useful in rural India, we need to demonstrate that peptides are effective against common Indian pathogens and that the target pathogen range is sufficiently broad to support the use of peptide even when diagnosis of the infection is delayed.   WP2 INVESTIGATE MECHANISM OF PEPTIDE ACTION We need to understand the mechanism of action of the peptide to ameliorate possible &quot;off-target&quot; effects, facilitate future improvements in targeting and to help consolidate the IP position. We will correlate the peptide concentrations used in the inhibition of bacterial adhesion with those needed to cause measurable changes in biophysical parameters.   WP3 EXPLORE INTERACTIONS OF THE PEPTIDES WITH NEUTROPHILS IN A CORNEAL ORGAN CULTURE MODEL It will be important to study the action of peptides on the inflammatory response to infection. None of the existing infection models have immune cells as components and so interaction with normal pathogen clearance mechanisms have not been examined.   WP4 EXPLORE EFFECTS OF PEPTIDES ON INNATE IMMUNITY Antimicrobial peptides (AMP) are very important in overcoming eye infections (Ref: Sharma et al., 2018) and cytokines can stimulate excessive inflammation leading to more collateral damage and so it is important to determine if peptide treatment can affect expression.   WP5 EXPLORE SYNERGY BETWEEN PEPTIDES AND EXISTING ANTIBIOTICS Lack of new antibiotics is causing problems. We already have supporting data showing a positive interaction between peptide and antibiotic in epithelial cell cultures. Potentiation of the effect of antibiotics holds the promise of resurrecting currently ineffective antibiotics.   WP6 INVESTIGATE EFFICACY AND SAFETY OF PEPTIDES IN A LIVE ANIMAL MODEL When testing agents for safety and efficacy, experiments must be conducted in India to satisfy regulators and the peptides must be shown to work safely in an animal model for next step of translation. We must minimise risk of translation into the clinic by demonstrating efficacy in vivo.   WP7 ASSESSING EFFECT OF PEPTIDE TREATMENT ON BIOFILMS Pseudomonal keratitis routinely involves biofilms [29], which are difficult to eradicate and can promote AMR. We aim to determine if the peptides inhibit initial biofilm formation or disrupt established biofilm, helping to establish the stage we should be administering peptides as prophylactic or for established infections.   WP8 ASSESS HEALTH ECONOMICS AND FEASIBILITY OF THE USE OF PEPTIDES AS A FIRST LINE TREATMENT IN OF EYE INFECTION Early health economic modelling will be performed to understand the preliminary estimates of the cost-effectiveness and economic impact of the peptide drugs. This model will include the key aspects of the decision problem such as the potential beneficiaries, their clinical outcomes, costs and other key factors (e.g. demographics). This will involve developing the value proposition, quantifying economic impact and feasibility assessment of the use of peptides as a first line treatment of eye infection in India."></capital-spend>
