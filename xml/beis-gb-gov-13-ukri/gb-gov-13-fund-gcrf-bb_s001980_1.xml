   <narrative xml:lang="EN">New approaches to a livestock trypanosomiasis vaccine: targeting the bite-site by immunization with novel metacyclic-stage parasite antigens</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">1) To express recombinant T. congolense and T. vivax metacyclic-stage proteins. Our selected proteins are T. congolense- or T. vivax-specific and are either proven or predicted to localize to the cell-surface. Previous work has shown that they are preferentially expressed in metacyclics. For T. vivax, we have also shown these proteins to be immunogenic in natural infections. We will express them using our tried-and-tested mammalian expression system. Using transient transfection of suspension-grown HEK293 cells, we have expressed and purified large amounts (up to several milligrams) of recombinant T. congolense and T. vivax protein, consisting of the entire ectodomain of cell-surface receptor proteins, properly folded and decorated and suitable for vaccine screening. Gene sequences encoding ectodomains will be cloned into plasmids, expression levels evaluated and then a bulk preparation prepared using nickel affinity chromatography. Outcome: we will produce recombinant cell-surface proteins unique to metacyclic parasites, and make our novel constructs available for functional genetics.  2) To vaccinate mice with our novel recombinant antigens. We will test our experimental vaccines in a murine model, which offers the best combination of practicality and biological realism. Mice will be immunized with single recombinant antigens in the first instance, and with combinations of promising candidates thereafter. We will monitor sero-conversion of mice using ELISA against our chosen antigen(s). Animals will be rested after the final antigen boost to let the immune system rebalance after antigen delivery. Outcome: we will vaccinate mice using a range of antigens that will optimise formulation.  3) To compare patent infections in vaccinated and control mice using tsetse challenge. Trypanosomes enter hosts as metacyclic forms via the bite site, where host immunity begins in response to both metacyclics and tsetse salivary proteins. An authentic infection model should challenge with tsetse to represent these important, early stages. Moreover, our approach is to immunize with antigenically invariant, metacyclic-stage proteins and the only way to deliver viable metacyclics is through tsetse challenge. Therefore, we will infect vaccinated and control group mice with bioluminescent T. congolense or T. vivax by applying tsetse fed on infected blood. We will monitor a three-week infection using an in vitro imaging system (IVIS), while quantifying parasitaemia and anaemia from thick blood smears every three days to identify antigens that produce a significant reduction in bloodstream infection. We will also purify parasite and host cell fractions from lymph and blood samples for transcriptomic profiling. Outcome: we will identify parasite antigens that protect against infection of vaccinated mice, resulting in significant reductions in parasitaemia/dissemination.  4) To identify correlates of protection from host transcriptomics. The nature of the host immune response to T. congolense and T. vivax is poorly understood, as are the parasite effectors that may modulate immunity. We will produce the first global view of host-parasite interactions during the early stages of infection by transcriptomic profiling. We will sequence the transcriptomes of parasite cells, mouse B-cells and CD4 cells isolated from lymph (7 days dpi) and from blood (21 days dpi) on the Illumina platform. Transcript abundance in vaccinated and control groups will be compared at several time-points post-infection to determine which cytokine and chemokine genes are differentially expressed in vaccinated and protected animals. We will also profile the expression of parasite antigens to understand better their role in host-parasite interactions. Outcome: preferential expression of specific immune genes or pathways in protected animals will establish correlates of protection, while parasite transcriptomes will identify genes important in establishment of early infection.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">We will express recombinant forms of newly-discovered, parasite proteins that are specific to the surface of infective-stage cells, and examine their ability to protect vaccinated mice against infection by African trypanosomes.  African animal trypanosomiasis (AAT) is a livestock disease caused by vector-borne, blood parasites (Trypanosoma congolense and T. vivax), and endemic in 37 sub-Saharan countries. AAT causes chronic anaemia and muscle wastage, resulting in death if untreated. The UN FAO considers AAT to &quot;lie at the heart of Africa&apos;s struggle against poverty&quot; with 50 million cattle at risk and billions of dollars lost in agricultural productivity annually. Resolving AAT is an enormous challenge because trypanocidal drugs frequently solicit parasite resistance, vector control is typically unsustainable, while vaccines are unavailable because the trypanosome surface is enveloped by a variable surface glycoprotein (VSG) coat. Serial replacement of the active VSG through antigenic variation allows the parasite population to evade host immunity indefinitely. Antigenic variation is the common thread linking the physiology and epidemiology of AAT, and key to understanding and preventing disease.  Nevertheless, a vaccine remains the most sustainable solution to AAT, and thus, discovering invariant parasite antigens that elicit protective immunity is a priority. A decade of trypanosome genomics and gene expression analysis has revolutionized our understanding of the antigenic landscape. Our work has identified parasite-specific proteins expressed uniquely during the metacyclic life stage in the fly mouthparts. We have shown that metacyclic protein architecture is distinct, and unlike the VSG-dominated surface of bloodstream form trypanosomes. These stage-specific proteins are typically invariant and produce strong immune responses. Our hypothesis is that immunizing with these metacyclic antigens can provide the host immune system with a &apos;standing-start&apos; in fighting infection, producing antibodies that neutralize metacyclics before they migrate into the bloodstream and, critically, before they become antigenically variant. We aim to test this by evaluating a panel of novel antigens for their protective properties and correlates of protection.  Our motivation is to translate this knowledge into an effective vaccination strategy. In this project, our approach has several innovations. First, we examine host-parasite interactions at the bite site, where the immunological response initiates. Second, we focus on the metacyclic stage of the trypanosome life cycle prior to the onset of antigenic variation. Third, we use a natural challenge model that produces an authentic initiation to infection. We have four specific objectives. 1) Recombinant protein expression in a range of combinations. 2) Vaccinate mice using different antigen formulations. 3) Infect mice via infected tsetse bite and compare the infection in vaccinated and control animals. 4) Profile gene expression around the bite site using transcriptomics of mouse leucocytes and parasites to identify correlates of protection, while providing the first global analysis of host-parasite interactions during the first days of infection.  This project will identify antigens for an experimental multivalent vaccine against metacyclic T. congolense and T. vivax, while establishing the immunological correlates of protection. Besides the immediate application of this new knowledge to efficacy trials of an AAT vaccine, it will also transform our understanding of host-parasite interactions at the bite site. The potential commercial application of AAT vaccines is enormous, and the likely positive effect on animal health and livestock productivity across the world would be profound. As one of the world&apos;s foremost veterinary diseases, a sustainable solution to AAT would be a seminal breakthrough leading to improved health and wealth in the world&apos;s poorest countries.</narrative>
