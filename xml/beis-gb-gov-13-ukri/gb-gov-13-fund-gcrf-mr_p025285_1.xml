   <narrative xml:lang="EN">More than half of the global population is at risk for deadly and debilitating vector-borne diseases (VBD). VBDs, which include malaria, dengue, filariasis and many others, cause 1 million deaths each year and leave communities in economic hardship. While many efforts to control VBDs have been successful, we are working against the challenges of globalisation, insecticide resistance and climate change. The spread of Zika virus is a very relevant example of how these factors have fostered the rapid expansion of VBDs. The World Health Organization has called for more research to improve infectious disease surveillance so that we can prevent and control emerging and re-emerging diseases. Fortunately, there has been renewed political and financial momentum to provide interventions such as vector control and mass drug administration to combat these diseases. An early detection system would allow for a rapid response to help contain the spread, however these approaches can be costly and are out of reach of many developing nations.  We have developed a low cost, VBD surveillance tool which allows us to detect the presence of VBDs in a community. Mosquitoes pick up pathogens when they feed on a person. If the mosquito is a competent vector, the pathogen will go on to develop within the mosquito body and the mosquito becomes infective a week or two later. We have shown that when non-vector mosquitoes ingest infected blood, they excrete the pathogen DNA in their faeces over the next few days. When vectors ingest infected blood, they also excreta small amounts of pathogen DNA.   The vector excreta surveillance system (VESS) collects mosquito excreta for the purposes of screening for pathogen DNA. Mosquitoes are actively or passively collected using one of many commercial or home-made trap types for the purposes of disease-specific surveillance or research. We have made a modification to mosquito holding cups, where mosquitoes may be held prior to sorting and preservation. We have included a super hydrophobic lining below where mosquitoes rest which concentrates the excreta into a small reservoir or a funnel which deposits onto special preservative. This is a significant improvement over current monitoring methods because we are able to screen very large pools of mosquitoes at once. The mosquito samples are not used in the process so there are opportunities to integrate this method with other surveillance activities. The role of non-vectors is particularly useful since it would enable screening of other fly-borne illnesses without species-specific collections (including the parasites that cause leishmaniasis, river blindness, sleeping sickness.) There is scope for further development of excreta collection from a passive trap which would eliminate the need to actively collect the mosquitoes.  In our lab based studies we have successfully detected DNA from malaria, the filarial worm that causes lymphatic filariasis, and a trypanosome species that causes animal trypanosomiasis. This proposal aims to field-test this approach in a village in Ghana where we have already characterised disease prevalence, mosquito species and local ecology. We will use three different trap types so allow us to determine which species and life-stage (bloodfed resting mosquitoes, or gravid mosquitoes ready to lay eggs) is the most sensitive for detecting parasite DNA in the excreta. We will compare the detection from our pools of excreta with the detection from individual mosquito carcasses. We also aim to extend this methodology to the detection of viral particles from the mosquito-borne viruses West Nile, dengue, chikungunya and Zika.  This is an approach that disease control programmes in developing countries could implement in order to monitor the presence of a diverse range of blood-borne pathogens without having to collect blood from participants or process mosquitoes individually.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="Current approaches for the early detection of emergent and resurgent vector borne disease are out of reach for many low and middle income countries due to the extensive resources required to detect low community prevalence. This challenge is even greater for communities at risk for multiple vector-borne disease outbreaks, and diseases which do not prompt treatment-seeking behaviour. We present a novel, non-invasive and adaptable approach to disease surveillance which requires further stimulus to meet the needs of the global health community to monitor emerging vector-borne diseases. The vector excreta surveillance system (VESS) serves as an early alert tool by collecting and concentrating the excretory products from wild mosquitoes for the purposes of detecting digested pathogen DNA. We have conducted the initial studies to quantify mosquito excretion patterns in various mosquito genera in the lab, we have developed a low cost prototype for excreta collection and we have successfully amplified filarial and protozoan parasite DNA from vector and non-vector excreta and faeces (E/F). We are now ready to further develop this approach to meet the needs of disease control programmes for early, low-cost, and sensitive detection of vector-borne diseases.  The project aims to:  1) Field test the approach that we have optimised in the lab to detect filarial and malaria DNA in wild mosquito E/F. Under this aim we will compare infection prevalence from pooled E/F with infection prevalence in whole mosquitoes. We will also compare the sensitivity of E/F detection using a field friendly strip-based detection to the quantitative PCR.  2) Expand molecular testing to detect protozoan and viral nucleic acids in vector and non-vector E/F. We will build on our preliminary work to define the detection limits for Trypanosoma brucei brucei and we will pilot arbovirus detection using West Nile Virus. Following optimisation for WNV detection, we will also apply the methodology to detect dengue, Zika and chikungunya viruses.  The foundation award will support a collaboration of scientists which represent the spectrum of translational research, enabling us to deliver a field-ready approach now and explore the promise to detect other blood-borne pathogens of both humans and animals in the future."></capital-spend>
