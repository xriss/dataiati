   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Almost half of all children who are out of school live in conflict affected countries (at least 27 million children in 24 countries). Children in these countries are twice as likely to die before their fifth birthday and countries with conflict have some of the lowest literacy levels in the world and the largest inequalities between girls and boys, rich and poor. Good quality education can protect children in the midst of violence and provide life-saving messages concerning health and safety, as well as the knowledge, skills and attitudes to survive, recover and rebuild their society after conflict. Yet, education is often given a low priority in situations of conflict.  We know that modern conflicts can last more than 20 years and often involve multiple armed groups competing for control of government institutions [such as schools], natural resources and territory. This also means that provision of education can be highly politicised in situations of conflict and this can prevent much needed assistance reaching those who need it most - it is usually the poorest or most marginalised who suffer the worst consequences of violent conflict. Education is usually considered &apos;a good thing&apos;, but we know that in certain circumstances education may actually be &apos;part of the problem&apos; as well as &apos;part of the solution&apos;. For example, unequal access to education and distribution of education resources may fuel grievances between groups in society, particularly if they are already in conflict. Exclusion of minority voices from decision-making will cause resentment. Insensitive or politically biased education policies in terms of the language of instruction or content of the curriculum may create mistrust between different ethnic, religious or cultural groups by fuelling stereotypes, xenophobia and other antagonisms.         We therefore need to better understand the underlying political, economic and social reasons why education may sometimes aggravate conflict. This is known as Political Economy Analysis (PEA) and is highly relevant to the provision of education in conflict affected countries. However, there are problems with current approaches. There is a reliance on international consultants to undertake &apos;one-off&apos; assessments that lack sensitivity to local history, politics, culture and knowledge of power-relations that are better conveyed in local languages. There is also a tendency to ignore the impact that international agencies have on national policies and practices, and the different political circumstances that operate in different parts of a country. There is often a reluctance to raise critical questions about education provision because they are too sensitive or may challenge vested interests. These severely limit the potential of analysis to improve the planning and development of socially just education systems.  The PEER Network is a three-year initiative led by four universities (Ulster, Cape Town, Nazarbayev and Sussex) aimed at improving the quality of PEA in partnership with academics, policymakers and practitioners in conflict affected countries. By the end of the project we aim to have made an impact by:   - Establishing two regional hubs of PEA expertise across conflict affected countries in Central Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa  - Bringing together 40 policymakers, practitioners and academics to develop PEA tools, knowledge and expertise  - Commissioning at least 20 research studies worth &#xA3;800,000 to create locally owned knowledge bases  - Making all the tools and resources freely available online to students, researchers and practitioners  - Supporting a new generation to undertake political economy analysis of education systems in their own contexts  - Influencing change in global practice in PEA for the benefit of children and young people in conflict affected countries</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The PEER Network aims to develop a critical and locally grounded approach to Political Economy Analysis (PEA) of Education that will help national, regional and global level policymakers and practitioners make socially just decisions about investments in education that benefit children in contexts of conflict and crisis.    The three-year initiative has the following objectives:  1. To establish two regional hubs of PEA expertise across conflict affected countries in Central Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa 2. To develop 3 Challenge Papers to provide intellectual leadership and set the research development agenda 3. To produce 2 Regional Reviews to assess the extent of, and synthesise findings from existing political PEA of education 4. To engage with at least 40 policymakers, practitioners and academics from conflict affected countries to develop PEA tools and expertise through task-based workshops and online support 5. To commission at least 20 PEA research studies (&#xA3;800,000 in total) to create locally owned knowledge bases 6. To develop an online Community of Practice in collaboration with INEE to promote free access and use of PEA resources 7. To support a new generation of early career researchers to undertake PEA of education systems in their own contexts  8. To use existing international networks and targeted events to influence change in global practice in PEA</narrative>
