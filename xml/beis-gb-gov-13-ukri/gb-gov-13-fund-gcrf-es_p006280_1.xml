   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project seeks to build a new academic-policy bridging network to promote high quality comparative scholarship and knowledge transfer on conflict resolution and peacebuilding in South and Southeast Asia. We focus on Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Indonesia, Cambodia, Nepal, Northeast India, Timor-Leste and Thailand, all of which are at the cusp of a historic transformation, but where the pathway to peace is contested, fragile, and frequently illiberal.  Our network has three objectives: (i) to promote and network academic research on comparative peacebuilding in Asia; (ii) to enable knowledge sharing and policy advocacy among scholars, practitioners, and policy makers; (iii) to advance rigorous scholarship through collaborative publications and research proposals.   The primary activities, outputs, and expected outcomes of this network will be threefold: (i) three workshops in Asia and the UK that bring academics and policy-makers together between June 2017 and May 2018; (ii) establishing a new website to promote research and knowledge exchange that is rigorous, evidence based, but also accessible; and (iii) developing collaborative research projects on comparative peacebuilding in Asia, to form the basis for joint publications and future large research grants.  The PI and co-investigators piloted a &apos;workshop-field visit&apos; format in 2015, with internal seed funding from LSE, York and ANU, and held a very successful two-day event for scholars, practitioners, media and policy-makers at the University of Yangon, followed by a three-day field visit. With this proposal we seek to scale up that successful pilot experience and intensify dialogue with multiple stakeholders in the region. We plan two workshops with a field visit component, in Sri Lanka (June 2017), and Indonesia (December 2017); with a final workshop in London (May 2018). These events will include distinct components for academic research presentation, policy dialogue, stakeholder conversations, and knowledge-exchange.   The intellectual content of our network events is structured around two key policy themes that make peacebuilding in South and Southeast Asia particularly significant and challenging:  (1) These &apos;post&apos; conflict countries are going through political, social and economic transformations that are not linear and liberal, but often troubled, inconsistent and illiberal.   (2) Peacebuilding is in most cases happening amidst a parallel transition from authoritarian rule that can be counter-productive to ethnic conflict resolution.   Our network draws on an international consortium scholars working on conflict and peacebuilding across area studies, anthropology, criminology, development studies, political science, sociology and law.  Since we initiated our dialogue, we have developed close links with our collaborators who will help us expand country, sectoral and topical expertise, and who bring significant institutional depth to our work.   Existing members of our network, who participated in the earlier pilot in Myanmar, include Professor Alex de Waal (Tufts), a seminal author on peacebuilding and dialogue in Africa, Professor Jayadeva Uyangoda (Colombo), the pre-eminent political scientist on the Sri Lankan ethnic conflict, Professor Caroline Hughes (Bradford) on peacebuilding in Cambodia and Timor-Leste, Dr Rachael Diprose (Melbourne) on ethno-religious conflict and inequalities in Indonesia, Professor Chaw Chaw Sein (Yangon) on the dynamics of authoritarian transition in Myanmar, Dr Terence Lee (NUS) on the role of the military in authoritarian transitions in Asia, Dr Stefano Ruzza (Milan) on counterinsurgency, criminology and peacebuilding, Professor Duncan McCargo (Leeds/Columbia) on the ethno-nationalist dimensions of conflict in Southern Thailand, Dr Lars Waldorf (York) on the comparative legal aspects of peacebuilding in Asia and Africa, and Professor Sanjib Baruah (Bard), on peacebuilding and politics in Northeast India.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="Our network proposal has three core objectives:  1. Promote and link academic research on comparative peacebuilding in South and Southeast Asia, particularly with respect to illiberal trajectories of peacebuilding  We seek to promote research and facilitate interdisciplinary discussions on the illiberal, domestic driven peacebuilding processes in post-conflict South and Southeast Asia. There has been an extraordinary expansion of academic interest in this field and a new generation of scholars are producing exciting research, drawing on innovative theoretical and empirical advances. However, this field of study tends to be siloed by individual country studies, divided by disciplinary barriers, and lacking in comparative perspective. There is now a critical need for this research to be better networked in order to become more effective. Our objective is to create opportunities for the study of illiberal peacebuilding to connect, gain exposure, develop common conceptual categories, achieve comparative depth, speak across disciplines, gain in rigour, and build momentum. Our network will not be a closed loop of existing scholars working on peacebuilding in Asia, but is instead designed as a platform to identify and attract new scholars and PhD students across disciplines. We also seek to reach out to and identify promising young scholars from universities in Asia and provide mentoring, co-publishing, and inclusion in joint future research projects.  2. Promote knowledge exchange and policy advocacy among scholars, practitioners, and policy makers at various stages of their careers  Policy-makers, development planners, and development aid donors in post-conflict countries in the region are struggling to address the parallel transformations out of ethnic conflict and authoritarian pasts. We seek to create a platform for the fluid exchange of knowledge between and amongst academics and policy-makers. That is, we aim to bridge academic nodes and peacebuilding knowledge and practice in the UK, Europe, Australia, and North America, with Asia, and also to connect scholars and policy-makers within South and Southeast Asia. In particular, we focus on Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Indonesia, Cambodia, Nepal, Northeast India, Timor-Leste and Thailand. There are clear benefits to be reaped from promoting knowledge sharing so that policy-makers can learn from the experiences of other countries in the region, and also conversely, so that academic researchers can gain greater insights into the way policy-makers address these problems on a daily basis. For example, an important issue that we have identified is that South Asian research and policy networks rarely connect to those in Southeast Asia, and there are important synergies to be gained here.  3. Develop collaborative research and large research proposals  The long-term objective is for this network to produce substantial scholarly outputs based on new, collaborative, comparative research on illiberal peacebuilding in Asia. Through this, we seek to create the means for the network to gain a self-sustaining momentum beyond its funded period. We seek to do this firstly by creating the conditions for new scholarly exchanges and policy exposures, as with our pilot experience in Myanmar that created spontaneous linkages and collaborations. We also seek to do so consciously by engineering our workshops and web portal towards (i) the publication of policy briefs and an edited volume on illiberal peacebuilding in 2018-19, and (ii) developing a large collaborative multi-country research project in 2018, to be ready by our final workshop in London."></capital-spend>
