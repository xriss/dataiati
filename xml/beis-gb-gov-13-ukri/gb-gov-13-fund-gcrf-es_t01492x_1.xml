   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Strengthening Capacity for Research and Policy Engagement in Shifting Notions of Motherhood and Fatherhood for Improved Children&apos;s Wellbeing in Africa</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In this proposal, Makerere University (hub) intends to work with the University of Witwatersrand, University of Ibadan, Moi University, University of Rwanda and University of Western Cape (spokes) and their partners to enhance the capacity of Gender and Social Work Departments to research changing notions of motherhood and fatherhood, and to use the results to advocate for improved family and child welfare policies and interventions. The preference for Sciences in Africa led to a reduction in research funding for the Humanities and Social Sciences, negatively affecting the interest and capacity to research contemporary social challenges affecting the continent, including identities, motherhood and fatherhood.  The notions of Motherhood and Fatherhood are at the core of the debate on gender identities, socialisation, perceptions, status, realities and imaginations. These identities are created, (re)negotiated, contested, affirmed and (re)born at different levels; at family/ household level, community, cultural traditional, national and global levels. Yet motherhood and fatherhood as identities also change and transform. Symbolic representations of motherhood and fatherhood become political especially when informed by ideologies surrounding nationalisms-whether national or tribal, subsequently informing ideals about manhood, womanhood; or masculinity and femininity. Research on motherhood and fatherhood globally points to various forms of fathers and mothers. What do these forms mean or how important are these forms to fathers, mothers and subsequent proof of masculinity and femininity?  Different developments, such as colonialism, urbanisation, HIV/AIDS, war and conflict, structural adjustments and technology have reshaped and transformed the material and cultural foundations of parenting, and with it the gendered identities of motherhood and fatherhood. Nonetheless, there is a tendency to treat them as temporary and or deviant from the norm. As a result, there is a dearth of research in family studies. With a few exceptions, research in motherhood and fatherhood in Africa is undertaken as a socio-demographic variable explaining certain economic trends and as a predictor of reproductive health and child wellbeing and outcomes. Limited research has been undertaken to focus on parenting and what the identities of motherhood and fatherhood imply for those who perform them, and how they perform them. Consequently, there is limited evidence for legislators and policy makers in family relations and children&apos;s welfare to work with. With the exception of South Africa, we continue to see Family and Children&apos;s policies and laws which assume that all mothers are married and will have the support of a spouse or at least extended family.  Key questions to be examined will include the following:  (1) What are the changes in motherhood and fatherhood in Africa and how does it relate to changes in femininity and masculinity? (2) What are the major drivers of these changes? (3) How best can these changes be conceptualised, studied and researched about? (4) How can researchers engage policy makers for child friendly parenting policies in view of these changes? In this multi-disciplinary proposal, Makerere University and her six collaborators seek to explore ways to enhance the capacity of researchers to research motherhood and fatherhood, and to engage policy makers for better family and child friendly policy making and interventions. This theme is trans-disciplinary, bringing together expertise from Gender Studies, Social Work, African Studies and Ethics to generate new knowledge and build researcher&apos;s capacity through research and ethics training, doctoral and post-doctoral research support, conference presentations, workshops and publications to mention a few.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The overall aim of this project is to strengthen the capacity of the collaborating universities&apos; Gender Studies and Social Work Departments/Schools to teach and research shifting notions of motherhood and fatherhood, and to engage in research uptake strategies with policy makers and non-academic partners.    The specific objectives of the Partnership are: a) Research: To conduct high quality locally grounded research and theorising on shifting notions of motherhood and fatherhood in contemporary Africa, paying attention to the changes, their drivers and implications for family relations and children&apos;s welfare.   b) Capacity Building and Strengthening: To contribute to a pool of highly qualified researchers in the research area through supporting doctoral, post-doctoral and early career faculty research, mobility visits and research dissemination (conferences and policy engagement).   c) Collaboration and Partnerships: To build an intellectual community of interdisciplinary scholars from collaborating universities through collaborative research, co-research supervision, co-teaching, mobility visits, co-publishing and curriculum development.   d) Embedding: To embed our research findings within the work of the academic and non-academic communities responsible for gender, children&apos;s welfare and family relations.</narrative>
