   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Some 1.45 billion people are estimated to be infected worldwide with intestinal worms, also known as soil-transmitted helminths (STH). Chronic and intense STH infections can contribute to malnutrition and iron-deficiency anaemia, and also can adversely affect physical and mental growth in childhood. Globally, STH result in 4.98 million years lived with disability each year. Fortunately, however, the global community is increasingly committed to tackling these infections, with many countries now successfully implementing geographically-targeted programmes that provide mass treatment to school-aged children delivered through schools. However, whilst school-based deworming has many important benefits for treated children, recent mathematical modelling suggests that treating only school-aged children will rarely stop transmission of these parasites, except in very low transmission settings, and that alternative approaches to treatment, including extending coverage and frequency of treatment, are required. To effectively deliver such expanded treatment, there is an associated need to evaluate the impact and cost-effectiveness of using community health workers to treat adult populations.   We plan to evaluate the impact of school- versus community-based treatment in reducing the transmission of STH species. A range of quantitative and qualitative assessments will evaluate the costs, cost-effectiveness, acceptability and feasibility of the different strategies and delivery systems. The study will be conducted in two contrasting settings in Kenya - south coastal and western regions - where an estimated 20% of the population are infected with STH. In order to maximize public health relevance, the study will be nested within the ongoing national school-based deworming programme, which is currently treating 4.6 million preschool and school children annually. The study drugs will be donated by GlaxoSmithKline and the full costs of delivery through schools and communities will be covered by the Children&apos;s Investment Fund Foundation, with additional input from the Government of Kenya. Cofunding for some of the trial activities are already funded by the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation.   There is tremendous interest in conducting this study. The Government of Kenya, other national governments, funders and international policy makers are seeking clear policy and technical guidance as to the optimal approach to interrupt STH transmission. At the same time, countries are increasingly using community health workers (CHW; community members who provide basic health and medical care to their community, often on a volunteer basis) to deliver a wide range of health interventions, and there is a need to evaluate the benefits of using CHWs to deliver STH treatment. The proposed study, the first of its kind in Africa, will address these policy information gaps. Our proposed study is demand-led at the country level, with partners in Kenya supporting delivery and committed to scaling-up the new strategy, once demonstrated to be beneficial. Not only will the findings inform policy and practice in Kenya and other STH endemic countries, they may also lead to new WHO guidelines on the community control of STH and ultimately have demonstrable benefits for the impoverished communities affected by STH.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="The proposed research will answer the question: is it possible to interrupt the transmission of soil-transmitted helminths (STH) and, if so, what is the most cost-effective treatment strategy and delivery system to achieve this goal?   In recent years, an unprecedented emphasis has been given to the control of neglected tropical diseases (NTDs), including STH. Chronic and intense STH infections can contribute to malnutrition and iron-deficiency anaemia and also can adversely affect physical and mental growth in childhood. Globally, STH result in 4.98 million years lived with disability each year - a burden which can readily be averted by periodic mass chemotherapy targeted to at-risk groups. Efforts to control STH and other NTDs reached a turning point in 2012, when WHO launched its NTD Roadmap and partners met in London and pledged to work together to control and eliminate 10 NTDs by 2020. Building on this momentum, in Paris, April 2014, global partners, spearheaded by the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation and the Children&apos;s Investment Fund Foundation, announced a new global collaboration to scale up STH control efforts and develop new tools and strategies for interrupting the transmission of STH. This commitment was in part driven by new mathematical modelling suggesting that an existing tool - mass anthelmintic treatment - might be sufficient to break transmission if new treatment strategies, including expanding treatment to adults and/or treating children more frequently, are used. The ultimate test of these predictions is to empirically evaluate the impact of different treatment strategies. Our proposed trial would be the first study to evaluate alternative treatment strategies and delivery systems for interrupting transmission of STH and will thus inform global policy and programme implementation at an important moment in the global control of STH and other NTDs. The proposed study has already received initial funding and we request additional funding in order to provide a fuller evaluation of the impact, cost-effectiveness and feasibility of the intervention strategies.    The more detailed objectives are:   1. To quantify the impact of school- versus community-based mass treatment in reducing the transmission of STH species, hookworm, Ascaris lumbricoides and Trichuris trichiura.   2. To evaluate the costs and cost-effectiveness of alternative STH treatment strategies and delivery systems in reducing transmission and improving health outcomes.   3. To examine the effectiveness of alternative strategies and delivery systems for disadvantaged sub-groups, including the poorest, non-enrolled children, and households without access to adequate water and sanitation.   4. To what extent are the treatment strategies acceptable to the community, feasible given the health system capacity, and can be easily scaled-up?  5. To provide a robust evidence base to identify where policy change should be recommended and where maximal improvements in health can be achieved in Kenya and elsewhere.   The questions being addressed are demand led within Kenya and have been developed through extensive consultations with local and national partners. The evidence generated by the study will enable national STH control programmes to decide whether the local elimination of STH is feasible and demonstrate the most cost-effective strategy to achieve this goal. Moreover, the study will provide training and capacity building, with the following objective:   6. To promote inter-sectoral collaboration and build capacity in community-based trials and impact evaluation in Kenya.   This objective will be achieved through a combination of formal and experiential training, including the opportunity to study for a distance learning MSc in Clinical Trials, mentorship of post-doctoral Kenyan scientists, and national training workshops."></capital-spend>
