   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project focuses on a contemporary publishing phenomenon that lies at the intersection between cultural trend and social movement, artistic intervention and community environmental project. Known in Latin America as editoriales cartoneras (or catadoras in Brazil), the phenomenon is often translated as &apos;cardboard publishing&apos;, because one feature that unites the diverse publishing projects is the material from which they make their books: recycled cardboard. Yet the term &apos;cartonera&apos; encompasses far more than the English word &apos;cardboard&apos;. It is also a reference to the cartonero figure - the cardboard collector or waste picker, a product of economic crisis and unemployment - that was so central in the formation of the first cartonera publishing organisation Eloisa Cartonera in Buenos Aires (2003). It was from cartoneros that Eloisa&apos;s founding artists and writers gained inspiration and purchased cardboard, and it was with them that they set up a productive publishing workshop that has since published around 200 titles. Editoriales cartoneras might thus also be translated as &apos;waste-picking publishers&apos;. Some of them, like Eloisa and Dulcineia (S&#xE3;o Paulo), continue to work directly with waste-pickers. Many others, though, have recycled the idea, and adapted it to different local contexts, communities and social needs: some work with groups of school children from deprived areas, others with indigenous communities, to name just two examples. What underpins these divergent, fragmented projects, however, is the shared notion of working productively and creatively from a situation of precariousness - material, social, political, economic and/or environmental.   In this comparative study of cartoneras from Brazil and Mexico, we explore &apos;precarious publishing&apos; in its two closely inter-related guises: an artistic trend and a social movement. In methodological terms, this requires a transnational, interdisciplinary approach that analyses the projects simultaneously as a collection of artistic texts and objects (through literary analysis) and a set of production methods, everyday interactions, organizational logics and social networks oriented toward social transformation (through ethnographic fieldwork).   This project makes a number of contributions to research across different humanities and social science disciplines. From sociological and anthropological perspectives, it explores the ways in which theories of social movements can be productively broadened out to include - or dialogue with - phenomena that, like cartoneras, are not only artistic in character, but also fragmentary, fragile and precarious in nature. From a literary angle, it fills a significant gap in research: though these publishers have attracted attention from scholars and journalists since 2003, their focus has largely been on the unusual ways in which they publish (organizational structures and processes), leaving the literary form and content of the books untouched. Our project explores how the content and form of the books (as literary, philosophical or political texts and as art objects) play a key part in creating new relations, communities and meaning. Finally, our innovative use of interdisciplinary methods makes this a ground-breaking study for scholars approaching similarly complex movements that are emerging worldwide in response to increasingly precarious economic, social and environmental conditions.   Beyond academia, our project is designed to create productive international collaborations between academics, publishers, cultural promoters and library archivists, which will lead to a number of shared outputs: a series of blog posts co-written by publishers, academics and librarians; a participative exhibition in London, in which participants will contribute to a new cartonera book; and a collection of cartonera texts accessible to UK-based readers and researchers at Senate House Library, Cambridge University Library and the British Library.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="Editoriales cartoneras are small, independent publishing projects that make books out of recycled cardboard and sell them at prices much lower than books from larger publishing houses. The context for this movement emerged in Buenos Aires in the wake of the 2001 economic crisis, during which thousands of cartoneros (waste-pickers) took to the streets to collect and sell scrap materials. In 2003, the founding members of Eloisa Cartonera (writers and artists) began buying cardboard from the cartoneros at five times its market value to produce hand-made books. Since then, the movement has spread across and beyond Latin America, taking on various forms and socio-cultural aims: some retain strong links to waste-picker collectives; others work with immigrant groups, indigenous communities or school children; others are principally interested in disseminating their catalogues to a wider audience.   The aim of our research is to develop a number of theoretically-informed approaches for understanding not only this particular socio-cultural movement, but also other related phenomena in and beyond Latin America, with four main objectives:  1. To produce the first sustained transnational analysis comparing cartonera texts and contexts. Since cartoneras have spread far beyond Argentina&apos;s borders, it is crucial to examine them beyond the Eloisa paradigm upon which most critics have focused. This study of cardboard publishing will focus on two case studies from both Brazil and Mexico. We will build on our own existing research by placing the cardboard-bound texts at the centre of our project, taking them seriously as textual/artistic objects and filling a major gap in existing criticism that has largely neglected the content of the books.  2. To develop innovative, interdisciplinary methods. The subject of this study is not just a collection of texts; it is also an enquiry into production methods, everyday interactions, organizational logics and social networks. Thus, it requires a combination of methods from literary studies and anthropology. We will combine close analysis of texts and paratexts (including online materials like Facebook pages and blogs) with ethnographic fieldwork (including immersive participant observation and semi-structured interviews) to analyse the complex relationship between the cardboard books and the meanings, relations and transformations they generate. This will form the basis for all of our outputs, including a co-authored book on precarious publishing, and this combined methodology will be disseminated as an analytical model for other researchers in the form of a paper in a top-quartile interdisciplinary journal (e.g. Criticism or Textual Practice).   3. To engage with, build upon, and test the limits of existing theories of social movements. Given the activism inherent in the cartonera project, this research asks how it might be read as a social movement, and how this reading informs and transforms understandings of activism and mobilisation. We will develop an interdisciplinary theoretical framework better to understand cartoneras by bringing together theories (deriving from anthropology, sociology, political theory, cultural studies, art criticism, etc.) of new social movements (Maeckelberg, Raszsa, Flynn), &apos;prefigurative politics&apos; (Graeber), post-autonomous art (Ludmer, Garcia Canclini) and relational aesthetics (Bourriaud) (references in Case for Support).   4. To engage in knowledge exchange between academic and non-academic participants. We will work directly with cartonera publishers on the one hand, and library archivists on the other, not only drawing from their experience, but also feeding our research into their projects and collections. Three of our outputs - a cartonera book, an exhibition and two library collections - will constitute a tangible contribution to the cardboard publishing movement by disseminating cartonera authors, ideas and objects beyond regional/national borders."></capital-spend>
