   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Chicken or  Egg: Drivers for Antimicrobial Resistance in Poultry in India (DARPI)</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The aim of this study is to first to map antimicrobial use (AMU) and the antimicrobial resistance (AMR) that is driven by inappropriate use, across the entire poultry meat supply chain from farm to table in India. The study provides [1] a unique opportunity to map AMU, [2] to understand entry points for development of AMR and [3] the contribution by inappropriate AMU in poultry, and [4] suggests potential solutions to address the huge AMR burden in India. AMR is a major global health risk, particularly in developing countries, threatening human and animal health. Contributing to this problem is the inappropriate use of antimicrobials in people and livestock production. India has a high burden of infectious disease, and bacteria from human clinical infections are becoming increasingly difficult to treat, with fewer treatment options available. Studies suggest that livestock may commonly carry resistant bacteria in their gut, with poultry and poultry meat also identified as a source of such bacteria. However, there is a complete lack of data on the scale of the problem, or on what antimicrobials are being used in poultry meat production, how they are used, and how this contributes to the carriage of AMR bacteria that may be a threat to human and animal health. Poultry meat is one of the main protein sources in Indian and is the fastest growing livestock sector. Increasingly, poultry meat in India is produced through more intensive integrated or semi-integrated farming systems where antimicrobials are used for various purposes, including for growth promotion, to prevent and treat disease. To date there have been no comprehensive studies on AMU or AMR through the poultry meat supply chain. Our interdisciplinary project aims to address these data gaps by studying the poultry meat food supply in its entirety to determine: behaviours that drive AMU and how these contribute to the selection and transmission of AMR, to inform better use; to design with farmers and other stakeholders interventions to reduce AMU/AMR, which are cost-effective and easy to implement; determine the economic impact from changing AMU practices, or using alternatives. The project will involve working closely with the poultry industry, policy makers and other stakeholders throughout to ensure the findings have impact. This project is timely in providing crucial data to inform antimicrobial stewardship: the trajectory of the Indian poultry industry is shifting towards intensive farming and AMU is predicted to rise substantially. Therefore, this is an opportunity to intervene through working closely with stakeholders to provide alternative strategies for sustainable AMU. The project also offers other benefits, with a strong social science component providing unique insights into behaviours driving AMU, as well as service design enabling visualization of AMU and AMR, and co-design strategies. Indian researchers will be trained in these methods, building capacity for social science in Indian agricultural and veterinary research that will have value long after the conclusion of this project.  The study will be the first to map AMU and AMR in the entire poultry meat supply chain from farm to table in India. The study provides a unique opportunity to map AMU, understand entry points for development of AMR and the contribution by inappropriate AMU in poultry, and suggest potential solutions to address the huge AMR burden in India.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The main objectives of DARPI are: 1. Determine the drivers for antimicrobial use (AMU), by undertaking participatory rural appraisal and rapid ethnographic assessment at key stages along the broiler meat food system. 2. Map, define the socio-economic context and identify hotspots within the poultry meat food system, by quantifying AMU and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) at key points of the system.  3. Determine rational use protocols and alternatives to AMs, through in vivo and in vitro studies that minimize AMR selection, and analyse risks for dissemination of AMR. 4. Co-design and assess AMU/AMR interventions with people who work and use the broiler meat food system. Objectives 1 and 2 are important for understanding the complexity of the drivers of AMU and AMR in the broiler meat system in its entirety and provide data that inform studies in Objective 3, and allow pressure points for AMU and AMR to be identified and visualised, which will aid the co-design of interventions with stakeholders for Objective 4. The supply chain from breeder to retail will be followed with integrated collection of qualitative and quantitative data, providing valuable opportunities for training in social design and ethnographic methodology. We will determine practices, use and the drivers for use of AM, and quantify the abundance and diversity of AMR along this chain, supported by in vivo and in vitro studies, including investigating alternatives to antimicrobials and alternative AMU strategies, with all of this subject to economic analysis. These will inform rational use and the development of participatory design tools to co-design and ensure that interventions are feasible, acceptable and cost-effective; with consideration of the future trajectory of the Indian poultry industry, so that approaches are scalable, sustainable and able to react to accommodate anticipated trajectory development within the Indian context. Objective 1 will be led by the by Royal Holloway University with the University of Arts and the Centre for Disease Dynamics Economics &amp; Policy (CDDEP), but with involvement of other Indian institutes. Objective 2 will involve all institutes in contributing to data (qualitative, quantitative, economic) and sample collection, and analysis; specific work packages have been designed to contribute to these objectives, with the National Institute of Animal Biotechnology (NIAB) leading along with the University of Liverpool, Karnataka Veterinary Animal and Fisheries Sciences University (KVAFSU), and the Poultry Disease Diagnosis and Surveillance Laboratory (PDDSL) of the Tamil Nadu Veterinary and Animal Sciences University, contributing to metadata and sample collection and determining the presence and context of AMR in the broiler meat chain. The economic context will be led by the University of Edinburgh, Liverpool and CDDEP and they will also contribute to objectives 3 and 4. Objective 3 will be led by Indian Council for Agricultural Research - Directorate of Poultry Research and Liverpool, with contributions from NIAB, KVAFSU and PDDSL, with the risk of dissemination addressed by Royal Veterinary College London, who will also contribute to data analysis across objectives 1-3. Finally, the co-design aspects of objective 4 will be led by the University of Arts and CDDEP.</narrative>
