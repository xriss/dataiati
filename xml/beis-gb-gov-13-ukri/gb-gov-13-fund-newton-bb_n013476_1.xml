   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Understanding and Exploiting Biological Nitrogen Fixation for Improvement of Brazilian Agriculture</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">After water, available nitrogen is the most limiting nutrient for plant growth. Although the demand for fixed nitrogen can be met by the use of chemical fertilisers, their use in agriculture has resulted in major environmental and economic impacts. At present less than half of the nitrogen used by farmers is assimilated by crops. Excess nitrogen leaks into the environment, leading to significant effects on soil and water quality, biodiversity, and atmospheric pollution. However, some bacteria can perform a process known as biological nitrogen fixation, which converts nitrogen gas from the atmosphere into ammonia, a source of nitrogen that can be assimilated by animals and plants.  This provides a more sustainable alternative to the use of synthetic fertilisers.  Although soil-dwelling nitrogen fixing bacteria can associate with food and energy crops, they do not readily release their fixed nitrogen for the benefit of the plant, although they can have beneficial effects on plant growth. In Brazil, significant increases in crop yield have been observed in response to inoculation with nitrogen fixing bacteria, some of which have an endophytic lifestyle and can gain access to intercellular spaces in plant roots and shoots.  This provides an opportunity to engineer closer associations between nitrogen-fixing bacteria and food and energy crops, in which fixed nitrogen is delivered more effectively to the plant. This proposal for a Virtual Joint Centre (VJC) brings together a team of Brazilian and UK investigators focused towards understanding and exploiting plant-diazotroph interactions as a means to enhance agricultural productivity in Brazil. Using fundamental knowledge of  nitrogen regulation in endophytic nitrogen fixing bacteria, we will engineer strains, which excrete ammonium to benefit crop growth, and examine the potential of these modified strains as inoculants. We will also design selection strategies to isolate associative diazotrophs that are competitive in the rhizosphere in relation to plant varieties that respond well and have a growth advantage in the presence of  these endophytes. We will identify genes required for efficient plant-microbe interactions and quantitate the level of biological, nitrogen fixation in relation to crop yield. Finally, we will we examine the potential for the use of native and engineered strains as inoculants. To achieve these objectives, we will exploit strong synergies and world-leading expertise of UK and Brazilian researchers in biological nitrogen fixation, microbial population dynamics, bacterial and plant genetics, genomics and synthetic biology, in order to engineer efficient cultivar-endophyte combinations and develop improved inoculant technologies. Enhancing nitrogen fixation in our target crops promises substantial benefits for Brazilian agriculture, while decreasing the use and environmental impact of industrial nitrogen fertilisers.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The major aim of this Virtual Joint Centre (VJC) is to develop innovative technologies to increase crop productivity in Brazil, utilising nitrogen-fixing bacteria as a sustainable source of fixed nitrogen, in order to reduce the input of chemical fertilisers in agriculture and mitigate the environmental and economic impacts of reactive nitrogen pollution. We will target major crops essential for human and animal consumption in Brazil. To support the sustainability of bioenergy and livestock production in Brazil, the Centre will also investigate the contribution that biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) makes to the N requirements of C4 perennial grasses such as Pennisetum and Miscanthus.   The core research objectives of the VJC are: 1. Engineer ammonium excretion in diazotrophic epiphytes and endophytes 2. Isolate efficient growth-promoting, diazotrophic plant associative bacteria 3. Characterise plant-microbe interactions and identify genetic components required             for efficient crop-microbe associations  4. Evaluate the effectiveness of inoculants in field trials  This core research programme will be augmented by a wider network of Brazilian scientists comprising the National Institute of Science and Technology (INCT) for BNF, funded by the Brazilian national research council, CNPq. This will provide additional expertise in related areas including soil microbiology, agronomy and inoculant technologies. The VJC will also engage in a range of partnering activities including annual scientific meetings, workshops for young career scientists and extensive laboratory exchanges between the partner countries.</narrative>
