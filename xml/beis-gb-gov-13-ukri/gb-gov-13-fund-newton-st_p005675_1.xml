  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Thailand is planning a major investment in radio astronomy, with the development of a new 40m diameter radio telescope over the next 5 years (the Thai National Radio Observatory). This facility is a strategic priority for Thai research as radio astronomy incorporates many key skills of value to a developing knowledge economy (engineering, electronics, information technology, computational and communications technology). However the project comes with significant human capacity and skills development challenges in that currently Thailand has few radio astronomers or engineers who can design, construct and operate the telescope. Our project is designed to address these challenges using the UK&apos;s long heritage and highly developed skills in radio astronomy. The UK has a leadership role in the world&apos;s next generation radio telescope, the Square Kilometre Array, and so places a high strategic priority on the global development of radio astronomy and the training of future generations of radio astronomers who will exploit this long-term project. We will partner with the Thai astronomical and technical community to transfer specific technical knowledge of radio astronomy instrumentation and to also bolster the Thai astronomical skill base. We will carry out a joint programme programme of training, targeted outreach to undergraduates, and bilateral exchanges to strengthen the Thai radio astronomy community and develop skilled human capital via training in radio astronomy, required computer skills and instrumentation. Our programme will not only help to develop the skills that Thailand needs for the Thai National Radio Observatory but will also have impact on the wider economy through the development of skilled graduates and postgraduates in electronics, information &amp; communications technology and advanced data processing.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The overall aim of our proposed project is to develop the human capital required to build, operate and fully exploit the science opportunities afforded by the Thai National Radio Observatory. Thailand is planning a major investment in radio astronomy, with the development of a new 40m radio telescope over the next 5 years and its integration into global VLBI networks such as the EVN, EAVN and LBA interferometers. This facility is a strategic priority for Thai research. A critical hurdle which must be overcome is to build the human capacity within Thailand to contruct, operate, develop and exploit the Thai Radio Telescope. While the educational infrastructure is in place to deliver skilled Physics graduates and postgraduates to MSc and PhD level there is limited uptake of graduates into astronomy and even more limited uptake in radio astronomy.  In this initial 12 month project we target current Thai Physics and Engineering undergraduates to widen their awareness of career opportunities afforded by radio astronomy and directly train them in radio astronomy and computational techniques. We will also develop specific technical, research and outreach skills in a programme of bilateral exchanges between UK and Thai staff. We aim to complete three work packages over the course of the grant. Each work package has roughly equal priority. Work Package 1: A seminar series in Radio Astronomy aimed at Thai undergraduates. The principal goal of this work package is to run a series of seminars in Thai universities which will excite interest in radio astronomy amongst final year undergraduate Thai Physics and Engineering students. Our key objective is to increase the uptake of Thai Physics and Engineering students in postgraduate degrees relevant to the Thai National Radio Observatory. Work Package 2: Radio Astronomy Summer School for undergraduates. We will run a bespoke training course for Thai undergraduates to provide core skills training in astrophysics, radio astronomy, data reduction and analysis. This course is modelled on the successful training programme designed for the Development in Africa with Radio Astronomy project, although adapted to fit within the Thai undergraduate summer break. The goal of the summer school is to encourage the uptake of postgraduate study in radio astronomy or radio engineering.  Work Package 3: Exchange of scientific, technical and outreach staff. We will run a continual exchange programme of scientific, technical and outreach staff between the UK and Thailand throughout our project. We will focus on three key areas where UK and Thai strategic goals overlap: scientific exchanges to boost the existing Thai science base and foster UK-Thai collaboration, long-term technical visits by Thai radio engineers to gain specific expertise in radio astronomy instrumentation, and exchanges between Thai and UK astronomy outreach staff to scope future collaboration and identify outreach synergies.</narrative>
