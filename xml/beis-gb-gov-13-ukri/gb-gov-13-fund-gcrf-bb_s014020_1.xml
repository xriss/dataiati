   <narrative xml:lang="EN">B12 deficiency and insufficiency is thought to represent a hidden worldwide epidemic of nutrient malnutrition in both developed and developing countries. However, there is no doubt that in India the problem is on a vast scale, with estimates of around 1 billion people having low levels of the nutrient. This is a consequence not only of general malnutrition but also due to cultural practices associated with vegetarianism, since crops have very low levels of B12. In this application we aim to initiate a programme of work to address this nutrient-deficiency challenge, by combining expertise in the UK with that found in India. Specifically, we want to investigate if a newly constructed recombinant strain of E. coli can be used to provide large quantities of purified B12. To achieve this we will combine the metabolic engineering work at the University of Kent with the process engineering capability found at the ICT in Mumbai. The development of a suitable extraction procedure will allow us to interact with chemical companies such as Cipla, who have expressed an interest in taking this forward if a suitable high-yielding method is developed. This holds the potential for India to be able to produce all its own B12 rather than having to rely on expensive imports. In so doing, this will also address serious concerns about global nutrient supply, since currently around 90% of B12 is produced in China. We also plan to explore the use of alternative culturally acceptable enriched sources of B12 in the form of algae and higher plants. Many algae are known to be able to absorb the nutrient but only limited studies have been undertaken in order to assess whether the B12 found in algae is bioavailable to humans. Similarly, we have recently found that some higher plants, such as spring cress, are also able to absorb B12 when the plants are grown with the nutrient. However, as with algae, it is not known whether the nutrient is bioavailable. Therefore, apart from investigating ways to enhance B12 uptake into algae and higher plants, we will undertake volunteer trials to determine whether food prepared from these sources is able to alleviate B12 deficiency in the volunteers. This work will combine expertise in the UK in providing the growth conditions, the food technologists in Mumbai and the clinical expertise in Pune to address this problem. This represents an exciting series of experiments that holds the potential to provide transformative solutions to B12 deficiency in both developing developed countries.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The application concerns improving the (bio)availability of vitamin B12 in India, a country that has very high levels of B12 deficiency and insufficiency. Low levels of B12 are associated not only with anaemia, but also with neural tube defects in babies, cognition in the young and the elderly as well as being linked to the development of cardiovascular disorders and diabetes. In India, the lack of B12 is also exacerbated by the high levels of vegetarianism in the country, since crops are naturally deficient in the nutrient. This application concerns developing new ways of making B12 more available. This will be achieved through a collaborative between three UK centres at Kent, Cambridge and Durham, linking in with scientists at the Institute for Chemical Technology in Mumbai and clinicians at the KEM hospital in Pune. There are two major aims associated with this project: Firstly, we will look to develop enhanced methods for B12 extraction from a recombinant E. coli strain that overproduces the nutrient. Once this have been developed we will then work with industrial partners to initiate industrial scale production of the nutrient. The second aim is to explore the use of alternative sources of vitamin B12. Specifically, we will investigate the uptake of B12 by algae and determine whether the B12 within this enriched algal source is bioavailable. Similarly, we have recently shown that higher plants can also absorb the nutrient. We therefore want to investigate whether the the B12 within such plants is also bioavailable. Providing alternative sources of B12 through culturally accepted foodstuff would represent a significant breakthrough in helping to overcome B12 deficiency within the country. The major objectives of the grant are outlined below: 1. Develop a high-yielding B12 extraction and purification method to allow for the isolation of the nutrient from a recently-developed recombinant strain of E. coli. 2. Investigate the ability of both micro- and macro-algae to take up B12 and determine whether the B12 absorbed in these systems is bioavailable to human subjects. 3. Investigate the ability of higher plants to absorb B12 and determine whether the nutrient is bioavailable to human subjects 4. Initiate trials with volunteers from B12-deficient regions to determine whether their B12 deficiency can be overcome by providing them with food products that have been fortified with either B12-enriched algal or plant material. 5. To enhance the public understanding of science about B12 deficiency and to liaise with NGOs such as the Pernicious Anaemia Society and GAIN to help develop policy for overcoming B12-deficiency.</narrative>
