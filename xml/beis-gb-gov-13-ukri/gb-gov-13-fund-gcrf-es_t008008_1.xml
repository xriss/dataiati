   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The success and failure of initiatives tackling the infrastructural gap in most countries in Latin America and the Caribbean are closely related to trends across a region where poverty affects one in every three households and informality is the norm for 57 per cent of the working population (UN-Habitat 2016, 55). Informality itself constitutes a challenge as seen in the reluctance of authorities to invest in areas which, by virtue of not being recognised as legal, fall into a void which neither attracts public investment nor does it encourage entrepreneurs or cooperatives to seek localised relevant solutions. The contrast between Colombia and Cuba provides a unique opportunity to understand the additional challenges that areas in transition - to peace, in the former, and to a new constitution, in the latter - pose to informality and will contribute to developing the kinds of approaches through which these challenges can be addressed more effectively.  Building on well-developed partnerships and the learning of several RCUK-funded projects, GREAT will generate real change in two informal off-grid settlements in Cali (Colombia) and Havana (Cuba). Focusing on transport and waste-management community-led projects, the project will contribute to &apos;gridding&apos; equitable urban futures through a series of three thematic PublicLabs on urban policy, mobility, and waste innovation. These will combine several in-site activities, participatory workshops, seed-funded projects, capacity training, and work with local policy and planning authorities as well as charitable organisations. Joining the expertise of environmental scientists, transport and geomatics engineers, designers, urban planners, entrepreneurs and sociologists, the project will address key SDGs (5, 6, 9, 10, 11 and 16), by embedding the voice of residents of these settlements into ongoing initiatives such as the Territories of Inclusion and Opportunities, an initiative of the Cali Mayor&apos;s Office, and the vision of transport in Havana in 2035, approved in 2003, and led by the Direcci&#xF3;n General de Transporte Provincial La Habana (General Directorate of Transport Havana). Both institutions are project partners. In doing so, we seek to answer two main questions: In what ways does being on- and off-grid provide an opportunity to rethink the relationship between people and urban infrastructure in areas of transition? To what extent do current off-grid policies and initiatives in Cali and Havana contribute to the disenfranchisement or empowerment of residents in informal settlements? If funded, the project will transform our understanding of the relationship between urban infrastructure and the dynamics of growth and change of informal settlements in areas of transition and provide unique learning points to help address important barriers residents of informal settlements face to improve their livelihoods, in Colombia and Cuba, and across Latin America and the Caribbean.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="Our vision is to &apos;grid&apos; equitable urban futures in Cali and Havana. To achieve this we will:  (1) Broaden the range of disciplines involved in the thinking of solutions meant to meet the infrastructural needs of off-grid communities  (2) Develop a series of PublicLabs to structure a programme of work led by the project local academic partners, involving relevant organisations and local authorities, and community members from two specific informal settlements in Cali and Havana, in order to generate novel locally-embedded solutions to help improve the livelihoods of settlement residents.  (3) Seed-fund innovative transport- and solid-waste management solutions led by the communities themselves, with a view for successful pilots to become models of self-sustaining income-generating activities.   (4) Deliver impact on local policies through the provision of robust and meaningful evidence as gathered by the local teams in consultation with a variety of stakeholders, significantly the settlement communities themselves. This will be achieved through sustained regular work in the study areas throughout the duration of the project.  Our programme of work responds directly to a number of sustainable development goals (SDGs), in particular, empowering young women entrepreneurs (SDG5), innovating zero-waste management systems (SDG6 and SDG9), and helping integrate transition-to-peace policies with current city-wide plans, specially in the case of Cali (SDG16). We have chosen our partners to embed and enhance the impact of project findings into ongoing initiatives relevant to the future of infrastructure in the two cities.   GREAT&apos;s infrastructure &apos;foci&apos; are transport and solid waste. The proposal has emerged from a well-developed and equitable partnership between the UK teams (at Lancaster and UCL) and the teams in the Universidad del Valle in Cali and the Technological University of Havana. Integrating techniques and approaches from design, engineering, sociology, entrepreneurship and urban planning, we seek to generate the kind of solutions which are locally embedded (owned by the community) and context-sensitive. Overall aims of our collaborative research are:  To understand what it means to be on- and off-grid in Cali and Havana, related to transport and waste management, in particular, and identify the kind of socio-technical innovations required to meet extant needs effectively.  To serve as a focal point where capacity to coordinate current public and private initiatives in the two cities can be built; and to co-develop sustainable long-term human and other infrastructures that can support actors in coordinating their actions to better effect and in dialogue with the communities whose livelihoods these actions seek to improve.  To co-develop and co-design pilot locally-grounded test projects to scale up existing initiatives and create a critical mass of solutions which can inform policy at city level (see also Pathways to Impact).  To develop a long-term strategy to embed successful initiatives into sustainable models in cooperation with local authorities, non-governmental organisations, cooperatives and local eco-businesses."></capital-spend>
