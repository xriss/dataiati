   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The SUPPORT programme involves lead and partner institutions of nine projects funded
through the Zoonoses and Emerging Livestock Systems initiative (ZELS) to create a
concentrated focus for interdisciplinary doctoral training and equip students with the skills
and insight to tackle complex zoonotic disease problems in Africa and Asia. The programme
is unique in the teaming of students and supervisors from Africa, Asia and the UK, an
emphasis on interdisciplinary training and supervision, and development of skills for
translation of research into policy and practice.
SUPPORT includes UK institutions where students will be registered and which have
responsibility for formal quality assurance of training (Royal Veterinary College, University of
Glasgow, University of Cambridge), two other ZELS lead institutions (The Pirbright Institute,
Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine) and 16 other UK and international partner institutions
supporting ZELS research and associated doctoral research and training, including three
institutions that will act as regional training hubs in east and west Africa and Asia.
The SUPPORT programme will include 15 students, 7 from Africa/Asia and 8 from the UK,
who will progress through a joint 3.5 year training programme that will involve a compulsory
induction course (2 weeks), a foundation training course in research skills (3 months), regular
attendance at SUPPORT summer schools and mini-symposia, a professional internship (up
to 3 months), and a ~ 3-year research project that will be embedded within or link across
ZELS-funded projects and based largely in Africa or Asia.
The programme will provide regular opportunities for students to come together as a cohort
in summer schools, training courses (hosted at regional training hubs in Africa and Asia) and
mini-symposia to gain an enriching experience of a diversity of disease problems, disciplinary
approaches, research environments and cultures. By strengthening personal and
professional relationships across the student cohort and ZELS partner institutions,
SUPPORT has great potential to secure a sustainable platform for zoonoses research into
the future.
SUPPORT will draw on best practices including: (a) a cohesive programme that enhances
the student cohort effect; (b) formal supervisory agreements; (c) personal development plans
for students; (d) robust progress monitoring and review frameworks at both UK and
developing country institutions; (e) training of supervisors; (f) &#x2018;learning through doing&#x2019; as an
important way of developing professionalism and networks and (g) professional internships.
The 3-year PhD research projects will be designed to strengthen the coherence of the
student cohort as well as the ZELS research programme through pairing/teaming of students
from the UK and developing countries and/or from different disciplines. These partnerships
will encourage sharing of insights, perspectives and interdisciplinary skills, act as bridging
points across projects, and forge supervisory partnerships and expertise that will strengthen
research capacity among partner institutions.
All partner institutions are able to draw on the considerable strength and depth among the
pool of PhD supervisors with interdisciplinary expertise and international experience that is
highly relevant to the ZELS remit. Supervisory teams will include researchers from different
disciplinary backgrounds and from both UK and developing country institutions.
The programme will be administered through the University of Glasgow, and the training
programme led by the Royal Veterinary College, with decisions made by a management
team comprising ZELS lead investigators, investigators from African and Asian training hubs,
the ZELS knowledge broker and two external advisors. Decisions of the management team
will be enacted by a core executive group and involve co-investigators assigned specific
organisational roles and responsibilities. The management team will meet in person at lea</narrative>
