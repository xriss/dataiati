  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The success of the first phase of APEX program has demonstrated the potential that the two countries have strong desire in sustaining the established scientific and technological collaborations based on their strengths and complementarities. Towards the later part of the program, some good mutual collaborations got established amongst several groups between two counties and it was felt at that stage to keep the momentum continuing to exploit the benefits of the ties and links which were going so well.  Being a joint collaborative program, it actually leads to mutual benefits across both countries and the UK consortium has obviously gained during its first phase. However, with much more vigorous participation from Indian consortium now, the benefits can exceed those envisioned in Phase-I. Some of the UK specific aims and objectives are listed as below: 1. Progression and exploitation of Perovskite Solar Cell research. 2. Development of new organic polymer materials and new device concepts 3. Performance testing of developed modules under Indian and the UK conditions 4. Business and collaboration opportunities with Indian and UK companies 5. Promotion of bilateral exchanges through early career researchers APEX</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">UK and India are both rising stars in the promotion of Solar Energy viz. direct generation of electricity from the Sun called photovoltaics (PV). In the UK, PV is seen as a key technology to reduce the carbon footprint of electricity generation. It is also a necessity if future building standards are to be met, which will require on-site generation. PV is the only way to meet this to date. DECC has announced recently &apos;The Solar Strategy&apos; which promotes the deployment of solar technologies on the existing buildings. In India PV has the added benefit that it is a highly scalable technology that can be deployed to support the grid infrastructure and indeed can be built possibly faster than conventional power plants through terrestrial solar farms and BIPV sectors. The current APEX program stems from the strategic move by the governments of the UK and India who jointly identified Solar Energy as an area of significance in providing solutions to the problem of meeting future energy needs. This partnership was aimed at linking the strengths of both countries to enhance the research capabilities of both nations. APEX had been focusing on the development of new functional materials, device structures, materials processing and engineering of photovoltaic modules utilising excitonic solar cells (ESCs). These are a class of nano-structured solar cells based on organic nano-composites and dye-sensitised nanocrystalline TiO2 materials. The current state-of-the-art power conversion efficiency (PCE) figures ~11.4% and ~9.2% has been achieved in liquid junction dye sensitized solar cell (DSSC) and organic solar cells (OSC), respectively. In the pursuit of achieving high efficiency solid state DSSC, a new breakthrough has been established recently through our Oxford group (Prof. Henry Snaith) who achieved &gt;17% efficient solid state devices using pervoskite solar cells. Thus, the APEX team enjoys the exceptional, world-class capability in Excitonic PV technology. The success of the program had been through its novelty, innovation and cutting edge R&amp;D capability it possesses.</narrative>
