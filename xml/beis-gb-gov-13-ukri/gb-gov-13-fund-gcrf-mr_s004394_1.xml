   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Adjunct antibody therapy for severe antibiotic-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii infections</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Antibiotic resistant bacterial pathogens are a particular issue in LMICs, causing for example 3 to 5 times more deaths per capita in Thailand than in the US. The AMR pathogen Acinetobacter baumannii infections is a common cause of severe community acquired pneumonia and nosocomial infections in SE Asia, with a mortality close to 50%. Our data show that at Nakhon Phanom Hospital, Thailand, A. baumannii is the second commonest pathogen identified in respiratory samples, and 60 to 67% of isolates were resistant to meropenem, tazocin, aminoglycosides and ceftazadine. We will develop an adjunct antibody therapy to reduce the substantial disease burden caused by antibiotic resistant A. baumannii in Asian LMICs. We will use a combination of bioinformatics, RNAseq, and antigenome technology to identify protein antigens recognised by antibodies that support killing of multiple A. baumannii strains or inhibit bacterial mechanisms required for full antibiotic resistance. The end result will be a multivalent antibody adjunct therapy preparation that improves bacterial clearance and antibiotic efficacy for AMR A. baumannii infections. The specific objects of the proposal are to test the hypothesis that &apos;Antibody therapy to conserved protein antigens will improve control of antibiotic resistant A. baumannii in murine and human infection models.&apos; In order to do so we have the following specific objectives: (a) Define the core genome and therefore protein antigens that are largely conserved between LMIC A. baumannii strains (b) Identify which of the conserved protein antigens are good candidates for an antibody therapy - that is, can induce an antibody response and/or are either highly expressed during infection or important for bacterial resistance to antibiotics (c) Define the protective efficacy and dosing requirements of a multivalent antibody therapy both in mouse models and a human blood model of infection (d) Obtain clinical data on proven A. baumannii infections in an LMIC setting to identify the most appropriate patients and timing for adjunct antibody therapy in future clinical trials (e) Increase UK and Thai research capacity researching AMR A. baumannii infections  In order to complete these objectives the proposal has the following research aims: 1. Use our genome data from 232 Thai A. baumannii strains to construct an microarray of conserved A. baumannii proteins. 2. Identify protein antigens that induce a protective antibody response by probing antigenome arrays with (i) human sera from Thai subjects recovering from A. baumannii infection and (ii) sera from mice after self-limiting A. baumannii infection that induces a protective adaptive immune response.  3. Identify A. baumannii proteins expressed during infection in mice, in human blood, and in response to antibiotics using RNAseq. Mutant analysis will confirm that genes highly expressed in response to antibiotics are required for antibiotic resistance. 4. Use the data obtained in aims 1 to 3 to identify A. baumannii protein antigens for further investigation by expression of recombinant protein to obtain antibody for investigating protective efficacy using in vitro immune assays and mouse models of AMR A. baumannii infection (with or without antibiotic treatment). These data will be used to design a protective multivalent antibody therapy. 5. Prospectively collect data and sera on Thai patients with A. baumannii infection to define the clinical role for a potential antibody therapy, assess whether convalescent sera is a potential source of antibodies for therapeutic use, and for purification of IgG species targeting antigens identified in aim 4 to confirm their potential clinical efficacy as targets for antibody therapy in an A. baumannii human blood infection model.  The proposal will define the potential of antibody therapy for A. baumannii infections in LMICs, and indicate whether this approach could also be effective against other major AMR pathogens.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Unlike in the UK and other Western countries, the bacteria Acinetobacter baumannii is a common cause of pneumonia and other infections in Asian countries.  Unfortunately A. baumannii both often causes severe infections and is frequently highly resistant to antibiotics, including penems and extended spectrum penicillins, and A. baumannii infections therefore have a high mortality and require considerable hospital resources.  We will investigate whether antibodies that bind to the surface of A. baumannii bacteria could be used as way of providing additional treatment to patients with an A. baumannii infection along with antibiotics. We will look for several protein targets for an antibody therapy that can increase killing of A. baumannii by human white cells or which by inhibiting mechanisms of antibiotic resistance makes a previously ineffective antibiotic able to kill A. baumannii.  To do so we will: Aims 1 and 2. Use information that we have recently obtained on the gene content of 300 Thai A. baumannii strains to identify proteins present in most strains, and use these to construct what is called an antigenome array. Antigenome arrays allow all the proteins that cause an antibody response to be identified, and we will use the A. baumannii conserved protein antigenome array to identify which proteins can cause an antibody response after human or mouse A. baumannii infections. Aims 3. Identify which A. baumannii proteins are abundant on the bacteria during infection or in response to antibiotics using a technology called RNAseq to see which genes are highly expressed during infection or when the bacteria has been stressed by antibiotics; these genes should b particularly good candidates for an antibody therapy. Aim 4. Use the data obtained in aims 1 to 3 to identify which A. baumannii proteins should be investigated further as potential targets for an antibody therapy.  We will make each protein antigen and obtain rabbit antibodies to the protein to test the ability of the antibody to recognise and kill different A. baumannii strains using laboratory assays of immune function and mouse models of infection. From these data we select a few protein antigens for use in a protective multivalent antibody therapy that targets several important proteins rather than just individual protein antigens as targeting several proteins should make the treatment more effective as a therapy. Aim 5.  To identify which patients with A. baumannii infection and when during infection those patients could benefit from an antibody therapy we will collect data on 100 Thai patients with proven A. baumannii infection. In addition we will purify antibodies developing in these patients as a result of the A. baumannii infection for use in our blood infection model to confirm that antibody therapy can inhibit A. baumannni growth in the blood or resistance to antibiotics.   Overall the project will identify which A. baumannii proteins would make good targets for an antibody therapy and confirm the potential of this approach for treating antibiotic resistant A. baumannii infections in Thailand and other Asian countries.  By allowing experienced research scientists who work on bacterial infections to start investigating A. baumanii as well, the project will also increase the number of researchers investigating how to combat antibiotic resistant bacteria both in the UK and in Thailand.</narrative>
