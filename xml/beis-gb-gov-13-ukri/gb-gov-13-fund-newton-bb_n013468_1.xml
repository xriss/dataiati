  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The UK has some of the most efficient farming systems in the world but is experiencing stagnating yields and continued problems with reactive nitrogen (Nr) polluting air and water. China desperately needs increasing food production but this must be achieved in accordance with the Government&apos;s new &quot;zero increase&quot; policy referring to chemical inputs, especially fertiliser N. We propose to meet the needs of China and the UK through a Virtual Joint Centre for Agronomic Nitrogen Use Efficiency that, as the call document demands, &apos;optimises farm practices and soil management to make more effective use of fertilisers and reduce losses of reactive nitrogen to the environment, thus mitigating against environmental impacts associated with this loss. The proposed Centre would contribute to the newly-created, Newton-funded &apos;Centre for the Sustainable Intensification of Agriculture (CSIA)&apos; led by Rothamsted and the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences (CAAS), and would be linked to proposed Centres in Brazil and India and with other collaborative research countries across the world.   Our objectives are to: 1. Develop novel indicators of N use efficiency and to combine these with other new real-time physical and chemical metrics to obtain holistic metrics of soil health and quality which informs farm practices and soil management to deliver improved agronomic NUE and sustainable crop production 2. Use these indicators and other emerging knowledge to test and develop on field experiments and farm platforms, farm systems that permit the sustainable intensification of (especially Chinese) agriculture, i.e. increased productivity with zero increase in chemical inputs by 2020. This is likely to include appropriate &apos;precision farming&apos; techniques. 3. Translate these developments to Chinese farmers using the proven &apos;Science and Technology Backyard&apos; programme developed by CAU and CAAS that is moving farmers out of poverty and enriching whole communities.  We will achieve this through the following four Work Packages:  WP1. Improved fundamental understanding of N cycling WP2. Harnessing novel N technologies WP3. Improved agronomic practices WP4. Predictive capacity and knowledge exchange  The Virtual Joint Centre will:  I. Conduct joint research projects described in section A below. II. Support short- and longer-term exchange visits of PhD students, post-doctoral researchers and visiting fellows. III. Extend existing and develop new adjunct faculty positions at the partner centres. IV. Share key resources, working on complementary Farm Platforms, sharing experimental methodologies, results and databases, modelling approaches and publishing joint papers. V. Continue and extend the practice in recent China Partnering Awards of holding symposia, workshops, seminars and  meetings that are facilitated by the partners but including other, sometimes collaborating organisations in the UK, China and elsewhere as described in the &apos;Management&apos; section below. VI. Generate a legacy beyond the immediate Newton Funding, based on collaborative proposals, joint supervision of PhD studentships, e.g. via the China Scholarship Council.  It will directly address the poverty and development of Chinese farmers and their villages, adding to and extending the benefits already realised through the STB programme. It will do this through the proven expertise and internationally excellent productive collaborations of the partners by improving NUE thus saving money by reducing fertiliser use and increasing yield and reduce environmental pollution. In the latter this is also likely to reduce urban air pollution because rural ammonia emission makes a significant contribution to this (Liu et al., 2013).</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">UK-China Virtual Joint Centre for Improved Nitrogen Agronomy (CINAG)  Despite making great progress, China still needs to increase agricultural production to feed its growing population with its increasing expectations while overcoming the considerable environmental problems that industrial and agricultural development has brought with it such as air and water pollution and soil acidification. Currently the three main cereal crops (wheat, maize and rice) use only 33% of the nitrogen fertiliser applied, and less than 40% of the nutrients in recyclable organic &apos;wastes&apos; such as livestock manure are returned to agriculture. China Agricultural University (CAU), the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences (CAAS) and the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) have developed innovative and successful ways of working with farmers to improve the situation, increasing yields of winter wheat and summer maize by 35% and reducing nitrogen fertiliser use by 20%. However, the Chinese Government has set the goal of increasing yields with zero increases in chemical inputs by the year 2020.  Rothamsted Research and its partners in this proposal, the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (CEH) and Bangor University (BU), have worked with CAU, CAAS and CAS for over 10 years, producing research into agriculture and the environment that has been published in the very best journals such as &apos;Nature&apos; and &apos;Science&apos; but also used by Chinese farmers through such mechanisms as a Chinese fertiliser recommendations system and farmer field schools. We propose to increase our UK-China collaborative research through a Virtual Joint Centre in Nitrogen Agronomy that would: 1. Carry out joint research projects, in particular using novel &apos;Farm Platforms&apos; that will allow us to develop economically and environmentally sustainable farm systems through research at the farm level. 2. Exchange staff and students for laboratory and field work, with a strong focus on UK-to-China movements and for periods of 1-3 months, e.g. summer student visits from the UK to China to work on the new CAU Cropping Farm Platform. 3. Hold joint conferences and meetings, with public participation. 4. Share data management, publications and practical work with farmers in China and the UK. We will develop novel metagenomic-based indicators of N use efficiency and soil quality, use these indicators, and other emerging knowledge, to test and develop farm systems that permit the sustainable intensification of (especially Chinese) agriculture, and take these developments to Chinese farmers. We will achieve this through four Work Packages: improved fundamental understanding of N cycling; harnessing novel N technologies; improved agronomic practices; predictive capacity and knowledge exchange  The Centre will build on previous collaborations such as China Partnering Awards and joint projects between the partners such as &apos;Sino-United Kingdom Low Carbon Agriculture&apos; project (Grant FCO-C02/62.1001), 2008-2011, funded jointly by the UK FCO and the Chinese Ministry of Agriculture and an existing VJC with CAAS: The &apos;Centre for the Sustainable Intensification of Agriculture&apos; (CSIA) and closely link to similar international initiatives such as EU &apos;N Expert Panel&apos;, utilising the Panel&apos;s approaches for expressing NUE at (1) the farm level and (2) through the food chain in order to compare systems and regions and as a stimulus to use N more efficiently.   The Centre will translate its research into practice in China through the existing and very &apos;Science and Technology Backyard (STB)&apos; programme, managed by our partners at CAU, CAAS and the Hebei Institute of Agricultural Sciences, and linked to Chinese local government extension agencies, fertiliser companies and farmers.</narrative>
