   <narrative xml:lang="EN">GCRF Building capacity for sustainable interactions with marine ecosystems for health, wellbeing, food and livelihoods of coastal communities</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Seas and coasts and the nature that lives in them provide multiple services (e.g. farmed and wild capture protein-rich seafood for local consumption and sale, coastal flood and storm defences, tourism, leisure, marine renewable energy, transport and climate regulation) that can be exploited or are passively used to support local economies and the health and well-being of coastal communities. Yet, there is an increasing demand for ocean space resulting from expanding use of the marine environment, and a growing awareness that much of the marine environment is deteriorating. In response a need for marine planning (MP) has grown globally to ensure sustainable use of marine space and extraction of its resources. This is particularly evident in E and SE Asia, where conflicts over marine space and resources are growing, added to by pressures of population growth The capacity to implement MP throughout E and SE Asia is largely lacking and presents an overarching challenge: to improve the integrated management of marine and coastal environments to reduce conflict between users, mitigate risks associated with expanded or new uses, and protect fragile ecosystems while supporting livelihoods, food security, health and well-being of coastal communities. We will achieve this through collaborative international, interdisciplinary research, training and capacity building. Activities will focus on learning-by-doing among researchers, local stakeholders, and local communities to deliver research outcomes with potential for impact. We have five sub-challenges to address, aligning with three UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDG1 no poverty; SDG2 zero hunger; and SDG3 good health and well-being): Challenge 1: Promote sustainable harvesting by reducing overexploitation of seafood and degradation of the environments, and promoting sustainable management of wild capture seafood and production of seafood through aquaculture.  Challenge 2: Prepare for climate change by understanding its direct and indirect effects on coastal communities and anticipating and mitigating the impacts e.g. coastal wetlands, reefs and mangroves dampen the effects of flooding, storms and tsunamis; their management plays a key role on human wellbeing beyond being sources of food.  Challenge 3: Promote good health: we aim to show how improved management of marine ecosystems may promote health and wellbeing benefits, including but not limited to food and nutrition, and reduce the health risks that arise from degraded and overexploited ecosystems.   Challenge 4: Identify opportunities for future growth: improved management can provide additional, sustainable, opportunities for growth via technologies such as marine renewable energy.  We will need to recognise and account for synergies and trade-offs among uses of the marine environment under MP. Challenge 5: Co-development and implementation of MP: marine plans need to be culturally-acceptable, facilitate growth of, and reduce risks to and conflicts among users of the marine environment, and simultaneously contribute to improving livelihoods, health and wellbeing and ensuring sustainable use of marine ecosystems. We will focus research, (and learning-by-doing), on case studies in UNESCO Biosphere Reserves in Indonesia, Vietnam, Philippines and China and marine protected areas in Malaysia.  Ultimately this project will deliver economic, social, health and wellbeing and environmental benefits to coastal communities in SE Asia via co-development of local research capacity, stakeholder engagement, and application of contextually relevant tools for MP that will endure well beyond the four-year programme. We anticipate a future where people can rely on restored and more resilient marine ecosystems that can be used sustainably to support and improve livelihoods. Delivery of that objective will in turn create durable collaborations between academic and non-academic partners to deliver research with transformative impact.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Vision: To develop interdisciplinary research capability and lasting collaborations that: facilitate innovative application of integrated planning in the marine environment within the UNESCO Man and the Biosphere Programme and other marine parks and their communities in South East Asia, and respond to the UN Sustainable Development Goals of no poverty, zero hunger and good health and well-being for coastal communities through the sustainable use of marine resources.   1. To provide a research base that supports planning in the marine environment (marine planning) through a novel integration of ecosystem services, ecosystem valuation (monetary and non-monetary), ecological public health, and governance approaches.  2. To increase the research capabilities of the team through co-developed research with appropriate stakeholder engagement to address actual marine resource management, economic development, health and wellbeing, and conservation challenges using the international case studies of the UNESCO Biosphere Reserves and marine protected areas in SE Asia.   3. To apply research to identify &apos;what works&apos; in fostering wellbeing, protecting both human and ecosystem health, and achieving sustainable development.  4. To use the lessons learned to further co-develop and apply practical and cost effective tools to support decision making and marine planning at local, national and regional scales.</narrative>
