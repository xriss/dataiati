   <narrative xml:lang="EN">NUCLEUS: a virtual joint centre to deliver enhanced Nitrogen Use effiCiency via an integrated SoiL-plant systEms approach for the Uk &amp; BraSil</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">We propose a Joint Virtual Centre, NUCLEUS, which will focus primarily on enhancing our understanding of the key agronomic aspects of nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) and improve the synchronicity between a plants need for N and soil N availability at an adequate rate and suport an optimal soil-plant environment that diminishes N losses (addressing research theme A of the scientific scope). We aim to achieve this via investigating the main nitrogen pathways in the soil-plant-atmosphere system and identifying which N pools less prone to losses can be managed aiming at a more efficient use of N by crop plants. Our vision is ambitious, involving 13 institutions and 30 scientists, and highly interdisciplinary involving soil scientists, agronomists, environmental biologists and social scientists. Our specific aims are to: 1. Bring together some of the UK and Brazil&apos;s top ranked institutes and leading researchers (in terms of funded research and publication records), some of them for the first time, to work jointly in this important area. 2. To deploy specific work packages (WP) that address important research gaps in our understanding to improve NUE and priorities for Brazil including WP1: Use of Sensor Technologies to Improve NUE in Crop Production; WP2: Linking the Impacts of Soil Physical Condition and N Cycling on Plant Growth; WP3: Manipulating Plant Root Systems for Improved NUE; WP4: Enhancing NUE through applications of Soil Amendments; WP5: Increasing Agronomic NUE in flooded and rain-fed rice production.  3. A sixth and overarching WP focused on Capacity Building, Training and an Outreach Programme ensuring we maximise the impact of our research, meet the ODA requirements and ensure the legacy of the project. 4. Complementary field and laboratory experiments in both UK and Brazil (including equipment sharing) utilising state of the art technologies e.g. sensors, Electrical Resistance Tomography &amp; X-ray Computed Tomography imaging etc. to probe the soil-plant response to nutrient stress and subsequent development of exciting remedial interventions to enhance NUE in agronomic systems in both countries. 5. To focus not solely on a single crop but on a diverse range of cropping systems including maize, rice, beans and wheat, both in commercial and subsistence agriculture, that has relevance for both countries.  6. A strong focus on capacity building, engagement and support of Early Career Scientists in partner institutes through exchange, joint-supervision, training activities and collaborative research. 7. To hold a series of workshops, training activities and other dissemination events over the duration of the project, linked to the individual work packages AND the project as a whole, to focus on establishing the current state of the art in understanding between the two partner countries for scientists, stakeholders and farmers ensuring the maximum possible impact for the research. 8.To undertake cutting edge research that can also be used to inform policy and practice on the ground. This challenge will be met by feeding directly into existing and new links to agronomic extension and policymaker networks.  9. To develop a roadmap for future collaborative activities focused on novel solutions for enhancing NUE through management of agronomic systems beyond the life of the initial funded project thus ensuring its legacy.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">World agriculture has made enormous advances in recent decades in increasing crop production largely through increasing the application of pesticides and synthetic fertilisers. Nitrogen (N) is a key nutrient and often a limiting factor for crop growth supporting the need for the addition of synthetic N fertilisers for most global agricultural systems. However a high proportion of this, often estimated to be &gt;50%, is currently lost into the environment often through the soil via leaching or to the atmosphere as a gas emission. This loss of N to the environment is represents a significant economic loss and pollutes surface and ground-waters, impacting negatively on ecosystems and increasing greenhouse gas emissions (GHG). Cutting across this is our future need to increase agricultural production in order to meet the demands of global food security for the rapidly expanding population. This challenge will necessitate a significant improvement in the management of N and in particular Nitrogen Use Efficiency (NUE) in both Brazil and the UK. The extent to which the release of reactive N can be mitigated to some degree through approaches related to improving agronomic NUE (e.g. using no-tillage systems, intercropping, combined crop-livestock systems, applying organic wastes to soils as amendments will be addressed here for the first time in an integrated holistic way between 13 partner organisations in Brazil and the UK. The NUCLEUS Virtual Centre will seek to undertake interdisciplinary research, with physical and social scientists, using the latest technologies to assess, understand and recommend new strategies concerning agronomic NUE management to support future crop development and food production. NUCLEUS will build on several current collaborations, whist generating many new ones for the future and seek to engage and inspire the next generation of scientists to tackle this important area. As the current level of understanding concerning the integration of these approaches is limited, there is potential for the outputs of NUCLEUS to be a bench mark for tropical and temperate agriculture throughout the world.</narrative>
