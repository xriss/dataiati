   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Exploring Participatory Film-Making as a Development Method to address Gender Inequality in the Pacific</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Gender inequality in the Pacific is a serious challenge and a sensitive issue - and requires a culturally appropriate and joined-up development approach to support and drive the necessary social changes. The prevalence of violence against women in the Pacific region is among the highest in the world, whilst women&apos;s parliamentary participation is amongst the lowest in the world. Countries across the Pacific region have put in place policy strategies, legal frameworks and a raft of initiatives, but against their own and internationally accepted indicators there has been poor progress towards gender equality, despite the development cooperation efforts of many donors over several decades. Why is the current paradigm underpinning gender policy apparently ineffective in grasping the social actions that produce gender inequality in the Pacific? What are the cultural contexts shaping the contemporary situation?   An emerging body of Pacific-made participatory documentary films has recently thrown new light on these problems by enabling communities to tell their own stories, in their own ways and through their own cultural terms. But we cannot assume that Pacific peoples&apos; view visual representations as we might expect, nor that film technologies alone are able to access and to draw out ideas in the vernacular. Rather, research suggests that the design of participatory processes can enable people to analyse and to leverage social change in their own terms. How do these home-grown Pacific film projects fit with the history of community film-making and human rights activism? What are the key factors to development methods able to align with indigenous knowledge and Pacific protocols for communal relations?  At the same time, legal and anthropological research suggests that current gender policies have recognisable origins in Euro-American folk models that reduce &apos;gender&apos; to the taken-for-granted differences between men and women. But gender in the Pacific is not merely a matter of the biological differentiation of women and men: in their own analyses of events and actions, Pacific peoples point to the importance of differentiating whether a woman is acting as a mother, daughter, sister, cousin, wife, in-law and look to these particular social, collective and kinship relations. Alongside examining the conceptual and cultural assumptions that underpin the current gender policy paradigms, we will examine the dominant theories of change for levering &apos;individual&apos; and &apos;societal&apos; behaviour changes misunderstand the tenets of Pacific socialites. Is there a culturally appropriate way to promote rights-based issues such as gender inequality within a communal society?   Film studies and ethnographic research each have distinctive ways of understanding how people engage and portray the world in their own cultural terms, and this project aims to bring these insights into dialogue. With PNG and Samoan film-makers&apos; recent development of culturally effective participatory methods and ethnographic evidence that Pacific gender differentiates relational roles not biological difference, this international research network opens a new space for dialogue in which academics and non-academics can collaborate in re-thinking the current paradigms in development policy and practice.  The proposed inter-disciplinary international research network will work by promoting sustained collaboration between researchers in the UK, Papua New Guinea and Samoa, by the use of video-conference research seminars, by analyzing the emerging genre of Pacific-made community films, by reviewing the literature on indigenous approaches and participatory methods, by involving Pacific film-makers and communities with experience of participatory film-making, and by series of workshop and impact engagement events across both regions - all with the objective of contributing to creative development methods to support the challenge of promoting gender equality in the Pacific.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The prevalence of violence against women in the Pacific region is among the highest in the world, whilst women&apos;s parliamentary participation is amongst the lowest in the world. This international research network involving collaborations between UK and Pacific film, legal and anthropology scholars takes up the question of how to address rights-based issues within a communal society and in culturally sensitive ways, and aims to contribute to finding new approaches to the challenges of gender inequality in Papua New Guinea and Samoa.  Film studies and ethnographic research each have distinctive ways of understanding how people engage and portray the world in their own cultural terms, and this project aims to bring these insights into dialogue. With PNG and Samoan film-makers&apos; recent development of culturally effective participatory methods and ethnographic evidence that Pacific gender differentiates relational roles not biological difference, this international research network opens a new space for dialogue in which UK and Pacific academics and non-academics can collaborate in re-thinking the current paradigms in development policy and practice.  Through an expanded international research network and collaborations beyond the academy, we seek to investigate the specific problem of community understandings of gender inequality issues and representational genres to support home-grown efforts towards change through inter-disciplinary collaboration and co-creation on participatory film-making, with the specific outcome of a culturally sensitive model with direct impacts for development which enables people as the primary agents of their own responses by grounding research in vernacular understandings and customary, national and international legal frameworks.   In taking up the development challenge of understanding how gender equality policy and development practice can be more closely aligned with Pacific understandings and communal processes, this project will:  1. Establish an international, interdisciplinary network of arts, humanities and social science researchers, building upon and significantly extending research partnerships between UK, PNG, Samoa and Fiji institutions.  2. Involve film-makers from the UK, PNG and Samoa in the core research team and engage Pacific researchers and practitioners, and engage Pacific communities with experience of participatory approaches to addressing gender inequality.  3. Review and analyze the emerging body of community films, the literature on indigenous approaches to development, and the literature of Pacific gender inequality.  4. Through video-conference research seminars, and a series of seven workshops in the UK and the Pacific, bring together film, legal and ethnographic expertise in a creative dialogue.   5. Prioritize research impact engagement and knowledge exchange with government, non-government and international development agencies (in London, Port Moresby, Apia, Suva and Brussels) and foster two-way dialogue in which UK and Pacific academics and non-academics can collaborate in re-thinking the current paradigms in gender policy and development practice.  6. Build capacity and enhance research expertise amongst academic and non-academic beneficiaries in the UK and the Pacific to promote the development approaches and develop the research insights produced throughout the project and extend its life cycle.   7. Dissemination outputs will involve a website, workshop briefings, a film short, peer-reviewed article, and edited book.</narrative>
