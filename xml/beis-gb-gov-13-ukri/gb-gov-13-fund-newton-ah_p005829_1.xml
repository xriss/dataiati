   <narrative xml:lang="EN">NEWTON - Cultural heritage in landscape: planning for development in Turkey</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">As defined in the European Landscape Convention (now signed and ratified by Turkey and the UK), the concept of &apos;landscape&apos; provides a way to bring cultural and natural heritage together in mutually-supportive ways. Landscape offers a global frame to address social and environmental challenges and to exploit the social, economic and environmental values of different types of heritage for social benefit. Landscape perspectives can be local and universal, personal and collective; they embrace both tangible and intangible heritage and have strong cross-sectoral connections to areas such as urban planning.   Landscapes underpin sense of place and identity: with careful management, they can transform people&apos;s quality of life. Although landscapes change constantly as a result of human actions and natural processes, researchers have not yet created spatial models at a large scale that provide detailed insights into historic landscape change. Such models could be used to understand fundamental issues such as the links between historical changes, intensification and climate change, and to inform planning for the future.  To do so, this project will develop emerging landscape characterisation methods that can be used across and between disciplines to address the challenges of environmental and social change through landscape. Leading specialists from Turkey and the UK will work together with a team of Early Career Researchers (ECRs) to identify and address challenges facing societies in both countries through cultural heritage in landscape.  During the research programme the team will develop innovative practical methods to create positive impacts within 5-10 years. This is especially urgent in Turkey as quickening economic development and social change create unintended negative impacts including loss of landscape character and poor-quality landscapes. The partners will promote research using Historic Landscape Characterisation (HLC), an interdisciplinary technique developed in the UK and first piloted in Turkey by members of the team with the aim of informing positive landscape planning and management.  The project will be organised into five Work Packages (WPs) to develop and demonstrate the value of characterisation using GIS (Geographical Information Systems) for historic landscape research, public participation and landscape planning. The research programme will be focussed around two case-studies in Turkey in the regions of Izmir on the Aegean coast and Mersin on the Mediterranean. Each case-study will include detailed analysis of a large region (including all available modern/historic cartography, remote sensing and aerial photographic data), with targeted ecological and archaeological fieldwork (WP2); public engagement and participation to underpin interpretations of landscape value (WP3); and GIS-based modelling of scenarios informed by historic character analysis to develop methods for visualising and planning future landscapes (WP4).  The project will address these two fundamental challenges in the Turkish context: 1. To identify and implement effective methods for advocating positive landscape change based on a well-understood and clearly presented base of evidence that includes cultural heritage; 2. To create effective relationships between landscape researchers in different scientific disciplines, landscape planning policy and practical implementation in landscape management.  Targeted dissemination actions will promote the project&apos;s results to relevant audiences. Two conferences in Turkey are planned during the project&apos;s lifetime for delegates including landscape architects, landscape planers, archaeologists, academics, local government officials, and national government ministries and authorities. The tools we develop will also be applicable beyond Turkey in the UK, Europe and beyond: the team will promote their use through their international networks, publications and online communications.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The aim of this project is to create and implement innovative methods for mapping the value of cultural heritage in landscape and for integrating this knowledge into systems of landscape planning and management. The research team will carry out two detailed case-studies in Turkey that build on a series of recent national and international research projects funded by bodies including TUBITAK, AHRC, the British Academy and the Newton Fund. The methods and approaches developed in the project will not be specific only to Turkey, but instead will demonstrate good practices that could be applied in any context around the world where rapid change threatens the value of cultural and natural heritage in landscape. Our objective is to promote the value and sensitive use of landscape heritage to underpin sustainable social and economic development.  The project will be managed as five Work Packages (WPs) which together will create and demonstrate innovative applications of GIS-based characterisation for historic landscape research, public participation and landscape planning. The project will be focussed around two case-studies in the regions of Izmir and Mersin, each of which will include detailed analysis of a large area (including all available modern/historic cartography, remote sensing and aerial photographic data), with targeted ecological and archaeological fieldwork (WP2); public engagement and participation to underpin interpretations of landscape value (WP3); and GIS-based modelling of scenarios to develop methods for visualising and planning future landscapes (WP4). The WPs have the following roles and objectives:  WP1 will undertake project leadership and management, including coordination of the WPs and line management of team members, monitoring progress, administration of the project, regular communication with partners, stakeholders, and funders.  WP2 will create a detailed HLC for each case study area, providing a GIS-based interpretation that identifies the key longterm changes in historic character over the last few millennia. The HLC will integrate the team&apos;s work to on ecological survey, enabling us to characterize how specific ecological assemblages relate to historic landscape change over time.  - This project&apos;s first key objective will be to demonstrate a method for effective interdisciplinary analysis of Turkey&apos;s historic landscape.  WP3 will adapt and improve the HLC approach to facilitate its use in participatory management of landscape heritage. WP3 recognises that landscapes include tangible and intangible elements of significance to different communities, and often provide spaces for clashes between agents with conflicting interests (whether local citizens, public authorities, commercial organisations, tourists, etc). - The second major objective will be to integrate participatory landscape research into the HLC interpretation.  WP4 will use the integrated HLC to inform models of potential landscape change in the future. The team will analyse and model short and long term landscape changes in each case-study and also will predict and evaluate the possible future changes under different scenarios for the year of 2050 using different modelling approaches informed by HLC. - The project&apos;s third key objective is to develop methodologies that enable the historical analysis embedded in the HLC to be integrated into modelling impacts of future change.  WP5 will undertake Dissemination and Communication activities throughout the project aimed at academic and nonacademic audiences. - The fourth project objective will be to host two conferences in Turkey that enable us to engage directly with early career researchers, landscape professionals and government agencies.</narrative>
