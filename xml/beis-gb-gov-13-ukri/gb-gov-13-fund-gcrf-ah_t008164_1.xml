   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Mobile Arts for Peace (MAP): Informing the National Curriculum and Youth Policy for Peacebuilding in Kyrgyzstan, Rwanda, Indonesia and Nepal</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">1. Partnership working: To co-produce peacebuilding resources with target communities and organisations through arts-based approaches and digital tools across music, dance, drama, visual arts and other cultural forms alongside the integration into the curricula and other approaches of partnering NGO and CSO participatory practices of conflict transformation, community dialogue, psychosocial support, and advocacy/activism for and with children and youth, especially marginalised groups.  2. Research: To research the use of cultural forms for dialogue between children and youth, between children/youth and educators and between children/youth and policy makers in order to generate effective, sustainable, impactful, and evidence-based peace-building approaches. To generate evidence for the effectiveness of arts-based approaches to peacebuilding through child and youth-led participatory action research and indigenous practices, including through monitoring and evaluation informed by the social, political and cultural context of each participating country. Monitoring and evaluation will assess knowledge gains as well as changes in attitudes and practices that foster peaceful interpersonal relations through the Theory of Change model.  3. Policy Impact: To inform youth policies that address community-based conflict, and to provide possible solutions to the exclusion of children and youth from processes of conflict transformation. To fundamentally shape pedagogical practices and spaces, through the National Curriculum and youth policy of Kyrgyzstan, Rwanda, Indonesia and Nepal and to serve as an international network to inform practice globally. This will be achieved through working with HEIs and ROs: University of Lincoln (UoL), University College London (UCL), Open University (OU), University of Rwanda (UR), Tribhuvan University Nepal (TU), Atma Jaya Catholic University of Indonesia, Institute of Research and Dialogue for Peace (IRDP); Government agencies: Lembaga Perlidungan Anak/Child Protection Agency Indonesia (LPA), Rwanda Education Board (REB); Arts organizations: Rwanda Cinema Centre, Mandala Theatre Nepal, Sakhna Nomadic Theatre Kyrgyzstan, Yayasan Anak Bangsa Indonesia (YABI), Woman Culture Centre Rwanda (WCC), Human Rights Film Centre Nepal (HRFC); CSOs: Foundation for Tolerance International Kyrgyzstan (FTI), Centre for Civic Education Indonesia (CCEI), Centre for Social Change Nepal (CSC), Sana Initiative Rwanda Janaki Women Awareness Society Nepal (JWAS), Uyisenga Ni Imanzi Rwanda (UNM); INGO: Family for Every Child and UN agency: UNESCO.   4. Capacity-building: To strengthen capacity and to encourage sharing across South-South arts-based peacebuilding approaches through the design and delivery of curricula and other resources with children and youth, cultural artists and adult educators working in formal and informal educational settings across regional and cultural contexts. This will provide further knowledge and understanding about the design, piloting, scaling-up, evaluation and sustainability of curriculum development and training initiatives that foster peace.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">MAP aims to provide a comparative approach on the use of interdisciplinary arts-based practices for peacebuilding in Kyrgyzstan, Rwanda, Indonesia and Nepal. MAP has the overall goals of first, influencing curricula and approaches to working with in- and out-of-school youth and second, creating structures and modes of communication between youth and policymakers from the local to global. Each country has different histories and approaches to peacebuilding, yet all four have a rich tradition of using cultural forms for dialogue. The selection of the four countries will enable us to explore how pathways to peace may be shaped by diverse political, cultural, religious and linguistic factors, as well as the crosscutting issues of gender and intersecting inequalities, environments and the exclusion of children and youth from policymaking processes.   MAP will operate across three core components: a) project design and delivery; b) research; and c) arts-based practice that run throughout three strands of activities. Strand One will involve scoping visits, literature reviews, community mapping and training of adult and child/youth facilitators in arts-based methods for dialogue and research. During Strand Two, up to 3 small grants of &#xA3;5,000 will be awarded in each of the four countries for child/youth and adult MAP trainers to work alongside CSOs to develop projects that address local issues that may incorporate (but are not limited to): child rights-based decision-making; child protection and peacebuilding. Up to 2 grants of &#xA3;29,500 in each of the four countries for youth to work alongside policy-focused organisations to explore arts-based communication structures. Up to 4 large grants of &#xA3;100,000 in each of the four countries for researchers of any level and partnering organisations to design and deliver effective monitoring, evaluation and impact delivery alongside the small and mid-size grant awardees. One additional large grant of &#xA3;100,000 will be awarded in the final two years of the project to synthesize findings, drawing out similarities and divergences across the four countries and to consider questions of scalability and transferability, in order to inform youth policy at an international level.  Strand Three will involve the coordination of community-based dialogue groups and MAP Clubs to inform policy and establish communication structures alongside synthesis and dissemination. The project will be working alongside cultural organisations, youth-serving CSOs, conflict and peace building CSOs, government institutions and ministries, higher education institutions, conflict management, and psychosocial wellbeing organisations. In this way, the project promises diverse impact at local, national and international levels.   We will explore the following questions:  1. How can different art forms be used to co-design, deliver and evaluate peacebuilding curricula and other approaches for working with children and youth to address local conflict issues? 2. How might cultural forms be used for dialogue with and between children and youth, educators and policy makers to advance peacebuilding through a local and indigenous approach? 3. How might psychosocial support, including local healing practices, be better integrated within peacebuilding approaches by using the arts to promote the wellbeing of children and youth, especially  those from marginalised groups?  4. How can cultural forms be incorporated into child- and youth-led participatory action research methodologies and adapted for the purposes of the design, undertaking and delivery of interdisciplinary  projects in diverse social, political and cultural contexts? 5. How might these cultural forms be used to create alternative spaces and communication structures for peacebuilding approaches and curricula development to inform local, national and international approaches to peacebuilding.</narrative>
