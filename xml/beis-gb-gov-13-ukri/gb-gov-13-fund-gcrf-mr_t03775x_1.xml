   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Exploring treatment burden and capacity for self care among patients with HIV/NCD multimorbidity in South Africa to inform interventions (EXTRA)</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Aims:  (i) to identify, characterize and understand patient and caregiver workload and capacity associated with self-management amongst people living with HIV and non-communicable disease multi-morbidity in a context of socio-economic disadvantage; and, (ii) to explore the relevance and applicability of existing theoretical models of NCD treatment workload- capacity developed in high income countries and to adapt them to inform research and interventions in the LMIC context of South Africa.  Objectives  1. To explore, with people living with HIV/ NCD multimorbidity, interactions between their experiences of health services, treatment burden (workload and capacity) and symptom burden, in settings characterised by socio-economic disadvantage 2. To present these findings to key health system stakeholders for consideration and to assess their potential to inform interventions aimed at reducing workload and enhancing the capacity of patients living with HIV/NCDs 3. To undertake theory-informed qualitative analyses that identify, characterize and explain core components of patient and caregiver treatment burden and their interactions with symptom burden and health system factors in this context and to determine which elements have concordance with the theoretical models of NCD workload-capacity developed in high income countries 4. To develop an adapted theoretical model of HIV/NCD workload-capacity and integrate this with our earlier modification of the WHO Innovative Care for Chronic Conditions (ICCC) Framework to form the basis for individual, peer group and service level interventions that can be validated in a large scale, complex intervention trial.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">South Africa (SA) and other sub-Saharan African countries are experiencing a double burden of chronic disease epidemics: one of infectious disease, most notably HIV, and the other, a rapidly evolving epidemic of non- communicable diseases (NCDs) such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease. This is resulting in different patterns of multi-morbidities (two or more simultaneously occurring long term diseases or conditions) to those commonly seen in high income countries. Concerningly, these chronic diseases are being increasingly seen in younger people, which has implications for their families, economic productivity and healthcare costs.  Currently, chronic healthcare for patients with multimorbidity in SA is fragmented and uncoordinated and does not take into account the increased challenges the patient faces in trying to manage their conditions. The primary aim of this Seed Funding Application is to identify and understand the illness &apos;workload&apos; experienced by patients with HIV/NCD multimorbidity, as well as their caregivers. This information will be used to ensure that the patient perspective is fully considered in the healthcare reform initiatives that are currently underway in SA, which aim to improve chronic care services. A further aim is to explore the relevance and applicability of existing models that explain the workload involved in NCD treatment and patients&apos; capacity to deal with it. Existing models have been developed in high income countries and we are interested to adapt them to our setting so that they can inform future research and interventions in South Africa and potentially in other low-and middle- income countries.  We will use interviews and discussion groups for this study. We will interview a range of patients and their care givers to explore how they experience self-management workload and their capacity to deal with it. This will be in both an urban and rural setting in the Western Cape province as for example, peoples&apos; access to services may differ. We will then recruit healthcare managers, doctors, nurses and community health workers from the same settings into &apos;task groups&apos; to discuss these findings and consider what they mean for the redesign of local services and interventions that might reduce patient burden and increase their capacity. We will also hold further meetings to present our findings to policy and health managers at a provincial and national level to influence reforms in the health system.  This project will help us develop a culturally and contextually appropriate model of HIV/NCD workload and capacity for a low -to- middle income setting such as SA. This work will contribute to development of interventions that can then be tested across different settings.</narrative>
