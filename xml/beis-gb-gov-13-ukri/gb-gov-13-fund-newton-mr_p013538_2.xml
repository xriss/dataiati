   <narrative xml:lang="EN">High blood glucose levels in pregnancy or gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is one of the most common medical conditions during pregnancy. It can cause harm to the pregnant woman and her child. GDM affects 10-15% of Malaysian women. More women are being diagnosed with GDM now because a lower level of blood glucose is being used to diagnose GDM.  If not treated, GDM can cause high blood pressure in pregnancy, increased numbers of caesarean deliveries, anxiety and depression. Women who have had GDM have 7-8 times higher life-time risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). There are risks to the children too. They may be too big or too small. If too big, they can have shoulders damaged during the birth. Their blood glucose may fall too low after birth. They may get jaundice soon after birth, or have difficulty in breathing. A very few may die before birth (stillbirth). In the long term, these children are at higher risk of becoming overweight and diabetic.  The diagnosis of GDM is usually made between 24-28 weeks of pregnancy using a glucose drink test called an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Although treatment can improve pregnancy outcomes, some of the damage may have already been done to the unborn baby.  So screening to detect high glucose levels earlier in pregnancy may be better. However, there can be harms as well as benefits from screening. As a recent British Medical Journal article said:  &quot;a label of gestational diabetes brings with it an intervention package that includes glucose monitoring, extra clinic visits, more obstetric monitoring with greater likelihood of labour induction, operative delivery and admission of the baby to special care, and finally for the mother a label of high risk for diabetes&quot;.   At present, all pregnant women in Malaysia are supposed to be screened for GDM because the population is considered to be high-risk. However, doing OGTTs can be challenging. The test requires pregnant women to come to a laboratory having not eaten anything for at least 8 hours. In many countries, including the UK, women are selected for OGTT based on risk factors such as higher body weight and older age. However, selecting women based on these factors can miss up to half of all women with GDM. Another blood glucose test done by a simple finger prick (called HbA1c) might do instead. It would be done at the first antenatal clinic visit. The HbA1c is a one-step test and patients do not need to fast. However, the value of HbA1c testing is not yet known in Malaysian women.  The aims of this study is to find out whether HbA1c testing at first antenatal clinic visit can predict later GDM and if there is a level that can rule out later GDM. We also want to compare testing all pregnant women with testing only those with risk factors. We will do a trial to see if a drug called metformin can prevent women developing GDM. Metformin is safe in pregnancy.  An accurate HbA1c level that can safely rule out GDM in women at low risk would help pregnant women. They can be reassured. Avoiding the need for OGTT would save them time and money. In contrast, if the HbA1c level identifies them as at high-risk, healthy eating and lifestyle advice can reduce their risk of getting GDM. In addition to the benefit to mothers and their children, this study will also be useful to people who provide health care in Malaysia. They can focus care more on women at high risk. The results could be used by other countries.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is one of the most common obstetric medical conditions, which when undetected can cause significant adverse outcomes for the mother and her child. The immediate risks to the mother are a doubling of pre-eclampsia, higher frequency of Caesarean deliveries, and psychological effects from anxiety, depression and social stigma. Women with a history of GDM have at least 7 times higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) later in life. Up to half of them will develop T2DM within 10 years after delivery. The immediate risks to the children include macrosomia (20%-30%), being small for gestational age (7%-10%), shoulder dystocia, neonatal hypoglycaemia and hyperbilirubinemia, respiratory distress syndrome and in rare situations, stillbirth. Children born to mothers with GDM are predisposed to childhood obesity and diabetes later in life. Treating GDM improves the obstetric adverse outcomes by approximately 50%.  Diagnosis is made usually between 24-28 weeks of pregnancy using a 75g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), but by then some adverse consequences to the baby may already be occurring and any delay in screening and treatment may make it too late to improve outcomes.  Although universal screening is recommended by many guidelines, this is not uniformly followed across the world, because of a lack of resources as well as doubts about cost-effectiveness. The major limitations are difficulty in conducting OGTT, which requires prompt access to laboratory facilities (glucose degrades in storage), in lower middle income countries (LMICs) where majority live in rural settings. Even in high-income countries like the UK, universal screening is not adopted due to the lack of cost-effectiveness in specific populations. An alternative to OGTT is screening with HbA1c at booking clinic, which has been advocated by the International Association of the Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups (IADPSG). The HbA1c is a one-step test and patients do not need to fast. However, the relationship of different HbA1c levels in first trimester/early second trimester of pregnancy and outcomes of pregnancy (including the development of GDM as per current criteria) is yet to be determined in Malaysian populations.   Our aim is to develop a research network and data estimates to underpin a larger study.  The primary objectives of our project are:  a) to assess the value of HbA1c testing at first antenatal visit at or before 20 weeks gestation in predicting later GDM and adverse outcomes of pregnancy, including determining levels of HbA1c that might rule out later GDM; b) to examine the relative cost-efficiency of different screening strategies i.e. universal versus selective screening;  c) if metformin, a drug that is safe in pregnancy, can prevent the development of GDM.  The secondary objectives of the study will be:  a) identification and the impact of novel risk factors that can be easily measured in resource constrained settings (such as gestational weight gain, blood pressure, socioeconomic status, educational attainment, etc.), and their relative contribution to the diagnosis of GDM;  b) Reduce the overall need for OGTT by accurate risk prediction leading to early detection of GDM or impending GDM earlier in pregnancy."></capital-spend>
