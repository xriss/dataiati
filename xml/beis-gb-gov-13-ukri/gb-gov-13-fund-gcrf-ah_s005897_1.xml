   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Rethinking waste and the logics of disposability: Compound 13 Lab</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Aims  1. Build a creative, shared space (Compound 13 Lab) for exploration, dialogue, learning, situated within the politics/policies of &apos;global city&apos;, built on methodological and pedagogical innovation, underpinned by a strong cross-sector partnership and leading edge research and scholarship 2. Build capacity for international knowledge exchange through the lens of the &apos;wicked problem&apos; of plastic waste,  exploring issues in sustainable urban development, poverty alleviation, and education 3. Create a space for the expertise, knowledge and voices of those working in the informal waste management industry and their young people to be listened to 4. Develop and incubate innovative, entrepreneurial solutions led by Dharavi&apos;s young people to the challenges that they face,  and build sets of skills for employment in India&apos;s 21st Century economy 5. Challenge public perceptions of the politics of human disposability, advocating for the work of informal recyclers as essential and valued labour within wider systems of production 6. Contribute to cultural and policy change that sees democratising access to knowledge and valuing expertise gained through experience as a vital means of implementing the UN&apos;s Sustainable Development Goals.  Objectives  1. To share emerging tools and technologies of the circular economy with those who would not normally have access to them, despite their key role in waste management within the city 2. To develop an ecological design curriculum for the Lab for young people aged 8 - 25, using the principles of creative and participatory pedagogy, and to make it freely available internationally 3. To support, deliver and document six participatory residencies with leading artists, designers, engineers and scientists (4 from India, 2 from the UK/EU) which provide a learning exchange mechanism to address issues of waste, work, education, survival and sustainability in Dharavi 4. To build an international platform for practice-based exchange and learning between artists, designers, engineers, scientists, researchers and policymakers in the field of waste management and sustainable urban development through exhibition, publication and a series of events in India and the UK.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Since the 1950s, more than 9 billion tons of plastic has been produced worldwide. Many plastic items are used once and thrown away. As most plastics do not naturally degrade, they remain with us, usually buried in landfill or floating in the ocean. India generates around 3.4 million tons of plastic per year, of which 60 - 80% is recycled, boasting one of the highest rates of plastic recycling in the world. In 2018, the state of Maharashtra banned single use plastic, making Mumbai currently the largest city in the world to do so.    Rethinking Waste...focuses on the knowledge politics of the informal waste management industry in the 13th Compound in Dharavi, Mumbai&apos;s largest informal settlement, where members of the project team have been working within a series of partnerships established since 2012, in particular through intensive collaboration, dialogue and action research with Acorn Foundation, India. The 13th Compound processes approximately 80% of Mumbai&apos;s hard domestic waste, where up to 250,000 rag-pickers supply 40,000 people employed in grassroots recycling micro-enterprises, working in risky and unsanitary conditions. This process of self-organised work is undertaken almost entirely by those with low incomes, low social status and migrants. Most industries in Dharavi are labour-intensive, producing high levels of pollution, even though they contribute to reducing the carbon footprint of the city. Hazardous and cramped working conditions, combined with poor sanitation means that a factor of such production is that it comes at the expense of human life.  Compound 13 Lab will be  a space for experimental design and learning, whose innovative programme introduces design and media tools, audiovisual technologies, 3D design and digital fabrication to disadvantaged, marginalised citizens who because their socio-economic status do not normally have access to these resources, developing a learning environment that has the potential to alter their future. Inspired by the makerspace movement, it utilises the materials and resources of the recycling industry as the starting point for learning and teaching about ecological design and living solutions. Through a programme of workshops and residencies by artists, scientists, engineers and designers, the lab will share emerging tools and technologies of the circular economy with those who would not normally have access to them. The project explores a paradigm of smart city where the technologically advanced city emerges from below rather than being centrally planned and implemented. In particular, members will be able to test and innovate with various technologies, exploring the ways in which plastics can be recycled, remanufactured and remade safely, reliably and creatively.   ACORN members will have co-designed and developed a bespoke &apos;living curriculum&apos; that responds to their issues, addresses their needs and aids their future goals. The implementation of the Lab is intended to create a space of enquiry where these local knowledges and practices can be communicated within and beyond Dharavi, through a process of increasingly self-organised making and learning. It will have the potential to be implemented in similar settings elsewhere; it will open up research avenues for digital fabrication industries; and may offer gateways to more skilled employment, even potentially incubating/testing new products and services made with recycled materials. The project will also host a &apos;hackathon&apos; and conference exploring innovative approaches to the circular economy hosted by Makers Asylum, Mumbai. It will develop, test and share learning materials that can be used worldwide by organizations engaged with communities working in the informal circular economy.</narrative>
