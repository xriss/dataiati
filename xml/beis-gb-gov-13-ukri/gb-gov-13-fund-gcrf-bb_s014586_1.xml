   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The overall aim of our project is to investigate biological and human well-being benefits provided by agroforestry in tropical landscapes. Large knowledge and data gaps on its potential to close yield gaps and underlying biological mechanisms generate perception challenges hindering wider uptake of agroforestry for sustainable agricultural intensification in small-holder and industrial farms. Our research addresses these gaps combining social and ecological methods to quantify how and to what extent integrated landscape management can enhance benefits to and from agriculture. Our research will address four main objectives with tasks in four work packages:  Objective 1 Investigate four key benefits provided by the study landscape. Data collection and mapping tasks will produce baseline data that fill essential knowledge gaps. Task 1.1 Collect ecological and socio-economic data from farms and buffer zones around farms Task 1.2 Upscale habitat quality metrics from plot scale to land scape maps using Landsat reprocessed reflectance data  Outcomes include baseline data that fill essential knowledge gaps: per ha yields for food &amp; cash crops in the study landscape (O1), soil quality quantified as soil organic carbon, pH, N, P, bulk density, earth worm density (O2), human well-being quantified as access to resources and socio-economic metrics (O3), and biodiversity benefits to crops quantified as pollinator and pest control minus pest effects (O4).  Objective 2 Investigate the agronomic potential of natural capital for these benefits. We will model spatial dependencies between the four benefits and the quality and distribution of natural and semi-natural habitats (our key &apos;natural capital&apos; management variable). Task 2.1 Model spatial dependencies of benefits (crop yields, soil quality and biodiversity benefits) on metrics describing the quality and distribution of natural and semi-natural habitats in the landscape.  Task 2.2 Model dependencies of human well-being on metrics describing the quality and distribution of natural and semi-natural habitats in the landscape.  Outcomes include novel spatially explicit models linking the distribution and quality of natural and semi-natural habitats in the landscape to the benefits (O5). The data and models will be used to test four hypotheses on expected relationships.  Objective 3 Validate sustainable intensification through natural capital accounting for biological and human well-being factors. We will co-develop scenario models analysing trade-offs in space and time between benefits and negative impacts arising from loss or restoration of semi-natural and natural habitats on the farm and in the landscape. Task 3.1 Construct network and quantify metrics for network robustness Task 3.2 Use scenario modelling on the objective 2 models to predict changes in the four key benefits with our key management variable.   Outcomes include ecological networks linking habitats to pollinators, pests and pest controls (O6), co-developed scenario models and their outputs (O7), dataset on inflection points &amp; local maxima in crop yield and well-being responses to habitat restoration/loss in the study landscape (O8). The data and models will be used to test four hypotheses on expected relationships.  Objective 4 Contextualise agronomic potential of natural capital considering social and policy dimensions of land management and governance. Outputs from scenarios will be used with contextual information to develop a systems model. Task 4.1 Obtain feedback on models through stakeholder workshops and develop system model  Task 4.2 Run knowledge exchange workshops with stakeholders.  The outcome is a systems model (O9) that can be utilised to predict to predict how changes in decisions on farm and landscape management are likely to translate into changes in the four benefits and trade-offs in benefits with other negative impacts. The model will be used to test one hypothesis.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The overall aim of our project is to investigate biological and human well-being benefits provided by natural capital (sensu agroforestry) in tropical landscapes of Sub-Saharan Africa.  Integrated land management that exploits natural capital (e.g. natural and semi-natural habitats and their resources) for benefits to and from agriculture has been identified as a key component of sustainable agricultural intensification in Sub-Saharan Africa by academics and practitioners. Small-holder farmers traditionally recognise the benefits natural habitats can provide to agriculture. But research on underlying &apos;best practice&apos; for improved crop yields is rare. Large knowledge gaps exist on the potential of natural capital for improving crop production whilst protecting biodiversity, clean water and resources such as timber, food, medicine and fuel. Data gaps are considerable on the biological mechanisms that underlie the benefits of natural capital for agriculture. Both knowledge and data gaps create perception challenges (&apos;how useful is natural capital and is it necessary?) and these in turn hinders the targeted uptake of integrated land management for agricultural intensification in small-holder and industrial farms.  Our research will fill these gaps combining social and ecological method advances to quantify how and to what extent integrated landscape management can enhance benefits to and from agriculture. Working with rural farmers, agribusiness, development and education practitioners, research organisations and government in Tanzania, we will collect and analyse ecological and socio-economic data from our study landscape in Tanzania to address four key objectives. Our study landscape (~ 20 km x 40 km) encompasses part of a corridor along the border between the fragile forests of the Udzungwa Mountains and the productive croplands of the Kilombero Valley, a water catchment area and an important ecological hotspot. First, we will investigate the four key benefits provided by the study landscape: these include crop yields, soil health, biodiversity (in particular abundance of pollinators and natural enemies of pests and their interactions with food plants and habitats), and human-wellbeing. Second, we will investigate the spatial dependencies of these four benefits on natural and semi-natural habitats and their distribution in the landscape. Third, we will develop models that predict changes in these four benefits following restoration or loss of semi-natural and natural habitats in the study landscape. These will allow us to design landscapes and management that would maximise the four benefits. And fourth, we will investigate the drivers for decision-making by farmers and agribusiness on the management of farms and the wider landscape. We will develop a tool that allows us to visualise those drivers and how they translate into decision-making and subsequently into agricultural productivity.   Our project&apos;s research focus is on impact aiming to maximise the utilisation of natural capital for food security and human-wellbeing. This builds on the definition of sustainable resource as &apos;use of resources at rates that do not exceed the capacity of the Earth to replace them&apos;. The research builds on evidence that agroforestry can substantially benefit crops, soil and biodiversity linked to pollination and pest control, whilst generating local (food, timber, firewood, medicine) and global (climate change mitigation, biodiversity conservation) environmental benefits. Our research will build on long-term partnerships established in the study landscape with farmers, agribusiness and government to achieve that impact.</narrative>
