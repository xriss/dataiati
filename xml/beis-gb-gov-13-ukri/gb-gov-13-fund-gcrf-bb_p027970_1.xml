   <narrative xml:lang="EN">TIGR2ESS: Transforming India&apos;s Green Revolution by Research and Empowerment for Sustainable food Supplies  The record grain outputs of India&apos;s Green Revolution in the 1970&apos;s established India as one of the world&apos;s largest agricultural producers, transforming the country from a starving nation to a food exporter, creating jobs and boosting the economy. However, behind this extraordinary achievement were varying levels of success across different Indian regions, and overuse of water, fertilisers, pesticides and other chemicals on an unsustainable scale. In terms of agricultural productivity, the technologies of the Green Revolution plateaued in the 1980s, yet the continued adherence to a strategy of intensive agriculture has led to increasing pressure on water and nutrient resources.  The proposed project (TIGR2ESS) will develop and strengthen alliances across a carefully selected network of UK and Indian experts in crop science, hydrology, social science and policy, allowing two-way knowledge exchange partnership to define the requirements for a second Green Revolution in India, set the necessary policy agenda, and define a collaborative research programme focused on sustainable crop production and sustainable resource use (with a focus on water use from farmer to consumer in a changing monsoon climate).  Working together will enable us to contextualise the challenge in terms of the widespread changes taking place in Indian society today, including: urbanisation, drawing many away from rural work, particularly men; and technological developments transforming the employment opportunities within food sector away from primary production. Choices about modern agricultural practices in India must reflect societal needs, and our understanding of these needs will help us orientate the subsequent research programme and its translation towards an outcome that is both technically and socially acceptable - and possible - for today&apos;s India.  The target for this programme is India, but relevance is in other developing countries, which in moving beyond the first Green Revolution of the 1960&apos;s, face unprecedented change due to societal and environmental pressures. The TIGR2ESS consortium will combine two innovative approaches to tackle these issues in India: Firstly, a series of Flagship Research projects will address fundamental research issues, and integrate their delivery and impact via a translational programme of outreach, education and entrepreneurial stimuli; secondly, a series of capacity building academic exchanges will support leading researchers from India and UK to frame collaborative research questions, and allow extensive training of more junior researchers to deliver these advances. At the heart of the TIGR2ESS proposal, the Flagship Projects will tackle fundamental research questions, with the first providing an overarching analysis to define the requirements for a &apos;second&apos; Green Revolution in India.   Secondly, a programme of research capacity exchanges will allow over 40 senior and young researchers to work in India or the UK,  providing training and skills enhancement opportunities in research areas across the programme. Additional field-based community surveys and workshops will promote rural community engagement and empowerment.   Overall, the programme will address the associated demographic and equality issues facing farmers in the context of increasing urbanisation.  Two core Flagship Projects will use fundamental scientific approaches to address key issues in Crop Sciences (broadening the production potential of dietary staples and providing lessons for orphan crops) and Sustainable Resources (with a focus on water sources and sustainable use, from farmer to consumer, in a changing monsoon climate). The final Flagship project will translate these findings in order to promote equal opportunities, stimulate entrepreneurship and develop educational programmes for nutrition across rural communities.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">With 1.34 billion people, India is the second most populous country in the world, and the UN estimates that by 2022 its population will surpass China. India is facing unprecedented change due to both societal and environmental pressures, and radical transformation of the current food production system is needed to meet growing demand both sustainably and appropriately.  The objectives of this proposal are:  1. To define the requirements and set the policy agenda for a &apos;second Green Revolution&apos; in India, framed by demographic changes affecting rural communities and feminisation of smallholder farming systems. The aim is to ensure a more resilient outcome for the country&apos;s future food production, including overcoming the regional bias of the previous Green Revolution that favoured production in certain areas and created unbalanced markets, and tackling its negative impacts such as overuse of water, fertilisers and pesticides.  2. To develop and strengthen alliances across a carefully selected network of UK and Indian experts, to build a collaborative, long-term research partnership in sustainable agriculture that will set India on the path to a second Green Revolution.  This will involve: a) two-way knowledge exchange, working together from the outset to contextualise the challenge in terms of the widespread changes taking place in Indian society today; b) building a collaborative fundamental scientific research approach to address sustainable crop production and sustainable resource use (with a focus on water use from farmer to consumer in a changing monsoon climate); 3. To develop and build ongoing capacity for research, innovation and entrepreneurship in sustainable agriculture in both the UK and India, training young scientists in areas critical to a sustainable agricultural system and enhancing their career progression, across career stages. 4. To open a dialogue with both small-holder and large-scale Indian farmers, helping promote gender equality and stimulate entrepreneurial activity through training workshops and on farm demonstrations. 5. To create employment opportunities in India across the entire food chain from farm to fork, thus boosting the country&apos;s economy, by interacting with Indian ministries, NGOs, multinational corporations and SMEs. 6.     To engage with the wider rural and urban communities in India to overcome malnutrition, and enhance understanding of food and nutrition through community educational programmes, and empower local people to adopt sustainable agriculture practices, improve nutrition and enhance wellbeing of communities.</narrative>
