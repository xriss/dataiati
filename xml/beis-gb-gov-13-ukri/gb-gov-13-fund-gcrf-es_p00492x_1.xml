   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Supporting Evidence-Based Policy: a longitudinal study of AMR risk behaviours among livestock keeping communities in India and Kenya</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Anti-microbial resistance (AMR) is set to rival climate change as one of the largest barriers to health and wellbeing in the 21st century (Aarestrup, 2015; O&apos;Niel, 2015; Woolhouse et al., 2015). And like climate change, AMR is likely to have a preferential impact on communities of the poor (Heffernan, 2017). Yet, to date, the inter-relationship between poverty and AMR has not been well explicated. This is particularly true with regard to animal agriculture. Indeed, while 2/3rds of the global poor are livestock keepers (Lin and Heffernan, 2009a, 2010) very little is known about the factors facilitating AMR among this population. We do know however, that AMR emerges out of the social, cultural and behavioural milieu in which disease and healing is situated. And in this case the environment in which livestock are produced. Therefore, the aim of the project is to explore three inter-related drivers: social, behavioural and environmental to the emergence of AMR among two communities of the livestock dependent poor: Maasai pastoralists in Kenya and subsistence dairy producers in Orissa, India. Both of these communities had participated in a large-scale study on animal healthcare service delivery funded by DFID in 1999 (Heffernan and Misturelli, 2000; Heffernan, 2001). In this manner, the research will draw on a historical dataset to compare a variety of parameters important to the emergence of AMR. Ranging from animal healthcare seeking behaviours/preferences to livestock-based livelihoods to access to service providers to farmer of understanding disease etiologies and access to livestock pharmaceuticals and antibiotic use, including dosages and timing over a 17-year period. Thus the study offers a unique opportunity to explore behavioural change over time. Such an historical assessment is beneficial on two levels: first, the strength and directionality of these forces on AMR emergence can be measured and thereby, better understood and second, the analysis offers a unique opportunity to support evidence-based decision-making.   The risk of the rapid ascendancy of AMR as a global threat is that the development community will formulate policies on a weak evidential base. Equally problematic, much of the current research exploring AMR focuses on bio-prospecting in one-off exercises. Therefore, it is likely that this approach will create an evidence base biased towards single outcomes. And in this manner, related decision-support tools will be limited in their ability to predict change by the singular, deterministic nature of the underpinning data (Heffernan and Yu, 2010; 2007; Yu and Heffernan, 2009). To address this issue, the project will create and deliver the &apos;AMR forecaster&apos; an easy to use ranking and weighting framework based on the longitudinal dataset. The aim is to enable policy makers, researchers and practitioners to use the simple on-line tool to assess the relative risk of AMR emergence among the communities involved.   Finally, however, we know that changing behaviour regarding the use of antibiotics is imperative both in the global North and South (O&apos;Neil, 2015; Woolhouse et al., 2013; 2015). Previous studies have shown that children can be effective entry points for livestock-related knowledge at the community level (LDG, 2011). Therefore, the project team will produce and disseminate learning material on AMR to local school children, and measure the transfer of key messages or &apos;memes&apos; on wider households members.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Antimicrobial resistance in animal agriculture in the global South is, in knowledge terms, one of the great unknowns (Who, 2014; Grace, 2015). Nevertheless, over the last decade, while poor farmers have increasingly reported the resistance of a range of infections (both human and animal) to treatment by commonly available antibiotics, the research community has been slow to respond. On the ground, most of the factors that have contributed to this state of affairs from the extra-label use of antibiotics, to incorrect dosing regimes to the sale of adulterated, fake and expired drugs are known to livestock specialists (Heffernan and Misturelli, 1999). And most experts would concur: the emergence of resistant pathogens in the global South appears to be related to an explosive mix ranging from the lack of farmer knowledge to lax regulatory environments to poor quality healthcare services. Yet the relative importance of any of these drivers to the emergence of resistance has not been explored. And equally importantly, the synergies and interactions between these factors have not been well documented. Most critically, forging an understanding of the rise of antibiotic resistance among these communities demands knowledge of how these drivers have changed over time.  A recent survey of the Chief Veterinary Officers in Africa revealed that measuring levels of antimicrobial resistance with regard to common livestock pharmaceuticals was well beyond the scope of surveillance activities (Grace, 2015). This is largely because across Africa, farmers can easily access livestock drugs without a prescription. And disease surveillance systems are largely under-funded. Indeed, among highly mobile pastoralist populations, access to black market drugs are rife which are often adulterated or diluted by the herders themselves in attempts to &apos;make the drug stretch&apos; across a larger number of animals. In India, while interactions with healthcare providers are more common, prescriptions are often provided to farmers without examination of the related clinical case. This is particularly problematic in the small-scale dairy sector. Pathogens causing diseases such as mastitis are showing increasing resistance to front-line antibiotics (Heffernan et al. 2017, forthcoming).  Therefore, the aim of the project is to explore the triumvirate of drivers: social, behavioural and environmental forging the rise in antimicrobial resistance among subsistence farming communities in the global South. The study will focus on two communities of the livestock-dependent poor: Maasai pastoralists in southern Kenya and small-scale dairy producers in Orissa, India. By using a historical dataset of changing disease incidence and prevalence, antibiotic use, access to livestock pharmaceuticals and service providers the interplay and potential dominance of particular social, behavioural and environmental factors to AMR will be identified. A key outcome will be a decision-support tool to enable users to rank and weigh these factors and thereby, calculate the risk of AMR among communities of interest.    While understanding the drivers to AMR is critically important, supporting behavioural change is also vital. To address this factor, the final component of the study will engage local schools in Kenya and India in AMR. As such, the project will develop a comic book for school children ages 8-12 &apos;Atlas the AMR Fighter&apos; for dissemination at the community level.  The study has four core objectives:  1. To perform a longitudinal study of the social, behavioural and environmental factors driving AMR among livestock keeping communities in Kenya and India. 2. To identify the interaction and synergy between these factors and their role in resistance/pathogen emergence.  3. To create a decision-support tool to aid in ranking and weighing, priority factors in AMR emergence.  4. To address behavioural change via the creation of learning material for school children.</narrative>
