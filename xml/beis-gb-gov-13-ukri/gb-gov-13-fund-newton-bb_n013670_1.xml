   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Developing Rice with Increased Resistance to Salinity and Drought</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Food production needs to be expanded drastically to feed an ever growing human population. Drought and saline soils are two environmental conditions that greatly depress agricultural production around the globe and it is estimated that around 20-30% of rice yield is lost in areas where these stresses are prevalent. To limit such losses, it is imperative that we develop rice varieties that are more resistant to these stresses, either through breeding or by using engineering.  Both breeding and engineering approaches require knowledge about the genes that contribute to tolerance. Not only will that help us understand the molecular mechanisms that plants use to respond to stress, the accumulation of such &apos;positive&apos; genes will enhance rice resilience to drought and salinity. In this project we propose to use a technique called GWAS (genome wide association studies) to identify (new) genes and variations in genes (alleles) that are important in rice drought and salt tolerance. In contrast to previous work, we use very specific traits when we carry out GWAS to maximise our confidence that we are targeting the right genes. We will further confirm the relevance of the identified alleles by analysing their function, for example via deletion and subsequent characterisation of the &apos;knock out&apos; plant. After these stringent &apos;quality controls&apos; the positive alleles will be introduced into existing, high yielding varieties that are commonly grown in Vietnam and the Philippines. Introduction can be achieved via molecular breeding (crossing plants), a well established but very time consuming process. In parallel, we plan to use state of the art genetic engineering which will greatly accelerate the process which is important because there are many beneficial alleles that need to be transferred. The introduction of these modern engineering, or &apos;genome editing&apos;, techniques is also vital because it avoids the drawbacks of genetically modified organisms which have low public acceptance.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The main, overarching, project objectives are (I) to generate Vietnamese and Philippine elite rice varieties with increased salinity and drought tolerance and (II) to transfer expertise from UK to Vietnam and Philippines concerning state of the art biotechnology.  Main objective (I) will be achieved through the following secondary objectives:   a: Providing proof of concept of successful genome editing (GE) to increase rice drought and salt tolerance. Modern GE approaches are now at a stage where there is the potential for routine implementation. We will employ CRISPR/Cas technology on the reference cultivar IR64 for a number of previously identified candidate genes.  b: Introducing high confidence candidate alleles into Vietnamese and Philippine elite rice cultivars.  Previously GWAS-identified candidate genes will be introduced into elite recipients using molecular breeding and GE to develop more tolerant germplasm.   c: Testing the functional significance of existing high confidence candidate genes. The role in drought and salinity tolerance of novel candidate genes will be assessed by using bioinformatics and loss of function mutants. The latter will be derived from public databases or generated in-house by using GE. d: Unravel the role of silicon (Si) in rice drought and salt tolerance. We will perform physiological experimentation to define the role of Si in drought and salinity, in particular with respect to its effect on shoot Na levels during salinity and tissue K levels during drought. Concurrent GWAS studies will help identify alleles that are important for this function.   Main objective (II) will be achieved through the following mechanisms: a: Expertise of carrying out and interpreting rice GWAS studies will be transferred to Vietnam.  The Vietnamese appointed researcher will spend a 3 month period in York when he/she will receive comprehensive theoretical and practical instruction in analysis of phenotypic data and their association to genotypic data (using GenABEL software), interpretation of  Manhattan plots, the effect of population structure and gene discovery and other relevant issues. b: Expertise of modern genome editing technology (CRISPR/Cas) will be transferred to Vietnam/Philippines.  The Philippine appointed researcher will spend a 3 month period in York concurrent with the Vietnamese researcher. Both will receive training in generating genome editing constructs, guide RNA design, rice transformation and rice regeneration. c: Consortium interactions. Frequent (6 monthly) web based conferences and a 5d consortium meeting (@18 months, in York) where presentations take place and scientific discussions are held. The meeting will also allow demonstrations and tuition for consortium members.</narrative>
