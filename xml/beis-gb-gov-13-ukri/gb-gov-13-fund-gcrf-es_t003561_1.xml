   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Water and Fire: Enhancing capacity and reducing risk through 15 &apos;Best Bets&apos; for transformative adaptation with vulnerable residents on the Cape Flats</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">South Africa&apos;s township residents are beset with legacy economic and social challenges of apartheid, poverty, and constrained development opportunities. The scale of this challenge is heightened by migration to cities, and rapid, extensive growth of formal and informal settlements, which are extremely susceptible to environmental risks. Climate change has exacerbated the risk of disasters as these destructive events have increased in severity and frequency. Urban densification, infrastructural collapse, poor post-apartheid governance, as well as mistrust between marginalised communities and state actors has compounded the effects of environmental disasters. Disenfranchised groups, including migrants, unemployed youth, the elderly, and ethnic and linguistic minorities are most at risk of the direct, indirect, immediate and systemic harms of such events, especially as they are intimately and complexly interwoven with structural oppressions, such as poverty, gender discrimination, racism, violence, and political alienation. Infrastructural collapse and emergency or disaster response services to township fire-outbreaks and water-shortages have been met with violence, where breakdown in trust between different levels of government, public services, and township residents have frequently provoked outrage. Three escalating environmental hazards disproportionately and differentially impact on excluded communities on the Cape Flats of Cape Town, South Africa. These are recurrent large-scale fires, widespread water shortages and in-access, and large-scale flooding. To mitigate the social impacts of disasters related to water and fire, and to meet the justice and inclusion priorities of the UN SDGs and UNISDR Sendai Framework priorities of &apos;build back better&apos;, risk-affected communities need to be supported to lead policy and practice changes to reduce these risks The project draws on themes of water and fire to bring disaster risk management to sustainable development by building local capacity in directing decisions for responses to environmental hazards that most affect the marginalised. In an age of government austerity and economic strain, township residents have been forced to become increasingly self-reliant and resourceful. The project will supportively mobilise local knowledges to mitigate disaster by prioritising coproduced, cooperative strategies. These may include coactivation of practical community-driven programmes, but also bottom-up policy strategy development to effectively respond to environmental disasters. We will engage democratic and creative participatory methods to mobilise the lived experiences of affected residents as primary evidence to challenge current disaster management processes and promote community-based resilience actions.   Through the systematic co-development of a set of resilience actions, this project will directly benefit risk-affected communities in their efforts to mitigate disaster risks and achieve sustainable livelihoods. These resilience actions include collaborative partnership with risk-affected communities to: assemble local knowledge drawn from  residents&apos; lived experiences to mitigate risks; engage indigenous democratic processes and creative interventions to mobilise local knowledge towards proactive responses to disaster risks; mobilise local knowledge to codevelop a set of agreed 15 &quot;Best Bets&quot; as shared, practical resilience actions to help reduce disaster risks; develop these 15 &quot;Best Bets&quot; into a community-driven policy strategy for disaster risk reduction; in the process, create a democratic framework for codeveloping policy strategies and community resilience actions to reduce disaster risks in affected communities. Planned activities will include legkotlas, indabas, community mapping activities, digital story-telling, and public engagement events to showcase creative and useableproducts of the community-driven engagement process, thus increasing positive societal impact.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed research aims to directly address the disaster risk challenges of three interrelated environmental hazards related to water and fire in marginalised SA communities by testing new methods of complementary democratic and creative engagement to advocate community-driven solutions and resilience action in response to such disasters. A key aim is to bring together principles of disaster risk management, [identifying, analysing, evaluating, treating and monitoring risk (EU Science Hub 2019)], with democratically-oriented prioritisation of disaster risk reduction (UNISDR Sendai Framework) at local level, [reducing mortality, economic loss, and the number of affected people], while developing disaster risk strategies and sharing information through a community-driven coproduced process, thus directly addressing UN SDGs [1, 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16 and 17].   By engaging themes of water and fire, the project objectives are to work with and alongside residents: 1) To address three environmental hazards affecting three marginalised township communities on the Cape Flats of SA, with the aim of enhancing local capacity to reduce disaster risks;    2) To improve the wellbeing, resilience and livelihoods of 3 severely disaster-affected communities;    2) To create alternative development pathways for sustainability by mobilising local knowledges and multi-literacies, and by engaging indigenous processes for democratic participation and dialogue in disaster risk reduction within marginalised communities;  2) To engage community-driven coproduced and creative processes to share information and build strategic resilience action on disaster risk reduction within affected communities;  2) To build an equitable framework for policy development and practice based on democratic, mediating systems that foster trust and cooperation between state, civil society, and affected residents  3) Through sharing information and processes from research activities, to increase local capacity in  other similarly affected urban communities on the Cape Flats and SA, and raise potential for scaled-up impact beyond the affected communities themselves to provincial, national and international policy arenas that value decision-making by the communities most at risk to environmental hazards; 4) To support strategic partnership building between the University of Stirling (UoS) team, the Sustainable Livelihoods Foundation (Cape Town research NGO), the Universities of Cape Town (UCT) and Western Cape (UWC), and participating residents of Delft South, Overcome Heights, and Sweet Home Farm on the Cape Flats, to collaboratively develop disaster risk reduction solutions to water and fire hazards faced by their and other Cape Flats communities; and to capacity-build three postdoctoral scholars in sustainable development areas related to project research interventions.  Through the systematic co-development of a set of resilience actions, this project will directly benefit affected communities in their efforts to mitigate disaster risks and achieve sustainable livelihoods.   These resilience actions include collaborative partnership to:  1) Assemble local knowledge and indigenous perspectives drawn from affected residents&apos; on-the-ground, lived experiences and individual/collective actions to mitigate risks;  2) Engage indigenous democratic processes and creative interventions to mobilise local knowledge towards proactive responses to disaster risks affecting these marginalised communities;  3) Mobilise local knowledge to codevelop a set of agreed 15 &quot;Best Bets&quot; as shared, practical, collective and individual actions to help reduce disaster risks for affected communities;  4) Develop these 15 &quot;Best Bets&quot; into community-driven policy strategy for disaster risk reduction; 5) Create a democratic, &apos;mediating system&apos; framework for codeveloping policy strategies and community resilience actions to reduce disaster risks in affected communities.</narrative>
