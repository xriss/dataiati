   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Technology-EnaSystem-Integratedbled Model of Care Aiming to Improve the Health of Stroke Patients in Resource-Poor Settings in China</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Our proposal is to improve evidence-based secondary prevention and rehabilitation of stroke patients in rural China, where resources are limited and a disproportionally large number of stroke patients live. It adopts a practical and innovative system-integrated technology-enabled model of care aiming to improve the health of stroke patients (the &quot;SINEMA&quot; model).   Our model is designed on the basis of, and lessons learned from, many previous studies by our and other research groups and insights into system barriers. The focus is on utilising and strengthening community-based healthcare workers and caregivers through training and technology. The model has two main parts: a) training of village doctors by physicians in secondary healthcare facilities, who are in turned trained by specialists in tertiary hospitals to provide evidence-based care to stroke patients in their villages; and b) training of family caregivers by nurses in secondary healthcare facilities, who are in turned trained by specialists in tertiary hospitals to provide simple and much-needed rehabilitation and other services to patients in their families. This model utilises existing human resources in the communities where the patients live and equips healthcare workers and caregivers with training and digital health technology (such as Android-based smartphone apps or text-messaging).   There are six specific step-by-step objectives:  1) To conduct a barriers analysis to understand the opportunities and constraints experienced by stroke patients and their families in accessing essential care and rehabilitation;     2) To integrate and refine content and technological platforms for the SINEMA model into simple-to-use training products and technological tools. This objective will garner evidence-based content and will scope out currently available technological platforms already developed in previous studies by our team or other groups, aiming for the best delivery channel for end-users. This objective focuses on translating specialised information from clinical guidelines for stroke into easily understood communication tools (such as a picture-rich intervention manual, video, audio, text messaging, etc.) and digital health technology (smartphone apps and SMS) through extensive adaptation based on user feedback and usability testing with end-users (village healthcare workers and family caregivers).  3) To train physicians and nurses in secondary and community healthcare facilities in our study sites through the &quot;train the trainer to train&quot; approach. Training of the trainers will emphasise how best to become an educator themselves rather than simply learning what their trainees need to master.    4) To implement the SINEMA model in a cluster-randomised trial in 1,250 patients in 50 villages in one rural county -- Nanhe County in Hebei Province located in the stroke belt in China. In the 25 intervention villages, village doctors and family caregivers will receive training and ongoing feedback and support and performance-based payments and incentives to delivery care to approximately 625 stroke patients.   5) To evaluate the implementation of the model through patient-centred outcomes (the primary outcome of systolic blood pressure, and a series of secondary outcomes), process evaluation (qualitative operational research method) and economic evaluation.  6) To actively engage policymakers and other key stakeholders throughout the study, and widely disseminate the model and the lessons learned from the study toward the end of and after the current funding cycle.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Stroke affects 62 million people worldwide and is a leading cause of death in low- and middle-income countries such as China. This serious condition has a high chance of recurrence and is also highly debilitating, leaving many survivors disabled. In family-oriented societies where significant health expenditure is out-of-pocket, a stroke constitutes a major life event that dramatically changes the life not only of the stroke survivors but also of the family caregivers.   In addition, for the large number of stroke patients living in rural areas, the care they receive is inadequate and far below evidence-based standards. To rely on specialists to provide such services is not only unrealistic but also unsustainable. Yet healthcare workers and family caregivers, who live in the same communities as the patients, lack the necessary knowledge, training and tools to provide high-quality care.   To address these problems, we have designed a model of care to train village doctors and family caregivers, equipping them with innovative digital health technology such as smartphone applications and text messaging. After training, they can deliver evidence-based care to the patients in their villages and families to improve their health status.   Based on nearly ten years of previous studies, we will first update, optimise and integrate the training products and component for the model. We will then roll out the intervention in 50 villages in Nanhe County in Hebei Province located in the stroke belt in China. We plan to train 5 physicians and 5 nurses in secondary healthcare facilities, who will in turn train 25 village doctors and 625 family caregivers, to provide services to 625 patients.    The model described and tested in this study has the potential to provide an example based on training, new technology and sharing of tasks by different players in the healthcare systems, to build up the capacities of many healthcare workers and caregivers in a scalable way, and to improve the health of stroke patients.</narrative>
