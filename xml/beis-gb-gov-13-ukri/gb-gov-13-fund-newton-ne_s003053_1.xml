   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Globally, water-related diseases are a major obstacle to sustainable development (WHO, 2018). Many of these diseases, such as Cholera and Hepatitis A, have been successfully phased out in Malaysia. However, leptospirosis and malaria still affect Malaysians every year. The annual incidence rate of Leptospirosis is actually increasing, from 0.97 cases per 100,000 population in 2004 to 12.47 per 100,000 in 2012.  It is well known that leptospirosis and malaria are strongly linked to environmental conditions, and humidity and temperature in particular. Although scientific understanding of this link is advancing at a rapid pace, it is still very difficult to build computational models that make quantitative forecasts of outbreaks. Yet such systems are indispensable for proactive disease management, and to optimise the allocation of resources for medical prevention and interventions.  A major difficulty with predicting outbreaks of water-related diseases is the large number of driving factors, which span the environmental and socio-economic realms. Additionally, many of the processes that link the driving factors with disease outbreaks, are highly non-linear and difficult to represent in computational algorithms.   This proposal therefore sets out to explore the use of artificial intelligence approaches to identify and model the physical and microbiological interactions that lead to conditions favouring disease occurrences, with the goal of developing an early warning system for disease outbreaks. The complexity and non-linearity in the processes makes AI methods such as the neural network approach highly promising as it is inherently suited to problems that are mathematically difficult to describe and highly non-linear.  The scientific field of artificial intelligence is developing at a very rapid pace. This evolution is driven by the exponentially increasing amount of information available online (often referred to as the &quot;big data&quot; era), much of which is highly unstructured and diverse (e.g., data from social media such as twitter feeds and news posts). This has resulted in the development of many novel and powerful algorithms and routines. However, its exploration in the context of water-related diseases is still very limited. Therefore, we propose to leverage these breakthroughs, by testing and adapting these new methodologies to advance predictive modelling of the link between hydrometeorological extremes and water-related diseases. The proposed research combines extensive compilation, synthesis and integration of socio-demographic and infrastructural data alongside data of environmental extremes, with novel computational algorithms to &quot;learn&quot; from the datasets and leverage the outcomes to improve operational forecasting systems.  We have assembled a world-leading consortium of scientists that combines expertise on hydrometeorological extremes, artificial intelligence and community health issues. We will use the Malaysian state of Negeri Sembilan as a case study, and will work in close collaboration with the State Department of Health. This will allow us to access historical records that include patients&apos; demographic information. More recently, risk assessment have been conducted using questionnaires that includes assessment of water supply and drainage infrastructure. The epidemiological data will be complemented by environmental data from the Department of Meteorology and the Department of Irrigation and Drainage (which are either available for academic use for free or a small fee), and monthly water quality monitoring data from local District Offices.

  <capital-spend percentage="This proposal aims to increase local resilience to current tropical disease outbreaks by bringing together world-leading scientists on hydrometeorological extremes with experts on artificial intelligence and community health. We aim to advance the use of artificial intelligence in improving the understanding of the risk of outbreaks, addressing major gaps between the different areas of study. For this, we will leverage recent advances hydrometeorological predictions, machine learning methods, and low-cost sensor development.  In particular, the proposal sets out to achieve the following objectives:   1. To assess data availability and identify environmental and social parameters with strong predictive potential for disease incidences from existing local, regional, and global datasets  Using the state of Negeri Sembilan as a case study, we aim to assemble a curated database of disease occurrence and potential hydrometeorological and social-demographic driving factors. For this, 8 water contact areas have already been identified by the local Communicable Disease Control and Prevention Unit. Historical records and questionnaire-based risk assessments are available from our project partners. Environmental data are freely accessible from the Malaysian Department of Irrigation and Drainage, while the Department of Meteorology charges a small fee. Water quality monitoring data will be provided by local District Offices.  This database will form the basis for the data mining approaches developed in objective 2.   2. To develop a predictive model using advanced neural network methods and improve prediction accuracy disease incidences  Using our expertise in a broad range of data-based analysis techniques and machine learning, which are part of the wider portfolio of artificial intelligence approaches, we aim to develop a predictive model that can be integrated in operational disease forecasting. We have identified neural network algorithms as a promising method, given the large body of research on its use in non-linear pattern identification and prediction. However, we aim to compare this method with more recent developments such as Radial Basis Function Neural Networks and modifications.   3. To design a community-based hydrometeorological data monitoring for strengthening future predictions of disease incidences    Objectives (1) and (2) will enable us to identify those hydrometeorological and other driving factors that have the highest predictive power in our computational model. Based on these insights, we aim to leverage our expertise in community-based hydrometeorological monitoring and low-cost sensing technologies to explore whether grassroots monitoring can contribute to improved outbreak forecasting. For instance, local hydrological features in the landscape such as lakes and ponds may be critical components that may not be covered by conventional monitoring networks. Monitoring them using a community-based approach may be a promising approach to refining large scale forecasts, increasing their relevance at a community level, and fostering local awareness and buy-in."></capital-spend>
