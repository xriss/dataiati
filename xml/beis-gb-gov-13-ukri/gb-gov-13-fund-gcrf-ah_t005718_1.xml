   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This proposal is organised around the four core principles of the AHRC development award call which are to develop equitable and sustainable partnerships in Low and Middle Income Countries (LMICs), support LMIC capability development, develop pathways to impact and enhance inter-disciplinary working. To this end, we will undertake a programme of: (a) strategic consultations with existing and new international and local experts, partners and practitioners regarding our network&apos;s research agenda and approach; (b) face-to-face and online knowledge sharing and co-design activities to enhance our network and partnerships.   This programme of work will directly frame our final stage Network Plus proposal and strengthen the foundations of our network plus &quot;hub&quot;, the MENASP network (www.menasp.com), for sustainable, cross-regional and equitable partnership working in conflict-affected countries. In so doing, this development award will directly support the core aims and scope of our shortlisted outline proposal whose strategic vision is to forge a paradigm shift in the critical analysis and policy practices of conflict-prevention in the Middle East and North Africa region (MENA) by advocating a shift towards a welfare-centred, social policy perspective. The latter requires a focus on the governance and impact of social protection policies in tackling the most overlooked yet urgently pertinent drivers of civic unrest and conflict in MENA.  The centre piece activity will be a five day practice-based planning workshop made up of three inter-related streams, that will take place in Dubai in February 2020 with the support of the British Council UAE office. The workshop will be managed by a local facilitator. The three steams of work will be:   (1) Workshop stream 1 (1 day): Safeguarding and inclusion in contexts of conflict - the management team and partners will consider the meanings of safeguarding and inclusion within the scope of the project. They will produce a protocol to guide the work of the network long term. This protocol will also be explained in a training film that will also be produced as part of the project.   (2) Workshop stream 2 (2 days): Consultation on research objectives and network approach - the aim of this stream will be to review the conceptual parameters of the network plus research agenda with the key co-Is and project partners. We will refine our country case study focus, consider in more depth and also test how we undertand change and impact will happen in the project and who will benefit from our research.    (3) Workshop stream 3 (2 days): Enhancing interdisciplinary engagement - the aim of this stream will be to focus two days of activity and discussions on dialogue between social scientists involved in social policy and conflict related research with practitioners and researchers from other discipline areas such the arts, humanities, education and management design thinking. These will enhance the project design and wider societal impact.    As stated above, in addition to the workshop will also produce a training video about the safe-guarding protocols and run a webinar during the later half of the project to review the project plans and future activities. Using our menasp.com website, we will support learning and partnerships for example by encouraging the network team to write blogs about their experiences of working in the network and how we can develop it further.   Interested members of the public will be able to follow our work on the website of the MENASP network www.menasp.com</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="In line with the principles of the call, this proposal will aim to strengthen the larger Network Plus bid on the linkages between social protection and conflict prevention in the Middle East and North Africa region (MENA) and facilitate a range of medium-term activities, providing valuable catalysts for longer-term network development, partnership building, research capacity building and spin-off research activities in their own right. Thus, the overall aims of the development award will be to:   (a) engage with interdisciplinary experts and partners who can support the network management in refining and co-designing the network&apos;s research, policy impact and capacity building agendas. The aim is to better address the multidimensional challenges associated with the programme of work around the governance of social policy in MENA, conflict prevention and building inclusive peace;  (b) ensure that the network plus project lays adequate foundations for &quot;doing no harm&quot; with regard to the research team, partners, participants and commissioned research. This will entail developing a due diligence, safe-guarding and equality protocol   (c) foster inclusive and equitable values by starting an open conversation within the team and the broader network about issues of gender, race and identity and by ensuring that workshop outputs are translated into Arabic;  (d) focus the work of the network management team on the most promising contexts and innovations. This will entail activities that support greater clarity on the network&apos;s strategic conceptual and policy linkages between social protection, conflict prevention and sustainable peace and how the country case studies included in the shortlisted proposal will provide adequate spaces and empirical knowledge for this purpose. Achieving this conceptual clarity will be fundamental for the development of a suitable theory of change in the Network Plus bid and associated pathways to impact.   Specific ways in which this development award fits with the main outline proposal objectives are:  1. to forge new challenge-focused, interdisciplinary scholarship for integrating insights from social policy and social protection to the analysis of conflict and peace building in the MENA region. The development award will build on and expand the network&apos;s existing inter-disciplinary expertise by undertaking consultations in three areas: with visual and performance artists on the impact and communication of research findings to excluded or deprived populations that are of relevance to the Network Plus proposal (refugees, low-income female-headed households, informal workers, people with disabilities); opening up discussions on the role of education and in particular universities in MENA  as spaces for conflict resolution and engagement with key stakeholders such as youth and the middle classes; exploring how conflict and social protection issues are understood in other disciplines such as history and religious studies.       2. to undertake a suite of capacity building and knowledge sharing activities among MENA partners, social policy and conflict-prevention researchers (including ECRs), civil society groups and policy stakeholders which will incorporate e-learning training tools and &quot;design thinking&quot; (policy labs). The development award will allow consultation and practice-based learning with local and international partners regarding equitable partnership building and MENA-relevant capacity-building. The capacity of the network itself will be enhanced, as a space for a new generation of researchers and practitioners to take root and deliver on the paradigm shift noted above.   3. to support policy innovation through grant commissioning of new research and pilot projects on horizontal and vertical inequalities in the case study MENA countries. The development award will allow the running of a workshop, translation of materials into the Arabic language and a training film on due diligence."></capital-spend>
