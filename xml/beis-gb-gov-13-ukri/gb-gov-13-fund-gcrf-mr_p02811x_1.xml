   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Bangladesh, a country of ~165M people that is eligible for Official Development Assistance, is facing a major and rapidly growing burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs), including cardiovascular, metabolic, respiratory, and neoplastic diseases. Unless the social, environmental, and behavioural exposures responsible for this premature death and disability can be controlled more effectively, the welfare and economic advancement of Bangladesh&apos;s people will suffer, exacerbating inequalities related to poor health, nutrition, and education. Our vision is to develop and evaluate simple, scalable and effective interventions that can help control exposure to major environmental and lifestyle risk factors, protect against NCDs, and promote health in Bangladesh (and beyond) in an acceptable, sustainable and cost-effective manner. To realise this aim, we will pursue four inter-linked objectives: 1) To create strategic NCD research platforms that leave lasting legacies in Bangladesh. We will build a multi-purpose population cohort to study determinants of NCDs in Bangladesh, encompassing social, environmental, behavioural, and biological domains across urban, rural, and slum settings. It will serve as a vehicle for: a) cross-disciplinary research projects b) capacity building and c) partnership building. 2) To conduct innovative cross-disciplinary research to advance understanding of the interplay of NCD risk factors, and to develop and evaluate practicable, feasible and acceptable interventions to combat them  We propose a systems-level approach to develop strategies to mitigate NCD risk factors, mindful of complexity, context and appropriateness, including addressing gender inequality, cost-effectiveness, convenience to users, and institutional and social acceptability.   Specific projects will range across social science, engineering, sensor development, environmental chemistry, big data, behavioural research, and public health.  3) To strengthen research capacity at three interlinked levels:  Individual level: We will train 40 applied researchers (31 from Bangladesh, 9 from the UK), at different career stages, capable of sustaining excellent research and effective action to combat NCDs in the face of complexity.  Organisational level: We will enhance partner organisations&apos; abilities to access and interpret relevant research and routine data by producing 12 further researchers capable of: a) systematic reviews b) analysing complex NCD datasets and c) developing eRegistry systems.  Institutional level: We will increase two-way understanding between researchers and policy-makers regarding the relevance of high quality evidence to NCD policy by focusing on the norms and rules which govern how institutions operate.  4) To mobilise partnerships between Bangladesh and UK centres of excellence   We will use a variety of interactive approaches to develop ideas and relationships, eg: Sandpit, town hall, and other ideas creation events: From the outset we will involve representatives of vulnerable groups, community leaders, policy-makers and policy-influencers to maximise the likelihood of ultimate real-world impact. Research seminars and workshops: In addition to Bangladesh-UK research meetings, we will promote &quot;South-South&quot; collaboration around NCDs, creating a network of organisations in South(east) Asia (eg, Public Health Foundation in India, the National Institute of Health Sciences in Sri Lanka). Research exchanges, eg: to give direct insight into Bangladesh&apos;s contrasting rural, urban, and slum settings, we will arrange early visits for UK and Bangladesh collaborators to key field sites, partnering with civil society organisations and NGOs already working in these areas to enhance engagement and understanding of the communities&apos; needs. Secondments at government (eg, Public Health England) and third-sector organisations (eg, RAND-Europe) to enrich experience and perspectives.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In recent decades, Bangladesh has been in the midst of a rapid transition: disease burden has shifted markedly from a profile dominated by infectious diseases, under-nutrition and conditions of childbirth to one increasingly characterised by chronic disease (&quot;non-communicable diseases&quot;) such as heart attacks, strokes, diabetes, lung diseases, and cancer. Estimates suggest that at least 60% of adult deaths in Bangladesh today are due to such chronic diseases.   As well as producing profound disabilities and cutting short millions of lives each year, the rise of chronic disease in Bangladesh has created major societal problems, limiting economic advancement, reducing human welfare, and skewing scarce resources toward costly treatments and away from social progress. This situation is unsustainable, especially as Bangladesh&apos;s population ages and continues to grow.  The causes of chronic disease in Bangladesh include distinctive social, environmental, and behavioural factors. For example, Bangladesh has one of the world&apos;s worst environmental and lifestyle risk profiles, characterised by:  Severe water and air pollution: According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), arsenic-contaminated water in Bangladesh, which affects ~100M people, is &quot;the largest mass poisoning of a human population in history&quot;. A 2016 WHO report on ambient air pollution judged Bangladesh to be the fourth worst polluted country worldwide.  Nutritional disorders: Deficiencies of elements (such as iron) required for normal growth and development are widespread. An evolving and complex background of persisting undernutrition and emerging obesity also increase disease risks.  Risk behaviours: &quot;Western&quot; lifestyles (eg, unhealthy diets, physical inactivity) are increasing, and may amplify adverse effects of traditional risk behaviours, augmenting disease risk.   These social, environmental, and behavioural risk factors tend to cluster in households, share antecedents and causes, amplify each other&apos;s effects, and depend on one another in complex (and non-obvious) ways. Importantly, they can also exert importantly different effects in differing contexts such as across rural, urban, and slum settings. Hence, approaches that could tackle such chronic disease risk factors in combination rather than in isolation are likely to be more powerful, as well as approaches that can take account of the context in which they occur.   Yet, Bangladesh&apos;s research infrastructure is not configured to evaluate the country&apos;s multiple risks and multiple settings, perhaps preventing the emergence of evidence that could suggest &quot;joined up&quot; solutions. Our proposal aims to address this grand challenge.   We will mobilise a multidisciplinary team of about 25 leading investigators from seven organisations in Bangladesh and the UK that have a substantial track-record of working together. We will adopt a wide-angle approach, focusing on intertwined risk factors for chronic disease that have not previously been considered in an integrated framework. The plan offers a fundamentally new approach to address this problem because it combines four innovative and inter-linked components:  1) Creation of a 100,000-participant study (&quot;cohort&quot;) in urban, rural, and slum areas to enable study of the social, environmental, and behavioural risk factors for chronic diseases.  2) Conduct of cross-disciplinary research projects that will use the new cohort help understand the interplay of risk factors, and how to combat them, drawing on the complementary strengths of sociologists, engineers, behavioural scientists, chemists, biostatisticians, public health scientists and others.  3) Delivery of an integrated programme of research capacity strengthening that targets three inter-linked levels of activity: individual, organisational, and institutional.  4) Mobilisation and deepening of partnerships between Bangladesh and UK centres of excellence.</narrative>
