   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The iBali (story) Network: Democratising knowledge through creative storytelling with youth who are excluded from learning in urban African Schools</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In a recent forum on reinvigorating arts and humanities in Africa, the African Humanities Programme (AHP) highlighted the important contribution they can make to defining African approaches to building scholarship and meeting social challenges. The social challenge the iBali Network is focussed on is the complex combination of factors which exclude young people from learning in urban schools in Sub-Saharan Africa. Secondary school education underpins global development strategies, and is seen as a minimum entitlement for equipping youth with the knowledge and skills required to secure decent livelihoods in a globalised world. Enrollment in secondary education has increased nine-fold since the 1970s, but youth in urban areas face under-resourced and overcrowded classrooms, unstable home-environments, crime and gendered social pressures, forced employment, poor sanitation and health challenges. It is young people who have opportunities for schooling, but who are excluded from opportunities for learning, who are at the centre of the iBali Network. Learning exclusions are compounded by the little attention given in African public schools to young people&apos;s articulation of their perspectives and experiences of the world they inhabit and the world they want.  We propose to create a network of expert and early career researchers (ECRs) and practitioners whose work coalesces around using participatory storytelling to tackle social issues, working at the intersection of GCRF challenges 3 (inclusive and equitable quality education), 8 (sustainable cities and communities) and 11 (poverty, inequality and gender). Storytelling approaches integrate international, scholarly and indigenous narratives and help surface and give value to different forms of knowledge. Through a focus on in-school youth and storytelling, the iBali Network is committed to both the promotion of arts approaches to address development challenges and the democratisation of knowledge about development through the arts.  The AHP also highlighted under-funding of arts and humanities departments in Africa, and the limited opportunities scholars working across the arts/development boundary have for networking, collaboration and dialogue. We know from our own experience that creating a critical mass of scholars working across this boundary is compounded by the research methods training available for ECRs working on critical social issues. This sits firmly outside the arts, and predominant methodological approaches can be problematic in how they frame and investigate exclusions from learning. The iBali Network responds directly to these concerns.  Through a range of activities which include a methodology-sharing summer school in South Africa, a bidding for funding workshop in Kenya, and sustained support for ECRs from across Africa, iBali aims to mobilise academics using participatory storytelling approaches. The network will demonstrate the approaches by working with academics, practitioners, and teachers and learners themselves to challenge the ways in which youth are excluded from learning in urban education systems. The core team is made up of internationally renowned scholars from Nigeria, Kenya, the UK, Sweden and South Africa. The Advisory Group extends the geographical reach to Ghana, Uganda, Tanzania, Zambia and Sierra Leone. Further, through the recruitment of ECRs, the iBali Network, the methodologies it promotes, and the resulting impact, will be authentically pan-African.  Fresh attention and more creative work is required to better understand why youth don&apos;t learn in urban schools. Through iBali&apos;s focus on storytelling, the arts become a mode of knowledge generation as well as a form of expression and engagement. The intention is to create the starting conditions for a sustainable and scalable network through which exclusions can be surfaced, highlighted and addressed by scholars, activists, policy makers, teachers and the youth of Africa themselves.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The overarching iBali objective is to establish an international network that applies arts and humanities approaches to the social issues evident in urban secondary schools in Africa. The network will bring together experienced and early career researchers and practitioners to share practices and experience of high-quality, ethical, locally engaged, culturally appropriate, participatory storytelling research methodologies for working with teachers and learners to address learning exclusions. The funded activities will create the conditions and relationships to sustain an ongoing network to support, highlight and apply the results of this important work in, and beyond, Africa.  More specifically the network will:  1. host a week-long summer school in South Africa (January 2018) with the core team, advisory group (AG) and up to ten early career researchers (ECRs) based at African institutions. The summer school will incorporate live community workshops in urban schools in which teachers and learners will engage with the co-learning process;  2. host a week-long intensive, collaborative bid-writing workshop in Kenya (August 2018) for the core team, ECRs and AG;  These activities will:  3. make resources about storytelling methodologies for understanding learning exclusions available and accessible to researchers and practitioners working in and with Africa through a published journal article and network website/blog;  4. cultivate sustained engagement with the boundary crossing facilitated by the funded activities by supporting the ECRs to develop and lead on research projects and proposals which utilise storytelling methodologies to research learning exclusions in their own national contexts;  5. embed sustained engagement by collaboratively developing a proposal for a large-scale research proposal which uses storytelling methodologies to surface learning exclusions in different urban African contexts. This will be targeted at the AHRC open call and submitted in September/October 2018;  And ultimately:  6. stimulate sustained debate (cross-national, cross-cultural, cross-boundary) around how storytelling approaches can surface new, indigenous knowledge about why youth are excluded from learning in urban African schools;  7. contribute to the reinvigoration of African arts and humanities scholarship through embedded, collaborative research into participatory storytelling as a mode of knowledge generation as well as a form of expression and engagement;  8. feed the results back to policymakers, practitioners and funders to create and motivate a sustained, supportive environment for this kind of work.</narrative>
