  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This challenge cluster will begin to establish a new network of academics, engineers and designers in underfunded DAC countries, to tackle the grand challenge of plastic waste management and use it to create new, locally designed products using 3D printing. This will add significant value to the waste and reduce reliance on unsustainable, unreliable supply chains. This is both timely and strategically important as there is an ever-growing concern for the volume of plastic waste being discarded in a landfill and in the oceans, especially in LMICs. If this waste can be diverted and the value significantly increased through the production of new products, it not only helps protect the environment but enables new businesses to develop circular products which meet specific local needs. In addition, this project helps to develop approaches to the sustainable dissemination of frontier technology, such as 3D printing and helps to progress distributed manufacture in Africa and other DAC areas.   The overarching aim of this cluster is to establish a network to develop a circular approach to plastic waste management in LMICs by converting plastic waste for use in 3D printers and facilitating entrepreneurship and creating opportunities for employment. Specifically, four project objectives have been identified;   - Create two network hubs to explore the process of taking the plastic waste and adding value by turning it into new 3D printed products in DAC countries to understand the scalability of the process.  - Synthesise current technology research to understand the repeatability of the process.  - Highlight innovative, user-centred product concepts and entrepreneurial possibilities of the technology and embed the knowledge with local partners in DAC countries (through local workshops).   - Translate design documentation into an accessible format (website, toolkit, video) which can be accessed around the world to create new hubs in preparation for follow-on funding.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This cluster brings together five previously funded GCRF projects which aim to tackle the ever-growing challenge of managing plastic waste in underfunded DAC Low Middle Income Countries (LMICs) using technologies such as 3D Printing. 3D printing has been recognised as a leading frontier technology which should be utilised within international development by the UK Department for International Development, UNICEF and the United Nations (Ramalingam et al., 2016; UN, 2018). Currently, the technology is at a &apos;tipping point&apos;, where it is becoming a feasible manufacturing technique and is considered to be the cornerstone of the next industrial revolution (Rauch, Dallasega and Matt, 2016). This game-changing technology is expected to have a substantial impact in LMICs. The project utilises this technology and local plastic waste as the material used in the 3D printers to create new products. It is fundamentally important to develop solutions to the problems caused by plastic waste, especially in LMICs which have poor infrastructure and inadequate waste management systems (Plastics Europe, 2018). It is also critical that frontier technologies (3D printing) are developed and their potential explored in LMICs as they provide a method to leapfrog traditional manufacturing, which is highly capitally intensive and has the ability to create new businesses and support wealth generation.   This new network enables researchers to develop two network hubs in Rwanda and Nigeria which will convert plastic bottles into filament for 3D printing which not only significantly adds value to the plastic waste, but also enables the creation of new products (such as homeware, prosthetics, medical components) and new enterprises and businesses. This project will, therefore; support the synthesis of current technology development, create twelve product concepts with local communities and help develop business models. This knowledge will be disseminated during a design workshop at each hub, developing new entrepreneurship skills and a legacy online resource which will enable other hubs to be started in DAC countries.   The project outcomes will be achieved through the following work-packages:  WP1 - Synthesis current technology research to understand the process (De Montfort University) WP2 - Create two new network hubs in DAC countries to understand the potential of the technology. (Aston University with support from NGO Tech for Trade)  WP3 - Translate design documentation into an accessible format (toolkit, video) which can be accessed around the world. (Aston University) WP4 - Build design capability workshops to demonstrate the potential application of the technology and support entrepreneurship and employment (Loughborough University).   The outcomes of the project will be embodied in an interactive website, toolkit and video which has direct relevance for anyone wishing to develop a hub using this model and create employment (direct/indirect) that will ultimately contribute to the alleviation of poverty as identified in the UN2030 Agenda.   Once established it is envisaged that the network created will grow and conduct pioneering research into solutions to plastic waste management and utilise frontier technology in GCRF funded regions.</narrative>
