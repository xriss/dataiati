   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Green Conservation of Cultural Heritage in Egypt</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">1.1. To create and develop an innovative means in the field of conservation of cultural heritage, regarding the disinfection and inhibition of bacteria and fungi colonizing the heritage objects. It is aimed at replacing the traditional harmful chemical and physical methods, due to the promising features of plant extracts and essential oils (PEEOs),  resource effectiveness, availability, manageability and safety for both heritage materials and people either visitors or museum staff. 1.2. To rescue the selected bio-deteriorated buildings, stones, mural paintings, textiles, carpets and oil paintings heritage in Egypt, via documentation, identification of the components, treat, disinfect them from microbial colonizing, and museum display. 1.3. To establish a conservation laboratory in the Faculty of Arts, Damietta University, it will be the first one in Damietta and the surrounding governorates, aid teaching under- and post-graduates and facilitate high quality research by faculty staff and specialists.  1.4. To lead a strong awareness of the chemical and physical methodologies that are harmful to health, heritage and the environment, and to encourage others in all disciplines to harness nature and green materials. 1.5. To build capacity around a novel mean in heritage conservation in the UK and Egypt, and to exchange expertise in microbiology and conservation and initiate a sustainable co-operation. 1.6. To increase the financial income of the Egypt cultural heritage for a long-term through treatment and display of the selected deteriorated heritage. 1.7. To publish high quality articles in high impact-factor journals, which also promotes our universities ranking. 1.8. To develop connectivity and sustainable partnerships, exchange knowledge, expertise and cultures, and to build new academic partnerships between Egypt and the UK, indirectly contributing to cultural harmony, which is a priceless aim in the long-term.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">It is well recognised that cultural heritage has high significance and value, providing an identity and sense of belonging to individuals, communities and nations. Egypt has a rich and diverse history dating from the Palaeolithic until the present day, including of course the immensely significant Pharaonic era. Despite their global importance, however, Egypt&apos;s heritage assets are under threat. This project is based on an interdisciplinary collaboration between researchers from Egypt and UK including representatives of the Egyptian Ministry of Antiquities. In the present work, various heritage samples will be collected from selected Egyptian heritage sites and museums. Different microbes including fungal and bacterial strains will be isolated and identified using biomolecular methodologies. Various plant extracts and essential oils (PEEOs) will be tested for their antimicrobial activity against key microorganisms. The most potent PEEOs will be evaluated for their efficacy in reversing biodeterioration using simulated models and/or materials. Finally, the most effective agents will be applied to some Egyptian heritage objects following scientific analysis of their characteristics and in consultation with the heritage conservation personnel.  The proposed project team in Egypt (Damietta, Mansoura, and Fayoum Universities) and the UK (University of Bedfordshire) along with the Team members from the Egyptian Ministry of Antiquities will proactively engage with personnel from Egyptian museums and sites to bring together distinctive interdisciplinary collaboration. This will enable partnerships among specialists in microbiology, molecular genetics, archaeology, and heritage conservation science. The diverse expertise of the project team in cutting-edge biological, molecular and analytical approaches and the facilities at various partner institutions will be fully utilised to develop new integrated pathways to investigate, analyse, and treat biodeteriorated materials leading to improved display and sustainability of Egyptian heritage. Capacity building, knowledge exchange, and enhancing stakeholder connectivity are integral to the project activities and deliverable.</narrative>
