   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Colombian armed conflict has been protracted and complex. Its multi-causal, multi-actor and multi-level nature complicates the construction of peace. Furthermore, there are real disconnects between the formal provisions in the negotiated Peace Agreement and the daily lived experiences of communities affected by conflict. In many communities various forms of conflict continue, and in some, new conflicts have emerged as a result of the national-level peace process. We capture these conflicts through the term conflictividades, a Spanish word describing conflict-prone scenarios not necessarily related to armed confrontation. This project seeks to explore the disjuncture between the Peace Agreement&apos;s formulation and the daily realities of life in three communities, and to facilitate and amplify local expertise and agency in moving towards peace and reconciliation in those communities. This participatory action research (PAR) project (Fals-Borda 1987) works towards reconciliation through approaches that give primacy to local communities over external perspectives in understanding the roots of ongoing conflict, and recognise that communities themselves have the necessary knowledge and expertise to overcome conflict. The ethos of the project, as both research and intervention, is therefore to work with communities to facilitate and harness their expertise rather than to impose models or ideas from outside. This will be achieved through utilising our participatory approaches to understand the sources of conflictividades and to prompt &apos;improbable dialogues&apos; (Lederach, 2016), thereby bringing together community members who may not normally work together to address these themes within and beyond the study communities.  As a starting point for engaging with communities over the causes and resolution of ongoing conflictividades, we will work along three lines of enquiry that constitute recurrent sites of ongoing conflict in many formally-defined &apos;post-conflict&apos; settings around the world. These are: i) territorial development; ii) provision of basic services; and iii) media. Our approach will engage the three study communities in iterative processes of reflection and dialogue around these three issues, mapping lived experiences of everyday conflict and building from those insights towards prompting inter- and intra- community dialogue. Local capacities for reconciliation will be harnessed and augmented in the process. As a result of these lines of enquiry, the project has particular relevance for three areas of the Colombian Peace Agreement: comprehensive rural reform (point 1), political participation: democratic opening to peacebuilding (point 2), and victims (point 5).  Methodologically, the project will deploy a range of participatory approaches (including participatory video and photo projects, and participatory media analysis) alongside more conventional social science techniques, such as focus groups and key informant interviews. The project will consequently combine innovative ways of community involvement in research with proven and rigorous academic methods.  This project brings together a partnership of scholars from the University of Sheffield (UK) and Pontificia Universidad Javeriana (Colombia) with CINEP, the leading Colombian organization on issues of peace and development. These three organisations have been developing a partnership over a significant period of time, culminating in the co-design of this project. Equally important are the strong relationships with the local partner organisations in the three communities in which the project will be carried out. Through co-production with the communities themselves, the project aims to generate important capacity-building gains for them to move towards a stable and lasting daily peace, and at the same time to contribute to the generation of new academic knowledge.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="The project has four overarching objectives:   1) To explore and understand the ongoing conflictividades that represent a disconnect between the formal peace process and daily lived experiences within the three study communities;  2 To utilise participatory methodologies to harness and strengthen local capacities for reconciliation by co-producing opportunities and interventions to facilitate &apos;improbable dialogues&apos;; 3) To use this process to co-produce a &apos;toolkit&apos; to provide local, regional and national actors with a set of actions and methodologies that may help promote the consolidation of peace in other settings; 4) To work with communities to co-produce new academic knowledge that contributes to the understanding of Colombia specifically and conflict resolution more generally, including through identifying the limitations of existing research on peace and conflict, seeking new alternatives and possibilities from participatory empirical work.  The project will operationalise these aims along three lines of enquiry (territorial development; provision of basic services; media), utilising a phased and iterative research design that allows us to work with communities to:  a) Map conflictividades around territory, service provision and media, as well as capture conflicts that do not relate to these themes; b) Prompt improbable dialogues around the particular conflictividades that are prioritised by our partners and participants in the three local communities; c) Identify and exploit opportunities to apply these approaches to other communities in Colombia either directly (e.g. through follow-on projects) or through knowledge sharing with other organisations; d) Generate academic outputs relating to the empirical cases and lines of enquiry being explored as well as the methods and approaches being utilised in this project (see &apos;Academic Beneficiaries&apos;, below)."></capital-spend>
