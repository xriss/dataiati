   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Community violence and adolescent mental health in Brazil</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In Brazil, child and adolescent mental health problems account for a substantial proportion of its burden of disease. Brazil also has strikingly high levels of community violence, both when compared to high-income countries and to other Latin American low- and middle-income countries, and is home to some of the most violent cities in the world. There is evidence that exposure to community violence is associated with high levels of mental health problems in high-income countries, especially among adolescents. However, very little research exists in Brazil on this and few policies or interventions are in place to specifically manage, reduce, and prevent the resulting mental illness burden.   This project aims to establish a UK-Brazil research network on community violence and mental health, to produce evidence on this under-researched topic of primary importance to LMICs generally, and LMICs in Latin America in particular, and lay the groundwork for future collaborative research. Our long-term goal is to reduce the burden of mental health problems associated with exposure to community violence among adolescents living in Brazil.  The projects will tackle four research activities: 1. Through secondary analysis of two existing longitudinal studies, from Pelotas in the south of Brazil, and Salvador in the northeast of Brazil, we will investigate the association between exposure to different types of community violence and depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and conduct problems among adolescents. 2. We will assess the feasibility of investigating the effect on mental health of violence-reduction policies in Brazil through data linkage of national routine datasets on community violence, mental health, and social policies. 3. We will develop new tools through pilot data collection. We will assess the validity of the International Trauma Questionnaire, a new tool for ICD-11 PTSD and complex PTSD diagnosis, and conduct qualitative work to refine a measure of community violence in Brazil. Primary data will be collected in the State of Sao Paulo, Brazil, in Embu, a violent municipality in the outskirts of Sao Paulo city, and a middle-sized city, Araraquara.  4. The organisation of a workshop in Brazil bringing together Brazilian and UK researchers, governmental officials, NGOs and local stakeholders in order to draft a consensus statement on the policies and interventions necessary to manage, prevent and diminish the mental health consequences of exposure to community violence among adolescents in LMICs. Furthermore, the workshop will represent an opportunity to draft a statement on the research priorities in the field, with a particular attention being paid to the cognitive, emotional-processing and neurological mechanisms underlying the association between violence and mental health.   This funding will represent an opportunity to bring Brazilian and UK researchers from different disciplines together in an &quot;International Community Violence and Mental Health Research Hub&quot;, with the common aim of tackling a public health priority for the Brazilian population. The findings will fill an important gap in the literature concerning the impact of exposure to community violence and the development of mental health problems in adolescents, the event-specific consequences of community violence on mental health, as well as enabling the future investigation of the potential effectiveness of different policies to reduce adolescent mental health problems. Furthermore, findings will provide the basis for informed discussions on the future research agenda and policies on community violence and mental health, a major public health priority for the Brazilian population.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Our long-term vision is to reduce the burden of mental health problems associated with exposure to community violence among adolescents living in Brazil. The current project will contribute to this long-term objective by producing innovative research outputs, achieving important policy impact, and creating the conditions for sustainable global mental health research with our LMICs partners. The project is organized in four vignettes - i.e. activities - with the following objectives:    1.  Evaluating the longitudinal contribution of community violence to mental health. Drawing on existing longitudinal datasets, we will provide a comprehensive picture of the contribution of different types of community violence to the development of depression in Brazil. In preparation of our long-term goal of providing a full picture of the mental health consequences of community violence, we will also investigate the role of community violence in the development of PTSD and conduct problems.   2. Evaluating the impact of national policies through data linkage. We aim to produce a proof of concept that will demonstrate the feasibility of linking national routine datasets (e.g. on income transfer, crime) with large surveys of adolescent mental health. This will represent a tremendous opportunity to address questions of immediate relevance concerning the impact of existing violence-related policies on mental health.  3. Tool validation in LMICs. We will validate the International Trauma Questionnaire (ITQ), a diagnostic instrument for ICD-11 PTSD and complex PTSD, among adolescents exposed to community violence; we will adapt a measure of community violence and check its validity through quantitative and qualitative work among adolescent living in S&#xE3;o Paulo.    4. Impact on policy and research agendas. We will create a consensus policy document on community violence and mental health and set an ambitious agenda for future research/applications. To this end, we will set up an International Community Violence and Mental Health Research Hub that will integrate UCL, LSHTM and Brazilian collaborators. A workshop organized in Brazil will materialise the hub and delineate policy and research agendas.  Our objectives are both ambitious and achievable during the course of the grant, as we rely on our extensive network of partners and existing collaborations that the project will contribute to further extend. In addition to the direct benefits resulting from achieving these objectives, the project will contribute in the following ways, in line with the MRC Confidence in Global Mental Health call&apos;s priorities: (i) Improving the understanding of the epidemiology and the aetiology of mental health problems in relation to community violence in LMICs. (ii) Refining standardised instruments, methods and outcome measures for mental health research in Brazil. (iii) Paving the way for future work aiming to systematically assess the association between exposure to community violence and mental health problems among adolescents, and to examine the cognitive, emotional-processing and neurological mechanisms underpinning this association.   (iv) Strengthening and fostering a sustainable inter-disciplinary UK-Brazil global mental health research network, bringing together world experts in clinical psychology, psychiatry, neuroscience, global child/adolescent health, epidemiology, and violence studies and non-profit research institutions through co-ownership and joint management of research.  (v) Fostering the interest of both established and early career researchers, at UCL and LSHTM, to conduct research relevant to global mental health by extending their work to LMICs.</narrative>
