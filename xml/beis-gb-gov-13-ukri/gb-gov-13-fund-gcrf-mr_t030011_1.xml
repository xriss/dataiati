   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Effect of urban vs rural context on effectiveness of a community intervention to prevent diarrhoea and stunting in young children in Mali</narrative>

  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Aim: To investigate the effect of a multi-component intervention to improve food-safety and child feeding on child health outcomes, and examine the effect of context on the health outcomes and causal mechanisms linking intervention to outcome.  Objectives: Further develop and test a complex, contextualised, community intervention to improve complementary-feeding (CF) and food safety/hygiene behaviours and to achieve the following: 1. Investigate whether the intervention can improve health outcomes # in infants ages 6-24 months (primary outcome is observed diarrhoea ##) 2. Investigate urban/rural contextual influences* on the intervention effects on health outcomes and explore the effect of other contextual variable on outcome 3. Explore the effect of intervention on mediating variables in the causal pathways that link the intervention to health outcomes (eg change in social outcomes, feeding practices, food contamination, and pathogens in stool) 4. Explore urban/rural and other contextual influences* on the intervention effects on the mediating variables in the causal pathways that link intervention to health outcomes 5. Investigate the social mechanisms of the intervention, and how they interact with contextual factors to influence health or other outcomes 6. Build capacity in the Mali and UK partners, create a strong partnership between the Mali, UK (including Water Aid) and other partners (Bangladesh, Gambia and advisory bodies such as WHO, UNICEF and WAHO), that builds skills in testing, developing and realising impact from this community intervention to improve infant health outcomes in Mali and beyond.  Null hypothesis: The intervention will not cause any improvement on the rate of observed diarrhoea in children 6-24 months in Mali (measured 15 months after intervention) and that there will not be a significant interaction between the intervention and place of residence (urban/rural).  For other health and non-health mediating outcomes in the causal pathways to diarrhoea (listed below) we have 90% power to examine a 25% difference between the arms. There is power in the sample size to also investigate the effect on these outcomes by the context of urban and rural separately.   Health outcomes assessed at 15months: - PRIMARY OUTCOME: Observed/photographed diarrhoea stool (based on Infant form stool scale)44 plus reported 3 watery stools in the past 24-hour  - 7-day reported diarrhoea  - measured growth and anthropometry (stunting, height/age, weight/age, weight/height)  - Child development (ASQ3 score)45   Mediating/explanatory outcomes  1. Microbiology - 15 common stool pathogens48 - Two stool inflammatory markers (calprotectin and lactoferrin) - Presence of E Coli in complementary-food and child&apos;s water tested for  2. Behaviour - Observed food safety and hygiene behaviours of mother - Observed and reported breastfeeding practices - Reported 48hr complementary food diversity and adequacy - Observed exposure of child to ground in the yard unsupervised and mouthing during play 3. Environment - Observed availability of used soap in the kitchen and latrine 4. Social - Women&apos;s Autonomy Measure51 as a measure of empowerment - Rate of community member and mother participation in the campaign activities - Reporting of intervention as a source of knowledge in an unprompted survey question  *Other context examined quantitatively (other than urban and rural) include both community (e.g. size of community, community social networks, and availability of health services in the community) and household/mother context (e.g. female autonomy, education, socio-economic status, parity, women&apos;s work, use of external childcare).</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Problem Globally 1.7 billion diarrhoea episodes result in approximately 2 million deaths in 2010.1 Regionally, Africa has the greatest burden. Alongside poor infant feeding, diarrhoea diseases also contribute to infant malnutrition.2-4 Despite new vaccines, treatments and public health measures,3 diarrhoea and malnutrition remain considerable public health problems in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). The period when a child starts eating solids (usually 6-24 months called complementary food (CF)), is associated with the highest rates of diarrhoea: over 50% of all diarrhoea deaths occur at 6-11 months.1 Most low-income households in LMIC cook ingredients at home or obtain food from informal street food-sellers who prepare the goods in their homes. Therefore home food handling, preparation and storage determine the scale of food contamination.  Although many studies explore the effects of improved water supply, hygiene and nutrition of infant diets on infant diarrhoea and growth development, much less attention paid to studies of food safety remain scarce. Research in this area has been too general to reduce diarrhoea through food contamination. The World Health Organisation (WHO) advocates targeted interventions to support CF safety and hygiene. Ideally CF safety needs to be accompanied with achieving optimal dietary intake for young children, which also remains a challenge in LMIC. Research shows that infant health and safety advice has limited impact on behaviour change unless accompanied by means to motivate and empower mothers in the community. Yet previous interventions targeting diet or diarrhoea have seldom drawn on cultural dramatic arts and community assets to motivate behaviour change. African communities have a particularly strong cultural heritage to underpin such potential impact.  Our Aim We propose a low-cost, scalable, and adaptable community intervention to reduce diarrhoea and improve the growth of young children in urban-poor and rural Mali. We will assess the effects in both settings, to inform replication and scaling of the intervention, because the dynamics of community life vary in each.  Our Previous Work We combine two complementary interventions shown to be effective elsewhere in LMIC. A trial in the Gambia (developed through former work in Bangladesh, Nepal and Pakistan) evaluated efforts to improve hygiene and safety of CF, while a trial in Kenya evaluated a community programme to improve breastfeeding and weaning food content.  Our Plan After adaptation with communities, our intervention will empower local families to implement behaviour change. It will include campaign-like activities such as culturally relevant dramatic arts (drama, songs, stories), public meetings, certifications, and home visits, delivered by a small team: 5 days of community campaign visits dispersed during 35 days and including home visits by trained female volunteers, plus a reminder campaign day at 9 months. We will allocate 120 urban and rural sites in Mali by chance to receive the intervention, or not, and assess 27 households in each site after 15 months.   The study is designed to quantify the influence of urban vs rural context, and to examine other societal influences (e.g. household poverty, women&apos;s work, and education, etc). Using observations, interviews, discussion groups, surveys and laboratory tests we will compare the implementation of the intervention in urban-poor and rural settings. Importantly, the intervention is designed to be sustainable through peer-education among mothers and older female volunteers (demonstrated after 32 months in Gambia), thus requiring only small levels of coordination resources from central government.</narrative>
