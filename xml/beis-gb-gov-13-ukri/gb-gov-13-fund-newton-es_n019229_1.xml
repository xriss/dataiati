   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Newton RCUK-CONICYT Governing the educational and labour market trajectories of secondary TVET graduates in Chile</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Chile has experienced considerable educational expansion over the past few decades as a result of the growing demand for education from individuals and families and the positional competition for qualified jobs in the formal sector of the economy. While in the past TVET policies were designed to offer educational opportunities for disadvantaged youth seeking a quick insertion in the labour market, today the orientations and the objectives of these policies are less clear given the larger number of secondary TVET graduates that pursue tertiary education and combine education and work in their trajectories after schooling. In this context, TVET continues to be a strategic sector for improving the skills of most disadvantaged youth over their life course but the transitions of these young adults from secondary to tertiary education and from education to work are becoming more problematic due to the high stratification of tertiary education supply, the scarcity of qualified jobs in the economy and the poor coordination of public policies targeting young adults.   The project aims to understand the potentially competing, and possibly ambivalent, orientations and objectives of TVET policies in Chile, their compatibility and contradictions with the aspirations of secondary TVET graduates, and their intended and unintended effects on the educational and labour market trajectories of these young adults. An important contribution of the project is the incorporation of the perspective of young adults (their expectations, aspirations and strategies) into the debate on how TVET policies can better support disadvantaged youth in their transition to work. By doing this, the project aims to contribute to the design of TVET policies that better accommodate the demands and needs of vulnerable young populations in changing labour markets and societies, which emphasize the relevance of this kind of research in this particular moment in transitional economies like Chile.   Conceptually, the project is based on three major theoretical perspectives - Cultural Political Economy, Life Course Research and Governance Perspective. The combination of these different systems of thought matches the topic&apos;s broad variety of dimensions. The proposed project brings together different disciplinary social scientific approaches, which aim at conceptualising the research questions in adequate ways due to its complexity; further, its drawing from theories and methods from Education Science, Sociology and Political Science purports addressing methodological issues related to the complex dynamics of policy-making by means of an interdisciplinary perspective.   In order to achieve its aims, the study is designed as a multilevel qualitative research at national, local and individual level. At the national level, we will map TVET policies and programs, will review policy regulations, and will interview national policy makers and stakeholders. At the local level, we will conduct case studies that will involve interviews with local authorities, TVET schools, and others. Finally, at the individual level, we will carry out interviews with a typological sample of secondary TVET graduates with different educational and labour market trajectories.  This project expects to expand the research evidence on TVET policies in Chile and their implications for the trajectories of TVET graduates after school. We expect that the evidence produced for the case of Chile will contribute to the debates on how TVET can improve the living conditions and labour market opportunities of disadvantaged youth in middle-income and low-income countries, what is a priority for many development agencies today.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project aims to understand the potentially competing, and possibly ambivalent, orientations and objectives of TVET policies in Chile, their compatibility and contradictions with the aspirations of secondary TVET graduates, and their intended and unintended effects on the educational and labour market trajectories of these young adults. Against this background, the project is structured around three objectives at the same level of importance:  - To investigate the relationship and complementarity of TVET policies in terms of orientations and objectives to their specific target groups; this includes elucidating the educational, economic and social goals and functions attributed to TVET, interpreting the specific meanings of the target group &apos;young adults&apos; put forward by TVET policies, and analysing their potential implications and intended and unintended effects on young adult life courses.  In order to achieve this objective, the project will review and map TVET programmes and policies in Chile; analyse the content of policy documents, regulations and media debates; and interview relevant international and national policy actors in different areas of government and beyond government that have been involved in TVET policymaking.  - To enquire, from the perspective of TVET graduates, into policies&apos; fit and potentials for successfully appreciating and exploiting the hidden resources of young adults for building life projects; this includes enquiring into the compatibility of TVET policies with personal interests and orientations, thus gauging the possibility of individuals to create subjective meaning and continuity.   In order to reach this objective, the project will conduct qualitative research through interviews and focus groups with TVET graduates to assess their perceptions of social expectations underlying policies and initiatives; their aspirations, expectations and life projects; the value they attribute to education and work in their career choices; how they perceive the opportunities available to them and what cultural resources they mobilise in their educational and labour market trajectories.  - To examine TVET policies in their embedding and interaction in the regional economy, the labour market and individual life projects of young adults in order to identify best practices and patterns of coordinating policymaking at local/regional level; this includes identifying regional and local policymaking networks related to skills formation and utilisation, with particular attention to actors, dynamics, trends, (mis)matches and redundancies.  To fulfil this objective, the study will conduct regional/local case studies in three distinct representative regions/localities through qualitative interviews with local policymakers, school leaders, tutors, trainers, tertiary education providers, employers, unions and local chambers of commerce. It is expected that the study of these networks will make possible to identify best practice initiatives and programmes, and define parameters necessary for coordinated policymaking involving the diverse partners and for creating synergic effects in terms of coherence/integration of specific training or educational programs with broader social interventions for so called &apos;vulnerable&apos; groups.</narrative>
