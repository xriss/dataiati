   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Women&apos;s empowerment and child health: exploring the impact of Rojiroti Microfinance in poor communities in Bihar, Northern India</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Every year, 2.2 million children die of malnutrition. Many more feel the effects of malnutrition on their health and intellect. Programmes to combat malnutrition include: distributing food directly; giving children micronutrients; giving nutritional advice; and protecting malnourished children through immunisation. Research by the World Health Organisation (WHO) has shown that these strategies can lead to better nourished children. However, these approaches may fail to reach those most in need (those living in extreme poverty). In very poor countries, where men are dominant, women are often prevented from making important family decisions and this may be linked to poor nutrition in their children. We are a group of community workers, economists, social scientists and doctors. Our partners are the Centre for Promoting Sustainable Livelihood (CPSL) - which is a non-governmental organisation in India; a UK charity (Rojiroti UK); the School of Sociology &amp; Social Policy; and the School of Medicine (both at the University of Nottingham). Our team have experience of helping very poor people in rural areas of India to fight poverty. Our community workers encourage people in poor hamlets or &quot;tolas&quot; in Northern India to form self help groups (SHGs). Most SHGs are formed by women. They are asked to save a little money regularly, initially Rs2.5 (3 pence) per week. If they save regularly, their savings entitle them to a loan. These loans start small - Rs50 (50 pence). Women in the group can receive external loans (from CPSL) of Rs500 (&#xA3;5) after 3 months and Rs3,000 (&#xA3;30) after 6 months (if credit is good). Loans may be used for emergencies (eg medical expenses); to allow women access existing government support schemes (eg money to travel to subsidised food shops); or to invest in livestock or agricultural equipment. Using these loans helps women avoid local money lenders (who charge much higher interest) and avoid emergency sales of their property (at knock down prices). We call this programme Rojiroti (which translates as &quot;daily bread&quot;).   We have recently completed a trial which tested whether Rojiroti improves children&apos;s health. This was a &quot;cluster randomised trial&quot; where 28 tolas (small village communities) were chosen at random to receive Rojiroti immediately and 28 to get the programme only after 18 months (control group). At the end of the first 18 months (before the control group started) we weighed and measured all the children under 5 in both sets of tolas. We found that the nutritional measures were better in the Rojiroti group. The effect was big enough to be important in practice and was unlikely to have arisen by chance. Overall 1326 mothers and 2064 children took part.  We now want to understand how Rojiroti improved children&apos;s nutrition. We also want to know if the scheme helps empower women (improve their status in society and their freedom to make decisions). We have already collected economic data such as whether loans were emergency or general loans, the amount borrowed, the purpose of the loan, whether the loan was repaid. We will carefully check and collate these data. We will also conduct 20 in-depth interviews with women who took part in the Rojiroti trial and around 10 interviews with CPSL volunteers. These interviews will be conducted by an ethnographer (someone who studies different cultures) who will visit Bihar for one month. We will analyse these interviews carefully. The voices of the participants and volunteers, combined with the economic data will allow us to work out what are the essential features of Rojiroti which allow the scheme to benefit children. We will also see whether Rojiroti helps empower women. We hope this will allow others to use Rojiroti in other parts of the work where there is poverty and malnutrition and where women do not get to make important decisions about their lives.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project will build on our prior quantitative research, conducted in Bihar, Northern India. We have previously conducted a cluster randomised controlled trial which investigated the effects of Rojiroti (&quot;daily bread&quot;) microfinance loans on child nutrition. Participants were poor, marginalised women taking part in self-help groups (SHGs) in tolas (small village communities) in Bihar. This State has a population of 116 million and is one of the poorest and most deprived states in India. Rojiroti is a self-help loan scheme, implemented by poor women living in disempowered conditions. In our cluster randomised trial of Rojiroti microfinance the outcomes were the nutritional state of children under five years in the intervention tolas vs. controls after 18 months. [See Arch Dis Child 2017;102:(suppl.1)A3 and ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01845545]. The primary outcome was weight for height Z score (WHZ). Secondary outcomes were weight for age Z score (WAZ), mid upper arm circumference (MUAC), % wasted and % underweight. We analysed data on 56 tolas (1326 women &amp; 2064 children). We demonstrated that, after 18 months of Rojiroti microfinance, children in the intervention tolas were significantly better nourished than those in control tolas, for each outcome measure. Mean WHZ was significantly better in the intervention group (-1.02) vs. control (-1.37; regression coefficient adjusted for clustering beta=0.38, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.61, p=0.001). Significantly fewer children were wasted in the intervention group (122, 18.1%) vs. control (200, 28.5%; odds ratio=0.46, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.74, p=0.002). This was true of children whether or not their mothers were SHG members. The effect was not seen with other microfinance schemes operating in Bihar.  Whilst yielding vital original nutritional data on the impacts that microfinance loans can have on families living in extreme poverty in Bihar, the research also opened important, under-researched questions about the social mechanisms behind such impacts. There are urgent sociological questions about how wealth is a determinant of health in this context, especially since the sums were modest in relation to the health improvements observed. There is a suggestion that, in relation to the nature of the Rojiroti scheme and its self-help method of intervention, the money itself might have implications and value in the form of other currencies, e.g. power, control, agency, independence, mobility and so on. These are nuanced and often intangible factors that require in-depth, face-to-face qualitative exploration. This research will therefore constitute an interdisciplinary and exploratory development of our understanding of the relationships between economic and social empowerment of women living in poor countries, and the health of their children.  Drawing on mixed qualitative methods, including interviews and focus groups carried out in Bihar during a 4-week period in January 2018, the research will ask:   In which ways were loan monies spent by recipients?  How do mothers perceive and measure the impacts of the loans? How do they account for the improved growth rates of the children? Did the loan improve women&apos;s mobility and agency? Did it enable a sense of empowerment? Were there problems associated with accepting the loan? Did it create any tensions within families?  Bott will spend four weeks visiting communities in Bihar where Rojiroti interventions occur (accompanied by Ojha for an initial one-week period for introduction and orientation purposes) and will conduct 10-20 interviews with women who are mothers and were loan recipients and additional interviews with CPSL volunteers. She will organise 2-4 focus group sessions with the women to explore emergent themes. This data will be transcribed and analysed, and used to inform around four publications. The data will be used to inform future collaborative work with local stakeholders such as the A. N. Sinha Institute in Bihar.</narrative>
