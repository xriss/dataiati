  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">A systems approach is needed to address the so far intractable global challenge of malnutrition leading to chronic diseases in all but the poorest countries in the world. The governments of the Caribbean Community have recognised the challenge of high obesity and chronic disease rates in their social and economic development and committed to policy solutions that improve local healthy food production and consumption. We are building on GCRF feasibility research undertaken by historians and health researchers to understand the evolution of Jamaica&apos;s foodscapes from 1945 to the present, as these have been shaped by profound historical and social changes to family and work life and local and global food systems over the past century. From this work, we identified together with stakeholders that there is an urgent need to develop cross-disciplinary networks and methods that make more systematic and innovative use of existing data sources that can significantly inform policy action. Data describing food systems - from food pricing, consumption patterns, import rates, land usage to disease trends - are inherently relational and transdisciplinary, and require researchers to cross disciplinary and sectoral boundaries to inform evidence-based policy. However, data sources in LMICs are often under-used, overlooked, fragmented and unlinked. In this proposed project we ask how transdisciplinary socio-historical data can be systematically assembled to understand the temporal complexity of Caribbean food systems. We will convene a Symposium on Transdiciplinary Data Assemblage at the University of Exeter to learn from leading international scholars who work in this and related fields such as Big Data and systems thinking and grapple with similar questions. Early Career Researchers at Exeter and the University of the West Indies will then collaborate to develop processes to systematically identify, appraise and assemble meaningful data sources for the historical evolution of Jamaica&apos;s food system from the Second World War to today. This will be made available to a range of national, regional and international stakeholders from research, policy and practice as an online &quot;data assemblage index&quot; that signposts and explains meaningful data linkages or assemblages and their uses. The usefulness of our method of transdisciplinary assemblages will finally be tested together with critical stakeholders by using the index to co-design worked examples and strategies such as building a business case for communal, edible gardens. We propose that we need to harness this historical perspective to inform policy and practice strategies for better future nutrition and health that are embedded in and meaningful to local communities.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Research questions How can transdisciplinary socio-historical data be systematically assembled to understand the temporal complexity of Caribbean food systems, and how can we harness this historical perspective to inform policy and practice strategies for better nutrition and health?  Objectives 1) To develop a network of international and interdisciplinary scholars across relevant disciplines who use historically-informed data from a variety of untapped datasets to understand contemporary food systems challenges in LMIC regions;   2) To co-develop methods and build capacity (initially in the Caribbean region) for mixed-method, transdisciplinary data assemblage to make better use of existing data and take data out of their disciplinary silos; 3) To co-design with stakeholders a strategy toolbox with worked examples of using historical data assemblages to map food systems to inform policy and practice in the Caribbean region and beyond.</narrative>
