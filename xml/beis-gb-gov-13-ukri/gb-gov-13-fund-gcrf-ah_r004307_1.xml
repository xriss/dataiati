   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The aim of this network proposal is to raise awareness within the communities of Southern Africa of the value of their cultural heritage and provide insights into how these may be expressed through inclusive crafts, leading to sustainable economic development.  Tourism supports one in every 12 jobs in South Africa. It has been recognised that diversification is required in the tourist industry. The rich and varied culture of the Southern African region has been identified as a social resource that is both sustainable and brings a different experience to the tourists visiting the Region.  Researchers, commentators and Government offices from Botswana, Zimbabwe and South Africa have all expressed similar aspirations for the development of cultural and heritage tourism.   However, many countries in Southern Africa are still supported by overseas economic aid to offset need in the poorest communities. Within these poorest of communities, those living with a physical or cognitive impairment are often the most vulnerable. In collaboration with the Southern Africa Federation of the Disabled (SAFOD) the proposed network will lay the foundations of a bridge between communities and people living with disability within those communities; and, enable dialogue and exchange of knowledge, through culture and heritage, expressed as artefacts. Initially, this exchange will be between five Countries in Southern Africa and the UK.   This first phase of network-building is working towards addresses the United Nations (UN) Sustainable development challenge goals to end poverty, Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all and promote inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all.  The proposed network and associated research is aligned with the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development&apos;s compliance statement point (i) of &quot;promoting economic growth and welfare of developing countries&quot;. All of the five SAFOD representatives are recipient countries on the DAC list.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="OBJECTIVES of the Network proposal are to:  - ENABLE discussion and dialogue about heritage and culture between local communities and disability support groups in Southern Africa and their UK counterparts; - SUPPORT the people living with disability within local communities in SA to voice their needs and aspirations; - HIGHLIGHT and raise awareness of cultural identity, heritage and sense of place as an asset and resource for sustainable economic growth; and, - DEVELOP a pathway to social inclusion and sustainable economic development, based around inclusive arts and crafts.  The outcomes of this Research Network will provide insights for individuals living with disability and their wider community members highlighting a pathway to sustainable economic development utilising their cultural and heritage as part of an inclusive approach to artefact production.  Expression of heritage and culture through inclusive arts and crafts design: empowering people living with disability to contribute to their community in Southern Africa.  To collaborate on knowledge exchange and gaining more insights into the needs of people living with impairment and disability to enable them to contribute to their community through the production of art and craft artefacts.   This first network phase will be about building connections between those involved in inclusive crafts development within SAFOD and their counterparts in the UK in relation to best practice for inclusive crafts. The Global Disability Innovation Hub will assist in the dissemination of knowledge about the culture and heritage of communities in Southern Africa (SA) and begin a dialogue with disability groups and crafts people in the UK and SA about pathways to enable inclusive crafts to flourish in SA communities."></capital-spend>
