   <narrative xml:lang="EN">A crisis of governance which has emerged as a result of the extreme centralization of power, weak institutions and failure to institutionalise the responsible use of power is a key challenge in the Horn of Africa region. This research project will investigate the promises and pitfalls of federalism and devolution in the respective countries with a view to proposing concrete policy alternatives. The project will examine the institutional design mechanisms that help address the crisis of governance in the region and ensure unity but at the same also provide political space for sub-state elements. It will analyse the impact of devolution and federalism in a context of weak institutions and proposes areas for reform that assist in strengthening institutions and facilitate the process of devolution and federalism.  Addressing the crisis of governance through federalism, devolution and inclusive political institutions as well as ensuring the institutionalization of power through strengthening the rule of law has the potential to make the government more accountable and able to deliver critical services. Such systems ensure relative stability and peace and reduce the risks of state fragmentation. Key research questions target the countries in the Horn of Africa region (Ethiopia, South Africa, South Sudan, Somalia), and the research will draw relevant lessons from countries in Africa (such as South Africa) and Europe (UK). Key experts from partner institutions have been chosen for their key skills and research excellence in this area, as well as their ability to address the research themes and engage with key leaders, political actors, civil society groups, women, members of parliament and other sections of society in each country. During the course of the research and while conducting the primary data through focus groups, key stake holder consultations and roundtables, gender equality will be ensured by all researchers. During the process of research key experts will engage with major stake holders in each country in four high level round tables and dialogues with political party leaders, academics, youth, women and civil society to gather relevant data on the state of governance. Based on the research outputs and existing knowledge, three rounds of short trainings (105 trainees in total) will be provided to relevant stake holders (parliaments, leaders, political parties, civil society groups, youth, women) in each country to disseminate the findings and create impact on actors and institutions. Four Policy briefs from each research theme will be prepared to guide the direction of reform in the system of governance in each country. Dialogue among leaders, political parties and civil society groups in each country will be the means to get policy buy in. Key experts will be commissioned to deliver key notes and summary of the policy briefs during training and seminar events. The final outputs and policy briefs will be shared in a regional seminar and dialogue where major stake holders will attend and engage by way of dialogue in the outputs.  Four journal articles will be published in reputable journals (Regional and Federal Studies, Journal of Gender Studies, African Affairs, International Journal of Constitutional Law). An edited book with all the contributions will be published towards the end of the project.  Improved knowledge on inclusive governance system, built capacity of major stake holders and actors on inclusive governance modalities ensures peace, stability and enhances service delivery- a major problem in the Horn of Africa As part of building the capacity of the CoE and strengthening linkages with and cooperation between the CoE and partner institutions, professors from partner institutions will be hosted as visiting scholars to provide lectures and seminars in the CoE in Good Governance. There will be joint research including research exchanges, lectures and short term trainings.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Objectives A crisis of governance which has emerged as a result of the extreme centralization of power, weak institutions and failure to institutionalize the responsible use of power is a key challenge in the Horn of Africa region. This crisis impacts many facets of life in these countries - including access to justice, health care and education provision and attempts to tackle poverty - ultimately affecting the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG&apos;s). This project, undertaken as a hub and spoke model, will tackle SDG 16 - &quot;Peace, justice and strong institutions&quot; - which is widely seen as a cornerstone goal on which the success of the other 16 goals rests, and it is key to achieving the overall Agenda 2030 objective of leaving no one behind. This project builds on existing GCRF investments in the areas of democratisation and governance and will bring cross-regional experience to bear on questions of institution-building and -strengthening in the Horn of Africa (including Somalia, South Sudan and Ethiopia,).  The project aims to address the crisis of governance through federalism, devolution and inclusive political institutions as well as ensuring the institutionalization of power through strengthening the rule of law that has the potential to make the government more accountable and able to deliver critical services. Such systems ensure relative stability, peace and reduce the risks of state fragmentation - a major concern in the region. Inclusive political systems lead to a more just political and economic order and thus reduce tension and conflict. Designing and strengthening inclusive political institutions that take the form of federalism and devolution assists in bringing in more actors at various levels of government (national, sub-national constituent unit and local). One of the major themes of this project is to investigate the types of institutional design that fits the context in each of the countries in the region. second major theme addresses the interface between federalism, devolution and the challenges of institutionalization of power. The project also addresses whether federalism and devolved systems enhance or limit the role and participation of women in governance.   As part of building the capacity of the CoE and strengthening linkages with and cooperation between the CoE and partner institutions, professors from partner institutions will be hosted as visiting scholars to provide lectures and seminars on the MA and PhD programmes of the CoE in Good Governance. There will be four joint PhD research projects that will be co supervised by senior staff from the CoE and the partner institutions that ensures high quality research geared towards addressing the research sub-themes. There will be research exchange schemes for staff and PhD candidates in the form of fellowships to be spent at the partner institutions in the first two years of the project, in which the students receive training on research methods, and on comparative institutional design from partner organisations. These initiatives will ensure that the cooperation between the partner institutions and Ethiopian partners is meaningful, equitable and sustained, and focuses on mutual learning and capacity-building. This project builds on and strengthens the existing relationship between the CoE and the partner institutions and will be the basis for further future research collaboration on governance and democracy in East Africa. Finally, the project aims to produce high quality, research-based policy inputs and provide three rounds of short term training for those who are in charge of making decisions (public institutions, leaders, political parties, practitioners, future leaders and civil society groups). Through capacity building and dialogue with stake holders, it disseminates the research out puts</narrative>
