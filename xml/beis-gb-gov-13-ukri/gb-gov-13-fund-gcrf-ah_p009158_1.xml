   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Restricted Access Pilot Project: Interdisciplinary perspectives on clean energy production and landscape conservation in North Patagonia</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The aim of the project is to undertake pilot research to show the interconnections between the histories of alternate energy production, the history of national parks and other gazetted areas, and broader histories of landscape degradation within the study area and to explore the broader applications of this framework to clean energy production and conservation through the development of a larger international collaborative network. It will do this by undertaking four main activities:   1. The construction of a comprehensive database and research baseline that involves data exploration and the consolidation of archival resources on the history of nuclear and hydroelectric power generation in the region; the history of conservation and landscape management in the region; contemporary clean energy and biodiversity conservation policies within the region and internationally; and GCRF and other possible funding frameworks for the development of a larger interdisciplinary proposal;    2. An exploratory fieldwork/survey phase in order to identify other sites of relevance to this framework and theme within the case study area;   3. The organization of a collaborative workshop in Bariloche (Argentina) with Chilean and Argentine colleagues and select PhD students in order to explore comparative research frameworks of sites and enable capacity-building activities on research methodologies. This will include partners from the Universidad del Comahue (Argentina) who are currently finalizing the Site Management Plan for Isla Huemul and have expressed interest in incorporating our data and interpretation, but also develop and co-create a better understanding of the methods and frameworks that are appropriate to assess sites of this complexity;  4. The organization of a small experimental &apos;pop-up&apos; exhibition (drawing on the exhibitionary experiments that form part of the collaborative working methods of the Heritage Futures project) at the Instituto Balseiro, with the aim to engage the local scientific community not only with the legacies of their work but also with the development of future collaborative research which considers the possible negative landscape effects of what are otherwise ostensibly &apos;clean&apos; and sustainable energy initiatives.  As the incoming AHRC Priority Area Leadership Fellow in Heritage the PI (Harrison) will also aim to use this project to develop connections with research communities and heritage partner organisations in Latin America to support the AHRC&apos;s development of international collaborations in the Global South which are directly relevant to the AHRC&apos;s Heritage Priority Area Strategy and which could be further developed through subsequent leadership and research activities in future years.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This pilot project explores the ways in which the designation of certain forms of conservation landscape (for example national parks and other forms of protected areas) facilitate specific forms of environmentally damaging &quot;non-conservation&quot; activities outside of their borders. This invites a radical rethinking of conservation histories. We suggest that conservation landscapes cannot be studied without looking at the broader landscape management effects-the &quot;salvation&quot; of certain designated areas and the &quot;sacrifice&quot; this facilitates of others. We cannot understand the gazettal of protected buildings or landscapes without looking beyond the gazetted structure or reserved area to consider the negative actions which such conservation activity permits. Conservation landscapes are themselves often related to attempts by the state to restrict or control access-like the landscapes associated with nuclear power generation or nuclear waste disposal, national parks and other conservation areas are also landscapes of exclusion (Galison 2015). The project will explore these issues through a focus on the archaeological and heritage landscapes associated with the failed quest for nuclear fusion on Isla Humuel within Nahuel Huapi National Park near Bariloche in Argentina, and the ways in which this project facilitated the subsequent establishment of a working nuclear reactor and atomic research institute in the same town and park, and other geographically associated attempts to develop alternative energy sources in the form of hydroelectric power schemes, alongside their broader affects on the landscape. This pilot study will form the focus for the establishment of a transnational, interdisciplinary working group in preparation for the development of a broader project which will explore the relationship between conservation landscapes, statecraft, practices of power and relationships between &quot;waste&quot; and &quot;wilderness&quot; across Chile and Argentina in the Northern Patagonian region. The transnational North Patagonian Andean region is an area which has long been politically contested and in which the gazettal of the earliest national parks signals attempts to utilise protected areas to demark and impose sovereignty by both the Argentinean and Chilean states, and also an area that shares the paradoxical legacies of natural protection and the search for sustainable forms of energy extraction that invariably disrupt the natural environment. Over the past century this region has seen major changes in regional economies (in particular the shift from forestry to tourism), attempts to develop alternative forms of non-coal based power generation (including the development of both nuclear and hydroelectric power stations both within and immediately adjacent to conservation areas), changes in public policies (in particular relating to conservation and environmental protection of the Andean environment) and the creation of national parks (through the geographically mirrored parks of Nahuel Huapi in Argentina and Perez Rosales in Chile, located on each side of the Patagonian Andes). This makes it an ideal location in which to explore the past, present and futures of whole of landscape approaches to conservation and clean energy production. We aim to assemble an interdisciplinary, transnational network which would eventually enable us to consider how these historical and contemporary tensions might be considered collectively in the development of new policies and practices in clean energy production in the region.</narrative>
