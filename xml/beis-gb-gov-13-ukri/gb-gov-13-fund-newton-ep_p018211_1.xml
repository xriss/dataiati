   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project proposes the adoption of micro-bubble aeration technologies as a potential new direction for shrimp aquaculture, for the benefit of shrimp farmers in Malaysia and the government agencies which oversee their industry.  The project seeks to harness efficient new technologies, and help to reduce the cost and environmental impact of shrimp farming to place the industry on a more sustainable footing both economically and environmentally.  Previous studies have indicated that shrimp aquaculture in Malaysia is intensive, but less productive than neighbouring countries including Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam (Thean et al, 2016), which has led to a focus on potential measures to boost productivity, including by improving farm management practices and the deployment of resources (Gazi et al, 2014).  Due to the importance of agriculture to the Malaysian economy (approximately 7.2% of Malaysian GDP in 2010 and contributing 10.9% of total employment), and with the identification of low productivity and quality as a key challenge (MARDI, 2015), this project has the potential to make a significant contribution as a route to improving shrimp farming processes.  The project will address the following research questions:  - What are the detailed characteristics of a micro-bubble aeration system in terms of its operational capabilities? (Off-field test based study) - What is the suitable micro-bubble aeration system and configuration for a nursery pond of shrimp Aquaculture? (Off-field test based study) - What is the energy/power requirement of a micro-bubble aeration system? (Off-field test based study) - What is the effect a micro-bubble aeration system on bio-floc and its circulation? (Off-field test based study) - What is the effect of a micro-bubble aeration system on water quality and shrimp growth? (On-field test) - What is the effect of a micro-bubble aeration system on water effluent? (On-field test)  The outcome  of the project will be disseminated to the Malaysian Ministry of Agriculture and Agro-based Industry, and then to the shrimp industry more broadly.  This dissemination activity will be based on sharing the evidence gathered in the field test in Malaysia, and will include measures of shrimp farming productivity, energy and water use, and effluent reduction, in order to promote the potential of the project outcomes.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="The aim of this project is to reduce the amount of water required for shrimp aquaculture by increasing the production per unit volume of water, and by improving water cleanliness (reducing levels of effluent and the cost of effluent treatment).  An assessment will be made of whether energy requirements reduce as a result.  A workable micro-bubble aeration system will be developed for demonstration in a nursery pond of shrimp aquaculture.  The objectives are:  - To study and to develop a suitable micro-bubble aeration system to be used at the nursery pond; - To carry out a lab-scale test in order to measure the performance of the developed micro-bubble aeration system and the change in dissolved oxygen (DO) levels; - To investigate the effect of the new system on the circulation of solid particles (representing bio-floc); - To evaluate the power/electricity consumption of the developed system; and - To carry out a preliminary field test of the system developed at a nursery pond of shrimp aquaculture in Malaysia.  The hypothesis is that the developed micro-bubble aeration system will have the following affects:   1. Improving or at least maintaining the dissolved oxygen (DO) level in water, as nano/micro scaled bubbles resides for a longer period in water; 2. Improving the living conditions and growth of the juvenile white shrimp; 3. Operating at the same or reduced electricity consumption in comparison to that required by the existing system; and  4. Using bio-floc technology to reduce nitrate and nitrite from the water (bio-floc technology uses microorganisms to convert solid wastes, including faeces, uneaten feed and nutrients (e.g. nitrogen and phosphorus) from aquaculture into nutritional contents, as shrimp consume the microorganisms as a food).  At the end of a 30-day demonstration in the nursery pond in Malaysia, the performance of the system will be measured via the weight of the shrimp, the total energy consumption, and analysis of the change in nitrate, nitrite and total suspended solids (TSS)."></capital-spend>
