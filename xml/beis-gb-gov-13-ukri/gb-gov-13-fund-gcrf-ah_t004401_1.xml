   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Based in the former princely capital of Rampur in north India, Tarana Khan is a local historian and novelist working to preserve her city&apos;s unique heritage linked to food, literature and culture. A former teacher, her motivation is the city&apos;s youth who retain a strong sense of their Rampuri heritage, even as it disappears around them.  Recognizing the urgency, she began collecting oral histories from older residents known for their connections to the &apos;old world&apos;. She also began exploring the famed Rampur Raza Library, with its rich and sizeable collection of Urdu and Persian manuscripts, for historic cookbooks. One Rampuri speciality, yakhni pulao - now cooked only to a basic recipe - appeared in fifty or more styles. Seeking to recreate these historic recipes, she worked with a khansama, or cook, from an old cheffing family to translate measures, procedures and ingredients into modern equivalents. A particular problem was the disappearance of older varieties of rice that had become extinct with the spread of high-yielding hybrid types. Their distinct aroma and taste remained alive only in the culinary memories of the older generation, who still yearn for tilak chandan and other small-grained local varieties previously grown in the rice-belt around Rampur.  Taking a lead from this &apos;local food hero&apos;, this partnership bridges the gap between culinary memory, local heritage and lost agricultural varieties. Bringing food historians, sociologists, literary scholars and plant scientists into dialogue with heritage practitioners, authors, cooks and street vendors, it addresses challenges linked to local communities and food sustainability in India through four main &apos;work packages&apos;: 1. recovery and analysis of historic cookbooks and other literatures relating to food and food cultures preserved in colonial, national, local and family collections in India, Pakistan and the UK. 2. recording oral history to enable culinary memories to be preserved in local cultural contexts with no written record. 3. commissioning a new anthology of creative writing on South Asian food and foodways to capture memories and ideas relating to such themes as family, domesticity, hospitality and food shortage. 4. growing heritage rice varieties in controlled-environment &apos;virtual rice paddies&apos; protected from modern pathogens. Preferred characteristics may then be incorporated into plants that will survive and thrive in extreme environments, while also delivering high yields and nutrients required by an ever-expanding population.  The culmination of a funded-stage of the partnership will be the Rampur Food Festival.  This two-day event hosted by project partner, the Rampur Raza Library, will focus on the cooking of heritage food to the recipes in Urdu and Persian manuscripts from the court of the Rampur Nawabs. Of particular note will be the use of heritage rice grown for the project to recover participants&apos; emotional response in terms of appearance, taste and smell.  In the late nineteenth century, the Rampur court was known for its patronage of an important cultural festival, the Jashn-e-Benazir, featuring poetry, music and, most significantly for our purposes, food.  A distinctive feature of this event was the mixing of different social classes and communities in the shared space of bazaar culture.  Building on this historic model in a contemporary context, the Rampur Food Festival will move heritage food from its 5* lodgings to street level, highlighting popularity and affordability to foster a means of livelihood for local cooks, street vendors and artisans.  The festival will also showcase other partnership outputs, including a historic recipe collection making material from archival sources available to contemporary cooks and a documentary highlighting culinary memory through oral history.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="The main objective of this partnership project is to bridge the gap between culinary memory, local heritage and lost agricultural varieties. Bringing food historians, sociologists, literary scholars and plant scientists into dialogue with heritage practitioners, authors, cooks and street vendors, it addresses challenges linked to local communities and food sustainability in India. Specific aims in terms of interdisciplinary knowledge exchange and innovative research collaboration include: (i) Recording culinary memories through oral history in order to chart changing food cultures from the colonial/princely era into independence and beyond. (ii) Analysing historic cookbooks and other literatures relating to food and food cultures to reflect on heritage recipes, diet-related health remedies and culinary memory. (iii) Liaising with popular historians, heritage practitioners, cooks and writers to share historic food cultures and consider how they be employed to benefit local communities, including those of different ages and backgrounds, in the present. (iv) Growing heritage rice varieties referenced in oral histories and historic cookbooks in order to ascertain attractive heritage characteristics that could be incorporated into new drought-resistant and nutrient-rich varieties. Though broad expertise will be marshalled to the aims of the partnership, a particular emphasis will be placed on Muslim communities that have experienced a devastating assault on their food cultures in contemporary India.  In terms of achieving tangible development impact in India, the project has the following aims for public engagement: (i) Preparing a pamphlet or small book (in accessible languages, i.e. Hindi, Urdu and English) featuring heritage recipes gathered from cookbooks and oral history to popularise dishes and simple health remedies. (ii) Filming a short documentary that would include oral interviews evoking culinary memories alongside an account of the unique process of growing heritage rice to revive historic recipes. (iii) Commissioning a new anthology of creative writing on South Asian food and foodways to capture memories and ideas relating to such themes as family, domesticity, hospitality and food shortage. (iv) Publishing blogs and short articles that publicise the partnership&apos;s unique interdisciplinary approach and rare research materials.  (v) Trialling a heritage food event in Rampur in north India that would present menus based on historic recipes using the project&apos;s heritage rice - thus allowing public response to be monitored - alongside related cultural activities.  The larger, if more intangible, objectives of the project are thus: (i) fostering a productive dialogue between academics in the Arts &amp; Humanities, Social Sciences and Plant Science on the relationship between cultural heritage and food production that may underpin future research - notably, the development of modern rice varieties that are also culturally-appropriate. (ii) initiating an exchange of ideas between heritage practitioners in different parts of India to the benefit of struggling localities, like Rampur. Having trialled a food festival in Rampur, a local cultural organisation may hope to make it an annual event that fosters local cohesion and draws tourism. (iii) employing food linked to India&apos;s Muslim heritage to mediate difference and reduce unease between religious communities at a time of communal tension and violence fostered by government policy."></capital-spend>
