   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Remote Sensing for sustainable use of seasonally dry tropical forests - Learning to live with the forest</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Around the world, seasonally dry tropical forests have in the past been disregarded as marginal wastelands but are now recognised for the importance of their biodiversity and potential ecosystem services. They face critical challenges of conservation, unsustainable use leading to desertification, local poverty and migration to urban areas. In Brazil, 11% of its land area is this type of forest, called the Caatinga. There is an urgent need to provide methods by which this fragile biome can be monitored and protected, for the plants, animals and people who live there. The aim of this project is to develop a tool that can provide a new level, quality and accessibility of information for 1) biodiversity monitoring at species level and 2) an assessment of ecosystem quality, with resulting implications for land use. Quantitative maps generated by this novel technology can be used to optimise resources and underpin policy and forest management methods. This project will generate technological innovation by integrating high resolution remote sensing (hyperspectral imaging from drones using Rutherford Appleton Laboratory camera systems) with ground-based measurement on the ground (including plant spectral profiles and LIDAR). One way in which it will be tested will be examination of effects of various levels of cattle grazing upon the forest, as a widespread human/environment interaction. To achieve its aims, the project team is interdisciplinary and international, with research partners from the UK and Brazil. The project will also involve Brazilian stakeholders from federal and state level ministries, agencies and advisory groups, as well as NGOs and other groups responsible for communities and for policymaking. By seeking their specific needs for affordable, practical technology at the start of the project, and by facilitating their planning for uptake of the technology by the end of the project, the project will seek to maximise its impact in Brazil. The technology will also have broader relevance to other seasonal dry forests and indeed other threatened, inaccessible ecosystems around the globe. Thus, through the technological innovation and deliberate engagement of stakeholders, the project will address the UN Sustainable Development Goal 15: &apos;Protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss&apos;.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The core aim of the project is to develop innovative technology that will enable effective biodiversity monitoring at species level and assessment of ecosystem quality, with implications for land use. Monitoring and protection of complex, threatened biomes require this improved level, quality and accessibility of information.  The objective is to create a management information tool based on taking high resolution remote sensing (hyperspectral imaging from drones - using RAL Space camera systems) and liking it to validated ground-based measurements (plant spectral profiles and ground LIDAR). This tool can provide: (1) biodiversity monitoring at species level and (2) an assessment of ecosystem quality (or health). This will provide quantitative maps that will be used to optimise resources and provide efficient and effective forest management methods. By using the remote sensing technologies to monitor human impact on seasonally dry forests, the capacity to quantify how these forests respond to and recover from over-use will inform policy for sustainable use.   The technical innovation objective is to integrate high resolution remote sensing (hyperspectral imaging from drones using Rutherford Appleton Laboratory camera systems) with ground-based measurement on the ground (including plant spectral profiles and LIDAR). The strategic impact objective is to include key Brazilian stakeholders (e.g. federal and state ministries and agencies, NGOs) in identifying needs for the technology and in championing its uptake in policymaking and forest management.  The immediate aim of the technological innovation is to contribute to sustainability and conservation of the Caatinga seasonal dry tropical forest biome comprising 11% of Brazil&apos;s land area. Having demonstrated the efficacy of this technology in Brazil, the broader aim is to contribute to other such forests around the globe; as in Brazil, these too are associated with local poverty, unsustainable use leading to desertification, and ultimately migration of local populations to cities, with associated social problems. Indeed, the technology would prove useful in any complex, threatened, inaccessible ecosystem.  Underlying these objectives is the project goal of addressing the UN Sustainable Development Goal 15: &apos;Protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss&apos;.</narrative>
