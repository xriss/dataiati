   <narrative xml:lang="EN">NEWTON SEA Sustainable production of compost, biofuels and chemicals from oil palm residues.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Malaysia is one of the world&apos;s largest producers of vegetable oil with approximately 20 million metric tonnes of palm oil produced in 2015 (MPOB, 2015). Palm oil has a diverse range of uses including food, cosmetics and industrial applications. Global demand for palm oil, combined with a market price below other vegetable oils, has resulted in the proliferation of oil palm plantations over recent years and an increasing demand for potable water to irrigate oil palm nurseries and to process oil palm fruit bunches. This has led to a host of sustainability challenges that could be converted into development opportunities. For example, with the prospect of continuing high demand there is an opportunity to develop cost-effective strategies for sustainable palm oil production and approaches to obtain additional value from the resulting waste residues, whilst simultaneously creating novel economic development options. The waste generated at palm oil mills is currently creating a major disposal problem and includes empty fruit bunches, shells, and fruit residues palm kernel; whilst in the plantations, waste includes palm trunks and fronds. Open burning of oil palm waste is prohibited, as it produces tropospheric ozone and black carbon contributing to both degraded air quality and global warming. Maximising energy recovery and amendments for soil improvement from the waste residues through the efficient use of oil palm waste residues in a sustainable manner is, therefore, desirable for both economic and environmental reasons.  Oil palm waste residues are predominantly lignocellulose, which is one of the most abundant forms of fixed carbon in the biosphere and its breakdown is a critical component of the global carbon cycle and the major contributor to soil health. Using renewable plant biomass as an industrial feedstock for fuels and chemicals presents a major opportunity to break our dependence on petroleum and lower our net carbon emission substantially.   A novel aspect of our proposal is the use of new &apos;omics approaches developed at the University of York to gain insights into the functioning of complex microbial communities to degrade oil palm residues, including assigning roles for specific community members and enzymes in the overall process to derive optimised microbial communities and harness their metabolic functionality for efficient lignocellulose digestion. The proposed research will identify completely new types of lignocellulose active proteins, both broadening our fundamental understanding of this process, as well as providing novel activities to improve the digestion of oil palm waste residues for the sustainable production of biofuels and chemicals. In addition, we are mindful that the promotion and demand for lignocellulosic biofuels will increase demand and competitive pressure on water resources. The large water consumption required by biomass processing plants is a matter of increasing concern and we will explore the possibility of using seawater for biomass processing and for fermentations, which could be utilised by coastal based biorefineries. Together, these scientific advances will provide a useful springboard for Malaysia to harness the results to inform new development opportunities.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Our goal is to build a leading UK/Malaysian team that has the capacity and capability to develop sustainable solutions for obtaining additional value from oil palm waste residues, whilst simultaneously creating novel economic development options. We will utilise new &apos;omics methods to study oil palm residue degradation by complex microbial communities. We will then mine these microbial communities and harness their metabolic functionality for efficient lignocellulose digestion. The project will deliver optimised oil palm residue composting systems and new enzyme cocktails to improve the digestibility of oil palm residues as a potential future feedstock for the production of biofuels and chemicals. The large water consumption required by biomass processing plants is a matter of increasing concern and we will explore the possibility of using seawater for biomass processing and for fermentations, which could be utilised by coastal based biorefineries.Key objectives are to:  1. Use state-of-the-art &apos;omics technologies to discover highly performing lignocellulose degrading enzymes from microbial composting communities for oil palm residue digestion  2. Develop optimised compost systems to support ecosystem management and services 3. Identify new lignin transforming enzymes to generate high value chemicals 4. Identify salt tolerant lignocellulose degrading enzymes from microbial compost communities obtained from mangrove forests  5. Develop improved fermentation systems using seawater media 6. Critically evaluate the social, economic and environmental implications of our research including its potential impact on Malaysia&apos;s development - understanding the extent to which these processes can improve the economic value of oil palm residues in an environmentally friendly way.</narrative>
