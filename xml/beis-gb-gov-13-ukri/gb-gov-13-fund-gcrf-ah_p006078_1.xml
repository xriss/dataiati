   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Creative Activism: Art and Development Alternatives (HN)</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">1) The primary objective of this network is to use art and creative activism to enable those whose voices have traditionally been marginalised from development debates because of poverty and positionality in the Global South to articulate, shape and deliver their own development aspirations and alternatives, and to use these articulations to influence, or to challenge, Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) implementation plans.   Four secondary objectives will help deliver this primary objective:  2) New knowledge: Develop an understanding of how alternatives are conceptualised and enacted by different groups in the South and identify whether and how they can inform, complement and/or challenge the SDGs. Despite the wide-ranging nature of discussions of alternatives, encompassing fields as disparate as feminist and ecological approaches to economics, managerialism, indigenous and peasant culture, and science fiction (e.g. DAWN, 2013; Permanent Commission, 2013; Utting, 2015; Parker et al, 2015; Beneria et al, 2015), these discussions have had comparatively little impact on mainstream development approaches. Social change is often driven by ideas from the margins, yet traditional research methodologies for development tend to privilege dominant practices. Innovative academic-activist-practitioner partnerships, and the arts and creative activism, can help to &apos;enlarge the field from which the unexpected can emerge&apos; by bringing together different domains and focusing attention on emergent practices (Gibson-Graham, 2008). Using disruption, performance and translation as points of reference, we will pursue this objective by identifying how the arts can help to promote new and emerging practices and visions that, as well as articulating local priorities, have the potential to be genuinely transformative.   3) Impact: Support the promotion of alternatives within the development sector, via the work of ActionAid and local actors, with the aim of promoting systemic change and challenging inequalities. See the Pathways to Impact document for more details.  4) Novel methodologies: Draw on art, culture and creative activism to develop and trial empowering and creative methodologies that can be used to promote alternative thinking and practice in development. Methods from the arts and humanities have particular potential to disrupt existing ontological frameworks, revealing new possibilities and practices. While there is an increasing interest in the use of creative participatory methodologies in development projects (e.g. theatre, film, storytelling), their potential is too often limited by dominant cultures of development that privilege elite assumptions about priority agendas. Yet, outside the context of traditional development projects, new social movements and activists are increasingly using creative and artistic approaches to challenge hegemonic paradigms and to fight for social change (Beautiful Trouble, 2012; Beautiful Rising, forthcoming). The project will develop and test new creative methodologies, notably the use of fictional future scenarios, that equip us to perform research and participation in a way that elicits (rather than suppressing) alternative perspectives. We will explore methodologies that facilitate &apos;bottom-up&apos; translation processes to inform national and global policy, drawing on ActionAid&apos;s experience, strengths and policy relevance (Santos, 2002; Kelly, forthcoming).  5) Network-building: Build a sustainable research network that crosses cultural boundaries, bringing together activists, artists, community members, researchers and practitioners from the UK, South Asia and East Africa. By bringing together people with very different perspectives and experiences, the project seeks to disrupt established ways of thinking, to trial new ways of performing in development spaces, and to enable local alternatives to be translated meaningfully at different levels.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project seeks to develop a researcher-activist-practitioner network to explore the ways in which art and creative activism can contribute to efforts to understand and enact development alternatives. Development alternatives is understood to mean the diversity of practice and thinking that offers an alternative to mainstream development approaches (e.g. neo-liberal, service delivery, aid-centred, hierarchical, entrepreneurial), in particular, diverse voices and approaches from the Global South rarely heard in development debates and practice.   Despite their success in terms of meeting targets, the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) failed to engage sufficiently with inequalities and the structural causes of poverty and injustice. In contrast, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) present a more comprehensive and inclusive vision of development, partly as a result of a consultative process to develop the goals that incuded the voices of the &apos;poorest and most vulnerable&apos; (UN, 2015, para. 6). As such, the SDGs may offer space for development alternatives to emerge, but only if there is strong civil society participation to insist on the reordering of development priorities. Exploiting this potential, therefore, will require the involvement of new actors in development policy-making and new ways to encourage the voice and participation of groups traditionally left outside the development process.    In this context, the aims and objectives of this network are innovative in five main ways: 1) It will be convened by an academic-practitioner partnership between the Centre for Applied Human Rights (CAHR) and Politics Department at the University of York, and the international development agency ActionAid. 2) The network will bring together artists, academics, activists and development practitioners from the UK, Bangladesh and Uganda - Bangladesh and Uganda will serve as regional hubs to facilitate participation from neighbouring countries. 3) The network will critically explore how art and creative activism - and specifically the themes of disruption, performance and translation - can articulate, shape and help deliver development alternatives privileged by those whose voices are often marginalised in development debates, and the extent to which these alternatives complement, enhance or are in tension with the global goals for development set out by the SDGs. 4) The network will deploy creative methodologies, specifically the use of fictional future scenarios, to trigger debate and shape alternatives. Art and activist workshops, followed by national reflection workshops, will be held in Dhaka and Kampala, followed by a final reflection workshop. This timeline of events will build momentum for the research network, and for a series of projects and funding applications on the theme of development alternatives. 5) Through ActionAid and local actors, the network will have clear pathways to impact.      The network will pursue four pathways to impact: Policy, organisational and practice impacts on NGOs; Public engagement, outreach and local impact in Uganda and Bangladesh; Methodological; Network building. Our most immediate impacts will be achieved within the non-governmental development sector internationally, in the UK and in the regions where the events will take place, but our aim is also to inform the practices, reflections and policies of international organisations (UNESCO, European Union) through our collaboration with ActionAid. Local impact in Uganda and Bangladesh, both recipients of high levels of ODA, will be achieved by working in partnership with local offices of ActionAid and other local actors in Dhaka and Kampala.</narrative>
