   <narrative xml:lang="EN">De-marginalising frontier communities in West Africa: action research, local knowledge, and resilience against natural disasters and ecological stress</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project aims to generate a better understanding of historical and contemporary resilience strategies adopted by vulnerable and marginalised groups at risk, especially women and the descendants of formerly enslaved peoples, to respond to ecological stresses and natural disasters in Frontier communities in Mali, Senegal and Guinea.   By bringing together a unique combination of expertise in African history, social anthropology and literary studies, the project will offer a synergistic approach with transformative and catalyst effect on development initiatives in the area, by building, together with the communities, a repository of local knowledges, practices and strategies of community-based resilience; creating communication bridges and platforms among marginalised groups and local communities to enable cross cultural collaboration and knowledge sharing on equitable resilience; assessing systematically the potential for replicability of local resilience strategies across contexts and at larger scales; making these visible at the national and international levels and opening windows and opportunities for diverse, alternative sustainable development pathways. The project will facilitate the involvement and leadership of those vulnerable populations in community-based resilience action planning and organisational learning, and integrate their experiences and knowledges across multiple scales for long-lasting development gains.  In-depth and grounded comparative research will involve a still too little-explored comparison of resilience strategies and local knowledge production among ten frontier societies which have experienced similar ecological stresses over the past 100 years. The transformative aspect of this research relies on building knowledge networks across borders between frontier communities stakeholders who otherwise would have little chance to connect and to share and compare their experiences and local knowledge. This cross-border knowledge networks will be facilitated by the partnership with the Malian NGO Donkosira, and the co-organisation of three training workshops with twenty village stakeholders (2 per project village) in each case study country, the co-designing of a mobile and accompanying website where historical and contemporary local knowledge will be uploaded in the form of short texts, photos, audios and videos.   The project seeks to bridge gaps between research and development practitioners, by engaging with local authorities, NGOs, and key stakeholders throughout the course of the project. The project will maximise impact by building on the PI and Co-Is long-standing research engagement with the villages under study. The project has been designed to ensure the research responds to and feeds into existing local initiatives with the support of our Malian partner organisation Donkosira.   The project will produce the following key outputs:  - One edited volume drawing together key findings - One co-authored journal article - One mobile app  - One website - One 20-min video - One school toolkit - Policy papers  - Practitioners how-to-do guide on the dos and don&apos;ts</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">West Africa is one of the poorest regions of the world, and also subject to different climate change related environmental stresses - such as desertification, flooding, landslides, and unpredictable rains. The majority of the inhabitants of the region rely on climate-sensitive economic activities and depend on natural resources for their livelihoods (UNDP 2011). Frontier communities in Guinea, Mali and Senegal are particularly prone to the effects of long and short-term environmental shocks and stresses, which can have significant negative repercussions for their subsistence activities. However, putting the emphasis on their fragility, precarity and susceptibility to extreme climate events without acknowledging their important and long-standing resilience building strategies in the face of recurrent environmental stresses misses the opportunity to realise their potential to drive transformative adaptation and to open up new pathways for sustainable development. Despite there being ample evidence showing the important role of local repertoires of knowledge in building resilience capacity before and after climate related shocks and stresses, these rich repertoires have often been devalued or ignored in the design of climate change and sustainable development programs and projects.   The overall aim therefore, of this project is to help re-centre the resilience thinking and practice in climate change adaptation policy back in local actors and communities themselves and enhance the efforts geared to achieve a more equitable sustainable development in West Africa by de-marginalising frontier communities in Senegal (Casamance), Mali (Kayes) and Guinea (Upper-Guinea). The project will focus on the longue-dur&#xE9;e resilience strategies of populations particularly at risk (women and descendants of formerly enslaved populations). It will aim to facilitate their involvement and leadership in community-based resilience action planning and organisational learning, and integrate their experiences and knowledges across multiple scales for long-lasting development gains.  Our project team brings together a unique combination of expertise in African history, social anthropology and literary studies, which are less common in development approaches. It aims at constructing a synergistic approach with transformative and catalyst effect by collecting local knowledge that can be harnessed for development activities located at the intersections between poverty, environmental sustainability, governance and vulnerability. The transformative aspect of this research relies on building knowledge networks across borders between frontier communities&apos; stakeholders who otherwise would have little chance to connect and to share and compare their experiences and local knowledge. This cross-border knowledge networks will be facilitated by the organisation in partnership with the organisation Donkosira of training workshops with all stakeholders in each case study country, and the development of a mobile and accompanying website where historical and contemporary local knowledge data will be uploaded and made accessible to a wider local and international audience.</narrative>
