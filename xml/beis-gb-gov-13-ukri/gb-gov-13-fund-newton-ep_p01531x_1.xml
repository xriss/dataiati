   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Recent natural disasters in Malaysia, such as the wide-spread floods in 2014/15 and the flash flooding of Kuala Lumpur in 2007, have revealed that improvements are required in the prediction of damaging natural hazards and in the capacity to manage the associated risks and consequences.    Appropriate to the theme of &apos;future cities&apos;, the focus of this project is the prediction and management of physical risks relevant to Kuala Lumpur, which is the Malaysian capital and the most populated city in Malaysia with around 8 million inhabitants. The particular hazards to be targeted in this project, which are common in Kuala Lumpur, are floods, landslides, sinkholes, strong winds, urban heat and air pollution.  A consortium of 16 research and business partners from the UK and Malaysia has been assembled for this project. The basic strategy is to adapt and combine existing technologies to enhance hazard assessment and develop the ability to forecast, with main objective to develop a prototype multi-hazard information platform suitable for communicating risks to geophysical and atmospheric hazards. The primary beneficiaries will be risk managers and decision-makers in Malaysian local government and the insurance sector. The project objectives relate to the Malaysian Science to Action initiative, which has an aim of mobilising science for societal well-being.   The University of Cambridge (UoC) is the lead UK and academic partner in the project and its main role is to lead the meteorological forecasting package. The British Geological Survey will co-lead the Geophysical hazards phase of the project working specifically on the geophysical hazard modelling (landslides and sinkholes) and co-develop a platform for managing and communicating multi-hazard forecasts in a changing climate for Greater Kuala Lumpur city region.  Benefits of the project will include:  Improved information regarding the risks of occurrence of geophysical and atmospheric hazards, enabling Malaysian local authorities to make better contingency plans to mitigate the effects of geophysical and atmospheric hazards, which will provide economic benefits and improve the quality of life for Malaysian citizens.  Improved information about geophysical hazards will aid the further development of insurance services in Malaysia.  The multi-hazard platform developed for Greater Kuala Lumpur city region will have relevance to cities elsewhere in Malaysia and in the wider south-east Asian region. Where the commercial development of such systems, could benefit both the commercial sector and future urban management.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The goal of the project as a whole is the development of a prototype geophysical multi-hazard forecast system for Greater Kuala Lumpa city region. The system will improve contingency planning and risk management, and reduce the economic and societal impacts of the hazards. The main focus is on short-range (hours to days) and high-resolution (city-scale) capability, regarding hazards such as flash-floods, landslides, heat waves, air pollution. There is also a long-range (weeks to seasons) component of the meteorological package, aimed at providing early warning regarding the activity of various meteorological events. The project consortium contains 16 Malaysian and UK academic and commercial participants.  The objectives of the main NERC British Geological Survey (BGS) component of the project work plan are:  (i) To enhance hazard assessment of geophysical hazards (such as landslides and sinkholes) in the Greater Kuala Lumpur city region pilot study area, with a focus on their association with meteorological conditions (e.g., rain thresholds).  (ii) To contribute to the reduction of the impact of geophysical hazards such as landslides sinkholes (e.g., lives lost, economic, environmental), through preparedness via risk assessment and early warning, and build resilience to landslides and sinkholes in vulnerable and hazard-prone areas of Greater Kuala Lumpur.  (iii) To get desired &amp; useful tailored information to appropriate stakeholders in ways they can access, by the use of risk information in practice (e.g., web-based information gathering/dissemination to stakeholders).   (iv) To disseminate project knowledge to the broader south-east Asian region along with capacity building to ensure project&apos;s lasting legacy.   The above objectives will be carried out in collaboration with the Minerals and Geoscience Department of Malaysia, University of Malaya, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, Geomapping Techology Sdn. Bhd., Param Agricultural Soil Surveys (M) Sdn. Bhd., JBA, Cambridge Environmental Research Consultants Ltd. and Cuesta Consulting Ltd., which are partners in the consortium.</narrative>
