   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Humanitarian policy and practice is driven by the immediacy of crisis and urgency. But in contexts of protracted conflict and displacement, it is often the hidden damage that takes place over time that sets the terms for future violence, change, and possible peace. The Rights for Time/Time for Rights (RfT) Network will co-create, co-evaluate and support the dissemination of a new understanding of how time conditions war, displacement, and violence, and shifts the possibilities and frame of action for humanitarian protection and human rights.  Our focus on time responds to gaps identified by our overseas partners in the Protection in Contexts of Conflict and Displacement theme. One of the major stumbling-blocks to protection is the failure to measure and identify needs and problems not currently obvious to external actors in policy, law, and in local contexts. Aid and protection that reacts to only the most &apos;recent&apos; abuse or threat not only fails to understand the nature of injury, but limits the sustainability of possible solutions. Uncovering layers of time and hidden damage will reveal the specific needs of the most vulnerable and disenfranchised. Multiple, layered and even simultaneous experiences of violence, displacement, and generational trauma persist into future generations, creating new challenges and blocking change.   To address this, we are proposing a new global, mobile, interdisciplinary, and multi-directional approach to uncover and focus on modern conflict, violence, and uprootedness within a longer time frame. Drawing together in-country partners and academic experts from the arts and humanities, the psy-sciences, neuroscience, medical anthropology, refugee studies, gender studies, human rights, transitional justice, and humanitarian law, and protection policy, we will meet these challenges by developing interdisciplinary, peer-to-peer, case-based research. We have chosen to work both within and across specific contexts where the long periods of violence produce enduring and intractable challenges, particularly for vulnerable communities and groups, such as women and girls. Conflict in Lebanon, Rwanda, Kenya, Jordan and the Gaza Strip and West Bank, has resulted in patterns of forced displacement that span generations. Memory legacies are acute, and trauma is ever-present.   We will develop the concept of Rights for Time to build a network that can bring the hidden legacies of conflict directly into humanitarian protection and human rights policy and practice. Co-Investigators based at the universities of Birmingham, KCL, SOAS, UCL and at the Hashemite University (Jordan) and the Lebanese American University will work with a series of Project Partners, including Wangu Kanju, We Love Reading, BLAST, the African Initiative for Mankind Progress and the Kigali Center for Photography to identify, pilot and commission a series of initial case studies, followed by longer projects, to generate new evidence bases, develop new policy, practice and law in action and make the forms of injury of protracted violence culturally visible at local, national and international levels. In doing so, partner countries will have the necessary tools and an increased ability to develop effective protection solutions for those most affected by conflict and violence, especially vulnerable groups.  This Development Award will allow us to deepen and strengthen our partnerships, particularly with NGOs, charities and community groups in the LMICs mentioned above. It will also facilitate extensive planning and the formulation of key policies, to be adopted across the Network, particularly around ethics/safeguarding and gender and inclusivity. We will also develop a communications plan for the RfT Network, including the launch of an initial project website, to raise awareness and encourage engagement with the project.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="This Development Award will allow us to deepen and strengthen our partnerships, particularly with NGOs, charities and community groups in the LMICs in which we are planning to work. It will also facilitate extensive planning and the formulation of key policies, to be adopted across the Network. We will also develop a communications plan for the RfT Network, including the launch of an initial project website.   - Employ a Postdoctoral Researcher, Dr Nora Parr, on a 0.2FTE basis, to firm up partnerships already in place, explore new ones, and facilitate communication and network action on the partner-to-partner level; - Support for the time commitment of an additional ECR Co-I who will provide the expertise and understanding of the law affecting the humanitarian sector. This responds to improvements in the bid recommended by first-round     reviewers, which include, incorporating identification of existing good practice models of protectionist/humanitarian law and policy interventions and prioritisation of research needs from a law perspective; - Hold a 2-day workshop in November (location TBC) with Management Committee members but also inviting along a wider range of (potential) partners to:  - Further develop the interdisciplinary approach of the Network;  - Agree to a Theory of Change which includes new and innovative definitions of &apos;success&apos; in legal/humanitarian practice, as well as mechanisms/ methods for the monitoring and evaluation of that success;  - Ensure that everyone, but most importantly refugees and other vulnerable groups, are not only at the table but contributing equally. This begins with the choice of location for the workshop, which we would aim to hold in either    Jordan or another location tbc.  With all partners around one table we can make sure that all parties will be served (will be impacted and can use our Theory of Change) and can contribute to project aims. Finally, partner-to-partner    relationships across the network will help increase confidence in the group overall, and ultimately strengthen relationships between in-country groups who identify distinct concerns.  - Agree on a broad ethical framework within which to operate, including establishing mechanisms for inclusivity and gender balance across the project;  - Better understand the particular safeguarding issues in each partner country and start to establish protocols for each location and activity type;   - Commission a project website in order to ensure early visibility and to share existing resources between partners and a broader public. This will also ensure that the project is up and running as quickly as possible down the line;  - Commission an innovative and effective communications plan for the project;  - Support the costs involved in bringing the Management Committee members together, ahead of the AHRC interview in December, to allow for preparation for the interview and to ensure that all the interviewees are in place for that    December date.  - Hold a 2-day workshop in the UK in early February 2020, to initiate planning for the formal launch of the 4-year programme, particularly to crystallise the initial pilot projects."></capital-spend>
