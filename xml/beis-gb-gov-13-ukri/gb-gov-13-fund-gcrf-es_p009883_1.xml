   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Aid Effectiveness in the Occupied Palestinian Territories</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Since 1993 international donors have invested more than $30 billion as aid meant to develop the occupied Palestinian territories (OPT), in order to support the Peace Process laid out in the 1993 Oslo Accord. The framework for this aid model was developed in 1993 by the World Bank in a policy document &quot;An Investment in Peace&quot;4 and the subsequent 1994 Paris Protocol.5 The Bank has also played a lead role since that time producing reports and policy recommendations for the top donors on how OPT aid should be given, acting as the intellectual leader for an aid process dominated politically by the United States and funded by the EU as the top donor.6 In the process of spending that aid, those Western donors have radically redesigned the Palestinian government and economy in their image built on neoliberal policy models, excluding local ownership over the aid process. That aid, one of the biggest and most intrusive cases in history, has been a failure.7 Since 1993 the economy of the OPT has significantly de-developed and is now dependent on aid to cover basic needs. Meanwhile, the general welfare of the people in the OPT has become markedly worse due to the combination of economic decline and violence, where repeated outbursts of conflict with Israel have resulted in thousands of deaths, tens-of-thousands of serious injuries, large scale incarcerations and the trampling of basic human rights guaranteed under international law.8 In this time the West Bank has been progressively absorbed into Israel through a rapid programme of settlement building, especially of East Jerusalem. Gaza&apos;s conditions are even much worse, bottled up in a stringent economic blockade since 2006 imposed by Israel, with support from Egypt and international donors, in order to destabilise and overthrow the local government.9 In that time three major bombardments have decimated Gaza&apos;s infrastructure, where the blockade and donor policy makes reconstruction and recovery impossible. Conditions are so bad that the UN has predicted Gaza could become uninhabitable by 2020.10 In my research I show how major donors have deliberately ignored the actual context of Israel&apos;s occupation policies and real conditions in the OPT, while excluding Palestinians from ownership of the aid process. Further, those donors deliberately ignore key principles for aid effectiveness agreed to by OECD countries, like the Paris Declaration (2005) and Accra Agreement (2008), which emphasise local ownership over the aid process, and the OECD Do No Harm principle, which emphasises the need for aid to be contextually appropriate in conflicted or fragile states. These flaws are reinforced by Western donors&apos; identification with Israel as a Western, capitalist democracy, and the close alliance of many with Israel. As a result, they often favour (some exclusively) Israel&apos;s interpretation of political events. Israel has been able to capitalise on those sympathies and shape OPT aid to meet its needs to sustain the occupation, at a profit. A recent estimate, for instance, is that up to 72% of the value of aid goes on to Israel, an OECD country and the occupying power.11 In this way donors feed and inflame the underlying reasons for conflict. Meanwhile, donors have operated under an assumption that Israel, as a Western democracy, is by nature inclined toward peace, and that through exposure to Israel the Palestinians could be remade to want it too. Such biased beliefs have been key to donors violating Do No Harm by giving contextually inappropriate aid that has actually undermined Palestinian state building. By not understanding the history and power dynamics in the OPT, donor actions have weakened the incentives for powerful elites to &apos;buy in&apos; to peace building and increased their incentives to &apos;opt out&apos;. My project identifies the worst donor policies with the aim of changing how aid is given in orderto promote real economic development, peace building and the general welfare of Palestinians.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The aim of my proposed post-doctoral project &quot;Aid Effectiveness in the Occupied Palestinian Territories&quot; is to share findings on aid effectiveness for a vital fragile and conflicted state on the OECD - DAC list, the occupied Palestinian territories (OPT), in order to foster dialogue about OPT aid and encourage changes in donor policy. At the heart of my PhD thesis lay questions about aid effectiveness in the OPT, where development aid was meant to spur economic growth and then lead to peace, all within the framework of an Oslo Accord Peace Process that began in 1993. Or more specifically, I looked at why aid was not being effective, and likely even causing harm, in what is one of the most important development case studies in the world - considering the sheer scale of $30 billion (and counting) in aid funding since 1993, and the importance of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict to regional Middle East and global security.1 My proposed project builds on my existing research with additional research into major donor policies and focuses on disseminating my findings on flaws in the OPT donor aid model. By providing policy recommendations and helping OPT stakeholders to reclaim ownership over their aid process, my intended outcome is to contribute to change that allows real economic development to take place, to improve the general welfare of Palestinians and possibly even to encourage actual peace-building. Building on my past research I will conduct additional research into the aid policies of the top OPT aid donors, which I recently identified with a collaborator in a cutting edge study for Oxfam-GB. There I also compared some of those donors&apos; policies against the norms of Aid Effectiveness (the Paris Declaration &amp; Accra Agreement)2 and Do No Harm Principle (for conflicted and fragile states)3 as laid out by the OECD. I would commit up to 25% of my time to this research, using it as an opportunity not only to produce further publishable findings that will contribute to knowledge on this subject area, but double as an opportunity to interact directly with policy-makers and stakeholders in OPT aid in order to influence policy. To do this I would lay out an appropriate methodology in January, similar to my thesis, consisting of a combination of document research and interviews with policy-makers for eight top donors from 2006-16. I would then carry-out the research from February to August, before publishing my findings in the Autumn. This would require travel, and that travel would be combined with my objective to build networks and collaborate with stakeholders, to carry out my project&apos;s overarching aim. Further, I would use this as groundwork to apply for a larger grant analysing OPT aid effectiveness from 1993 onwards, and its relationship to development and peace building as laid out by the Oslo Accord. I would hope to develop this in tandem with one or more research colleagues, focusing on those identified in my work plan. Ultimately the aim behind all of this research is to promote long-term sustainable growth, including peace-building, in the OPT. As such, I will communicate my findings in order to effect change to the existing OPT aid model, through engagement with academic and non-academic audiences on various platforms. Those include journal articles, publishing my thesis as a book, policy briefings, mainstream media and blogs. I will further network with policy-makers and stakeholders during my additional research, at conferences and ideally through some talks at NGOs. I will collaborate with several scholars in the USA and Europe, particularly on publications, and crucially to disseminate findings about Palestinian development aid through a placement at a Palestinian non-governmental (NGO) that formed in recent years to challenge and hold to account the donor model, the Al-Shabaka Policy Network. I also intend to use thepost-doc opportunity to develop my research and teaching skills, and my future academic career.</narrative>
