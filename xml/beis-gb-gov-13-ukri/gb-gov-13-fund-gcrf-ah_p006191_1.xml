   <narrative xml:lang="EN">- Establish a mutually beneficial working relationship with an academic from each of the four levels of ODA recipient country that has expertise in the challenges and opportunities associated with creative product design in their home countries  - Through the collation of existing case studies and original project-based learning undertaken during the project, identify a consensus-driven approach to creative product design that is relevant to the four levels of ODA recipient country to support wealth generation and employment  - Provide mechanisms (launch events/website/video/booklet) by which the consensus-driven approach can be rolled-out in the network participants&apos; home countries and more widely to all 146 ODA recipient countries  - Use the working relationships, knowledge and outcomes from the network activities to explore opportunities that will extend the project through more substantive applications for funding</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">As a core human capability, creative product design has the capacity to change the physical environment by envisioning, planning and executing solutions to real-world problems that can generate wealth and provide employment (IDSA 2015). Through the development of dedicated methods/tools, design activity has reached high levels of sophistication in the developed world, where outcomes have a major impact on quality of life embodied in the functionality of manufactured products and contribution to wealth generation/employment through a supply chain economy (Proximity Design, 2014). However, the economic and social benefits of  such approaches remain problematic in ODA recipient countries due to a lack of appropriate training and education in opportunities and nature of the creative process.  This project integrates the distinctive and emerging methods of arts and humanities research in creative product design to share, discuss, co-create and envisage ways in which the discipline can contribute to key areas of the UN2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development i.e. &quot;emerging creative economies, creative practices.....and building on local crafts, products, expertise and experience&quot; (United Nations 2015). The ultimate outcome is to provide employment to tackle poverty as identified in the UK Government Aid Strategy 9 (Department for International Development, 2015). The proposal exploits the PI and CI&apos;s expertise in the use of design to support product development for both developed and developing economies by facilitating the identification and application of approaches that are appropriate for ODA recipient countries. It builds on a recent PhD undertaken by the CI who has direct, first-hand experience of the key issues through field work in Myanmar.    The project outcomes will be achieved via a six phase network-driven approach that promotes shared learning and dissemination of outcomes:  Phase 1 - Establish latest thinking in the use of design-based approaches for creative product design in the four levels of ODA recipient country   Phase 2 - Collate case study examples of creative product design undertaken in the four levels of ODA recipient country that effectively address opportunities/challenges  Phase 3 - Deliver a UK networking event to explore the challenges and opportunities for creative product development in ODA recipient countries through the presentation/discussion of the Phase 1 case studies; generation of an approach for best practice; exploration/testing of this through a co-design task for a problem/issue/opportunity identified for each of the ODA recipient country (four design briefs); identify a consensus-driven approach for roll-out to all ODA recipient countries  Phase 4 - Translate the consensus-driven approach and case studies/designed outcomes into an interactive website, video and booklet for dissemination at a launch event in each of the four levels of ODA recipient country plus distribution to key representatives (academic/government/business) in all 146 ODA recipient countries  Phase 5 - Reflect on all project activities and identify opportunities to further extend the work through further applications for funding   The outcomes from the project will be embodied in an interactive website and printed booklet that has relevance for anyone wishing to use creative product design in ODA recipient countries to address problems/issues/opportunities and create employment (direct/indirect) that will ultimately contribute to the alleviation of poverty as identified in the UN2030 Agenda. The outcomes from the network will be embodied in the distributed resources, with the interactive website continuing to develop beyond the six month project through the uploading of case studies that demonstrate the successful application of the identified approaches and edited/maintained on a voluntary basis by the PI/CI.</narrative>
