   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Gender Responsive Resilience and Intersectionality in Policy and Practice (GRRIPP) - Networking Plus Partnering for Resilience</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">A central aim of the Network+ will be a critical interrogation of key concepts as part of our research leadership role. This will extend beyond a scholarly endeavour to encompass the policy and practice domains. We aim for GRRIPP to be an important global influencer of ideas, policies and practices. Creating a feedback loop of our research advances between the global, Municipal and community levels would allow us the see impact at local levels. Some of this work will be undertaken by regional teams but mostly this will come out of the Commissioning process. The GRRIPP project aims to support the evolution of gender and intersectionality, resilience and sustainability from descriptive heuristics to frameworks for transformation through establishing a new Network of Networks. This will allow the unpacking of these concepts and the development of knowledges that are critical and situated, indigenous and decolonial; establishing in-country research needs across different timeframes; collectively identifying the major indigenous problems which require our whole team&apos;s attention. We aim to support a stronger understanding of gender &amp; intersectionality, and a much-improved ability to embed that understanding in policy and practice, which is absolutely critical for delivering the  SDGs, theSendai Framework and other global challenges, in a way that leaves no-one behind. Through a paradigm shifting network of collaborators (ranging from academic to policy leading think tanks, practitioners and municipalities), this GCRF Network+ aims to nurture long-lasting and mutually beneficial collaborations between and among communities, municipalities, policy makers, scholars and international academic institutions; and to generate meaningful insights into considerations of gender responsive, risk aware, sustainable and resilient infrastructure in its various manifestations (human, political, economic, social, built) found in settlements at every scale. Knowledge building and excellence in research.  The science behind this network and the research that will be developed will be driven by the host countries and their development challenges and will be socially relevant and academically cutting edge. Capacity-building and international partnerships.  GRRIPP aims to devise a series of capacity building workshops and events which will allow the sharing of expertise and the development of skills and knowledge (e.g. trainings on proposal writing and joint &apos;write-shops&apos; for preparing academic papers including on feminist writing) internationally, intra-nationally, and across discipline and sector. We expect our Regional Partners to be creative and innovative in the research and events they commission. Networking.  The GRRIPP team is a network of experienced and productive networkers. We aim to: -Build in-country capacity (including UK) using agile techniques through networking and carryingout innovative and grounded  for a sustainable trajectory of widely shared research and practice excellence. -Engage with other networking groups across UKRI networks and GCRF hubs. Engagement events and processes will include those sectors currently lacking (or resistant to) a gender dimension. -Regional Teams will include a networking mentoring function to support ECR. -As well as conventional network activities such as online webinars/round tables, we plan activities which are more grounded and co-produced, including from a feminist, decolonial and activist perspective, which will be determined as network members feel appropriate to their settings. -From our first Inception Meeting we will develop legacy plans to ensure the sustainability of the work we initiate or develop. A conscious aim of GRRIPP is to decolonise knowledge production and provide levels of autonomy for regional teams.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The GRRIPP Network+ will build an international, network of scholars, policy makers and practitioners to promote gender and intersectionality. This requires networks of disciplines, sectors and interests and a range of partners who are willing to think and work together in new ways. We seek to establish a radical vision which begins and centres upon gender and intersectionality rather than adding it, post hoc, to domains and sectors. The primary challenge we identify is to embed gender and intersectionality in resilience thinking, policy making and practice through better understanding the drivers of gender inequality of risk and resilience in order to build gender responsive resilience (GRR).  We will focus on Resilience to Environmental Shocks and Change and ask: what difference would it make to re-envision the many global challenges facing ODA countries through a gender lens? We will also focus on sustainable infrastructure, which allows us to apply a gender and intersectionality lens to the planning, design, construction and governance of cities and communities; both in the everyday and in the context of disaster risk reduction and resilience. Initially we propose working directly across three regions Africa; Latin America and the Caribbean; and South Asia. We plan to ensure diversity within regions and countries to reach rural and smaller urban locations and stakeholders and not just capital cities/ large urban centres.  We plan an ambitious Commissioning programme for cutting edge research and capacity building activities which will encompass major nationally identified and significant challenges. We aim to mentor and support to leave no-one behind by actively involving very local and informal groups and networks through our various partners. We aim to leave our mark in the academic, policy and practice spheres through the diverse and wide-ranging outputs we seek to support and produce. For example: We plan to have a major influence on theoretical debates; we will engage policy makers and policy implementers to ensure theoretical and practical insights can be presented in policy-friendly ways that speak directly to their agendas; Through global &amp; regional workshops, we will collectively deliver expert discussions and research trainings, plan collaboratively written, presentational and advocacy activities. Our &quot;research mentor&quot; scheme will partner more experienced researchers with junior ones to focus on confidence-building for the next generation of thinkers and policy-influencers.  The legacy of GRRIPP will be connected, knowledgeable and empowered researchers, practitioners, communities and policymakers; theoretical innovations on gender, intersectionality and resilience; gender- and intersectionality-responsive disaster and conflict management policies; and a context-relevant information and evidence base for embedding gender and intersectionality into policy and policy into action.  We hope that the actions and outputs of the GRRIPP Network+ will support positive change in the everyday lives of people living in ODA countries while building socially-responsible and socially-productive capacity in the academic, policy and practice communities of the UK.</narrative>
