   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Widespread antibiotic use is considered to be a major contributor to the growing problem of antimicrobial resistance in many countries, but there is a lack of evidence regarding its key drivers in China, particularly in rural settings and outside hospitals, and whether these differ from those found elsewhere. This evidence is essential for identifying the health system, behavioural and policy interventions that have most potential for limiting the spread of antibiotic resistance in China, while ensuring equitable access to antibiotics for essential treatment of bacterial infections. This innovative interdisciplinary project aims to acquire greater understanding of key social, economic, cultural, systemic and other influences on antibiotic use by investigating and quantifying current use of both prescribed and non-prescribed antibiotics and other forms of care to treat common infections in rural parts of Anhui Province.  Our study will document treatment-seeking practices for selected common infections from all sources (including informal, Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), folk, home-based, private and government medical care) among patients at local health facilities and in the general population. We will gather information on testing, clinical diagnosis and antibiotic treatment procedures at lower levels of the health system and on over-the-counter purchasing of antibiotics from pharmacies and medicine shops. We will ascertain the annual incidence of common respiratory tract infections in the population of Anhui Province and assess the effects of the different forms of treatment they use, including antibiotics, on reported severity and duration of illness. We will also ascertain the feasibility of assessing clinical diagnostic accuracy, relationship between patient-reported symptoms and clinical diagnosis, and burden of antibiotic resistance in non-hospitalised patients, and investigate possible population biases in existing laboratory data through microbiological sampling. This range of evidence will enable us to formulate recommendations for appropriate interventions to optimise the use of antibiotics in Anhui Province and other regions of China.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="The project Objectives are to: 1. Describe treatment-seeking behaviour and types of treatment sought (including biomedical care, home treatment, self-medication, dietary therapy, Traditional Chinese Medicine) in  a. a cohort of patients with selected common infections attending primary care facilities and  b. a prospective population sample of those with self-reported Respiratory Tract Infections (RTIs) in rural Anhui Province 2. Identify key social, cultural, economic, clinical, health systems, behavioural and other determinants of current antibiotic use in these populations 3. Characterise antibiotic prescribing, sample collection and microbiological testing practices in relation to presenting symptoms and clinical diagnosis for outpatients at village and township levels of the health care system  4. Document current characteristics of antibiotic treatment and map pathways of care in a patient cohort attending non-hospital clinical settings, using Urinary Tract Infection (UTI) and exacerbation of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) as exemplars 5. Assess the feasibility of performing microbiological confirmation of diagnosis in non-hospitalised patients with UTI and exacerbation of COPD 6. Estimate the importance of over-the-counter antibiotic purchases as a source of antibiotic consumption overall and for self-reported RTIs in this rural population  7. Describe routinely available data sources which could be used to monitor antibiotic acquisition, antibiotic prescribing, clinical indication and microbiological investigations in village, township and county level government health care settings 8. Determine the annual incidence of self-reported RTIs and resort to all types of healthcare, including antibiotics, in the population of Anhui Province 9. Assess the perceived effectiveness of different forms of care including antibiotic use by multivariate modelling of patient outcome indicators (reported duration and severity of illness) 10. Identify system influences on antibiotic use by comparing resistance rates in a cohort of patients to resistance rates in specimens in local microbiology laboratories 11. Identify relationships between reported symptoms and antibiotics provided and socio-demographic characteristics of patients and antibiotic purchasers."></capital-spend>
