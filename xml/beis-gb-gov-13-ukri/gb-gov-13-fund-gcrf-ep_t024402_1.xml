   <narrative xml:lang="EN">-   Develop and support pilot projects that involve engaged practitioners/ policymakers and NGOs in collaborative work to implement and explore the feasibility of evidence-based interventions that reduce social exclusion in public service settings.  Multilevel interventions that could work across diverse sectors and those addressing intersectional disadvantage will be of particular interest for future research to scale up the selected interventions and develop new theoretical insights.   -   Amalgamate evidence-based strategies and interventions already identified across collaborating projects. These will be classified as macro-, meso-, micro- and multi-level interventions, drawing on the framework developed in the Socially Inclusive Cities Network for understanding how exclusion is created and maintained and assessed against the inclusion model developed by the PEER Network. Develop a summary of evidence based strategies across the Cluster for wider dissemination and identify best practice methods for equity-focused research as well as gaps in current evidence. -   Explore how these strategies align to current policy, practice and community priorities and to opportunities for implementation in a range of ODA-eligible contexts, drawing on the local knowledge of international partners.  -   Assess outcomes from pilot project work against known evidence gaps and select pilots with the most promise for filling these gaps and for upscaling to develop proposed intervention research for Stage 2</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Inequalities between different groups in society can be created and maintained by public services such as healthcare, education and local government.  Discrimination within these services results in poorer access to services, worse outcomes and non-representation in decision-making.  This kind of exclusion from public services is in turn linked to higher levels of poverty and unemployment, poorer health and less capacity to influence how society is governed compared to other social groups.  This project will establish partnerships between communities that experience such exclusion, organisations that represent their interests, policymakers and academics to challenge the status quo and give these communities a voice in public service planning and decision-making.   We will create a Partnership between five international research projects covering 21 countries in Africa, Asia and North America, to identify common solutions to the above issues.  We will make recommendations from the evidence that is already available on how public services can become more inclusive of disadvantaged groups in society.  We will provide funding to test out some of these solutions on a small scale and see whether these have the potential to reduce the inequalities that some groups experience.  This will help lay the ground for larger-scale research that evaluates the most promising solutions that could work across a range of disadvantaged groups and a range of countries. This collaborative research will produce: 1) a  policy briefing on evidence-based strategies that support public services to work fairly for everyone  2) an overview  of recommended research methods and gaps in current evidence  3) two international workshops to discuss how and where inclusion strategies might work in practice 4) four to six pilot studies in low and middle-income countries supported by an international partnership  5) pilot reports  describing methods and findings from each pilot study  6) recommendations about which potential solutions could be developed into a larger scale proposal and  7) an academic publication and accessible report bringing together knowledge from the individual pilots and highlighting a future research direction  Our Partnership aims to create a significant development in the field of research on equality and inclusion in society by bringing together researchers from different academic disciplines and by crossing public sector boundaries.  We aim to produce new knowledge in  and supporting contributions to diverse streams of evidence and publications with global relevance.</narrative>
