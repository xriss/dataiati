   <narrative xml:lang="EN">A lung-oriented controlled human infection model using live BCG to evaluate tuberculosis immunopathogenicity and vaccine efficacy (TB-CHIM).</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">TB is major global public health problem, with the urgent need for new control measures. In this joint LSHTM-UCT project, we hypothesise that lung-specific immunity against human mycobacterial infection can be interrogated using a CHIM. TB-CHIM will address important knowledge gaps about the immunopathogenesis of TB in the human lung about which we know very little. This may have important implications for vaccine design and uncover new diagnostic and immunotherapeutic targets against TB. We hypothesise that TB-CHIM can be refined to create a proof-of-concept model to evaluate the efficacy of candidate vaccines. The work proposed here will establish the safety and validity of the 90-day approach (versus 3-day approach used in TB HART) and the selection of a multidimensional biosignature that correlates with low TB risk. Thus, we will develop a generic model to evaluate and prioritise vaccine candidates for phase III trials. The optimal route of vaccination for a pulmonary pathogen like M. tuberculosis remains unresolved in humans, and TB-CHIM will evaluate the comparative immunogenicity and efficacy of BCG depending on the route of administration. To achieve this, the proposal will consider 3 main Aims and objectives:  (1) To interrogate and compare lung-specific human mycobacterial immunity in 3 groups of healthy participants representing a gradient of TB susceptibility and risk (presumed sterilizing immunity, presumed-latent TB infection, recurrent TB disease; n=20 per group) by evaluating the baseline and 90-day lung-specific recall responses to bronchoscopically instilled live BCG. Specifically to: (a) Evaluate the frequency and antigen specificity of lung resident and central memory T-cell populations induced by BCG using tetramers and single T-cell receptor RNA sequencing; (b) Categorise and investigate the antibody-mediated opsonisation and &apos;killing&apos; of M. tuberculosis ex vivo using broncho-alveolar lavage-derived antibody fractions obtained post-BCG challenge; (c) Evaluate the ability of lung-specific BCG-primed memory T-cells to mediate ex vivo mycobacterial killing using a M. tuberculosis-infected macrophage co-culture model.  (2) To develop and validate a human model of vaccine efficacy by comparing the longer term 90-days post-BCG cellular and transcriptomic immunological profile to the 3-day post-BCG challenge data obtained from the recently completed TB-HART study (which identified a pro-inflammatory biosignature associated with TB risk) in the same 3 sub-groups listed in Objective 1. Specifically, to: (a) Confirm the safety of the 90-day bronchoscopy preceded by inhaled BCG challenge; (b) Apply a &apos;systems biology&apos; approach to analyse comparative readouts along a host-specific phenotypic gradient of susceptibility (using the data from Objective 1 and the completed TB HART study) to delineate a multi-dimensional combinatorial biosignature, synonymous with protective responses, that can be used to evaluate future vaccine candidates.   (3) To compare the 90-day lung-specific recall responses in healthy participants with latent TB infection, who have received BCG either intradermally (n=20) or bronchoscopically (n=20; participants with LTBI recruited in Objective 1 will serve as the bronchoscopic instillation component). Specifically, to: (a) Compare the frequency and antigen specificity of lung resident and central memory T-cell populations induced by BCG administered via different routes (bronchoscopic vs. intradermal) using tetramers and single T-cell receptor RNA sequencing; (b) Categorise and investigate the antibody-mediated opsonisation and &apos;killing&apos; of M. tuberculosis ex vivo using broncho-alveolar lavage-derived antibody fractions following BCG administration via different routes. (c) Evaluate and compare the ability of lung-derived memory T-cells, induced by bronchosopic versus intradermal administration of BCG, to mediate ex vivo mycobacterial killing using an M. tb-infected macrophages.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Tuberculosis (TB) is one of the deadliest diseases known to man. It has killed over 1 billion people in the last 2 centuries and is currently the biggest infectious disease killer globally. In 2016 there were over 10 million newly diagnosed TB cases and 1.7 million people died (worldwide 3 people die from TB every minute!). In some parts of the world, like Sub-Saharan Africa, the disease is out of control.   TB most commonly affects the lungs and is transmitted through the inhalation of cough droplets, which enter the host&apos;s lung and eventually reach the air sacs (alveoli) where the infection takes root. However, if someone inhales TB bacteria it does not necessarily mean that they will develop active TB disease. In most people (~90 to 95%), the immune system is able to either kill or contain the bacteria before they develop disease. However, in ~5-10% of people, the bacteria multiply leading to TB disease.    The immune system is complex with many interacting components. However, how these components work together in the lung to kill the bacteria and prevent disease development is poorly understood. Thus, it remains unclear why some people get the disease while others are protected. This is mainly because most research, up to now, involved animal models and cells from the human blood compartment, which poorly approximate what happens in the human lung. However, several lines of evidence now suggest that a type of white blood cell called a memory T-cell, if &quot;trained&quot;, can rapidly recognise and kill the TB bacteria. New research also suggests that antibodies, once thought to have no role in protection, can interact with other cells to kill TB bacteria. We aim to investigate these specific components and how they can protect against development of disease in the human lung. This will give us clues how to design protective interventions against TB.  The best way to eradicate TB is by developing an effective vaccine. Yet the current vaccine used in many countries, BCG, only protects against TB in children and offers little protection in adults, especially in countries where TB is common. About 20 new vaccines are being evaluated but the development process is very long (10 to 15 years) and expensive (about  &#xA3;800 million from start to finish) and most vaccines will fail in the late stages of human testing. Thus, we need a new efficient and more affordable approach, involving small numbers of patients, to choose the best vaccines to move to larger human studies. Another unresolved issue is how best to administer the vaccine. Traditionally, vaccines are given by injection in the skin but inhaling it directly into the lungs may better activate the protective responses against airborne infections like TB.  Our proposed study will attempt to address these unmet needs and unresolved questions by directly infecting the lungs of different groups of test participants (each group showing a different level of susceptibility against TB) with a live weakened strain of TB (called BCG) and examining the immune response before and after infection. This is called a controlled human infection model (CHIM). Such a model more accurately reflects how a person is naturally infected with TB. CHIM has been used in the past to develop vaccines for other disease such as cholera and malaria with great success. We have recently completed a study funded by the Gates Foundation and SA-MRC using a similar model where we have infected the lungs of healthy persons with BCG and a mixture of different proteins from TB bacteria (called PPD) and examined the immune response in the lungs after 3 days. We have established the safety of this CHIM in close to 100 participants. We now need to leverage these gains by using this model to now interrogate which specific aspects of the immune system are protective, refine the system to finalise a model that can be used to triage new vaccine candidates, and to determine the best route by which to administer new vaccines.</narrative>
