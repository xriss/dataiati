   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Engaging Young People in the Development of Digital Mental Health Innovation in Africa</narrative>

  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Mental health challenges are faced by 1 in 4 people globally, but in Low and Middle Income Countries (LMIC), up to 80% of people do not receive preventive or acute care . Digital mental health is seen as a promising route to address the treatment gap, but also raises ethical, legal and policy challenges. In LMICs, lack of ethics, governance and policy guidance can slow down or prevent translation of digital mental health innovations into the healthcare system. This impinges on the rights of individuals to access mental health technologies that arise from digital innovations. A further consequence of the lack of attention to ethics and governance challenges is that the balance of harms and benefits of digital mental health have not been properly identified and analysed.  The lack of analysis is likely to disproportionately affect young people, who are a key target for mental health interventions, and who also have distinctive individual and social vulnerabilities.  To address this problem, the network will bring together stakeholders and experts in the ethics of digital mental health, digital innovators, mental health practitioners, and policy makers across Africa. The chief aim is to develop a robust framework for responsible and relevant digital mental health interventions for young people in African countries. The cross-disciplinary network will have a group of young people at its core, who will co-create all its work and outputs. The network will use a stakeholder mapping surveys, workshops and interdisciplinary training and exchanges to achieve its aims. It will contribute not only to scholarship, but also to research capacity, co-production, inter-sector mobility, and democratic participation among young people.   Project activities will include: -Intensive training and capacity-building opportunities for early career researchers and young people (e.g. workshops; visiting scholar programmes); -Meetings and workshops to facilitate the transfer of knowledge among stakeholders; -Literature reviews to critically assess and synthesise existing work, identify gaps, and formulate research questions -Community engagement to inform empirical questions -With young people, co-create a sustainable engagement strategy to involve young people, with a focus on representation from vulnerable groups, such as LGBTQ+; sexual violence survivors; those living with HIV/AIDS  Young people will be at the core of the Network, integrated with expert groups of researchers in ethics and social sciences; service providers (app developers, mental health practitioners and researchers); religious congregations, policy and governance. This will ensure the network outputs reflect the needs of young people and that the framework is scalable and sustainable as it is co-produced with young people, researchers, service providers, and policy makers.     1.

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The core objective of the project is to: Build a network of experts and stakeholders to develop a framework for responsible and relevant digital mental health interventions for young people in African countries The specific objectives of the network are to: 1.Bring together UK based and African based relevant experts to develop a proposal to submit to phase II of the DIDA call -Core network members, advisors and strategic experts will meet to plan for phase II submission 2.Identify, recruit and formalize relations with stakeholders required to achieve network aims -A stakeholder analysis to identify the required stakeholders and profile their roles and influence in the phase II project will be conducted leading to formalization of relations 3.Conduct workshops with diverse groups of young people to identify their needs and preferences for digital mental health interventions -The information is essential for development of the phase II proposal 4.Through use of Early Career Researchers paired with mentors, conduct a survey in different African settings to identify risks, benefits and facilitators of, and barriers to, engagement among diverse groups of African young people with digital mental health interventions -This survey will provide data that will be useful in crafting the strategy for responsible and relevant digital mental health interventions for young people in African countries 5.Conduct a workshop with representation of key stakeholders, including community leadership,  to develop a full proposal for submission to phase II DIDA call  -This will be a key output (network legacy plans, including a submission to the second round of DIDA funding) of phase I 6.Facilitate the sharing of knowledge about responsible digital tools and relevant digital tools  among young people, ethicists, service providers (technology companies, mental health practitioners), and policymakers (guidance and standard operating procedures) -A framework for responsible and relevant research in digital mental health is our second key output, and will enable and empower the research in our phase II submission The network will address the following overarching question: What constitutes a robust framework for responsible and relevant digital mental health interventions for young people in African countries? We will formulate methodologies to address the following specific questions. (Where we refer to &apos;diverse groups of young people&apos; we mean to identify vulnerable groups that are often left out of mental health research e.g. LGBTQIA+; sexual violence survivors; people living with HIV/AIDS from the ages of 12-25) 1.Which digital mental health &apos;interventions&apos; reach and engage young people in Africa?  a.What digital mental health interventions are in the development pipeline for this population? b.Which groups of young people have been reached through digital mental health interventions, and which groups have not been reached? 2.What are the key ethical, policy and governance implications of digital mental health interventions for young people in the African context?  a.How was &apos;digital mental health&apos; conceived, and which methodologies were used to inform this understanding? 3.What do diverse groups of young people identify as the key risks, benefits, facilitators of, and barriers to, involvement with digital mental health applications?  a.How do these perspectives compare and contrast to the findings in (1&amp;2)? b.Do these perspectives differ among groups depending on vulnerabilities? 4.What, if any, potential for young people&apos;s participation in mental health advocacy do digital platforms provide?  a.Does participation in digital mental health advocacy resonate with young people as a form of expression of their &apos;digital rights&apos;? b.Should such opportunities to participate be responsibly designed into mental health apps? c.Would such opportunities expand the reach of digital mental health interventions among African young people?</narrative>
