   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This work is undertaken in the context of the UK-China &quot;Marine Development Feasibility Studies&quot; call. This call was developed through a joint workshop between the UK and China research councils. As part of this workshop, four key areas were identified as critical to the development of wave and tidal energy in China. The research proposed here spans across two of these areas: &quot;Increasing Survivability&quot; and &quot;Holistic Integrated Design Tools&quot;.   More specifically, the aims and objectives of the present work address important questions related to &quot;Understanding the system dynamics to increase reliability and survivability&quot;. In the context of holistic design tools, the research addresses improvements in &quot;CFD techniques (including potential flow models) to assess fluid structure interactions&quot;.   These two key elements of the present work are tightly linked, with one building upon the other. Whilst enhanced CFD techniques act as important design tools for wave energy conversion (WEC) developers, they are also urgently required to enable and understanding of WEC loading regimes. A firm understanding of loading regimes, in turn, will lead to improved design for survivability. These novel techniques are also crucial in addressing issues related to device reliability and fatigue loading. In addressing these challenges, the understanding of viscous effects and nonlinearities are central.  The enhanced physical understanding of both viscous effects and nonlinearity in wave structure interactions is believed to stimulate the development of wave energy extraction in both China and the UK. In the case of China, this is hoped to reduce the high dependence on fossil resources currently imported from abroad. For the UK, the development of wave energy is an important element in meeting the long-term CO2 emission targets.  The new unified model to be developed in this project will lead to a more efficient and accurate coupling method for the prediction of hydrodynamic characteristics, dynamic loadings and fatigue effects. Taken as a whole, this provides the base for the improved design of floating WECs, their survivability, and practical maintenance.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="The present work seeks to address the research question  Could novel viscous-nonlinear-potential flow modelling approaches lead to significant improvements in predicting (a) highly dynamic loading and (b) survival loads for WECs?  With the overarching research question in mind, and building upon the latest advances in the description of extreme wave climates for both the UK and China, the research aims are:  (1) To significantly improve the confidence in load predictions for WECs, in both dynamic and survival regimes  (2) Through existing in-house experimental data and numerical modelling, clearly identify the competing influences of: a. Extreme and dynamic load variation due to nonlinearity b. Extreme and dynamic load variation due to viscous dissipation  (3) Define an extended research agenda for the development of viscous-nonlinear potential flow modelling."></capital-spend>
