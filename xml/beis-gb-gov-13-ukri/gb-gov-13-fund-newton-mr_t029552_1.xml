   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Development of antimicrobial peptides against Gram-negative antibiotic resistant pathogens</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The overall aim of this project is, by collaborative research with UK partners, to accelerate antibiotic drug discovery to address Gram-negative drug resistance in South Africa (SA) and through this endeavour establish a long-lasting legacy in antimicrobial resistance (AMR) research in SA. In this project we will improve the success of pre-clinical efficacy studies by transforming hit-to-lead and lead optimisation studies of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). AMPs are an important class of compounds that have notable bactericidal, immunomodulatory and anti-biofilm capabilities. As such they are promising leads for the development of novel antibiotics for both topical and, as shown recently, intravenous applications and as radiolabeled infective-selective imaging agents (tracer) for non-invasive molecular imaging. AMPs will be therefore evaluated for both topical and systemic, intravenous, administration, notably addressing indications including bacterial keratitis and neonatal sepsis which are of particular concern in South Africa and where existing therapies are increasingly compromised by the well documented rise in AMR.  For this project there will be ten objectives:   1) Explore the diversity of AMPs that can be isolated from indigenous South African species including ticks, frogs and mosquitoes. 2) Evaluation of synergistic peptide combinations with classical antibiotics, repurposed drugs and other AMPs.  3) Evaluation of candidate peptides for toxicity and stability for therapeutic applications. 4) Understand the mechanism of action of selected candidate peptides/combinations to enable lead development.  5) Rational design of peptide analogues with increased antibacterial potency against relevant drug resistant Gram-negative pathogens.  6) Further investigation of the efficacy of lead peptides with relevant ex vivo and in vivo (Galleria mellonella) models of infection. 7) Adapt existing mouse models of pulmonary infection for use in the evaluation of the imaging agent.  8) Evaluate the toxicity profile of the lead peptide candidate(s) considered for intravenous administration in the murine infection model. 9) Develop a radiolabeling solution to allow for complexation of radioactive gallium-68 ([68Ga]Ga) to create an AMP based tracer. 10) Show the gallium-68-labeled peptide is capable of selectively visualizing Gram-negative bacterial infection via positron emission tomography (PET) imaging and evaluate [68Ga]Ga-citrate-PET and [18F]FDS-PET as a biomarker for serial monitoring of response to peptide-based antibiotic therapy.   Through this process we aim to enhance links between researchers in both countries building capacity in AMR research at the University of Pretoria (UP), North West University (NWU) the Nuclear Medicine Research Infrastructure (NuMeRI) and Sefako Makgatho University (SMU). In the UK the accelerator will enable a network comprising King&apos;s College London, The Universities of Warwick and Sheffield and the National Infection Service, Public Health England to create novel and robust models to evaluate this class of antibiotic. Consequently, the accelerator will show how AMPs, as a class, can fulfil their potential to be developed through the pre-clinical phase of antibiotic drug-discovery.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The underuse and overuse of antibiotics has resulted in Gram-negative bacteria becoming resistant to known antibiotics. Although this is a global problem, the lack of new antibiotics and alternative therapy is of concern especially in SA, where patients with a weakened immune system, such as those with HIV, are highly susceptible to infection. The diagnosis of Gram-negative infections is often difficult, especially when these occur deep in the body. The resistance to antibiotics used to treat these infections makes the situation worse as the infection progresses undetected and so both new antibiotics and new ways of monitoring the success of treatment are urgently needed.    This is a global crisis and only through an international collaborative scientific effort, will new antibiotics be discovered. An important aspect of this process is to build capacity in peptide based antibiotic drug discovery. A focus of such an endeavour is to provide scientists from historically disadvantaged backgrounds and institutions in SA the opportunity to be leaders in this field of research. Through this process, the training of the next generation of scientists is essential to ensure a continued success to find novel approaches to combat the perpetual threat of evolving bacterial infections, especially in the context of unique health care challenges in South Africa.   One such approach is based on using antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), nature&apos;s own antibiotics which have remained effective throughout evolutionary history, but which have yet to make a breakthrough into clinical use. AMPs are key components of the innate immune system of a huge variety of living organisms, including humans, and have the ability to eradicate infection. Now, to show that AMPs can be developed as antibiotics for therapeutic application in patients we will learn how to modify them to increase their safety and stability. We will also ensure that they are more likely to work in patient by testing them in conditions that match more closely the patient infection setting. Existing methods of laboratory antibiotic testing are deficient as they often under- or over-estimate the potency of different types of antibiotic, most notably AMPs .   As well as treating patients, we want to use AMPs to monitor their recovery or tell us when other antibiotics should be given. We will adapt imaging techniques, recently developed to study brain activity or find tumours and reveal the success of radio- and/or chemo-therapy. AMPs can be modified to carry a radioactive tracer and will circulate around the body before homing in on the bacteria causing infection. The tracer that is attached is used for either positron-emission tomography (PET) or single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) where a relatively low, and hence safe, dose of gamma rays is emitted. The intensity and location of the PET or SPECT signal can be mapped in the body in three dimensions to give the location and extent of any infection and to signal when, e.g. a localised infection starts to spread around the body. Since AMPs selectively target bacteria radiolabeling can provide a rapid, noninvasive method for infection imaging and with the correct antibiotic treatment, rapid patient recovery with reduced risk of antibiotic resistance development.   Through Newton funding a UK and SA collaboration will be established to accelerate the innovative discovery of new AMP-based antibiotics. Through increased mobility and exchange of UK and SA researchers from UP, NWU and SMU, links between researchers in both countries will be strengthened and new partnerships will be developed with the possible establishment of a global pre-competitive drug discovery consortium. This process has a further benefit and that is the strengthening of the strategic relationship between the UK and South Africa.</narrative>
