   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Our GCRF TRADE Hub addresses a global challenge that has led to dramatic decline in biodiversity and ecosystem resilience in the past century, and if not addressed will significantly imperil the development of lower income nations. Trade in wildlife and agricultural commodities from low and middle income to higher income countries has increased rapidly over the last decades, and is projected to expand rapidly into the future to meet  demands. Although trade is vital for national development, it also can carry heavy environmental and social costs, particularly for poor rural people in DAC countries, mainly because there is a great imbalance of power within the decision-making system and the most affected people are relatively powerless and voiceless in the decision-making process. The development of these trades over the past decades have has also resulted in considerable impacts on natural systems, threatening with extinction thousands of species globally. Addressing the issue of balancing the positives of ever-expanding trade with its costs is essential to addressing several of the SDGs, to protect and promote livelihoods within vulnerable communities in DAC countries, and is important for the UK in terms of negotiating sustainable trade deals that also meet other environmental and social development commitments.   The Hub will work on a number of key trade flows that are particularly important to our focal developing countries and the UK, and where we have existing strengths that will allow us to have real impact in the lifetime of the Hub. This will include trade that has a direct impact on biodiversity - for example the global trade in wildlife for a range of uses, including the regional and national trade in wild meat. It will also include agricultural commodity trades that have indirect impacts on biodiversity through conversion or degradation of habitats. Its strong international and interdisciplinary research team, including economists, trade modellers, political scientists, ecologists and development scientists, will produce novel, impact-orientated research. Through involving companies, UN-related trade bodies and governments, the project will be embedded in the needs of the economy and development at large.    We have ten work packages: During the project design phase WP0 will further elaborate a detailed theory of change and mapping exercise leading to the co-design of the research programme with critical stakeholders (private sector actors, trade organisations and NGOs). This will lead into the delivery of eight interlinked work packages: WP1: Understanding wildlife trade from DAC countries (live animals, skins, non-timber products, wildmeat) at the supply end; volumes and characteristics of local and export trade, and impacts on biodiversity and resource users; WP2: Understanding supply to demand-end agricultural commodity trade pathways, volumes and characteristics, within and exported from DAC countries; WP3: Determining the magnitude and spatial-temporal distribution of social benefits and costs for selected wildlife and commodity supply chains from the supply to demand ends; WP4: Understanding how trade and economic policies impact on wild-sourced and agricultural commodity trades and their impact on people and nature; WP5: Modelling the implementation of different scenarios of trade policy and corporate decision making; WP6: Developing solutions and building capacity through engagement with the private sector (large corporations and investors); WP7: Developing solutions and building capacity, through engaging with trade public sector rule-setting agencies and national policy makers; WP8: Outreach and Technology Solutions. We also have a cross-cutting WP9: building DAC partner capacity to ensure ongoing, sustainable research-led solutions to TRADE&apos;s intractable challenge. We involved DAC countries, corporations, investment bodies, and UN-linked trade agencies in the co-design of this Hub from the outset.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="1) To work with developing country researchers, civil society and governments, international organisations focused on trade policies, as well as corporations and investors, to co-design impact-orientated interdisciplinary research on global trade that will feed directly into decision-making at multiple scales.  2) To gather field data on trade in specific wildlife species (wild-caught and captive-raised) and agricultural commodities, and synthesise with statistics and models, to develop a detailed understanding of a number of key trades that impact particularly heavily on biodiversity and people in key DAC countries.  3) To use these datasets to assess the environmental and social costs and benefits of selected trade flows and markets, with an emphasis on wildlife, major agricultural commodities such as soybean and oil palm, and emerging locally important crops in developing countries.  4) To further develop incipient databases and models of the extent, characteristics and impacts of wildlife trade (https://trademapper.aptivate.org/; https://www.cifor.org/bushmeat/resources/bushmeat-data-map/), and agricultural commodity trade (https://trase.earth/?lang=en) on the environment and human well-being, into powerful and spatially explicit tools to assist corporate and national compliance with environmental and investment pledges and standards at local to international scales.  5) To build on an existing global model of land use systems (the IIASA GLOBIOM model: http://www.globiom.org/), using scenarios developed by the IPCC, IPBES and others to project how changes in global trading systems might facilitate more sustainable trading systems with lower environmental and social costs.  6) To use these models and empirical findings to identify local to global solutions to trade and market-related related sustainability problems, and work through the Hub network to study and actively promote the implementation of these solutions at multiple, interacting, scales.  7) To engage with partners in a range of sectors to define the best ways to influence global trade flows and national and sub-national markets to mitigate their potential environmental impacts and associated social costs and maximise their benefits at multiple scales.   8) To work with the public sector decision-making bodies involved with global trade management to work to influence trade decisions at various scales.   9) To frame all results in the context of the SDGs and the Aichi Biodiversity Targets, and the work programmes of the CBD and CITES conventions, to maximise policy uptake  10) To build capacity in DAC countries to address trade-related issues through research and policy engagement, and the creation and strengthening of regional hubs of research excellence, thereby enabling DAC partners to contribute more effectively to impactful decision-making processes at the local, national and international scales."></capital-spend>
