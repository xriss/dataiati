   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Available meteorological records show that the world&apos;s weather is becoming more variable and more extreme and that these extremes are becoming more costly in terms of both insured and uninsured losses to infrastructure, crops, housing and natural ecosystems.  The relative impact of, and vulnerability to, these events is highest in developing economies.  In Mexico the economic cost of extreme events increased 30x between 1980-99 and 2000-2012 and climate change projections indicate that the country will experience more extreme weather, as well as more intense droughts. Within Mexico, the Yucatan peninsula has been identified as being unusually vulnerable to climate change in part because of its low rainfall, high temperatures and frequent tropical storms (including the most intense hurricanes), but also because of the continuing importance of small scale, near subsistence farming and fishing and a high indigenous (Maya) population who are  economically disadvantaged.  Better understanding of what makes communities, and particular sectors of communities, more or less resilient in the face of extreme weather events will help in the development of effective adaptation strategies at local, regional and national scales in a context of a changing climate.  Achieving this means drawing together researchers from a range of disciplinary backgrounds (spanning the natural and social sciences and humanities) to develop a common research methodology.   For this research to be relevant and practical in terms of real world problems, it also needs to be developed with input from the potential users and/or beneficiaries of the work.  This project brings together a team of experts from UK and Mexican research institutions, all of whom have experience of working in the Yucatan on different aspects of weather and climate (especially drought) but largely with a particular focus (e.g. the role of gender in understanding and coping with extreme weather, ecosystem sensitivity to drought).  Here, they will work together and with our existing networks of federal and state government agencies (such as the Secretariat for the Environment and Natural Resources (SEMARNAT), the Gender and Environment Network (RGMA), the Secretariat for Urban Development and Environment Yucatan (SEDUMA) and the National Protected Areas Commission (CONANP)) and community groups (e.g U&apos;yool&apos;che a sustainable agriculture collective).  This work will be focused on three specific study regions, one on the north coast of the peninsula where hurricanes are a particular problem and two further south, where drought is more of a concern, one where subsistence farming dominates and one where commercial agriculture is more important.   These geographically specific studies will be complemented by work to exploit the availability of new, high resolution satellite imagery from the ESA&apos;s Sentinel-2 and -3 platforms to track landuse and vegetation change and work on the data available from the region&apos;s network of meteorological stations.  Taken together these approaches will allow a fuller assessment of which parts of the peninsula are most vulnerable to extreme events and the impacts these have on the natural and managed environment, of what makes communities more or less vulnerable and their strategies for adaptation.  The specific goal will be to develop a protocol for determining resilience which will support policy makers and communities in making decisions about how to cope more effectively with the negative impacts of a changing climate on economic development and quality of life through better understanding and improved communication.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="The purpose of this project is to develop more effective methodologies for assessing resilience to extreme weather events (hurricanes and droughts) based on case studies from the Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico, with an initial focus on farming and fishing communities. This will be achieved by:   - Developing an interdisciplinary network across three universities (one UK, two Mexican) and one research institute (Mexico)  - Using three pilot projects in communities in areas where project partners have existing activity to develop a genuinely interdisciplinary methodology based on a shared understanding   of what is meant by an extreme weather event, how its impacts can be assessed and what factors (environmental, social, cultural, political, economic) determine resilience  - Exploring differences both within and between communities in relation to these determining influences  - Developing existing and new links with government agencies and other user and community groups concerned with social, cultural, economic and environmental sustainability to involve them in the research life cycle  - Exploiting products from the ESA&apos;s Sentinel-2 and -3 platforms to look at the impacts of extreme events at improved spatial and temporal resolution  - Updating and improving the analysis and mapping of meteorological data to yield a more comprehensive understanding of patterns of change and their potential climatological forcings across the peninsula  - Holding a workshop to bring together potential users and beneficaries of the research and to work with them to finalise a research protocol for assessing resilience that is relevant and useful  - Building capacity and providing opportunities for the development of early career researchers and students in both countries through employment opportunities, experience of interdisciplinary working and bursaries."></capital-spend>
