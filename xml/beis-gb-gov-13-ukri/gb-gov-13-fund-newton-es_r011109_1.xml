  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">During the transition between conflict and peace, demobilized individuals have few opportunities to enter the job market. This is particularly critical in Colombia where more than 3 million people live in areas affected by the conflict and have now started their journey into peace. In this setting, one possible alternative is to develop entrepreneurial ventures. However, the entrepreneurial endeavors developed by former combatants have a low rate of success. Considering these aspects, the proposed research has the following research questions:  1) What are the methodological strategies that can be used effectively to develop entrepreneurial capabilities among the demobilized population? 2) What are the individual and collective barriers that these entrepreneurs face to develop their businesses? 3) How can an entrepreneurial ecosystem be promoted in areas where former combatants are located? 4) How can entrepreneurship be used as a mechanism for peace?  Based on this research questions this proposal aims at designing, developing, and implementing a methodology that promotes peace agents in conflict areas by using the entrepreneurial method. With this proposed action research, the team seeks to train and accompany entrepreneurship processes both at the individual and communal levels. During the stages of training and accompaniment, the project will employ the capabilities developed by former combatants in a war context to foster the development of entrepreneurial capabilities in a peaceful context. It will also be necessary to identify the barriers that demobilized individuals face to develop entrepreneurship. Based on those barriers, the project will promote ecosystems that favor the development of entrepreneurship. The central goal of this research is to empower former combatants so that they can identify problems in their communities, as well as develop and test different solutions to address them. This is a way to reduce the issues caused by the lack of formal institutions, promote the generation of productive processes, and encourage a peaceful coexistence by addressing problems instead of avoiding them.  The novelty of this project relies on its ability to generate contributions on three critical dimensions. First, to develop a new methodological approach to transform the capabilities developed in a war context in entrepreneurial capabilities that can be used in a peaceful context. Second, to promote ecosystems for entrepreneurship in peaceful contexts. Third, to identify the barriers and drivers (both at the individual and community levels) to develop entrepreneurial capabilities among former combatants.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">General objective: To develop an entrepreneurial ecosystem in the concentration areas where demobilized individuals are located.  The specific objectives of this proposal are: To design and implement tools that develop entrepreneurial capabilities taking into consideration the specific context of the demobilized population - this will enable to foster access to entrepreneurship.  To accompany entrepreneurial processes - This will allow us to contribute to the increase the success rate of entrepreneurial ventures in demobilized areas  To identify the barriers and drivers (at the community and individual levels) that demobilized individuals face to develop entrepreneurship - This will allow us to devise, establish and test effective mechanisms to help individuals and their communities in these areas   And finally to promote the development of entrepreneurial ecosystems in the concentration areas where demobilized individuals are located - this will ensure that our efforts for entrepreneurship are sustained over time and that local entrepreneurs  commit to their entrepreneurial endeavors for longer periods of time.</narrative>
