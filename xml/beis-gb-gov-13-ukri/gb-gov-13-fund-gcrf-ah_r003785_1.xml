   <narrative xml:lang="EN">e-Voices: Redressing Marginality brings together a global network of academics and practitioners to explore the theme of marginalisation and how digital media can be used to support marginalised groups to make their voices heard within and beyond the borders of their communities to promote social inclusion. This network aims to document these emblematic uses to promote discussion and exchange of ideas, and to enable adaptation and adoption by similar groups within and across countries. In particular, the network is going to explore three case studies: how favela residents in Brazil are using digital media to foster community engagement and active citizenship, how Kenyan artists are using digital tools to promote a dialogue around human rights and power structures and how development organisations working with displaced population in Syria are using digital technologies to foster peace, and reconciliation in the country.   To do so, the network leverage the experience and expertise of its core partnership Bournemouth University in the UK (PI), Universidade Federal Fluminense (UFF) in Brazil (Co-I),  TCF/SparkLab in Syria, and PAWA254 in Kenya. The network also includes a consistent number of members coming from local institutions, local organisations, activists, and academics, namely: - Brazilian activists and local organisations: Youth Forum of Rio de Janeiro, Mare Vive, Coletivo Papo Reto, Coletivo Piratininga de Comunica&#xE7;&#xE3;o/ NGOs- Rio on Watch, catalytic communities, Amnesty International - Kenyan artists and local organisations: The Nest, who worked with LGBT communities, Osborne Marcharia, who have albinism or dwarfism (Osborne Macharia), Ng&apos;endo Mukii, who worked with migrants.  - Development organisations working in Syria: Syrian Telecentres Project-Salamieh, Telecentre &amp; Studies Centre for Handicapped Research, Community organizers network  e-Voices: Redressing Marginality is structured in 5 main events over 12 months: - Event 1: kick-off meeting - December 2017, Bournemouth UK, including 20 Participants: A representative from each institution involved in the network + several academics from Bournemouth University, and 3 UK academics experts in the field. - Event 2: Digital Activism in Brazilian Favelas - March 2018, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, including 30 Participants: A representative from each institution involved in the network + representatives from local organisations, city hall government, mainstream media, and local academics from UFF and UFRJ.

  <capital-spend percentage="e-Voices: Redressing Marginality brings together academics in diverse fields of Media and Communication (Animation, Digital Media for Development, Social Communication, Political Communication) and practitioners in Kenya, Syria and Brazil who are or have been engaged in using digital communication strategies to end or combat marginalisation.   The network explores three in-depth case studies, in which high-risk, marginalised communities use digital media as a tool to overcome their marginalisation. In particular, the network will document: - Favela residents in Brazil and their use of digital media to push for active citizenship and participation in their country&apos;s political system. - Use of artistic strategies in Kenya whereby artists can re-present marginalised groups, such as the LGBT, migrant or the disabled communities, through storytelling and visual aesthetic forms to speak powerfully about their lives and identities, document their everyday experiences, and their uses of digital spaces and technologies to disseminate these.  - Displaced groups and refugees in Syria, who are using digital media to promote peace and reconciliation in their devastated country.  The network will promote discussion among members and participants, in order to: 1. Report emblematic uses of digital media to document everyday experiences of marginalised groups in order to build bridges to the wider, international public sphere; 2. Track the process from community building to communication, to gaining a share of voice and having impact; 3. Identify similarities and peculiarities of this process in each in-depth case study; 4. Reflect on ethically sound methodologies to approach marginalised and at risk groups, to collect data and identify good practices without exposing them to the risk of further harm;  5. Identify trends and opportunities for global practitioners, activists, and development institutions to craft services and content based on end-users&apos; most common practices and applications of digital media."></capital-spend>
