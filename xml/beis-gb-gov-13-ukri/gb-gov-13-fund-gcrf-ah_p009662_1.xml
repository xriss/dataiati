   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Performing Living Knowledge: Developing a replicable model for arts-based empowerment of marginalised  urban communities in Uganda and Malawi</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">1. The proposal aims to substantially upscale and embed the impact activities and embodied legacies of INTERSECTION&apos;s work in Uganda and implement this approach within the new context of Malawi. 2.     The primary objective of this project is to develop a well-documented, evidenced and replicable model for arts-based, dialogic community empowerment. The model enables expression, in a nuanced manner, of the complexity of community concerns and issues, and utilises community-based research and arts to give effective voice to poor communities in Africa, both horizontally - community to community, and vertically - community to relevant stakeholders and policy makers. 3. The project will promote community cohesion through creating confidence and non-confrontational mechanisms for equitable debate across generation and gender divisions, that can lead to real representation and voice for all members of the community in deciding and acting on community concerns and priorities. 4. The project will give poor and marginalised communities the tools, voice and confidence to raise legitimate concerns, aspirations and rights issues to local stakeholders and policy makers in an effective and impactful manner, enabling communities to hold them to account for decisions and actions affecting those communities. 5. The project will show how a dialogic process of arts-based practice, coupled with embodied learning, debate and community-based research enables a virtuous circle of action and reflection that can lead to the development of critical thinking which forms a firm basis for community activism. 6. The project will develop means through which communities, HE organisations and NGOs, using arts in relation to development, can work in equal partnership, developing replicable models for effective arts-based research, activism, training and project delivery. 7. The project challenges the current dominant model for the use of the arts amongst NGOs and donors across Africa that relies almost exclusively on hiring professional arts makers to deliver message based material advocating aims pre-determined by international donors, based on insufficient or non-existent community research; and fails to provide any meaningful evidence of community engagement or impact (Marsh &amp; Gould 2004, Plastow 2014). In its place it will offer well evidenced methodologies, co-produced research and impactful activity emerging from sustained collaboration and mutual learning between communities and HE organisations 8. The project will work with the only training institution for arts and development in Malawi, Chancellor College, University of Malawi and the Malawian NGO, Youth Net and Counselling (YONECO), to enable them to re-vision, re-view and re-conceive their teaching, training and delivery of arts-based development activity, learning from participation in and with a community-led process. 9. The project will produce an online multi-media manual, a book of experiences and learning co-written with communities in Uganda and Malawi available freely online and in purchasable print, and short films on impact to evidence the methodology and findings of the project, for use by other community groups, relevant HE organisations, relevant NGOs and donors. All these will be co-researched, written and produced by all project participant groupings. 10.  The project will disseminate its findings widely in all three national contexts, using performance, web technology, presentations at conferences and symposia, relevant user networks and conventional publishing outlets.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project builds on the arts and social science activities pioneered by the Uganda strand of the AHRC funded INTERSECTION project, under the Care for the Future programme. The project worked over 20 months with 60+ volunteer members of a working class community in Walukuba, Jinja, in eastern Uganda. It built an intergenerational, inter-ethnic, inter-religious, cross-gender community group of widely divergent educational attainment; that engaged in a sustained process of embodied arts-based action research and dialogic debate emerging from locally identified environmental concerns. The project led to both horizontal - community to community, and vertical - community to stake holders and policy makers - interventions and knowledge exchange events combining performance and debate. Marked gains in community cohesion, confidence, advocacy and activism were achieved (McQuaid &amp; Plastow 2017; film &apos;We Are Walukuba&apos;  https://vimeo.com/171216540/e04de5b695). The group registered as a Community Based Organisation &apos;We Are Walukuba&apos; in November 2015 in recognition of the transformative value participants ascribed to the project.  This proposal builds on the unforeseen achievements, beyond original research aims, of the group and our Frierean-inspired methodology (Friere, 1970) that invoked a virtuous circle of action (arts-based embodied exploration of of issues identified as concerning the community) and reflection (group discussion of critical reflections generated by activities undertaken), and appetite expressed by the community to continue to work together and build their skills to become more effective community advocates. In consultation with We Are Walukuba - henceforth WAW - it was agreed that what the group needed in order become self-sustaining in the longer term, and to complete the transformation into a group of self-confident independent advocates for their community, was targeted training by experts in a range of arts and organisational skills. The skills needed were discussed in a series of community meetings with WAW, Plastow and McQuaid in August 2016. It was agreed these would be delivered in 1-2 week blocks where workers could take time out of work and mothers could be provided with child care. Each group of 6-12 trainees would undertake to in turn pass on the skills acquired to the wider group. The impact of this first stage of the project will be evidenced by a series of community organised performative and knowledge exchange events utilising the skills acquired.  The second stage of the work is focused on scaling up the project; demonstrating how it provides a replicable model for arts-based, dialogic community empowerment, by reproducing its essential stages, learnt from the Uganda experience, over a four month period in an analogous working class community (Mtogolo village) in Zomba, Malawi. Building on the particular knowledges and contacts of our Malawian Researcher, Zindaba Chisiza, we will collaborate with a local HE partner- the Department of Performing Arts, University of Malawi, and a local arts-based NGO, YONECO. We will enable all three parties, working as equals, to mutually learn, both a new methodology for community engagement, and to share the knowledges and perspectives of all concerned about the community-selected broad topic under investigation.   The final 3 months of the project will be given over to: *  co-production of a co-authored community book sharing the experiences of the project in both sites *  co-production of a manual in the form of a multi-media website, explaining the methodology of the project *  supporting Chancellor College in reviewing and reforming its arts for development curriculum in the light of the project *  supporting the NGO in reviewing and reforming its arts for development training and approach *  dissemination events in Uganda, Malawi and the UK *  evaluation of the impact of the work in both Malawi and Uganda and on all involved in the project.</narrative>
