   <narrative xml:lang="EN">One of the factors that significantly impinges on the quality of life among elderly people is a decrease in salivary flow (hyposalivation) and a dry mouth (xerostomia). The prevalence of xerostomia increases with age and affects approximately 30% of people aged 65 or older. Xerostomia leads to problems with speech, taste digestion, mastication and swallowing, and a high incidence of dental caries and candida. There is no cure but chewing gum and artificial saliva are used to relieve the symptoms in many cases. Given the large numbers of sufferers, and the potential increase in incidence given our aging population, it is important to understand the mechanisms that drive xerostomia so that new therapies can be found.   Xerostomia can be caused by a number of different factors. Certain medicines cause xerostomia as a side effect, while xerostomia is also a central feature of the auto-immune disease Sj&#xF6;gren Syndrome, which affects up to 3-4% of older adults. Xerostomia is also a feature of some genetic disorders that affect the salivary glands, such as LADD syndrome and ALSG, and is frequently a side effect of head and neck radiotherapy. We aim to study xerostomia using various mouse models of gland dysfunction and regeneration.  This application aims to combine knowledge of salivary gland development with knowledge of salivary gland stem cells from mouse and translate these findings into humans. This is possible through combining research from basic scientists in the UK and clinical researchers in Brazil, with the ultimate goal of creating innovative methods to treat xerostomia.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="Permanent salivary gland dysfunction is a common feature of head and neck cancer survivors (worldwide more than 550 000 new cases annually), Sjogren patients (up to 3% of the general population) and the elderly. Chronic dry mouth leads to a dramatic loss in quality of life as it affects general physiological functions - such as mastication, gustation and speech- and current treatments are only symptomatic and often unsatisfactory. The overall aim of the project is to provide an improved therapy through salivary gland tissue regeneration by: 1. Understanding the basic science of salivary gland development, based on in vitro assays, in vivo animal models and validating the findings in human tissue. 2.  Identifying and characterizing in animal models multipotent progenitor cells capable of regenerating salivary gland tissue. 3. Validating findings obtained in Aim2 in human tissue using a bank of human normal and pathological salivary gland tissue."></capital-spend>
