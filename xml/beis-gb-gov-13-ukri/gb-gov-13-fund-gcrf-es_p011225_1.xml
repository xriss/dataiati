  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">&apos;Knowledge in Action for Urban Equality&apos; (henceforth KNOW) will address the challenge of achieving urban equality in cities in the Global South. The SDG 11, to achieve cities which are safe, inclusive, resilient and sustainable, and the New Urban Agenda adopted at Habitat III in Quito, 2016, emphasise inequality as one of the main obstacles to achieving prosperity and resilience in cities. KNOW focuses on building capacity to research urban equality in the developing world and among ODA researchers in the UK. The project brings together a collaborative, interdisciplinary, and international team to develop innovative long-term programmes of knowledge co-production for urban equality among governments, communities, businesses, and academia.   The objectives of KNOW are:  1. Transformative Research for Urban Equality: to co-produce knowledge to activate transformations towards urban equality in selected cities in the global south, with a focus on redistributive and integrated actions to address prosperity, resilience and extreme poverty. This research will engage with diverse groups of people and aspects of their lives which often go unrecognised, unmeasured, or made invisible in nine cities of the Global South.  Firstly, it will give them agency within a process of knowledge co-production. Secondly, it will generate missing data and ideas needed to develop policy, planning and governance approaches that are responsive to real lives, opportunities and processes in the cities where they are applied. For communities, the project will support processes to improve recognition and participation in urban governance, and deliver context-specific projects whose outcomes will benefit them directly.  For local governments, the project will help to develop, implement and assess policy and strategies to deliver urban equality.  2. Building Research Capacity: to build and strengthen research capacity in selected DAC countries and the UK to tackle the challenges and opportunities of vulnerable urban communities through partnerships of equivalence between networks and organisations of the poor, government, the private sector and academia.  KNOW will expand the capacities of a wide variety of actors to participate in collaborative knowledge production and pathways to impact prosperity, resilience and extreme poverty in the selected cities. This involves defining research problems together with key city actors; involving both experts and urban citizens together in learning-by-doing research processes; development an ethics of practice; and integrating impact strategies in the research process.    3. Developing Urban Learning Hubs: to jointly build responsive Urban Learning Hubs in target countries to co-produce relevant knowledge to analyse, plan, monitor and compare city progress towards national and global goals on urban equality, in particular the SDGs and the Habitat III New Urban Agenda. Through the programme of research, the project will strengthen Urban Learning Hubs in selected cities and regions.  This will involve consolidating networks of actors with the interest in and capability to address multiple dimensions of urban equality in each location. The outcome will be context specific Urban Learning Hubs that can act as intermediaries between multiple actors delivering research and action for urban equality.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Urban equality refers to the possibility of attaining an even distribution of access to resources, services and opportunities, as well as recognition of social diversity and inclusion in decisions that affects urban citizens&apos; lives. Increasing rates of urban inequality since the 1990s affect directly prosperity and resilience outcomes in urban areas. Increasing rates of urban inequality hold back economic, social and political progress and can contribute to conflicts and extreme poverty. In the age of urbanisation, with more than half of the World&apos;s population living in urban areas, achieving urban equality is a major global challenge. Three quarters of the World&apos;s urban areas are more unequal today than they were 20 years ago. Close to 1 billion people worldwide live in informal settlements, deprived of basic services and livelihood opportunities. The challenge of urban inequality has inspired a new global discourse on the future of cities and urban areas. The Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 11, the &apos;urban&apos; goal, emphasise the need to deliver inclusive cities. The New Urban Agenda (NUA) adopted by national governments in Quito, October 2016, asks for urban policies for a city that leave &apos;no one behind&apos;.  The project &apos;Knowledge in Action for Urban Equality&apos; (henceforth KNOW) seeks to develop research capacities in developing countries and in UK institutions that deliver ODA research, to deliver on the SDG11 and the NUA. KNOW focuses on the major knowledge gap in global policy agendas: delivering urban equality for inclusive cities of opportunities for all. The work programme focuses on three key challenges: achieving prosperity; building resilience to disasters and a changing climate; and addressing the persistent problem of extreme poverty.  The work programme is divided in six work packages. Three work packages focus on learning-by-doing, that is, doing research as a means to build capacity. Work Package 1 will deliver city-relevant research in several countries including Per&#xFA;, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Tanzania, Uganda, Sierra Leona, India, and Sri Lanka. In each case, KNOW will support the formation of a network of overseas and local academics, and stakeholders who will work together to identify the specific challenges associated with urban inequality that emerge in each city. Work Package 2 will use different case-based experiences to develop a comparative programme of research across cities, exploring the challenges of prosperity, resilience, and extreme poverty. Work Package 3 will focus on develop an &apos;Ethics of Practice&apos; for urban research, within the framework of the Global Challenges Research Fund. Three work packages will focus on delivering capacities to maximise the impact of research.  Work Package 4 will focus on how to translate research into practice, working with key policy makers, intermediaries, and activists to explore the development of urban policy following the programme of research in each city. Work Package 5 will focus on how to maximise the impact of research in education, particularly focusing on the education of planners in the Global South. Finally, Work Package 6 will examine the UK-based capacities to deliver ODA-research for urban equality, seeking to strength current areas of work and develop a new transdisciplinary field of research practice.  KNOW will be coordinated by the Bartlett Development Planning Unit, a recognised institution with a track record of 60+ years of applied research to deliver socially and environmentally just cities in the global south. KNOW also build on a consolidated network of partners in urban areas, capable to deliver an ambitions, international, and interdisciplinary urban research. These partners constitute the locus for a worldwide network of Urban Hubs that, strengthen by the experience in KNOW, will deliver a long-term agenda of research for urban equality.</narrative>
