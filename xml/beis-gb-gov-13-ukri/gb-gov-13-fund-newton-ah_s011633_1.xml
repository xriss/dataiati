   <narrative xml:lang="EN">OUR PAST, OUR FUTURE, ALL TOGETHER IN FAYNAN</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Faynan is an impoverished region of southern Jordan. It has a remarkable landscape of archaeology that has received more than 40 years of research, principally by UK, US and German research teams. The Department of Antiquities, supported by the AHRC funded &apos;Discovering WF16&apos;  (AH/P005594/1) project, has begun to develop a local museum with the joint aims of developing eco-tourism to generate income into the local community for sustainable development, and build community engagement with the museum for social cohesiveness and well-being. The objective of the &apos;Our Past, Our Future, All Together in Faynan&apos; project is to make a significant contribution to this task: to build community engagement with the Faynan Museum and facilities for eco-tourism to support social cohesiveness, individual well-being and sustainable economic development in Faynan.   This will be achieved via six work packages, each with their own objectives and of equal priority:  Objective and WP1: To re-design the museum by working with the Faynan community to co-create the gallery space to include representation of the last 100 years of Faynan&apos;s history. The current exhibition ends abruptly at the Ottoman period, inadvertently implying that the &apos;past is the past&apos;, having played no role in shaping the present day community, economy, politics and landscape.  It also fails to record the character and diversity of lifestyles in Faynan throughout the last century, these now rapidly being lost from memory.   Objective and WP2: To facilitate members of the local community to tell their own history and stories about Faynan in their own way, and represent this within the museum. The current exhibition tells the story of Faynan entirely from an external, western and academic perspective. It fails to provide an account of Faynan&apos;s history from the local community itself. What are their stories about Faynan? How are the stories of each tribe different from each other? What are their views about key events of the past that have shaped their present? How might the museum present their own view of history to themselves, their children, neighbours and visitors to Faynan?   Objective and WP3: To support the six schools in Faynan to develop an awareness and understanding of Faynan&apos;s cultural heritage, to provide educational resources and activities at the Faynan Museum, and to use these for teaching and learning across the curriculum.  Objective and WP4: To connect the museum to the landscape by installing information boards at a further 20 archaeological sites, ensuring these are discretely placed so as not to interfere with the natural landscape of Faynan and the walking experience it provides. One of the purposes of the museum exhibition is to guide visitors and members of the local community to sites in the landscape where there would be such discretely placed information boards. Because of previous limitations of funding, these have only been established for three of the 30 most significant archaeological sites in Faynan.   Objective and WP5: To make the cultural heritage of Faynan accessible to those unable to visit archaeological sites in its remote locations or to visit Faynan at all. This will make use of photogrammetry to document and make accessible a sample of Faynan&apos;s archaeological sites and artefacts via digital display in the museum and on the Faynan Heritage website.  Objective and WP6: To enable the museum to become a community hub by designing social and play space for adults and children in its immediate vicinity. In Faynan we need to counter the idea of a museum as a building that houses relics of the past only to be visited for educational matters. While such a museum might be valuable for short-term visitors to Faynan, and be appropriate for relatively affluent local communities, a museum of this type can only make a limited contribution to sustainable development in regions of economic deprivation.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Faynan is located south of the Dead Sea on the eastern side of Wadi Araba in southern Jordan. This is an economically deprived area, with pastoralism and irrigation-based farming providing livelihood to members of four Bedouin tribes who live within Faynan: the &apos;Ammarin, Sa&apos;idiyyin, Rashaydah and &apos;Azazmah. It has a remarkable archaeological landscape that has been discovered and explored by research teams from the UK, US and Germany over the last forty years, all with support from the Jordanian Department of Antiquities.  While there have been many academic publications, this cultural heritage has not been sufficiently used to support eco-tourism into Faynan which could be a major source of income for sustainable economic growth. Neither has the cultural heritage been made accessible to the local community and used to support social cohesiveness, education and well-being.   The establishment of the Faynan Museum by the Department of Antiquities has provided an opportunity to make progress on both of these matters. Between 2016 and 2018, an AHRC funded project (Discovering WF16) established the first displays within the museum and provided a small number of information boards at the archaeological sites. The success of that project demonstrated the value of further developing the museum.   This new project will involve a close collaboration between UK and Jordanian academics, and the Faynan community. It has the full support of the Jordanian Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities will make a step change in the ability of the museum to support the local community for sustainable development. By raising awareness and understanding, the project will also help protect and conserve the cultural heritage of Faynan in the face of an expansion of irrigation farming, road and dam development.  The project involves six sub-projects that will:  1. Co-create an enhanced gallery space to include representation of the last 100 years of Faynan&apos;s history within the musuem 2. Facilitate members of the local community to tell their own history and stories about Faynan in their own way, and represent this within the museum. 3. Support the six schools in Faynan to develop an awareness and understanding of Faynan&apos;s cultural heritage and embed this into the learning and teaching 4. Connect the museum to the landscape by installing information boards at a further 20 archaeological sites, 5. Make accessible the archaeological sites of Faynan to those who cannot visit Faynan or cannot access the sites in its remote areas by using photogrammetry to document and digitally represent the sites within the museum and on the Faynan heritage website 6. Enable the museum to become a community hub by designing social and play space for adults and children in its immediate vicinity.  Each of these projects will be developed jointly with members of the local community in Faynan via workshops. The outcome will be a museum that will support eco-tourism in the region, provide the local community with a means to represent their own history in their own way, support education, social and individual well-being, and help to protect and conserve Faynan&apos;s cultural heritage.</narrative>
