   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project will develop ideas and key issues arising from the Creative Lab on &quot;Social Change through Creativity and Culture&quot; held in Rio de Janeiro in October 2015. The Lab offered participants the opportunity to build project teams and at the end, creative project ideas were presented to a group of mentors and advisors who gave feedback. Participants will now have the opportunity to apply to QMUL/PPP for direct project funding to refine their ideas and develop them further.  It will:  * Support communication structures between November 2015-March 2016, providing translation and convening regular meetings between between the 20 Creative Lab participants, to support the continuing work of partnerships and working teams formed at the Creative Lab  * Set up and run a project grant application process to award individual grants to teams for the direct costs of making an anticipated 4-5 projects to be shown publicly in Rio&apos;s Multiplicity/Multiplicidade Festival in 2016, setting appropriate grant reporting structures in place  * provide infrastructure staffing and central resourcing (such as venues for making, equipment, etc) to support producing/production of the projects within Multiplicidade Festival 2016 in Rio de Janeiro  * provide a return visit to Rio de Janeiro for the UK participants to sustain their contribution to the project outcomes.</narrative>
