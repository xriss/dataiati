   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The research network brings together researchers and grassroots arts and culture organisations across four distinct socio-cultural and physical geographies - Cuba, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Jordan, and the UK - to explore the potential of arts and humanities based methodologies, specifically participatory photography and storytelling, for developing local and international educational capacity on climate change induced food and livelihoods insecurities.   Whilst climate change has generated a crisis of livelihoods, food insecurity, and internal and cross-border migration in Cuba, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Jordan, the issue has garnered relatively little international attention. What is more, whilst the focus of education provision and capacity building among dispersed and vulnerable populations has been the development of mobile technology and the top-down dissemination of targeted content, fewer initiatives have focussed on the use of participatory arts and humanities based methodologies, which not only facilitate a deeper engagement with local cultural and socio-political contexts, but also enable more collaborative and innovative bottom-up approaches to knowledge co-production and exchange.   The research network connects researchers, academic institutions, arts practitioners, and small-scale arts and culture NGOs in Cuba, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Jordan, and the UK, with each other, and with socio-economically vulnerable urban youth in Cuba, rural youth in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and and young refugees in informal settlements in Jordan. Network participants will co-facilitate and take part in participatory photography and storytelling workshops, local and international exhibitions of the work they produced, and local and international learning labs designed to promote evidence-based reflection on the practical potential of participatory photography and storytelling to for developing local and international educational models and materials for education on climate change. Based on the experiences, work and research produced as part of the participatory photography and storytelling workshops and learning labs, network participants will also co-produce locally-relevant materials on climate change induced food and livelihood insecurities and local solutions that can be developed to address them, and an open-access online module on climate change induced challenges in Cuba, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Jordan.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="The proposed network will bring together researchers and grassroots arts and culture organisations across four distinct socio-cultural and physical geographies - Cuba, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Jordan, and the UK - to explore the potential of arts and humanities based methodologies, specifically participatory photography and storytelling, for developing local and international educational capacity on climate change induced food and livelihoods insecurities. The main objectives of the research network are to:   (1) Bring together researchers, arts practitioners, NGOs, and affected communities in Cuba, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Jordan, and the UK to share best practices and engage in an evidence-based reflection on the practical potential of participatory photography and narrative storytelling to: (a) facilitate the co-production and dissemination of knowledge on climate change induced food and livelihoods insecurities locally, and across international borders; (b) ground the development of sustainable informal, community-generated educational models in LMICs; (c) and generate measurable educational impact for targeted marginalised and vulnerable communities facing protracted environmental crises and related food and livelihood insecurities in LMICs.   (2) Enable researchers and arts organisations in LMICs to deepen and extend their informal educational initiatives with local populations, and build capacity to use arts and humanities based approaches to co-produce knowledge on the effects of climate change on local communities and economies.  (3) Enable researchers, NGOs, and marginalised communities at each location - socio-economically disadvantaged urban (Cuba) and rural (Bosnia and Herzegovina) young people, and young refugees in informal settlements (Jordan) - to co-produce and exchange knowledge on climate change generated food and livelihoods insecurities horizontally (across international borders with other members of the network, as well as through co-produced, open-access online educational materials) and vertically (with local and national policy makers, researchers, and educational institutions)  (4) Ensure the self-sustainability of local, arts-based educational initiatives by building capacity for the use arts and humanities methodologies by marginalised and vulnerable communities to educate and advocate on climate change induced food and livelihood insecurities. Participation in photography and storytelling workshops, local and international learning labs and exhibitions, and the co-production of physical and digital educational materials will facilitate the development of a variety of transferrable skills among disadvantaged urban and rural young people and young refugees in target communities, which will contribute to the self-sustainability of these initiatives."></capital-spend>
