   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The aim of BioENGINE Africa is to introduce synthetic biology research skills training into
universities in Ghana, Cameroon and Kenya offering graduate-level courses in
engineering or biotechnology. This will underpin demand for these skills both in academic research and in the rapidly growing bioeconomy sector that is a strategic priority for the African Union. Synthetic biology offers rich interdisciplinary educational opportunities at
the intersection of chemistry, biology, engineering, computer science and design. We aim
to equip researchers across disciplines with essential skills to meet real-world challenges
through adoption of engineering approaches such as design, build and test cycles to the
development of diagnostics for local priorities in human, animal, plant and environmental
health.
Objectives
1. To identify and establish a cohort of 12 talented lecturers from Ghana, Cameroon
and Kenya who actively teach graduate-level courses in engineering or
biotechnology and are motivated and able to incorporate synthetic biology skills
training into their institutional teaching with the support of their cohort peers and
the UK participants, who have a long track record in supporting educational
initiatives in synthetic biology.
2. To train the cohort in the use of effective pedagogies for synthetic biology
education, specifically the application of &#x201C;Design, Build, Test&#x201D; engineering cycle to
biological systems and next generation biotechnologies.
3. To mentor and support the cohort in their professional development and facilitate
the delivery of research skills training in synthetic biology to over 150 graduate
students.
4. To design teaching resources including practicals that are meaningful and
incorporate inquiry-led learning opportunities but are also affordable and feasible
to provide on a continuing basis in resource-constrained institutions. We will share
these resources openly for all who wish to use them.
5. To support the incorporation of BioENGINE Africa modules into Masters and PhD
programmes at the participating institutes and support the lecturer cohort in
advocating for further provision of synthetic biology research skills at national
curriculum level, aligned with local and international bioeconomy strategies.
6. To inspire and inform researchers who will apply the skills they acquire through the
courses to developing impactful diagnostics whether in the partner countries or
through applying to international opportunities.</narrative>
