   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The UN has described the Syrian conflict as &quot;the most dramatic humanitarian crisis that we have ever faced&quot;. By August 2015, 1,114,000 refugees had fled Syria to seek safety in Lebanon, 630,000 had fled to Jordan and 1,939,000 to Turkey. Local communities, civil society groups and faith-based organisations in these countries are some of the most important actors responding to the refugee influx from Syria, filling major gaps which exist even when major aid programmes have been implemented by international agencies such as the UN. These civil society responses have included Lebanese, Jordanian and Turkish citizens providing food and shelter to refugees, local faith leaders offering spiritual support to people displaced by the Syrian conflict, and social and material support provided by protracted refugees who were already living in Lebanon, Jordan and Turkey before the outbreak of the Syrian conflict.  All of these initiatives are clearly significant, but little is known about how and why local communities offer assistance to refugees. This project aims to enhance our knowledge by carefully examining a range of responses developed by the members of nine local communities in Lebanon, Jordan and Turkey, asking questions such as What has motivated these responses? and Who has benefited and who has been excluded from these responses? Another important question is How are these local responses perceived by &apos;traditional&apos; humanitarian aid providers, including governmental Ministries, international humanitarian aid agencies, and UN agencies?   It is important to examine the different implications of local community responses to displacement for different reasons. For instance, although little evidence exists, the UN and traditional Northern donors are increasingly supporting &apos;local&apos; responses to conflict because this is a way of sharing the &apos;burden&apos; of providing aid and services to millions of refugees. At the same time, however, academic, political and policy observers express concerns that local responses may be motivated by political, ideological and faith-based priorities, rather than adhering to the international humanitarian principles of neutrality, universality and impartiality upheld by organisations such as the International Committee of the Red Cross. Detailed research is therefore urgently needed to ensure that local initiatives are neither prematurely celebrated nor unduly demonised.  This research aims to improve our understanding of the challenges and opportunities that arise in local responses to displacement, both for refugees from Syria and for the members of the communities that are hosting them. A team of local researchers will spend 6 months in Lebanon, Jordan and Turkey carefully observing how the members of 9 local communities have responded to the arrival of refugees from Syria. They will interview a total of 270 local community members and 270 refugees, asking them about their experiences of providing or receiving local assistance; refugees and community members will also share their views through a number of participatory research workshops and creative writing workshops in Lebanon, Jordan and Turkey. 150 people who work with local, national and international organisations (including UN agencies) will also be interviewed, to examine their views of local responses to refugees from Syria. Doing this will help us identify whether there is national and international support for local community responses for refugees, or if national and international organisations believe that local responses should not be encouraged or allowed.   The project will use this research to develop recommendations for civil society groups, aid groups, governmental ministries and international organisations. These recommendations will provide suggestions on how local, national and international organisations can best work together to support the needs and human rights of people affected by conflict.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="This project aims to critically examine how, why and with what effect local communities in Lebanon, Jordan and Turkey are responding to mass displacement from Syria. In so doing, it fills a major gap in knowledge vis-&#xE0;-vis the multiple formal and informal roles played by local communities - including those that explicitly or implicitly identify with and are motivated by faith - in supporting, and/or undermining, the resilience of conflict-affected populations.  The main research objectives of the proposed research are to:   1. Enhance understandings of the different roles played by local communities in contexts of conflict-induced displacement;  2. Document the perspectives and experiences of a wide range of people affected by, and responding to, conflict (including refugees and hosts) via interdisciplinary, participatory research; 3. Increase knowledge of the ways in which &apos;protracted&apos; refugees respond to the arrival of &apos;new&apos; refugee communities displaced by conflict; 4. Better understand the impacts of local responses to conflict-induced displacement on refugees and host communities;  5. Develop a nuanced understanding of the ways in which local responses are characterized by processes of inclusion and exclusion (including on the basis of gender, political opinion and religious identity); 6. Identify the barriers and opportunities that exist for local communities to meaningfully respond to the short-, medium- and long-term needs and rights of refugees displaced by conflict;  Throughout the project, the research aims to develop a greater understanding of the roles that religious values, beliefs and practices play both implicitly and explicitly in local responses to and experiences of conflict-induced displacement. It also aims to centalise the voices of conflict-affected people in a range of participatory knowledge exchange and dissemination activities across the Middle East and the UK   Overall, the project aims to significantly contribute to theories of humanitarianism, and debates pertaining to donor-recipient relations and the agency of  both host communities and refugees in conflict situations. It also aims to inform the development of policies and programmes that can most appropriately address the needs and rights of conflict affected people by engaging with diverse actors across local, national, regional and international levels. This highly topical and innovative project thus fills major empirical and theoretical gaps regarding local responses to conflict, with broad implications for conflict-affected people, academics, policy-makers and practitioners alike."></capital-spend>
