   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Training, motivating and retaining professional health workers is crucial for the improvement of health outcomes, especially in low and middle-income countries where poor health worker performance has been recognised as one of the key obstacles to achieving better health outcomes. To improve staff motivation and performance, many donors and governments have recently supported the introduction of Performance-Based Financing (PBF) mechanisms, which link part of the health workers&apos; remuneration to performance targets. While promising results have shown that these programmes can improve utilisation of health services and some health outcomes, it is still unclear what specific effects they have on the motivation and behaviours of health workers. Yet it is key to understand better how PBF works for health workers, and in particular whether all aspects of health workers&apos; performance have improved or whether PBF can induce some undesired effects, e.g. a reduction in time spent with each patient.  The aim of the proposed research is to generate new knowledge and understanding of how PBF programmes work and influence health workers&apos; performance. The proposed research takes advantage of a quasi-experimental study introduced by the World Bank in four of the poorest and most rural regions of Senegal in 2014. The project will collect a rich set of primary data in control and PBF facilities to answer several critical questions.  The research will first undertake some interviews to assess whether the extent to which what was planned in the PBF scheme is actually what is happening in practice. This will help understand exactly the nature of the intervention being implemented. The research will then undertake a large survey, collecting information in control and PBF facilities on the working environment and characteristics, behaviours and performance of health care workers. The aim is to determine the effects of PBF, by comparing the performance and behaviours of health workers with and without PBF incentives. Specifically, the survey will explore whether PBF improves the productivity, quality of care provided and attitude towards patients. The data collected will also help determine whether the time and effort spent on each patient increase and on non-incentivised activities decrease as a result of the PBF. Finally, with the information collected, we will be able to identify mechanisms through which the performance of health workers changes.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="The aim of the research is to assess if and how performance-based financing programmes (financial incentives linked to a mix of volume of activities and qualitative targets) in a low-income setting improves the performance of health care workers.   The project will have the following specific objectives: 1. To describe how the programme is being implemented (a) How well are the key PBF mechanisms (reporting, verification and payment of outcomes) being enforced? (b) What are the key challenges and enabling factors to the PBF implementation? (c) How do local and regional stakeholders view the PBF programme? (d) How do facilities allocate bonuses between individual health workers?  (e) How do HWs perceive the bonuses compared to their efforts and workload? 2. To explore to what extent financial incentives improve the performance of health workers, measured across a range of outcomes (a) Does PBF improve quality of care? (b) Does PBF improve responsiveness towards patients?  (c) Does PBF improve clinical productivity (number of patients seen per health worker per day, time spent in facilities, productive time spent in the facilities)? 3. To determine whether financial incentives lead to undesirable effects (a) Is there a reduction in time spent on non- or less-incentivised activities?  (b) Is there a reduction in time spent per patient? (c) Is there a less thorough examination of patients seen? 4. To analyse the causal pathways through which performance of staff improves  (a) Are there more resources available in PBF facilities (in terms of availability of drugs, equipment and competence of staff in PBF facilities)? (b) Are HWs&apos; earnings higher in PBF facilities (and what is the mix of earning sources)? (c) Are health workers making more effort: is the &quot;know-do gap&quot; (difference between what the health workers are able to do and what they actually do) lower in PBF facilities? (d) Are monitoring and peer pressure higher in PBF facilities? (e) Is intrinsic motivation higher in PBF facilities?"></capital-spend>
