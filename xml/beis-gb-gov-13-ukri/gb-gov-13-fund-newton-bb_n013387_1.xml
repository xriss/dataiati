   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Nitrogen is an essential element of biological molecules and life on earth. Lack of usable nitrogen limits growth of microbes, plants, and animals. Lack of nitrogen in agricultural soils limits plant production of food, feed, fibre and fuel. Nature solved the nitrogen limitation problem via evolution of biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) in diazotrophic bacteria that reduce atmospheric N2 to NH3, which is readily assimilated into biological molecules. Biological nitrogen fixation is catalyzed by a complex metalloenzyme called nitrogenase whose oxygen-sensitivity may explain its restricted distribution amongst prokaryotes. Some plants, including most legumes and a few non-legumes form intimate, nitrogen-fixing symbioses with diazotrophs that provide the plants with ammonia. As a consequence, legumes have been an integral part of sustainable agricultural systems for thousands of years. However, in an effort to increase plant yields large-scale use of industrially-produced N-fertilizer has doubled the influx of N into the terrestrial biogeochemical N-cycle, with serious negative consequences for human health and the natural environment. Therefore, the long-term sustainability of massive N-fertilizer inputs in agriculture has come into question. A team of eight investigators in India and two in the UK have come together to enhance the use of legumes, increase their effectiveness at fixing nitrogen and develop endophytic diazotrophs for use on cereals such as rice. Our focus is on pigeon pea, which is the second most widely planted legume in India but suffers from poor rates of BNF and low yields. We will select elite lines of pigeon pea and competitive rhizobial inoculants to maximise yields while improving their robustness. In addition we will develop phosphate solubilising strains of rhizobia as the supply of phosphorous often limits the rates on BNF and plant yield. Desirable traits for BNF and phosphate solubilisation will then be stacked into rhizobial inocula. A final long-term aim is the transfer of BNF to cereals, particularly rice, by the use of endophytic diazoptophs that can be inoculated onto cereals. This will be done both by selection of new endophytic diazotrophs and by manipulation of the control of BNF and ammonia secretion in elite strains. To achieve these aims we bring together the national leaders in India and the UK with expertise in bacterial and plant genetics, genomics, biochemistry, molecular and cell biology, physiology, synthetic biology combined with a deep knowledge of BNF in Indian soils and different regions. Improving BNF in our target plants will increase croyields for resource-poor farmers while decreasing the use and environmental-impact of industrial N-fertilizers.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">We have three main objectives which form three distinct work packages. Our first objective is to identify pigeon pea with superior grain yield performance and match them with effective nitrogen-fixing rhizobia to enhance crop production. Our second objective is to develop plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) and engineered rhizobia with phosphate-solubilising capacity as inoculants to improve nodulation and BNF, whilst maintaining soil quality. Our third objective is to study how rhizobial diazotrophs infect cereals. This has the additional long-term objective of improving nitrogen levels delivered to cereals without detrimental effects on the environment.   These three objectives map directly to three work packages (WP);  WP1 Select optimal pigeon pea-Rhizobium combinations for nodulation, nitrogen fixation and grain yield. Pigeon pea is one of the most important crops in drylands in India, but suffers from inconsistent yields and poor nodulation by ineffective rhizobia. Our aim is to improve selection of optimal plant lines and rhizobial inoculants to increase plant growth and grain yield for use in drought-stressed Indian soils. The quantification of how much nitrogen is derived from nitrogen fixation versus uptake of soil nitrogen is a key to establishing the success of BNF. This needs to be carefully quantified in arid regions for rain-fed pigeon pea. Measurements of the contribution of native and of inoculated competitive rhizobial strains, as well as selection of superior rhizobial strains, will enable the inoculant industry to deploy these strains and thus translate to sustainable increases in yield.      WP2 Enhancing plant growth and BNF by engineering rhizobia to solubilize phosphate. Plant growth and nitrogen fixation are often limited by the supply of phosphate, which may be abundant in soil but is locked up in inaccessible forms. However, secretion of organic acids can lead to solubilisation of phosphate with large gains in nitrogen fixation and plant growth. Several enzyme systems to enhance phosphate solubilisation have been developed by Dr Naresh Kumar and we propose to use synthetic biology to engineer them into cassettes for expression in a wide range of bacteria, including rhizobia.    WP3 Characterisation of diazotrophic rice endophytes and their mechanism of infection.  Rice and legumes (as green manures) have been grown in rotation in India for hundreds of years. It has been found that significant numbers of rhizobia will infect both a legume to elicit root nodules and infect rice as endophytes. Endophytic bacteria associated with cereals may already make some contribution to the nitrogen status of the plant. We aim to identify and isolate a wide range of these bacteria using high-throughput community analysis and culturing. In parallel with isolating new rice endophytes we will characterize a particularly exciting group  of rhizobia that infect both a legume and rice. Peanut (Arachis) can be infected by bradyrhizobia in a nod-dependent fashion by West Bengal Arachis hyopaea strains (WBAH) and by nod-deficient West Bengal Oryza sativa strains (WBOS). We will determine how these strains infect plants, work which has enormous importance for achieving significant nitrogen fixation in cereals.</narrative>
