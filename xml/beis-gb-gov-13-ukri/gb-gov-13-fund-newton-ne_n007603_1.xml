   <narrative xml:lang="EN">SPECTRA: Soil Processes and Ecological Services in the Karst Critical Zone of Southwest China</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The SPECTRA programme aims to enhance the sustainable development of one of the poorest regions of China, Guizhou, through cutting edge critical zone (CZ) science undertaken by integrated, complementary and multidisciplinary teams of Chinese and UK scientists that thereby builds the capacity of critical zone science in China. The overarching scientific objective of this project is to determine what controls the resilience, response and recovery of the CZ and its integrated geophysical-geochemical-ecological functions to perturbations, and how  understanding of interactions between CZ processes from molecular to catchment scale can be used to develop integrated sustainable landscape management for the Guizhou karst CZ.  In achieving this objective we will address the ODA priority of enhancing economic development and social welfare by providing rigorous applied scientific knowledge that will underpin the development of strategies to improve net ecological service delivery from the karst landscape.  This will allow identification of land management options, and inform realistic economic and ecological compensation plans to alleviate poverty.  The programme will be delivered through 4 workpackages (WP), each designed to generate the evidence needed to address our overarching objective. Each WP has a separate set of sub-objectives:  WP1 will characterise the current state of the karst CZ under different levels of soil degradation, focusing on links between soil properties and plant performance. The objectives are to improve understanding of how degradation in this karst landscape effects:   1.1 soil structure (including aggregation), carbon and nutrient stocks  1.2 the relative availabilities of different nutrients  1.3 plant nutrient acquisition strategies associated with different root traits  1.4 rates of autotrophic and heterotrophic below-ground respiration.  WP2 will quantify the relative rates of soil formation and loss along a perturbation gradient.  The objectives are to quantify:  2.1 soil formation and long-term mineral nutrient release rates and their control by the distribution of silicate minerals in the CZ  2.2 variation in mineral weathering rates with respect to soil degradation and vegetation distribution  2.3 total post-disturbance soil loss over the last half-century along the perturbation gradient  2.4 the proportion of near surface sediment currently transported through sub-surface pathways 2.5 the effects of roots and mycorrhiza on weathering rates in field-based experiments 2.6 current erosion rates.    WP3 will determine the key controls on nutrient availability to plant communities, and the impact of land degradation plant productivity a perturbation gradient.  The objectives are to relate these to CZ properties and determine the:  3.1 response of the soil microbial community to pressures within the karst landscape;  3.2 role of C, N and P as limits to soil microbial function within karst soils;  3.3 role of N-fixing bacteria in regulating the atmospheric N supply to karst soils; and  3.4 mechanisms controlling P supply to primary producers in karst soils.  WP4 will determine the mechanisms controlling the ecosystem services (ES) provided by the karst CZ, and the impact of land degradation on ES provision.  The objectives of the workpackage are to:   4.1 Develop and test the state-of-the-art CAST model for simulation of perturbation-driven evolution of the soil profiles in karst landscapes; 4.2 Develop 3D models of nutrient distribution within the karst CZ landscape; and  4.3 Use remote sensing (RS) and classification of the karst landscape to identify areas currently experiencing different levels of degradation, allowing for informed policy implementation around restoration for ES provision and/or financial incentives for relocation and poverty alleviation.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The SPECTRA programme seeks to enhance the sustainable development of one of the poorest regions of China, Guizhou, through cutting edge critical zone science undertaken by integrated, complementary and multidisciplinary teams of Chinese and UK scientists. The key question for management of the karst landscapes of SW China is &quot;how can the highly heterogeneous critical zone resources be restored, to enable sustainable delivery of ecosystem services?&quot;   We know little about the geological, hydrological and ecological processes which control soil fertility and soil function in these landscapes and how best to manage them to maximise ecosystem service delivery. SPECTRA has been designed to address these questions through a suite of 4 interlinked workpackages.   The CZ will span a gradient from undisturbed natural vegetation through to human perturbed and highly degraded landscapes. Using cutting-edge approaches we will integrate measurements of:   (1) the three-dimensional distribution of plants (including roots), soil, fungi, and microbes;  (2) rates of rock weathering, elemental release and soil formation processes;  (3) rates of erosion and soil redistribution; and,  (4) pools and fluxes of soil organic C (SOC), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P).   This will allow us to identify the biological controls on nutrient availability, soil formation and loss in the CZ and their response to perturbation, providing the rich evidence base needed to inform land management decision-making in the Guizhou province.  In doing so, SPECTRA will directly address the Newton Fund objective of enhancing economic development and social welfare by providing rigorous applied scientific knowledge that will underpin the development of strategies to improve net ecological service delivery from the karst landscape, informing realistic economic and ecological compensation plans to alleviate poverty, particularly for the households that rely on fragile soils for a living.   The project is also designed to maximise the benefits to the science communities of both countries, thereby bringing significant institutional benefits to all partners. Training of Chinese Early Career Researchers in state-of-the-art approaches and techniques in leading UK laboratories is an absolute priority of the scientific partnership, and combined with the networking opportunities between project partners in the global CZ community, will contribute significantly to meeting the Newton Fund objective of building the capacity for CZ Science in China.   The ultimate beneficiaries of this project will be the people of Guizhou karst region (population 35 million), which is one of the poorest regions in China with a GDP less than 50% of the national average. In response to the environmental deterioration and changing social conditions in the Guizhou karst region, the Chinese government has intervened to promote the abandonment of the most degraded cultivated land and its succession to grassland, shrub and forest. This strategy has met with mixed success and is not yet underpinned by well-developed plans to repay landowners for rational and sustainable use of land resources. This must be informed by science that quantifies current and potential ecosystem service delivery. There is significant potential for our research on the response, resilience and recovery of the karst critical zone to perturbation to inform improved land management strategies that will meet these demands, leading in turn to improved delivery of ecosystem services to the communities in this region and higher environmental quality, addressing poverty and the welfare of the population through development of long-term sustainable economic development.</narrative>
