  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Human papillomaviruses cause a wide range of problematic lesions, including a significant number of human cancers, as well as genital warts, respiratory papillomas, and recalcitrant skin lesions.  The cancer-associated HPV types are often referred to as &apos;high-risk&apos; types and are responsible for about 6% of all human cancers, with cervical cancer being the most significant of these.  Cervical cancer is the most common cancer to affect young women, and causes approximately a quarter of a million deaths per year worldwide.  High risk HPVs can also cause oropharyngeal, anal and penile cancer.  There are currently no antiviral therapies that can cure either high or low-risk HPV-associated disease, although since 2008, vaccines have been available in the UK that protect against some high and some low-risk HPV types.  Cervical cancer is also managed with cervical screening, with &apos;precancerous lesions&apos; being surgically excised if they are detected.  Neither vaccination nor screening are totally effective in preventing disease, and are still not widely implemented worldwide.    A significant part of our work addresses &apos;vulnerable epithelial sites&apos; such as the uterine cervix, where high risk HPV types cause pre-cancers and cancers.  We suspect that viral gene expression can be disrupted at these epithelial sites from the outset, with this deregulation having a major influence on cancer risk. Our main priority is to examine how site-specific deregulated human papillomaviruses gene expression can lead to disease. We will compare viral gene expression and the target cell primarily at the cervix and then at the various other vulnerable sites within the body. We will also examine viral gene expression in relation to the immune system components during subclinical infection, compared with active infections, regressing lesions and de novo infections. Our combined approach aims to understand more accurately the biology of disease progression, to underpin future developments in screening and potential treatments.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project has three main objectives that are directed towards understanding papillomavirus gene expression and protein function in the context of disease.  In particular, we will focus on the cell type and patterns of viral gene expression that regulate events during initial infection, lesion persistence, and subclinical maintenance - focusing on changes in cell phenotype which lead to disease. Viral functions will be considered extensively in the context of the normal regulation of the cervical transformation zone, where these viruses cause a significant number of neoplasias and cancers.     In the context of these broad objectives, the project aims to ...  1 establish a generic understanding of HPV gene expression in the cervical transformation zone, during initial-, active- and subclinical infection.   2 clarify the unique vulnerability of the cervical transformation zone to HPV infection and life-cycle deregulation.   3 Compare the cervix to other transformation zones throughout the body, e.g. oropharynx, anal and ocular sites.   4 Examine the relationship between the viral gene expression with the cellular microenvironment at these different sites.  This work will guide future molecular studies and will help to interpret current studies on cellular immune response to HPV.   Prioritisation; Because these objective are interlinked, the sub-goals have been ordered according to their importance at the start of the project. These aim to...  1. establish quantitative HPV gene expression patterns typical of infections at the ectocervix, the endocervix, and the cervical transformation zone. 2. To establish the phenotypic consequences of expression on cell phenotype. 3. extend our observations to other epithelial sites where high risk HPV types cause cancer, with a view to establishing the extent of viral deregulation, and to gain insight as to the cellular origin of disease. 4. Use ex vivo models to consolidate the data regarding target cell and expression patterns that come from the above. 5. develop a clearer understanding of the cellular immune interactions during initial infection and lesion-persistence, and extend this to disease-clearance and sub-clinical infection. 6. Development of hypotheses to explain the cellular interactions that underlie HPV deregulation or it&apos;s control.</narrative>
