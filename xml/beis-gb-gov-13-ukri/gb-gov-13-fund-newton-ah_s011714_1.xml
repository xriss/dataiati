   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The aim of this project is to strengthen the local stewardship of Tall Dhiban, a large mound 70 kms south of Amman Jordan, by enhancing its economic and social value.  This will be achieved by increasing local connectivity with the site and improving on-site interpretation and management. Tall Dhiban is well-known as capital of the biblical kingdom of Moab and the find spot of the Mesha inscription (now in the Louvre), the longest Iron Age royal inscription from the Levant. Despite the strong historical narrative and biblical connections provided by the Mesha Inscription, the site is seldom visited by tourists and is poorly understood by local residents because the visible archaeological remains are difficult to interpret and partially obscured. Modern Dhiban is an adjacent Bedouin town of the Bani Hamida tribe that has been the site of economically motivated civil unrest since at least 2011. This unrest has led to increased looting of Tall Dhiban as well as violent confrontations between police and protestors on the site itself in 2016. This project aims to transform the site of Tall Dhiban into a cultural resource for the building of positive local heritage identities, as well as an economic resource for local businesses by increasing the number of external visitors to the site.  In doing so, we also aim to build capacity in Jordan for public history and the management of cultural heritage sites. This will be pursued with a two-fold strategy.  In town we will run a schools based public history programme working with teachers and Mutah University trainee researchers. This project will culminate with a History Festival, in which student family history projects and social media will be used to encourage residents of Dhiban to contribute their own stories, images and artefacts.  A repository of these materials will be turned over to the community for self-directed public history projects in future.  One emphasis of this public history project will be on the relationship between the town, tribe and the tell (archaeological mound) of Dhiban.     On the tell itself we will work with Hashemite University students to prepare a site management plan and interpretive signs and related materials for presenting the site.  We will also instigate a programme of site maintenance and cleaning, and the establishment of visitor pathways. Through a Jordanian non-profit (SELA Training) we will provide a nationally recognised vocational training programme in basic conservation techniques for dry-laid stone architecture to four unemployed youths from Dhiban, which should allow them to find more regular and better paid employment within the heritage sector in Jordan. It will also provide us with skilled technicians to help stabilise the exposed architecture from various phases of Dhiban&apos;s 5,000 year settlement history. Current visitor numbers for Tall Dhiban are very low, hence we expect that any improvement to the presentation of the site will lead to a proportionately significant increase in visitors and external income. It will also allow Tall Dhiban to be a potential stop on developing day-tour circuits within the Madaba Governate, where one already finds two UNESCO World Heritage Sites and several important concentrations of mosaics.     The site will also serve as a point of integration between often intagible local historical narratives and the global and national narratives that dominate archaeological interpretation. Academically, we will trial best practices for realising this integration, articulating the histories of the town and the tell as intertwined and continuous.  If successfully presented, the site will become easier to integrate into local cultural and educational activities and provide a more diverse and nuanced experience of Jordan for foreign tourists. It is already evident that engaging with recent histories will challenge academic approaches to tell sites that do not analyse them as places that are still in formation.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="The main objectives of this project are: 1) To strengthen the local stewardship of the cultural heritage resources of Tall Dhiban by enhancing their economic and social value to residents of the modern town of Dhiban. 2) To improve the presentation and amenity value of the site of Tall Dhiban so that it is both better preserved and more easily interpretable, hence increasing potential visitorship and making the site more accessible to local residents of Dhiban. 3) To encourage and document local historical perspectives on the relationships between the town, the tell and the Bani Hamida tribe as a means of facilitating positive social change, enhancing social cohesion, enhancing local ownership of, and responsibility for, cultural heritage resources and driving economic growth. 4) To build capacity for the design and execution of public history projects within Jordan by training Jordanian university students and school teachers in appropriate methods 5) To build capacity for cultural heritage site evaluation, management and presentation by training Jordanian university students in appropriate methods. 6) To build local capacity for sustainable site management  (i.e. low-cost/ high resilience) by training local residents in basic evaluation, cleaning and conservation techniques for dry-laid stone architecture. 7) To trial and evaluate methods by which local historical perspectives can be effectively translated and integrated with archaeological research in site interpretive materials to offer more complex and nuanced historical representations to site visitors. 8) To transform current academic understandings of tell formation and long-term settlement histories by incorporating the histories of the modern residents of such sites. Tells are sites where the past and present are always co-present and are only artificially partitioned into purified sequences.  Symmetrically incorporating stories of recent settlement on, or adjacent, to these mounds requires a conception of tells as sites that are still in formation and of a past that is growing and enduring into the future.  In practical terms we plan to meet these objectives by:  i) Developing a site management plan and training Hashemite University students in the processes involved; cleaning the site surface and establishing visitor pathways, carrying out basic architectural consolidation and training local residents in the methods used, researching and producing interpretive text and images that can be presented on bilingual (Arabic/ English) signs for the benefit of local and external visitors to the site and training Hashemite University students in the processes involved. ii)Developing a schools-based public history project in Dhiban, as well as training student assistants from Mutah University in the method and theory of public history.  This project will culminate in a &quot;History Festival&quot; where resources for local narratives of the town tell and tribe will be &apos;harvested&apos; and then turned over to the residents of Dhiban.  Materials from this public history project will be incorporated into the text and images developed for on-site signs as well as other interpretive materials."></capital-spend>
