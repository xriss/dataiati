   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project, taking advantage of the optimal preservation by desiccation in the Egyptian desert of organic materials, in particular insect remains, will produce new information on environmental and climate change through the study of insects by researching rural and urban environments from pharaonic and Roman Egypt and placing them in the context of existing environmental and archaeological research in the eastern Mediterranean. The sites selected for analysis are the ongoing excavation of Elephantine, in Aswan and material on permit in the UK from Qasr Ibrim. Environments and climate will be reconstructed, based on evidence from within and around settlement areas, in particular species from the natural insect fauna as well as those which live with man as uninvited guests and accidental travelers including insect pests, flies and ectoparasites. In addition, analytical techniques will be applied to material currently outside of Egypt either on permit or in museum collections. Both AMS dating and DNA of insect chitin will refine interpretation and produce new results.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="The main objectives of the project are to:   1.obtain new insect data from sites in the Aswan area; 2.compare with existing data, largely from New Kingdom Amarna; 3.improve methodologies for AMS dating using materials already to hand; 4.examine DNA of fossil insects from material on permit and compare the results with available sequences from the same species in order to detect biogeographic patterns.  In addition the project seeks to:  1.train Egyptian researchers on new methodologies; 2.build scientific collaborations between Egyptian and UK Universities highlighting fields which are underused or underdeveloped; 3.introduce new methodologies for the study of Egyptian materials. 4.communicate project results to the public in the UK and Egypt in collaboration with Museums."></capital-spend>
