   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The aim of the project is to take the expertise and practical knowledge acquired in the course of the AHRC large grant, Transnationalizing Modern Languages (2014-2017) to Namibia. Working with the Phoenix Project and its educational partnerships, the project will adapt and refine the methodologies that have been developed by TML to co-produce - with researchers from the University of Namibia (UNAM) and local practitioners - materials that are tailor-made for the Namibian context.  The project pursues two specific work streams: 1) To support multilingualism and translingual practices and their embedding in school education. 2) To sensitize health specialists to the role played by multilingual communication, including translation and self-translation, in their professional practice.  The objective in both cases is to achieve enduring impact through curriculum development, the production of teaching resources, and the creation of a transnational mentoring network that will amplify the effects of the project throughout Namibia and beyond.  In the first work stream, the TML team and established partners will collaborate with UNAM specialists and teachers in local schools to explore the use of translingual creative writing and oral narratives in fostering awareness of linguistic as well as cultural diversity and interlingual skills within primary and secondary education. The objective is to improve understanding and management of the transition between mother tongue and English language education. It is also to develop cross-cultural literacy skills for all learner groups across the curriculum. The collaboration aims to foster a widespread understanding of the importance and value of Namibia&apos;s multilingual heritage and of the dynamic relationship between English as a vehicular language and the other languages present in the country.  The second work stream concentrates on the development of multilingual capabilities and translation skills among health specialists. By mobilizing the expertise of the TML team on the centrality of translation in multilingual contexts, the objective is to create resources which colleagues in Namibia will embed into Higher Education curricula (involving UNAM&apos;s new M.Med. in Anesthesia) as well as Continuing Professional Development, via the training programme run by UNAM across Namibia&apos;s regional centres. The objective is to ensure that participants, who are also the future trainers in the field across the country, will receive intensive awareness-raising instruction on working and teaching in multilingual environments. The objective is to ensure the development of greater awareness of the role of interlingual communication in medical contexts and of the advantages as well as risks inherent in working with multiple translation practices. The work stream aims to ensure that health professionals see a marked increase in their ability to deliver an effective service with improved patient care and welfare outcomes.  The project seeks to facilitate educational and professional development through multilingual education in the local environment, identifying the school and health systems as key areas of social wellbeing and economic development.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project stems from Transnationalizing Modern Languages (TML), one of three large grants awarded under the AHRC&apos;s Translating Cultures scheme. TML&apos;s established group of Modern Languages experts has conducted research revealing the centrality of a variety of language practices, ranging from multilingualism to translation, in migration contexts and multicultural societies. An important part of TML has been to develop methodologies aimed at embedding awareness of linguistic and cultural diversity within educational practices, from primary to higher and adult education.  TML has cemented links with The Phoenix Project (http://www.cardiff.ac.uk/phoenix-project), led by Prof. Judith Hall, that links Cardiff University and the University of Namibia (UNAM) and which supports the Welsh Government&apos;s International Development Wales for Africa initiative, promoting mutual capacity building and sustainable collaboration.  The aim of the project is to take the expertise and practical knowledge acquired within TML to Namibia by working closely with The Phoenix Project and its educational partnerships. Methodologies developed in TML will be adapted and refined to co-produce with researchers from UNAM and local practitioners materials tailor-made for the Namibian context. The new research seeks to facilitate educational and professional development through multilingual education in the local environment, identifying the school and health systems as key areas of social wellbeing and economic development.  The promotion of multilingual education has been identified as a key target with social and economic benefits for Namibia with clear connections to a number of UN sustainable development goals. Issues relating to languages and communication affect the country&apos;s ability to grow economically; they are central to successful healthcare provision; they have a clear impact on poverty, income disparity and gender and generational inequality; they impact upon capacity building and access to job markets; they are relevant to conflict resolution as well as to the promotion of human rights; and they are clearly related to issues of cultural heritage and memory.  The project concentrates on two specific areas: supporting multilingualism and translingual practices and their embedding in school education; and sensitizing health specialists to the role played by multilingual communication, including translation and self-translation, in their professional practice. In both cases, the focus is on co-research practices, mutual learning and capacity building. The aim is to achieve enduring impact through curriculum development, the production of teaching resources, and the creation of a transnational mentoring network that will amplify the effects of the project throughout the country and beyond.  By promoting awareness of the impact of language capabilities and translation practices in Namibia&apos;s multilingual environment, the project aims to support sustainable action regarding cultural heritage and cultural memory (in education and the media), produce new research insights on the impact and sustainability of language and translation practices in a variety of locales and landscapes, and promote more efficient communication within health and medical practices (working with multilingual teams in multiple local contexts), all of which involve complex interactions among indigenous, colonial and post-colonial linguistic and cultural heritages.  By engaging with creative practices of translation and language learning in Namibian schools and by building on an on-going project between Cardiff University&apos;s Phoenix Project and UNAM in health education, the project will make an enduring contribution to educational provision and access to healthcare for excluded sectors of the population as well as to the conservation of cultural memory and intangible heritage in Namibia through the validation of indigenous tongues as languages of education and information.</narrative>
