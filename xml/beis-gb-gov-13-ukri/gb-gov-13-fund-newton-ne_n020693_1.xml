   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (GLOFs) pose a significant hazard to communities and infrastructure in many mountainous parts of the world, including Chile and a number of other lower income countries.  This GLOF hazard has increased over the last century as glaciers recede in response to global climate change forming a growing number of glacial lake systems. Outburst floods can occur anywhere that water is stored beneath or on the surface of a glacier, where water becomes ponded behind an ice front or ice dam, or where water is stored in proglacial lakes that develop between a moraine and a receding glacier margin. Lakes in the latter category (moraine-dammed lakes) are particularly hazardous because a sudden collapse of the moraine dam can trigger the release of large volumes of ponded water.  In Peru alone, outburst floods from glacial sources caused ~ 32,000 deaths in the 20th century, as well as destroying vital economic infrastructure, settlements and valuable arable land. In the Nepal Himalaya, it has been estimated that the costs associated with the destruction of a mature single hydropower installation by an outburst flood could exceed USD 500 million. Ice-dammed and moraine-dammed lakes are now developing in Chile as glaciers recede. They pose an ever-increasing threat to communities and infrastructure downstream.  This project will answer questions concerning the past, present and future glacial hazards in Chile. We will assess their changing magnitude, frequency, and distribution under current and future global climate change.  We will produce the first complete inventory of historical GLOFs in Chile  and identify sites that have the potential to develop glacial hazards in the future. We will use physically-based numerical models to simulate GLOFs at sites identified as posing a high hazard and use these simulations to make hazard and flood risk predictions that can inform planners and decision-makers in Chile and other lower income countries globally.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Our proposed research has three main objectives:    1. To understand the physical processes that govern the development of Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (GLOFs) in Chile: Using remote-sensing and fieldwork, we will compile an inventory of past GLOF sites around the major icefields, satellite glaciers and snow- and ice-capped volcanoes of Chile. From this inventory, we will then identify currently developing GLOF sites and establish the locations of potential future GLOF sites. We will use these observations to establish the physical processes that govern GLOF behaviour in Chile including sites that may be prone to moraine-dam failure, the locations of sites likely to be sensitive to ice-dammed lake drainage and sites that are susceptible to volcanic and earthquake activity. We will analyse flood hydrographs (where available) of selected former GLOFs and use these to establish the patterns of downstream impacts.   2. To estimate the effects of Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (GLOFs) on society and economy in Chile: Using the inventory and the identification of potential GLOF sites across Chile, we will objectively assess the potential for damage to communities and infrastructure downstream. We will also conduct numerical simulations of downstream impacts for selected potential GLOF sites using physically-based numerical flood models.  3. To assess the potential future implications for Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (GLOFs) in Chile and provide a framework that can be applied to other lower income countries globally: At selected sites in Chile we will undertake a detailed analysis of the potential downstream economic and societal impacts of future GLOFS, including the impact on communities, infrastructure and agriculture.   We will make recommendations for mitigation strategies. Finally, as an output from this research project we will make recommendations for GLOF hazard assessment protocols and mitigation strategies in lower income countries globally.</narrative>
