   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The role of improved housing in the African malaria recession</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">(1) To undertake a comprehensive programme of work to investigate the role of improved housing in the African malaria recession. This will be achieved through four study objectives: i. To conduct a cross-sectional analysis of the association between house quality and malaria (a) in Upper River Region, The Gambia and (b) across the African continent. ii. To estimate changes in housing quality at the district level in SSA, from 2000-2015. iii. To retrospectively evaluate the role of improved housing in the African malaria recession, from 2000-2015. iv. To estimate the potential impact of housing as a malaria control intervention in SSA.   (2) To develop a high level of technical proficiency in a complementary range of advanced quantitative methods and build on existing skills in this area. This will equip me to make an original and impactful contribution to the epidemiology and control of vector-borne disease (See Career Intentions). Acquisition of these skills will be facilitated via specialist training courses and collaboration with experts in the field (see Collaborations).   (3) To ensure the research findings have maximum impact by disseminating them widely: (i) to the academic community via quality peer-reviewed papers in high impact scientific journals; (ii) to an interdisciplinary, international scientific audience at conferences and seminars; (iii) by press-releasing findings to the national media and thus communicating them to the general public; (iv) to international stakeholders and decision-makers (see Academic Beneficiaries, Communications Plan, Impact and Pathways to Impact sections).</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Malaria is a mosquito-borne disease, mainly confined to the tropics. Today, malaria control is at a pivotal juncture. The disease remains a major source of human illness and death, killing around 600,000 people annually. Yet the past fifteen years have seen great advances in controlling malaria, with a third reduction in the annual incidence of cases. These reductions have been mainly achieved by distributing chemically-treated bed nets for people to sleep beneath and by spraying houses with chemicals that kill mosquitoes. However, mosquitoes have become resistant to the chemicals used, meaning that additional tools are urgently needed to avoid losing the progress made.  Since malaria is a &apos;disease of poverty&apos;, strongly influenced by its environment, there is heightened interest in using broader, non-chemical approaches for its control, by working with sectors outside health such as agriculture, water and sanitation and urban planning. This is especially pertinent as we approach the launch of the Sustainable Development Goals for international development later in 2015. The research proposed here will specifically investigate how one such approach - improving housing - can help to reduce malaria in sub-Saharan Africa.  Good housing, traditionally a key pillar of public health, remains underexploited in malaria control. Yet most bites by malaria mosquitoes in sub-Saharan Africa are received indoors at night, so the home can be a risky place. Historically, improved living conditions and house screening contributed to malaria elimination in Europe and the USA. Today, studies have shown that well-built housing can help to protect against malaria in many African settings. However, house design has been largely neglected as a potential malaria control tool, due to reliance on other interventions.  Today, unprecedented population expansion and socioeconomic development in sub-Saharan Africa presents an unrivalled opportunity to build healthy homes. The continent&apos;s population is projected to double between 2010 and 2040 to nearly two billion and may surpass three billion by 2070, with 144 million new houses needed by 2030 in rural areas alone. Housing quality is also transforming across much of the continent, as incomes increase. This economic and cultural revolution represents an exceptional opportunity for malaria control.  The aim of this fellowship is to investigate the potential contribution of better housing to malaria control in Africa. This will be achieved by addressing three questions:   i) How is malaria associated with housing quality in different parts of sub-Saharan Africa? ii) To what extent has housing improved in Africa, and how does this change relate to trends in malaria endemicity, 2000-2015?  iii) What is the potential impact of using better housing as an intervention against malaria?   To answer these questions, state-of-the-art modelling approaches will be used (1) to assess the association between house design and malaria in multiple African countries, (2) to quantify how housing improved in Africa between 2000 and 2015, (3) to understand how trends in malaria between 2000 and 2015 were related to changes in housing and (4) to estimate the total number of malaria cases in Africa that may be averted by ongoing housing improvements. This study will exploit the world&apos;s largest collection of malaria surveys, the Malaria Atlas Project, together with nearly 200 demographic and health surveys from over 40 countries in sub-Saharan Africa.    In summary, this study will evaluate the potential of building better homes to impact on malaria in Africa. The outcomes of this research will provide critical information to guide research and policy decisions relating to sustainable malaria control, at a pivotal time.</narrative>
