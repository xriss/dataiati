   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Cyclical extreme rainfall events, such as those generated by the El Ni&#xF1;o in South America, can cause devastation through flooding in low and middle income countries, particularly in Peru, a country that is intimately linked to climate phenomena associated with the El Ni&#xF1;o-Southern Oscillation. It was Peruvian fishermen who first identified El Ni&#xF1;o in the late 19th Century off the north coast of Peru. However, very little attention has been given to the opportunities these events can create for food systems, especially in the context of climate change in arid settings. This is particularly important because these events have the capacity to increase the amount of available freshwater and produce fertile sediment that fill river and lake floodplains. Our project will undertake the first systematic, interdisciplinary research on desert-El Ni&#xF1;o-food systems in the Sechura Desert, northern Peru. The outputs from our research will have a bearing on how future challenges and opportunities associated with climate change, in particular El Ni&#xF1;o in northern Peru, are imagined in academia and policy. It focuses attention on the less researched positive possibilities that El Ni&#xF1;o events can generate in some contexts, which in northern Peru has significant implications for marginal desert-living communities, e.g. fishers and farmers who have so far been invisible in the popular narrative of disaster mitigation surrounding a strong El Ni&#xF1;o event. Specifically, we will (a) deconstruct the climate history of the Sechura desert by integrating monitoring and lake sediment records of climate change; (b) examine human responses to El Ni&#xF1;o through colonial and republican archives and generate oral histories of previous El Ni&#xF1;o events; (c) evaluate contemporary food system practices through a mixed-method approach that looks at impact of climate variability on fish ecology and participatory mapping of fishing/farming practice and resources/markets; (d) identify challenges and opportunities for desert-El Ni&#xF1;o-food systems by mapping social and economic development in the Sechura desert and contextualising this with newspaper archive analysis leading to future scenario planning.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="Aim: To create an interdisciplinary and multi-sectoral research consortium, to understand the desert-El Ni&#xF1;o-food system in Sechura, northern Peru, as a pathway towards enhancing its long-term resilience to future, short-term, cyclical systemic environmental shocks.  Objectives: The specific objectives of the partnership are:  Obj. 1. Build an interdisciplinary platform to examine the desert-El Ni&#xF1;o-food nexus.  Obj. 2. Gather baseline information on El Ni&#xF1;o, effects, historical data, (using the past to understand the present and to better predict and plan for the future).  Obj. 3. Evaluate current systems (sea and continental fisheries, farming) by combining a social science focus on livelihoods with fisheries and agricultural sciences to address food systems from an interdisciplinary perspective.  Obj. 4. Develop a blueprint for production (sea-lagoon fishing and farming), processing, and commercialisation to take advantage of the new opportunities climate change generates for making El Ni&#xF1;o desert food-systems and livelihoods more sustainable."></capital-spend>
