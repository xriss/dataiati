   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The aim of this project is: To work with government, academic, and creative industry partners in Brazil to share and build on the findings of CWL&apos;s research into creative hubs. This will create outcomes of significant value to a range of non-academic beneficiaries, including the Government of Sao Paulo, Brazilian policymakers, SMEs in the creative economy of Sao Paulo, and owners and managers of creative hubs.   Its objectives are:   (1) To draw on CWL&apos;s research insights into &apos;creative hubs&apos; in London to support the State of Sao Paulo&apos;s objective of developing publicly funded creative hubs. Key research findings from London will be reviewed and modified in relation to the specific economic and cultural contexts of Sao Paulo. The project team will advise the Government of Sao Paulo specifically on the SMEs and entrepreneurs who should be invited to join their first creative hub being developed in 2016.   (2) To map the activities of Impact Hub (to be confirmed), Sao Paulo, an existing privately funded creative hub in Sao Paulo. Impact Hub is working with the State of Sao Paulo to support the development of a major new hub in the city of Sao Paulo. This research will focus on the SMEs and entrepreneurs within Impact Hub, Sao Paulo, looking specifically at key business needs and also at the CCI sectors represented in the hub.  The project will also facilitate a bridge-building phase between Impact Hub companies and entrepreneurs and academic researchers from the Design, Engineering School (Escola Politecnica), and Communications from the University of Sao Paulo (USP). It will then work closely with this creative hub to: (a) Implement a small innovation voucher scheme based on CWL&apos;s Creative Voucher scheme. (b)  Run two networking events. (c) Hold a business surgery, (d) Conduct a smaller qualitative survey speaking to local businesses in the same neighbourhood/area as the hub in order to gauge how the hub affects the local economy (e) run a conference to disseminate end-of-project research findings.   (3)To establish a network to support future collaborative work in this area involving government agencies in Brazil, the University of Sao Paulo, People&apos;s Palace Projects, creative economy institutions and SMEs in Brazil, and a range of creative hubs.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project will contribute to international development by working with governmental, academic, and creative industry partners in Sao Paulo, Brazil to inform the design and operation of new publicly funded creative hubs. Creativity, digital inclusion, and the beneficial social impacts of a growing creative economy are key to the development goals of the State of Sao Paulo. Having invested significantly in the past in accessible IT facilities to enable access to digital technologies for disadvantaged communities, the State now recognises that digital inclusion is insufficient in itself to achieve their development goals, and is thus seeking to re-purpose these facilities as Creative Hubs that can support entrepreneurial activity, facilitate networking and collaboration between SMEs, and generate positive economic outcomes for disadvantaged communities within the State of Sao Paulo. They have a strong interest in working with researchers from Creativeworks London (CWL) and from the University of Sao Paulo (USP) to inform the methodology they will adopt to facilitate co-creation, networking, and collaboration within their creative hubs, and see this as a pilot for more significant and sustained collaborations in the future. This project builds on research into creative hubs undertaken within the AHRC-funded CWL project from 2012-16. This research has been widely disseminated internationally. Research partners from the USP participated in a workshop exploring the CWL methodology and research findings related to creative hubs in 2015. The CWL PI (Shiach) gave a keynote lecture at the ABRAPCORP Conference (Communication and Cultural Industries) in Sao Paulo in May 2016. This research visit was supported by People&apos;s Palace Projects (PPP), which has an outstanding record of UK/Brazil collaboration with a focus on culture and creativity. This project will support knowledge exchange with an impact on cultural and creative organisations and businesses in Sao Paulo. It will enhance the value of the original CWL project by examining how some of its major research findings can make an important contribution to policy development in other cities around the world - especially in the Global South. The project will contribute to the UN Sustainable Development Goals by focusing on two areas: Goal 8, &apos;promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all&apos;; and Goal 11, &apos;make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable&apos;. In terms of the contribution that Arts and Humanities research can make to international development, this proposal will make a contribution in two areas: first, by supporting emerging creative economies, creative practices and creative hubs in ODA recipient countries; and second, by developing the potential for arts and humanities research to catalyse knowledge exchange between higher education institutions, state government, and creative SMEs in Sao Paulo.</narrative>
