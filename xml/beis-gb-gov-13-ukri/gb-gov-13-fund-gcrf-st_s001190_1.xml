   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Conventional and commercially available Radiation Therapy (RT) treatment systems utilise S-band linac technologies coupled to magnetron or klystron RF power sources, which invariably entails incorporation of the linac structure inside the rotating gantry for circumferential patient treatment. The theme of this activity is to assess a variety of different linac and RF source configuration options, taking advantage of recent technology developments in frequency ranges outside of the conventional provision. Advances in both Standing Wave and Travelling Wave linac operational performance and solid state, magnetron and klystron RF power delivery capabilities, have the potential to be able to define a new RT system configuration which can not only outperform, but also may offer a simpler, more efficient and robust system integration platform which can be more appropriately applied for ODA country exploitation.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="Objectives identified for this proposal are:  1. Assessment of suitable linac and RF amplifier configurations will enable exploration of both low and high frequency technologies which offer the ability to exploit modern, high operational performance devices which can provide a more modular approach for RT system integration.   2. Taking advantage of high power, solid-state amplifier solutions at frequencies below 1GHz are of particular interest, whereby such implementation can significantly simplify the RT system integration complexity through removal of all high-voltage power supply systems.   3. At higher frequencies above S-band, advanced linac technologies also offer the advantage of very high accelerating gradients (approaching 50MV/m) which can significantly reduce the physical footprint of the linac structure within the RT treatment platform. In addition at such high frequencies, the development of multi-beam klystron technologies has advanced considerably, offering high efficiencies and reduced HVPS complexity and associated costs.   4. In terms of the modularity which can then be employed, an assessment of configuration options will fundamentally explore the necessity for having the linac embedded within the rotating gantry and whether there are more effective approaches in detaching not only the RF amplifier system, but also the linac structure itself.   5. The intricacies of then providing robust RF and/or electron beam delivery through rotating RF and beam delivery interfaces has been a fundamental inhibitor for limited commercial system solutions which have adopted this approach in the past and so reassessing current technology viability will be of particular significance."></capital-spend>
