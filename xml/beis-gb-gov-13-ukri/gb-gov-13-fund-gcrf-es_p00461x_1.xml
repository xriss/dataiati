   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Is someone a refugee if he or she has fled to a state that hasn&apos;t signed the Refugee Convention or recognised refugees in its domestic law? If this person isn&apos;t a refugee, what rights does he or she have? What protection is owed to him or her by the new state of residence?    From Lebanon through to Malaysia, millions of refugees live in a broad, contiguous swath of states that have not signed up to the core international agreements concerning how refugees should be protected.  In such locations, refugees are often treated as &quot;outside of the law&quot; and subject to discrimination, abuse and other serious human rights violations.  The answers to the opening questions for these people are too often in the negative and the result can be catastrophic for refugees.  Refugees in these locations suffer a range of mistreatment as result of being seen as outside of the law, including irregular status, discriminatory treatment from landlords and employers, sexual harassment and assault with impunity (including at the hands of state officials), arbitrary arrest and indefinite detention (often in conditions so severe as to put their life at risk), and corporal punishments such as canning.  This project seeks to systematically explore some recent successes by local providers of legal aid to refugees in such situations and to determine whether these successes can form the basis for a new approach to refugee protection.  Working with four leading providers of legal aid to refugees in Egypt, India, Malaysia and Hong Kong, the project will evaluate the experiences of refugees, lawyers and legal aid organisations in using innovative legal arguments and frameworks to protect refugees.  The project will support the mapping of the relevant local legal frameworks through doctrinal legal analysis, interviews and workshops with legal experts, and discussion with refugee community leaders.  The project will provide funding to local lawyers to pursue legal advocacy for the rights of refugees drawing on a range of innovative sources of law, including other international treaties, local constitutional law, various local legislative provisions, local jurisprudence, and common-law principles.  It will collect detailed stories about 120 of these legal encounters; these stories will be documented over time, using a range of material, and from multiple points of view.  Forty of the stories will be turned in to multi-media, digital stories for further online discussion and advocacy.   The project will work closely with project partners.  Three international workshops will ensure that partners receive training and capacity building in the research methods of the project and fully participate in the analysis of the data produced by the project.  The findings of the project will be shared with the scholarly and professional communities through sub-regional workshops hosted in each of the four countries under study and through the presentation of the findings at a range of international conferences and meetings.  The goal of the project is to support new refugee legal aid programming in the Global South, particularly in places where such programming has been overlooked because either or both the lack of the Refugee Convention and the absence of local refugee legislation.  It aims to develop a better understanding of the process of litigation and factors that influence its success.  As both the UN more generally and UNHCR more specifically move towards a renewed emphasis on the rule of law, the project will suggest pathways to protection that are consistent with this new emphasis and which pay attention to the expertise and agency of local legal and refugee communities.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="The main objectives of the project are as follows:  (1) The project takes as its point of departure the inadequacies of and the need for an alternative to the current ad hoc, extra legal approach to protection in the large number of states in the Middle East and Asia which do not adhere to the treaties of the international refugee regime nor have domestic legislation to protect refugees.  The proposed alternative is the &quot;law of asylum&quot;: the creative use by local legal actors of existing legal frameworks, processes and institutions to provide protection to refugees.  This approach will be tested in the challenging jurisdictions of Egypt, India, Malaysia and Hong Kong.  (2) The project seeks to map the local legal frameworks that are available for the protection of refugees through the law of asylum, to validate these frameworks (and the problems that they address) with local refugee and legal communities, and to test the utility of these frameworks through sustained legal engagement (30 legal encounters in each case study jurisdiction).  (3) The project seeks to provoke a sustained discussion about legal engagement in the Global South.  This discussion will be provoked and informed by the following key interventions: (i) online discussion of the findings of the project and the legal encounters represented by the 40 digital stories produced by the project; (ii) national / regional workshops to share the findings in the Middle East, South Asia, South East Asia, and East Asia; (iii) scholarly and practitioner outputs, including journal articles, a practitioner-focused edited collection, a monograph, policy briefs and guidelines; and, (iv) engagements with scholarly and practitioner communities at a number of key meetings, in London, Geneva, Bangkok, and elsewhere.  (4) The project seeks the reformulation of policies with respect to protection in the Global South to include a focus on the use of legal engagement strategies even where the Refugee Convention and other traditional indicia of refugee law are absent and where the rule of law may be problematic.  Advocacy for this goal will be supported by the production as part of the project of 40 digital stories about legal encounters in the four jurisdictions studied by the project.  In addition, the project will produce policy briefs and guidelines for various stakeholders.  (5) By working closely with local providers of refugee legal aid in each jurisdiction and high-profile advisory board, the project will create cohorts of practitioners well versed in the discourses of refugee legal aid and with strong international support networks.  The project will support and strengthen existing networks such as the Asia Pacific Refugee Rights Network through partnership with its Legal Aid and Advocacy Working Group."></capital-spend>
