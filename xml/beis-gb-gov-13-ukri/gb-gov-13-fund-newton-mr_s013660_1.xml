   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Modern genomic technologies and development of genome analysis tools have been successfully applied to improve our understanding of the emergence, spread, short term evolution, and transmission of clinically important MDR bacteria. Genomic analysis has allowed us to determine with fine scale resolution the role played by inter-hospital patient transfer in national and international dissemination of MDR pathogens. It has allowed us to determine the selective forces which drive the evolution of MDR pathogens in the hospital and within patients and the clinical impact this can impose. Genomic analysis has also been used to identify outbreaks, potential sources of outbreaks, and inform successful interventions to bring an end to outbreaks within hospitals.  The scale of the MDR problem in Chinese hospitals is reaching alarming levels. The incidence of morbidity and mortality associated with MDR infections in China has grown year-on-year in the 21st century. Most alarming is the rise in the incidence of infections caused by A. baumannii, E. coli and K. pneumoniae which are resistant to carbapenems, that last line of antibiotics available to treat infections with MDR pathogens. The national CHINET network of clinical microbiology laboratories of 34 sentinel hospitals across China (www.chinets.com) report that in 2017, E. coli, K. pneumoniae and A. baumannii were the top three bacterial species recovered from clinical samples. There were 13,337 known cases of carbapenem resistant A. baumannii (69.3% carbapenem resistance prevalence), 6,434 cases of carbapenem resistant K. pneuomoniae (23% carbapenem resistance prevalence), and 845 cases of carbapenem resistant E. coli (2.3% carbapenem resistance prevalence). It is therefore vital that genomic level investigations of these bacteria are implemented in China immediately, to allow the breakthroughs in understanding transmission, spread, and infection control that have been afforded in the Western world.  The proposed research to be conducted by the network will be organised around three independent but inter-connected projects:  1) Investigate the reservoirs and routes of transmission of carbapenem resistant K. pneumoniae   2) Investigate the community carriage dynamics of carbapenem resistant E. coli leading to the continuous introduction of strains into hospitals and subsequent infections.  3) Investigate the reservoirs and routes of transmission of carbapenem resistant Acinetobacter baumannii.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="Whilst China is a global leader in genome sequencing, lack of resourcing has seen the implementation of genomics in clinical infectious disease research and control lag behind other countries. Most acutely there is a lack of sufficient genomic analysis and bioinformatics skills within the health care setting in China, making adoption of genomics in infectious disease research and control extremely difficult to implement. If China is to combat the increasing morbidity and mortality associated with multi-drug resistant (MDR) bacterial infection in its poorest and weakest members of society, then addressing this shortcoming is of paramount importance. Here we propose the generation of a research network of leading Chinese hospitals, and world-renowned microbial genomics researchers in the United Kingdom to address this pressing issue. We will consolidate, and build new partnerships to facilitate vital research investigating the transmission dynamics of (MDR) pathogens in Chinese hospitals, create a nucleus of highly trained bioinformaticians in the clinical setting, and create real-time sequencing capacity in hospitals. This will ensure an impact on the understanding and management of MDR infections long beyond the three-year lifespan of the proposed project.  The proposed project revolves around three primary objectives:  1) To create a pool of clinical infectious disease researchers with excellent skills in microbial genomic data analysis, bioinformatics, and microbial genomic project design  2) To investigate the effective routes of introgression and transmission of carbapenemase producing Enterobactericeae (CPE) in Chinese hospitals  3) To combine phenotypic antimicrobial susceptibility profiles with genomic data to ascertain genetic factors which influence variation in minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) levels."></capital-spend>
