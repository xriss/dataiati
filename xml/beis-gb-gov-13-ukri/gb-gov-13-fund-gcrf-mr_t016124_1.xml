   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Evaluating multiple loci modulating susceptibility of African malaria parasites to artemisinin</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Combination drugs for treatment of malaria deployed globally since the start of the 21st century have provided a substantial public health benefit. Malaria deaths across Africa in particular have plummeted since a peak in the 1990s, when failure of the drugs chloroquine and sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine precipitated a rise in infant and child deaths. A key component in all the currently effective drug combinations is the plant-derived chemical called artemisinin. The parasite-killing ability of artemisinin has recently been threatened by the emergence of reduced susceptibility in the Mekong region: this is manifest as a slowing of artemisinin clearance of P. falciparum from the blood of treated malaria patients. Although under combination treatments these patients should eventually experience a full cure in most cases, in this region the combination partner drugs are also failing in some patients. Careful monitoring and vigilance of malaria drug resistance is therefore needed. A parasite gene has been identified in Cambodia and the surrounding region which contributes to the loss of effectiveness of the artemisinin drug - this gene, which encodes a kelch-domain protein and is called K13, has accumulated a variety of mutations. These are strongly associated with the loss of effectiveness of artemisinin against these parasites. However, this same phenomenon has not yet been observed in African malaria parasites - in the small number of cases where drug treatment does not work, K13 mutations are not implicated as the cause.     In the past 2 years, gene-editing studies by ourselves and others have successfully demonstrated a direct effect of 3 genes in reducing susceptibility to artemisinin : pfap2mu, pfubp1 and pfcoronin. Variants of these genes elicit increased parasite survival in vitro in the ring-stage artemisinin survival assay (RSA). In the case of trafficking adaptor potein subunit AP-2mu, we have shown that the role of this protein in P. falciparum is unlike in other organisms as it does not interact with clathrin, but is associated with an as yet unknown compartment in the cell that appears to also contain K13, although we found no evidence of direct interaction between AP-2mu  and the K13 protein. There is, however, good evidence of direct interaction of AP-2mu with a different kelch protein , K10. Polymorphisms in the gene encoding the K10 protein have been previously identified as a genetic component of parasites from the Mekong region in which the K13-dependent reduced artemisinin susceptibility originally arose. This work was carried out by PhD student Ryan Henrici, who completed his doctoral studies in 2018 and has moved on.   We now request support to extend this work, using gene editing to test the effect of new mutations. In preliminary studies of both field samples and UK isolates, we have already identified a number of such new mutations in our current five genes of interest - pfk13, pfap2mu, pfubp1, pfcoronin and pfk10 (see Case for Support). For each new isolate (either from the UK or from our collaborator Dr Bismarck Dinko in Ho, Ghana) that is adapted to culture, we will fully test drug susceptibility, and genetically characterise them using genome sequencing. In gene-editing experiments we will then directly measure the impact of each candidate gene variant in both established laboratory lines and in our new cultures from UK and Ghanaian patients; any variant proven to generate a drug susceptibility phenotype may therefore be contributing to changing patterns of drug susceptibility, and could be developed as a surveillance marker for use in malaria endemic areas. Our work will thus assist our understanding of resistance to our current combination drugs, and help us to devise strategies for deploying these drugs carefully in both the UK and Africa, to maximise their useful life in curing malaria patients.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Front-line combination drugs for treating malaria patients world-wide are threatened by diminishing efficacy. In this project we will investigate an expanded group of candidate genes implicated in reduced susceptibility of the major malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum to artemisinin, the key component of all current fixed combination antimalarial regimens. Culture-established parasite isolates collected from UK travellers and patients in Ho, Ghana, will be tested for evidence of an in vitro phenotype of reduced susceptibility. Clinical isolates from patients known to have failed treatment, and thus with an in vivo phenotype of interest, will also be tested for in vitro susceptibility. Parasite isolates displaying either or both of these two phenotypes will then be characterised at the genomic level for variant alleles of five key loci - pfk13, pfap2mu, pfubp1, pfcoronin and pfk10 - and any new loci decribed in the literature in the course of the study. Variants associated with susceptibility phenotypes will then be rigorously tested by reverse genetics, using CRISPR-Cas9 gene-editing.  Specific objectives are:  1) Establish a comprehensive stable of in vitro culture-adapted P. falciparum isolates of African origin from UK travellers, with particular emphasis on those developing recurrent parasitaemia after treatment with artemisinin-based combination therapy; measure the in vitro susceptibility of each isolate to artemisinin and key partner drugs.   2) Perform whole-genome sequencing on all culture-adapted isolates, and identify variants of our five candidate artemisinin susceptibility-associated loci listed above, plus any other candidates subsequently identifed; cross-tabulate alleles of candidate genes occurring in those isolates with evidence of reduced drug susceptibility in vitro, or of patient treatment failure. 3) For each variant among the candidate loci asociated with either in vitro or in vivo suscpetibility phenotypes, utilise CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing of standard parasite lines 3D7 and Dd2 (chloroquine-sensitive and chloroquine-resistant, respectively) to test the impact of these variants on in vitro susceptibility to artemisinin and partner drugs. Once the required gene-editing reagents (transfection plasmids encoding guide RNA and recodonised donor repair DNA templates specific for each region of interest in each gene, as well as the Cas9 recombinase) have been proved successful in our 2 lab lines, we will move to gene-editing in the clinical isolates themselves. Candidate variants will be introduced into fully susceptible isolates, and ablated in isolates displaying an in vitro reduced susceptibility phenotype.   4) Extend our approach to a defined endemic country parasite population where artemisinin combination therapy is standard treatment: specifically, 50-100 in vitro culture-adapted P. falciparum isolates from patients presenting to clinics in Ho, Ghana, in 2017-2024 will be tested for susceptibility to artemisinin and partner drugs in vitro. Cultured parasites will then be analysed by whole genome sequencing to illuminate any genotype-phenotype associations in this parasite &quot;cohort&quot;, and any such putative associations observed will be rigorously tested using gene-editing. Variants of interest will be introduced to, or ablated in, representative Ho isolates at either extreme of the artemisinin susceptibility range and the impact of the transgene on in vitro phenotype assessed.</narrative>
