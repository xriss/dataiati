   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project is to build from catalogue components a new kind of high-resolution spectrograph. The concept relies on separating the complexity introduced by Earth from the requirements of the spectrometer unit itself. This separation enables a massive reduction in size and complexity on the spectrometer side and it is the natural complement to Adaptive Optics technologies being developed elsewhere. The concepts demonstrated here might be used to save tens of millions of pounds in instrumentation costs on the coming generation of extremely large telescopes but also be reproducible by University, public and amateur observatories and offer a competitive alternative to the purchase of large inefficient Fourier transform spectrometers in the wider marketplace. The key developments that we wish to demonstrate are, (1) a compact inexpensive design that can achieve the same performance as existing instruments in terms of wavelength coverage and spectral resolution and (2) bespoke active metrology/actuation of the system to achieve -or even surpass- the best wavelength calibration stability at a fraction of construction and operation costs and to produce a facility instrument. While the prototyping for this instrument is at the University of Hertfordshire, the facility instrument will be produced in Thailand but with the insight gained from operating a prototype version on the new 0.7m. The Thai government has made a large investment in the National Astronomical Research Institute of Thailand and so they have the new laboratories in which to build the instrument as well as immediate access to a new 0.7m. Current high-resolution spectrographs are large, expensive and difficult to maintain and are reserved to an elite of a handful universities and groups around the globe. Moreover, because these instruments are so expensive, technology cycles and designs have evolved very little and do not take advantage of the great quality improvement and reduced costs of new materials and mass produced optics. In a sense, the technological leap we want to embrace is like the one between the first digital cameras to the current smartphone technology. The economic development and welfare of a country relies on key infrastructure and the capabilities of the workforce. In the field of physics and in particular astrophysics, the ability to design and make instruments and to measure and interpret the properties of the transitions in other planets, stars and galaxies is a key cornerstone to understand the properties of the Universe. High-resolution spectroscopy has for decades being a primary tool of astrophysics and a driving force in enabling new fundamental astrophysics. From the discovery of planets around nearby stars to the direct measurement of the size of the Universe. Worldwide, the most oversubscribed instruments on telescopes have long been the high-resolution spectrographs. Although Thailand has a large telescope and a number of smaller ones it does not have a high resolution spectrograph. The proposal is aimed at using Overseas Development Aid funding to develop Thai infrastructure and capabilities while at the same time opening up a new collaboration which should have long-term benefit to the UK scientists and engineers.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="This proposal is to build a EXOhSPEC (EXOplanet high resolution SPECtrograph) for the Thai National Telescope. This will be novel in three key respects: (1) size, (2) active stablisation and (3) made entirely from catalogue components. The proposal is that the current prototype of EXOhSPEC will be developed as a fully functional instrument that will be built in Hertfordshire and Thailand and used on the NARIT on the 2.4m telescope. This project is about making the current prototype at the University of Hertfordshire into a facility instrument. The technical requirements that the system must move into the field are: 1) Resolution: Required &gt;70 000, goal 100 000. This will be achieved via the high dispersion properties of an echelle reflection grating operating at a large blaze angle (75 deg), at Littrow configuration. 2) Wavelength range coverage: Required 500nm-850nm, goal 450nm-1000nm. All the optics must be selected to achieve high throughput in this range. The cross disperser must be able to separate the diffraction orders while fitting in a 4k x 4k detector. 3) The image quality must be diffraction limited for 90% of the wavelength range. 4) Stability: The system must be able to keep high stability (~1 m/s) over time-spans longer than 20 min(requirement), goal (&gt;1 hour). 5) The system must be compact. Requirement, 30x50x15 cm3, Goal : All packaged in 30x30x10 cm3 box 6) Lead times for procurement of all the components must be short. Requirement: procurement lead time for any piece shorter than &lt;1 month, Goal : all catalog products (lead times &lt; 1 week)."></capital-spend>
