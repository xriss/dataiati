   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Indo-UK Centre for the improvement of Nitrogen use Efficiency in Wheat (INEW)</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Virtual Joint Centre will  1. Bring together the major UK and Indian research providers with programmes on nitrogen use in wheat, to coordinate activities, harmonise protocols and provide a unique range of genetic material, skills and research facilities. 2. Exploit these resources to carry out an integrated study of the genetic, biochemical and molecular basis for improved N use efficiency in wheat grown in the UK and India, from mechanisms of nitrogen uptake to partitionioning in the grain and effects on processing quality. 3. Identify candidate genes that control key processes limiting N use efficiency in wheat grown in the UK and India 4. Develop molecular markers for key traits and transfer these to commercial and public sector wheat breeders in the UK and India. 5. Provide training and exchanges for students and early career scientists in India and the UK. 6.     Provide training in key technologies to scientists in India and the UK. 7.     Establish a &quot;legacy&quot; of joint facilities and interactions as a basis for longer term joint research programmes.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Wheat is the most important staple crop grown in the UK, and one of the two major crops grown in India. Nitrogen fertiliser is a key determinant of yield and the major cost of wheat production in both countries and excessive application can result in pollution of groundwater and increased production of greenhouse gases. Breeders and farmers in the UK and India have worked hard to improve the efficiency of use of applied nitrogen, by improving the uptake and utilization efficiency within the crop through genetic improvement, together with the precision of fertilizer application in the field. However, further improvements are required to face the challenges of increasing crop production for an expanding global population with increasing uncertainty of climate. Both yield and quality attributes are dependent upon nitrogen inputs and need to be incorporated into economic and sustainable solutions.  We will therefore bring together the major UK and Indian wheat researchers with programmes on wheat improvement to determine the genetic control of nitrogen use efficiency in wheat. These comprise scientists from five Universities and Institutes in the UK and from six in New Delhi, Haryana and the Punjab, which is the major wheat-producing area of India. The studies will focus on comparisons of wheat lines and populations which differ in their nitrogen use efficiency. These lines will be grown in field experiments in both countries and studied in detail using a range of biochemical and molecular genetic approaches. This will lead to the identification of genes and molecular markers that can be exploited by wheat breeders globally, and to new strategies for improving the precision of nitrogen application which will delivered to farmers via well-established mechanisms in both countries.   Furthermore, since similar mechanisms are expected to determine nitrogen use efficiency in other plant species the results should be of wider applicability to other crops and countries. In addition to supporting a closely integrated research programme in the UK and India, the Centre will also provide a legacy of shared facilities, technologies, genetic material and datasets that will facilitate longer term bilateral collaborations, and provide training in crop genetics and genomics and exchanges for early career scientists and students in both countries.</narrative>
