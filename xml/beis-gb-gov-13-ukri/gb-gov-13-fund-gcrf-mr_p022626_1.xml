   <narrative xml:lang="EN">VACCINE - Development of novel picornavirus virus-like particle vaccines</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The strategy of the Medical Research Council is to improve the progress of international health research worldwide. Vaccination has had an enormous impact on human and animal health and is therefore one of the most important and effective medical interventions. However, there are still many examples of diseases for which we do not have effective vaccines. Furthermore, much of our current vaccine production involves the production of disease-causing agents (e.g. viruses) which are subsequently inactivated during the production process.  In their simplest terms, viruses can be thought of as protein containers that protect the viral genetic material inside. The container is inert - it is the viral genetic material inside which is responsible for causing disease. However, the container (capsid) is of key importance in the process of developing immunity through vaccination. Here, the body&apos;s immune system recognises the capsid proteins and generates antibodies to these, which then give the body protection against the disease. Therefore, production of just the capsid as a virus-like particle (VLP) should elicit a protective immune response, yet be totally safe. Furthermore, such production could be undertaken under low containment, which is both easier and cheaper, thus making such virus-like particle vaccines more accessible to developing countries. However, there are problems to be overcome, as many VLPs are unstable. We have a large amount of proof-of-principle data with the production of VLPs for poliovirus and have generated stabilised VLPs that offer better protection than the current polio vaccine (in animal models). We now we wish to apply our strategy to other viruses, focussing on the causative agents of hand, foot and mouth disease. This is a disease of growing concern due to outbreaks particularly in the SE Asia region, associated with hospitalisation and death. According to the World Health Organisation, this affected 1,520,274 people by the end of July in 2012 in China, with 431 reported deaths, and outbreaks are now reported in Europe.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">We will utilise the approach which we have validated with poliovirus in order to develop safe, effective and commercially viable vaccines for other picornaviral diseases, initially concentrating on the major causative agents of hand-foot-and-mouth disease in humans, enterovirus 71 (EV71) and Coxsackievirus A16 (CAV16). 1. Selection of EV71 and CAV16 viruses and native empty capsids with enhanced stability. 2. Acquisition/production of antibody reagents to distinguish &apos;native&apos; (H) and &apos;expanded&apos; (H) particles; assay development. 3. Development of expression constructs; VLP production and characterisation 4. Immunogenicity of natural and recombinant VLPs vs wt virions and VLPs and inactivated vaccines. 5. Initiate comparable studies with other enteroviruses.</narrative>
