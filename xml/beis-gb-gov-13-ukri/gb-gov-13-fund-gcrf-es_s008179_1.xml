   <narrative xml:lang="EN">A reliable and acceptable quantity and quality of water, and managing water-related risks for all is considered by the United Nations to be &quot;the critical determinant of success in achieving most other Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)&quot;.    Water is essential for human life, but also necessary for food and energy security, health and well-being, and prosperous economies.  However, some 80% of the world&apos;s population live in areas with threats to water security; the impacts of which cost $500bn a year.  Progress in meeting SDG6 (Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all), has been slow and in May 2018 the United Nations reported that &quot;The world is not on track to achieve SDG6&quot;.  Improvements that increase access to water or sanitation are undone by pollution, extreme weather, urbanization, over-abstraction of groundwater, land degradation etc.    This is caused by significant barriers that include: (1) Insufficient data to understand social, cultural, environmental, hydrological processes; (2) Existing service delivery / business models are not fit for purpose - costs are too high, and poor understanding of local priorities leads to inappropriate investments; (3) Water governance is fragmented and communities are engage with, and take responsibility for, water security; (4) Pathways to water security are not adaptable and appropriate to local context and values.  These barriers are inherently systemic, and will require a significant international and interdisciplinary endeavour.  The GCRF Water Security and Sustainable Development Hub brings together leading researchers from Colombia, Ethiopia, India, Malaysia and the UK.  Each international partner will host a Water Collaboratory (collaboration laboratories) which will provide a participatory process, open to all stakeholders, to jointly question, discuss, and construct new ideas to resolve water security issues.    Through developing and demonstrating a systems and capacity building approach to better understand water systems; value all aspects of water; and strengthen water governance we will unlock systemic barriers to achieving water security in practice.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="Our vision is to enable water security through developing and demonstrating a systems and capacity building approach that better understands water systems; values all aspects of water; and strengthens water governance to enable integrated water management.  The Hub brings together an internationally leading team of researchers from Colombia, Ethiopia, India, Malaysia and the UK.  Each of our 8 objectives is a step towards to our overarching vision:  1. Embed systems approaches within Water Collaboratories to identify transition pathways to water secure cities and catchments;  2. Map and understand Water Systems: (i) Collect and share data about physical, social, environmental aspects of the water system, and, (ii) Develop cloud services that provide information such as water quantity, quality, risks etc. to stakeholders;  3. Plan Water Systems: Reduce water security planning costs in developing nations with tools for rapid optioneering to quickly prototype, assess benefits, and approximate costs of water security interventions;   4. Value Water Systems: Embrace social, cultural, spiritual, environmental and economic values; and reconcile these values in a just and equitable manner that ensures the human right to water;  5. Govern Water Systems for all: Build capacity to allow all stakeholders to participate and cooperate in water security decisions, to enable a transition to integrated water governance that leaves no one behind;   6. Invest in Water Systems: Create tools to access finance and precipitate action by bringing together value capture and integrated governance mechanisms, to provide effective service delivery/business models;  7. Embed Water Systems and water security in the knowledge economy: Build interdisciplinary research capacity in all participants to tackle water security challenges beyond the initial five years of the Hub; and,  8. Lead in Water Systems: Continuously monitor, evaluate, and learn; and share to ensure real world impact, so the Hub is judged to be a global leader in water security by public, private, civic and academic actors."></capital-spend>
