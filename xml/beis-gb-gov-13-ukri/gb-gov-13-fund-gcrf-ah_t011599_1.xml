   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The goal of this research is to address a real-life housing problem affecting the livelihood of low-income residents in Klong Toey, Bangkok, Thailand. This project supports a low-income people-led initiative as a result of a precarious housing situation they are facing. The research seeks to address two interrelated domains of urban life; housing and livelihood. Housing and livelihood constitute fundamental human needs; the cumulative effect of the dysfunction of these aspects of human lives have greater consequences for vulnerable groups in lower and upper middle-income countries. By addressing livelihood problems and housing insecurity of low-income residents of the Klong Toey community, this research responds to structural inequalities rooted in low-income settlements, such as Klong Toey.  Bangkok has over 1.5 million people living in slums forming about 2,000 communities. Klong Toey settlement is situated on a land area owned by the Port Authority of Thailand and dates back to 1939, and has currently over 100,000 inhabitants. Despite several attempts over the years to evict the residents to allow for the expansion of the port&apos;s facilities, the population kept growing, and a strong community organisation, supported by voluntary agencies, started opposing eviction attempts since 1973. The pressure from the Port Authority has recently increased since the government decided to develop Klong Toey, as part of a master plan. The Port Authority views Klong Toey as a prime location for real estate development and as a new urban centre. The master plan was approved without public consultation with the Klong Toey community, who are facing eviction, hence the urgency of this proposal. We know from preliminary studies that uncertainties around housing and livelihood in Klong Toey are having negative impacts on low-income older people&apos;s health and well-being.   The project aims to start a positive collaborative process between low-income stakeholders, community organisations, policy-makers, and housing developers in Bangkok. It will engage with all parties to co-produce adequate and sustainable housing design options and redevelopment and relocation solutions that guarantee community cohesion and fabric, adequate housing forms, and offer opportunities for a secure and sustainable livelihood for all residents.  The project will develop housing and livelihood guidelines to guarantee the welfare and livelihood of vulnerable residents in Klong Toey, particularly older people and women. We anticipate that the co-design activities targeted at low-income participants will identify needs, create the opportunity to influence decision-makers and developers, and contribute to protecting the livelihood and the health and well-being of this vulnerable group. Additionally, other low-income countries may benefit from this project&apos;s bottom-up advocacy through its methodology to inform the architectural design of their housing, support for livelihood and how to engage with decision-makers at local level.  The project also proposes to contribute to improving governance structures in Bangkok influencing housing provision for low-income groups.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="The aim of this project is to support a low-income people-led initiative as a result of a precarious housing situation they are facing, which is also threatening their welfare given that most residents and particularly older people depend on their housing for their livelihood.   The project has the following four objectives. The first two objectives will set the context in which affordable and adequate live-work housing options and redevelopment and resettlement solutions will be considered within objective 3. Whereas WP4 will provide capacity building for early career researchers and other stakeholders, dissemination and implementation of the research programme.  1. To examine current challenges facing the provision of adequate alternative housing to low-income residents in Klong Toey, Bangkok. 2. To study current obstacles to maintaining livelihood and protecting the welfare of low-income residents in Klong Toey, Bangkok. 3. To co-produce a housing and livelihood toolkit for local housing actors and communities to support the provision of affordable and adequate live-work housing options and redevelopment and resettlement solutions. 4. To build capacity of early career researchers and advocacy groups through research training, co-design workshops, implementation of the research programme, and dissemination and impact creation."></capital-spend>
