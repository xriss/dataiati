   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Prevention of severe RSV infection by a helminth-induced serum factor that elicits antiviral monocytes?</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In babies and toddlers worldwide, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most common cause of a type of chest infection called bronchiolitis and causes severe lung inflammation. 2-3% of all babies in the UK have to be admitted to hospital with RSV bronchiolitis and some of them develop very severe and sometimes life-threatening disease. This happens particularly when very high numbers of virus particles are present after infection. Due to treatment costs and costs for the wider society (e.g. days lost at work for parents/ carers) RSV is responsible for a major financial burden. Despite all of this, no specific treatment or effective, widely available preventative interventions exist and novel approaches are urgently required. Palivizumab, a prophylactic antibody against RSV, can prevent hospital admissions by about 50% but due to high cost its use is limited to small groups of high-risk infants in affluent countries.    We have previously reported that infection with a gut parasite worm can reduce the number of viral particles in the lungs and disease severity in a mouse model of RSV infection. More recently, we have found that protection from severe RSV infection in this model is associated with increased production of immune cells called monocytes in the bone marrow and their accumulation in the lung. Monocytes are thought to be important in the immune response to RSV, but how they exert their antiviral effect is not fully understood. Importantly, all the above effects of parasite infection can be recapitulated with cell-free blood serum from infected mice, unless it has been heated. This suggests a central role for a protein in the serum, such as an immune system messenger molecule, as the soluble RSV-protective factor. If we can identify this factor, and work out what it is doing, we may in the future be able to develop a novel approach to protection from severe RSV disease in young children.      Here, we will initially use our mouse model to study which subgroups of monocytes occur and which monocyte genes are &apos;switched on&apos; during parasite infection, in order to define the mechanisms by which monocytes limit RSV infection. We will then use two approaches to identify the RSV-protective factor from blood serum; one where we measure, block and replace known candidate immune mediators in the serum, and another where we test groups of serum proteins of different sizes for their anti-RSV effect, followed by measurement of the proteins within the effective group and identification of candidate factors. These will then be tested individually for their antiviral effect and the RSV-protective factor will be identified. Finally, to translate our findings from the mouse model to humans, we will use existing blood samples from Ugandan children with and without gut parasite worms. We will assess the activation of genes to see if those with parasite infection also have more monocytes and more active anti-viral genes in their blood and we will measure the concentration of the newly identified RSV-protective factor to see if it is elevated in parasite-infected children.    These studies will let us find out which parasite-induced factor is responsible for the protection from RSV infection and how monocytes contribute to this protection. They will also tell us if the RSV-protective factor and/or monocytes will be promising new targets to develop preventive treatment for severe RSV bronchiolitis.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">We have recently observed that infection with Heligmomoides polygyrus (Hp), a murine gut helminth, reduces lung viral load and disease in respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) co-infection. Our preliminary data suggest that this Hp effect is mediated through a serum-transferrable mechanism that leads to lung monocytosis. We wish to capitalise on our observation since it may present an exciting opportunity to develop effective, affordable and widely available prevention against severe RSV-bronchiolitis, which is currently lacking. This project also presents an opportunity to better understand the basic biology of protection from RSV, and how common intestinal parasites and respiratory viruses interact.   The objective of this project is to identify the helminth-induced RSV-protective factor and to understand its antiviral mechanism by defining the role of monocytes in this helminth-induced antiviral effect. Our overarching hypothesis is that helminth infection of the gut, through soluble serum mediators, drives monopoiesis and recruitment of monocytes to the lung, which prime the antiviral pulmonary response, conferring protection from severe RSV infection.   Our specific objectives are to determine whether  1. Hp infection leads to increased monopoiesis in the bone marrow, blood monocytosis and CCR5-mediated monocyte recruitment to the lung. 2. Hp infection induces a transcriptionally distinct monocyte population with antiviral effects in RSV infection. 3. The effects of Hp infection on monopoiesis, lung monocyte recruitment and RSV replication are mediated by a discrete protein factor in serum, which we aim to identify and validate. 4. Children infected with enteric helminths (hookworm, trichuris) have increased blood monocytes, antiviral gene expression and serum levels of the RSV-protective factor.</narrative>
