  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Chinese Government has launched several initiatives for financing health and welfare services and it has allocated substantial amounts of money to these initiatives. Despite big increases in expenditure, there is evidence that there are problems with the appropriateness and value for money of these services. City governments are experiencing growing demands for a variety of services associated with high levels of migration, an ageing population and rising expectations. This has stimulated some city governments to experiment with new ways of organising service provision, government contracting with providers and ensuring that these providers are accountable to the local community. The Institute of Sociology of the Chinese Academy of Social Studies has established partnerships with a small number of cities to generate evidence from the experience of these pilot interventions. Its findings contribute to national debates on the changing role of government in the delivery of health and welfare services.  A number of other rapidly developing middle-income countries face similar challenges with the need to adapt health and welfare services to rapidly changing needs. They are also exploring new types of relationship between government, service providers and structures of local accountability. There are few opportunities for mutual learning from these experiences. The overall aim of the proposed partnership between the Institute of Sociology of the Chinese Academy of Social Science and the Institute of Development Studies, which hosts the STEPS Centre, is to support efforts by governments in China and other low and middle income countries to adapt their health and welfare services to a context of rapid and inter-connected changes. It will achieve this through a series of exchange visits and workshops that provide opportunities for Chinese researchers to collaborate with counterparts in the UK and in other rapidly developing middle-income countries in building a systematic understanding of the changing relationships between governments, providers of health and welfare services and the communities that use these services. The specific objectives are: 1  To enable Chinese researchers to draw on lessons from the experiences of the UK and of several rapidly developing middle-income countries to support city governments that are experimenting with new approaches and to provide advice to national policy makers  2  To provide a forum for mutual learning between policy makers and policy analysts in China and other rapidly developing middle-income countries  3  To design and secure funding for a multi-country programme of research 4  To support bilateral Anglo-Chinese collaboration in exploring approaches for meeting the needs of the rising numbers of the elderly</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposal is to establish a partnership between the Institute of Sociology of the Chinese Academy of Social Science and the Institute of Development Studies to explore the changing relationships between government and providers of health and welfare services in China and in other countries experiencing rapid and interconnected economic, social and demographic change.  The project will support visits of British researchers to Chinese cities that are experimenting with health and welfare system reforms and participate in workshops with Chinese researchers and policy-makers to discuss lessons emerging from the Chinese experience and from the experiences of other countries. It will also support visits of Chinese researchers to the UK to collaborate with British researchers, learn lessons from the experiences of the British health and welfare system and develop collaborative links with researchers from other rapidly developing middle-income countries.  It will also support the participation of Chinese researchers in meetings with policy analysts from other countries experiencing rapid economic, social and demographic change. The main outputs will be publications in academic journals, policy briefs for decision-makers and the development of a programme of research and mutual learning on adapting health and welfare services to contexts of rapid change. The outputs of this project and the subsequent research programme will enable policy makers and policy analysts in low and middle-income countries to draw on lessons from the experiences of China and other rapidly developing countries as they address similar challenges in their health and welfare sectors.</narrative>
