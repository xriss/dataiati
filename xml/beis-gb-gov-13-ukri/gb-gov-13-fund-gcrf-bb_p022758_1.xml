   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Household biomass ash as a fertilizer to sustainability improve soil nutrition to enhance rice yields</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The overall objective is to redress the impact that over-cropping of rice paddy fields, initiated during the Green Revolution, has caused to soil sustainability with respect to non-fertilized macro- &amp; micro- nutrient elements (B, Ca, Co, Cu, Mg, Mo, Ni, Se, Si) in Bangladesh. Agronomic waste streams (straw/stems, animal) are, at best, only sporadically recycled as fertilizers, leading to nutrients being non-sustainably stripped from the land.  This application focuses on Pleistocene Tract soil physiographical units which do not receive fresh yearly inputs of nutrient rich fluvial deposits, &amp; are naturally more deficient in elemental-nutrients.   Reuse/redeployment of waste-streams must be based on the strongest scientific basis to systematically maximize benefits (yield/sustainability); whilst ensuring potential negatives (pathogens, mobilization of As/Cd) are minimized. The central non-fertilized element for sustaining rice yield is Si, with rice being a Si accumulator &amp; vital to maintaining high-yields as it protects against insects, pathogens &amp; lodging, &amp; limits the uptake of Cd &amp; As. By recycling rice crop waste-streams, &amp; additionally sourcing other supplies of local, Si-rich material, for paddy fertilization, soil health can be built-up, restored &amp; sustained.   Specific objectives are: (i) To obtain a mass-balance of the agronomic &amp; non-agronomic nutrient element-flows, through subsistence farming communities in Bangladesh villages in the Madhupur, the Barind Tract regions. These areas contain semi-natural forest &amp; fruit orchard patchworks, interspaced with agronomic land, &amp; that villages occupy raised land that is typically forested to provide shade. Leaves, twigs &amp; fallen timber are systematically collected for firewood, providing supplemental mineral ash resource. Part of this task will be to establish what is currently done with all agronomic &amp; semi-natural waste resources to directly feed into Objective (ii). (ii) To develop workable (time, resource &amp; acceptability) interventions to either redirect agronomic wastes streams, or to capture additional resource, for paddy fertilizer. Household ash recovery, recovery from local rice mills (husk &amp; husk ash), ash used for poultry bedding which is manure enriched, ash from forest firewood scavenging, &amp; composted kitchen waste, will be assessed. As Tract regions are also key areas for horticultural produce, the quantity &amp; utility of waste streams arising from vegetable &amp; orchard crops also needs considering.  (iii) Field-trials of waste-streams to assess optimization for enhancing crop yield &amp; sustainability through improving soil mineral &amp; organic matter (OM) status. Here conventional NPKS &amp; Zn fertilization will be used as a control plus &amp; minus main waste-streams in a full factorial design. Additionally, straightforward straw incorporation, which is sometimes, but not systematically practiced will be tested to see if this is the best waste-stream recycling option as it is closest to source &amp; unprocessed, but use off excludes use as animal feed, bedding, fuel etc.. Waste-stream fertilization will be at maximal application rates for what is produced in that agronomic catchment on a per ha basis. Trials will be held across 20 villages of WP(i). Six commonly used local, high-yielding rice cultivars will be trailed for both monsoon &amp; dry-season production. Straw &amp; grain yield, grain nutrient density, &amp; soil nutrient status before &amp; after cropping will all be assessed. Pest &amp; microbial disease infection rates will be assessed both visually &amp; using molecular characterization. Total Cd &amp; As speciation in grain &amp; shoot will be assessed to see if waste stream management is either neutral, enhances or mitigates concentrations present.   (iv) Devise best management practice for subsistence paddy soil agronomic waste stream recycling from WPs (i-iii), identify further/future areas to develop, &amp; the application to other subsistence rice economies globally.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This proposal is to improve the lot of the subsistence farmers of Bangladesh by giving them sustainably higher yields of rice, through recycling of agronomic and natural environment wastes, primarily as ash from household cooking fuels. Bangladesh agronomic soils are over cropped as they tend to be harvested twice a year, with the heavily application of NPKS and Zn fertilizers to maintaining this cropping intensity. This leaves the nutrients not fertilized (B, Ca, Co, Cu, Mg, Mo, Ni, Se, Si) being removed year on year in the crop. In Bangladesh rice straw is fed to cattle and the resulting cattle dung used for fuel in the home. Only sporadically is household ash added back to land. Domestic fuel is also collected from the interspersed semi-natural forests and orchards that typify the Bangladesh agronomic landscape, with this ash providing additional mineral resource. Along with composted household waste, rice-mill waste, animal bedding and horticultural crop waste, there are many nutrient rich waste streams to be tapped with respect to use as paddy field fertilizers. If these streams are redirected back to the land enhanced yields of rice can be obtained sustainably, giving more wealth and resources to subsistence rice farmers throughout Bangladesh. This recycling approach developed for Bangladesh can be used throughout the world, adapting to local rice growing management and societal practices.   The proposal has four stages. The first is to characterize the nutrient content and quantity of waste streams flowing through Bangladeshi substance rice farming villages. The second task is to maximize ways in which to redirect these waste-streams back to the land. The third is to trial, through both wet and dry season rice cultivation, across 20 geographically separated Bangladeshi villages, the utility of these wastes for building up soil health and increasing rice yields, testing common Bangladeshi rice cultivars.  Fourthly, and finally, a management protocol will be derived for dissemination across the rice farms of Bangladesh to educate what are the best ways to sustainably manage paddy fields using local recycled resources.</narrative>
