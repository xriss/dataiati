   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Resilience In Groundwater Supply Systems: integrating resource-based approaches with agency, behaviour and choice in West Africa (RIGGS)</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Access to safe and reliable water supplies is a key goal across most of Africa. Groundwater reserves increasingly play a critical role in achieving this as part of resilient water supply services. Yet, risks of contamination and over-abstraction threaten to undermine the resilience of this supply. The rapidly rising trend for privately-developed wells and boreholes raises concerns about the vulnerability of water supplies to natural or man-made environmental shocks. However, the social, political and economic processes underpinning this are poorly articulated. The potential scale of the situation is particularly marked in Nigeria where the use of boreholes has increased exponentially since 1999 (from 10% of the population to 38% in 2015), with most other forms of water supply, notably piped tap water, falling.  Developing effective groundwater management approaches that build the resilience of communities is challenging, not least given the range of different actors involved, their competing interests and demands, and variations in the hydrogeological environment. Insights from resilience studies in social science emphasise how the resilience of ecological resources to shocks and change is critically linked to the adaptive capacity of social systems and their agents. Choices made now have long-lasting effects, yet these choices are little understood. Understanding the choices made by consumers, drillers and policy actors requires a strong interdisciplinary dimension and argues for new perspectives as to how the resilience of communities and societies might be built.  The project brings together a unique interdisciplinary collaboration between academics in the fields of economic geography, psychology, hydrogeology and journalism studies from the UK and Nigeria. The project will develop and test an innovative framework for understanding the interplay between environmental resources, social systems and behavioural choices affecting the resilience of groundwater supplies. It will do this through developing a mixed-methods approach that will be trialled in three pilot study areas in Nigeria. This will enable the study team to consider the role groundwater resources can play in building the resilience of communities to future potential environmental shocks; the risks posed by private abstraction trends to the resilience of communities to sudden or slow-onset environmental hazards; the role of different media in framing communities&apos; understanding of groundwater resources, and individuals&apos; and organisations&apos; perceptions, choices and behaviour; and how perceptions, choice, behaviour and agency can influence (policy) actions to reduce vulnerabilities and enhance resilience.     The project builds on the published interests of the World Bank, UNICEF, WaterAid and other key actors in Nigeria and Africa. It will build links with these, and other, organisations to ensure that the project is relevant to their interests and can inform their future thinking. To maximise the effectiveness of the project we are working closely with the leading network operating in this area - the Rural Water Supply Network (RWSN). This includes participation in the quinquennial RWSN Forum, a survey of RWSN members and webinars hosted by RWSN. These actions will extend the reach of the project and set a context for the findings of the pilot actions.   Overall, the project will strengthen knowledge for building the resilience of groundwater resources in the face of environmental hazards, through integrating resource-based approaches with a stronger appreciation of the influence of human agency.  It will inform our understanding of the underlying drivers of disaster risk, how actions are incentivised in different contexts, the role of communications and media in influencing the choices and decisions being taken and the role played by multi-level governance actors in framing these choices through their policy actions.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project will strengthen knowledge for building the resilience of groundwater resources in the face of environmental hazards, through integrating resource-based approaches with a stronger appreciation of the influence of human agency. This will contribute to a greater understanding of how key sustainable development goals might be met - particularly those aimed at ensuring the availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all, and making cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable. There are 4 principal objectives:  1. To foster new concepts and insights in this critical field through developing and testing an innovative interdisciplinary framework for understanding the interplay between environmental resources, social systems and behavioural choices affecting the resilience of groundwater supplies. This will be achieved through: 1) Developing common tools and approaches to examine the implications of the rise in privately developed wells for domestic water consumption on the resilience of the communities concerned, and the choices and behaviours associated with this.    2) Trialling these tools in different contexts through three linked pilot studies in Nigeria. The results of this exercise will deepen our understanding of the role of human agency in the resilience of groundwater capacities and offer insights into how to build resilience to future environmental shocks. In particular we seek to examine: a) the role groundwater resources play in building the resilience of communities to future potential environmental shocks  b) the risk that the on-going exploitation of groundwater resources through private development might contribute to a lessening of the resilience of communities to sudden or slow-onset environmental hazards in the future c) the role of different media in framing communities&apos; understanding of the groundwater resource, and individuals&apos; and organisations&apos; perceptions, choices and behaviour regarding this  d) how perceptions, choice, behaviour and agency - in the context of groundwater use - influence actions to reduce vulnerabilities and enhance resilience, and how prospective interventions may be appropriately designed/framed 3) Refining the tools in the light of the pilot studies so that they can be scaled up and applied in other contexts.   2. To establish a new, and lasting, interdisciplinary research-led collaboration between academics in the UK and in Nigeria. This will combine the knowledge of those with experience of Low and Middle Income Countries (LMICs) and those with experience of research in primarily European contexts, combining expertise from the fields of geography, hydrogeology and engineering, psychology, and journalism studies. Through the project we will work to extend the reach of this collaboration, by engaging with wider networks relevant to this field and inviting key speakers to the Final Conference (such as from the NERC UPGro project and the University of East Anglia).     3. To develop long-lasting partnerships with key policy and practice communities, to contribute to the debate on how to build the resilience of societies to natural and anthropogenic environmental hazards in the field of water supply. The engagement of users is integrated throughout the project, from proposal design through workshops, webinars and participation in high-profile events. This will build the foundations for strong partnerships for future activity.    4. To define a future research agenda that identifies research and innovation questions that integrate resource-based approaches for managing the resilience of groundwater supplies with a stronger appreciation of the influence of human agency. Through this we seek to raise the profile of this crucial and rapidly-emerging issue amongst beneficiaries and users, including international policy actors, national and state level actors and practitioner bodies, and funding organisations.</narrative>
