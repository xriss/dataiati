   <narrative xml:lang="EN">A capacity-building platform for advancing biostatistics in Ethiopia, Kenya and Malawi</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The overarching goal of this proposal is to develop a self-sustaining capacity building platform for advancing biostatistical methodology research in Kenya, Malawi and Ethiopia.  The grant will sponsor six training fellowships for full-time employed researchers in biostatistics at the Kenya Medical Research Institute Wellcome Trust Research Programme (KEMRI-WTRP) in Nairobi and Kilifi (Kenya), the Malawi-Liverpool Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Programme (MLW-CRP) in Blantyre (Malawi) and the Department of Statistics of Hawassa University in Ethiopia. The rationale for our chosen partners is that Hawassa has a strong postgraduate programme in statistics while KEMRI-WTRP and MLW-CRP provide applied biostatistics environments linked to  substantive public health context and expertise.   The six Fellows will be placed in Lancaster University and Cambridge University for the duration of 12 months and will work on the development of advanced statistical methodology motivated by three substantive global health problems. The programme will enable the Fellows to operate as integral members of multi-disciplinary research teams by further development of their expertise in biostatistics, skills in teaching of statistical subjects and their ability to develop high-quality documented statistical software.  The specific activities of this proposal are the following. Training courses in geospatial statistical methods and mathematical modelling of infectious diseases will be delivered by Lancaster and Cambridge. These courses will be tailored to the specific needs and projects of each Fellows. During the programme, the Fellows will also design new courses in statistics to be delivered at their respective institutes after completion of the project. This will be carried out in collaboration with the PI and CIs who will provide high quality support in the creation of new teaching material and educational statistical software. The core spirit of this programme is of a continuous and strong interaction between the Fellows and the investigators, who will act both as project supervisors and mentors.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The specific objectives of the proposal in order of priority are the following.  1. To offer training fellowships to six fully-employed African biostatisticians from the Kenya Medical Research Institute Wellcome Trust Research Programme (KEMRI-WTRP), the Malawi-Liverpool Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Programme (MLW-CRP) and the Department of Statistics in Hawassa University in Ethiopia. The core activities of the training programme will be motivated by three research projects in global health which urgently require the development of novel statistical methodology. During the programme, the six fellows will be placed at Lancaster and Cambridge for 12 months under the supervision and mentorship of the PI and CIs as indicated in the &quot;Case for support&quot;. The Fellows will undertake an intensive training programme in statistics consisting of carefully selected courses from the Master programmes in biostatistics of the two hosting institutions. These will be complemented with workshops aimed at equipping the Fellows with the specific technical kills required for a successful completion of their research projects.  2. The Fellows will develop new courses in statistics that they will deliver at their home institutions on completion of the programme. During the programme, the Fellows will also have the opportunity to attend workshops offered by the Departments of Education in Lancaster and Cambridge so as to further their teaching skills in statistics. The PI and CIs will provide an important supervisory role for the design of the courses and creation of teaching material. All this will be carried out while ensuring that teaching goals of the Fellows align with the specific pedagogical aims of their home institutions.   3. To create a self-sustaining capacity-building platform of statistical expertise between the UK and African research centres involved in the programme. These will collaborate closely by sharing their skill sets in statistics, while UK research partners will provide a leading role for training and research support. Strengthening biostatistical expertise in Africa is fundamental so as to equip health research programmes with the required statistical and mathematical skills in the face of rapidly growing opportunities for collecting and using data to &quot;ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages&quot; (Sustainable Development Goal 3: Sustainable Health and Well-being) continent-wide.  4. To expand the outreach of the programme to other African centres.  Our long-term objective is to create new sustainable training and research partnerships which 1) will provide a pipeline of highly skilled biostatisticians to support public health projects Africa-wide, 2) will develop sustainable south-south and north-south collaborative relationships and 3) will act as models for similar developments in other disciplines and countries.</narrative>
