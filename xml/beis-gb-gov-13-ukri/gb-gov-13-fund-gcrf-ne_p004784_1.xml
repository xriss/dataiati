   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed research will assess the impacts of and responses to extreme drought (Botswana and Zambia) and floods (Kenya) associated with the 2015-16 El Ni&#xF1;o (EN) and subsequent rainy season. The aim is to examine the economic consequences for small and medium enterprises (SME) as they are affected by: water supply disruption in Botswana&apos;s capital Gaborone due to drought; extreme flooding in Kenya; and disruption in Zambia&apos;s electricity supply due to reduced hydropower production caused by low reservoir levels. The project is a partnership between the Grantham Research Institute (London School of Economics), the African Collaborative Centre for Earth System Science (University of Nairobi), the Botswana Institute for Technology Research and Innovation and the University of Barotseland (Zambia). African SME are seen as crucial for growth and prosperity, yet they face numerous challenges, including climate-related disruption to essential activities. However, these impacts are often poorly documented and the evidence base of economic impact is very sparse. This research is timely and urgent; in all three cases there is a need for real-time/rapid assessment as retrospective studies suffer from recall bias.  The study is designed to start in April 2016 and track impacts and response through to February 2017 to make repeat surveys of EN impacts, institutional response and learning.  We identify three main objectives; 1) To document the hydrological impacts and water resource management response during and after the 2015-16 EN. 2) To assess the recent and ongoing socio-economic impacts of EN-induced disruption and mitigation responses in SME. 3) To examine factors affecting risk perceptions and behavioural change during a period of extreme climate disruption.  All three objectives concern important knowledge gaps and are also designed to generate evidence and novel insights that can inform policy and practice to support more effective climate risk management. The project aims to make a difference through academic papers for disciplinary (hydrology, climatology) and interdisciplinary environmental journals. We will also make presentations at relevant national and regional fora and present key insights to disaster management agencies. We will explore opportunities to scale-up outputs through joint collaborations (workshops, events) with other projects supported by this call. Programme and plan of research - The work consists of six main stages over 18 months; 1) Scoping of EN impacts from web reports and local media, complemented with stakeholder consultations to agree study locations and sampling strategy. April-May 2016 2) Design survey and interview questions, identify key respondents and SME. May-June 2016 3) First survey and interviews. July-August 2016 4) Data entry, transcription and analysis. September-December 2016 5) Repeat revised survey and follow-up interviews (Learning assessment). December 2016-February 2017 6) Complete analysis and write-up. March-September 2017 Dissemination activities will be undertaken throughout the full period and include a small mid-project stakeholder event and final dissemination event in each country. The proposed work aims to integrate contextual information, biophysical data, interviews and surveys, collected at key points during the study.  The work will generate rigorous baseline evidence for three countries of EN associated drought and flood impact pathways and damages. Robust evidence of damages is essential for costing disaster risk reduction programmes and adaptation and useful to governments and development actors for targeting actions. Insights of water/disaster management and SME response and follow-up assessment of risk perceptions and learning will allow us to generate recommendations on preparedness and response (what works well; why, where and when) and feed these into research, practice and policy communities.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="The proposed research will assess the impacts of and responses to extreme drought (Botswana and Zambia) and floods (Kenya) associated with the 2015-16 El Ni&#xF1;o (EN) and subsequent rainy season. The aim is to examine the economic consequences for small and medium enterprises (SME) in the agricultural/urban sectors, as they are affected by: water supply disruption in Botswana&apos;s capital Gaborone; the direct and indirect effects of flooding in Kenya; and load shedding in Zambia&apos;s electricity supply from disrupted hydropower production caused by low reservoir levels. In all three cases we will track the physical hydrological impacts and responses of water resource managers and SME as their sectors are affected by climate anomalies associated with 2015-16&apos;s EN. This research is timely and urgent: in all three cases there is a strong need for real-time/rapid assessment as retrospective studies suffer from recall bias and lack the detail that can be gained from near immediate structured collection of respondent data. Furthermore whilst the EN may have peaked its consequences are far from over and will continue for many months, e.g.: lag times in reservoir level recovery; long-lasting flood damage; crop yield and livestock impacts that are just beginning to appear.  The analysis will link detailed tracking of impact pathways: EN &gt; drought/flood &gt; physical impacts &gt; management response &gt; socioeconomic consequences. The study is designed to start in April 2016 and track impacts and response through to February 2017 in order to make repeat surveys of impacts, response and learning, and to capture any anticipatory actions if a La Ni&#xF1;a is forecast. The project has three main objectives; 1) record the hydrological impacts and water resource management response during and after the 2015-16 EN drought (Botswana and Zambia) and floods (Kenya) 2) assess the recent and ongoing economic impacts of EN-induced disruption and mitigation responses in SME in Botswana, Kenya and Zambia&apos;s agricultural/urban sectors 3) examine factors affecting risk perceptions and behavioural change during a period of extreme climate anomalies and resource disruption  Objectives 1 and 2 address critical knowledge gaps in the biophysical and socio-economic evidence base for EN impact pathways in three countries with well-established strong teleconnection patterns that are all manifest during the current event. Objective 1 addresses the understanding of biophysical impact pathways in complex hydrological systems, and the role of organisational response in mediating impacts. Objective 3 explores behavioural issues for hazard management that are rarely considered in developing country contexts, particularly during or directly after extreme events.  All three objectives concern important knowledge gaps and are designed to generate evidence and novel insights that can inform policy and practice to support more effective climate risk management. For example, more detailed understanding of hydropower impact pathways should highlight entry points for improved management of hazards, may provide economic arguments for specific interventions and lead to greater reliability of electricity supply for SME which play a significant role in employment and poverty reduction.   Anticipated achievements and outputs - 3-4 academic papers are planned: 1-2) Case studies of evidence base of hydrological and economic impact on SME for Climatic Change and/or Water Resources Research, 3) Practitioner behaviour during hazards for Climatic Change, 4) Synthesis paper for high impact interdisciplinary journal. In-country fieldwork will provide opportunities to make presentations at relevant national and regional fora. Key insights will be presented to DFID country offices and relevant disaster management agencies. We will explore opportunities to scale-up outputs through joint collaborations with other projects supported by this call and/or ongoing DFID-RCUK research programmes."></capital-spend>
