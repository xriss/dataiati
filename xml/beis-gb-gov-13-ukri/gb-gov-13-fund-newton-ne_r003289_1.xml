   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Innovative low-cost optical sensor platform for water quality monitoring</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project designed to improve the welfare of the population of India by developing better water quality monitoring at a lower cost and thus, promoting healthcare and wellbeing and with that supporting the people, livestock, and agricultural product to be safe and thus enhancing health, finances, and well-being. It is exploiting the world-class expertise available in India and in UK in Photonics, a key Enabling Technology (KET) to make a difference. The main objective of the project is to develop a novel platform for rapid, in-situ and multi-parameter detection of harmful pollutants in water to enhance the wellbeing and health of disadvantaged people in India through:  1. The use of established fibre based optical sensors incorporating multiplexed fibre Bragg gratings (FBG), Long Period gratings (LPG), and tapered nano-fibres for simultaneous multi-parameter sensing for biological and chemical pollutants in water 2. The designs and optimisation of more innovative emerging nanotechnologies in planar photonics, such as slot-guides, ring resonators, and whispering gallery modes Silicon Photonics exploiting well developed CMOS technology for more compact and potentially at a low-cost optical sensors for water quality sensors 3. Development of surface functionalisation of biosensors with engineering nanomaterials, reduced graphine oxide, for their specificity to specific target pollutants with improved sensitivity, for example, E coli, cholera, Hg2+, arsenic and pesticides.  4. Multiplexing of such optimised sensors with a low-cost frugal interrogation system and followed by advanced signal processing to process multi-parameter sensing with reduced cross-sensitivity. Field trials will be carried out in IISc campus and with Bangalore Water Supply &amp; Sewerage Board.  The project will select some limited number of targeted pathogens, such as E coli and cholera pathogens and selected heavy metals such as mercury and arsenics, to fit-in the funding limit. However, in future other emerging pharmaceutical and pesticide pollutants can be added in the target lists. The developed interrogation system would be capable to monitoring 300 individual targeted pollutants simultaneously.   To carry out this work, a team with expertise in photonics modelling, optical fibre sensor development, surface chemistry, deployment of smart interrogating systems with advanced signal processing has been brought together both in the UK and India with key input from users group.  Combine the efforts of physicists, chemists, biologists, engineers and water experts on the development of integrated photonics sensors for continuous in-situ, multi-parameter monitoring of selected harmful pollutants in water supply and to design, develop, test better systems to reduce possible infections, outbreak of disease, and thus suffering of humans.  Development of innovative, real-time, in-situ, robust, accurate, reliable, and lower-cost optical sensors that measure the key biological pathogens and chemical pollutants to continuously monitor water quality, for drinking, and domestic, industrial and agricultural uses within the targeted limits of various identified pollutants for the overall safety, economical and social wellbeing of India. The consortium will benefit from the advice and their interactions with professional bodies both in UK and in India including other stakeholders such as water supply authorities, municipalities and relevant ministries.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Water is essential to life. Access to safe drinking water may be norm in developed countries, but two billion people in developing countries, like India have limited access to clean water and according to the WHO, mortality of water associated diseases exceeds 5 million people per year. Waste water from geological sources contains pollutants like arsenic and fluorides or discharge from industries, agricultural farms, and household wastes contain pharmaceutical, heavy metals, pesticides, fertilisers, organic waste, and faeces discharged to rivers and lakes.  Waterborne diseases are caused by pathogenic microorganisms that mostly are transmitted in contaminated fresh water and results from bathing, washing, drinking and in the preparation of food. Bacterial pathogens, cause major diarrhoea, resulting in millions of avoidable deaths, with more suffering of children. Industrial wastes such as heavy metals are toxic to marine life and subsequently to humans who eat those causing birth defects and cancers. Effect of many industrial wastes can be very slow, often identified very late. Waste organic matter, fertilisers, and nutrients deplete oxygen from water and cause suffocation to fish and other aquatic organisms and ultimately human consuming these infected fish.  CITY has excellent facilities for fabricating FBG and LPG, complements IISc expertise. Several concatenated gratings can be fabricated on the same optical fibres to detect several species simultaneously and each grating can be prepared for different selectivity with different Bragg wavelengths for multiplexing. Advanced micro-fibres, micro-knots and micro-spheres can also be functionalised for more compact optical sensors. On the other hand, silicon nanophotonics is an exciting emerging area of research and innovation, which exploits the well developed CMOS technology developed by highly matured semiconductor industries. Exotic slot waveguide, where light is confined in a low-index region, can easily be functionalised for much more compact optical sensors, often just several micron long. Highly sensitive silicon ring resonator less than 5 micron in radius which can detect 10E-5 refractive index change and 2 micron diameter micro-resonators supporting whispering gallery modes are capable of detecting a single molecule. Such tiny sensors can be mass manufactured at vastly reduced cost, hundreds of them in a mm-square wafer, and then multiplexed and excited by a single 500 nm nanowire optical bus for rapid multi-parameters sensing. IISc has expertise in functionalisation and bio-sensing complements CITY expertise in physical and chemical sensing. The present water quality monitoring systems over the whole India, from large metropolis to small towns and remote villages are of diverse quality. There is a lack of standardised criteria for defining the safe limits of various key pollutants. Effect of some pollutants can be very slow, such as that of heavy metals, and this can be even more difficult to identify at a low level of contaminations until prolonged suffering by people. A solution to this problem is to improve the surveillance systems, both for fast acting bio-pathogens and slow-acting chemical pollutants and one way to achieve this is to develop methods to rapidly, in-situ, accurate and continuous monitoring of water quality and identify any potential breakdown in quality control well before it can be identified from the outbreak of any major diseases with many avoidable sufferings. The objective of this research proposal is to develop frugal, compact multi-channel optical sensors for innovative and cost-effective development of multi species rapidly, reliably and selectively to detect protein, peptides, cytokine, from bacterial and viral pathogens and chemical residues for in-situ and real-time drinking, general use and waste water monitoring, which can be deployable to large metropolis to small rural community.</narrative>
