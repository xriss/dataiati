   <narrative xml:lang="EN">RCUK-CONICYT: Utilising functional genomic variation for improved disease resistance in Chilean salmon aquaculture</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The economic burden of infectious disease hinders sustainable farmed Atlantic salmon production in Chile, and most aquaculture species worldwide. Targeting production of resistant stocks by selective breeding is a long term goal, and will contribute to disease control at a population level. Enabled by advanced genomics tools and technology, genetic improvement of disease resistance can be accelerated using genetic marker data to identify resistant parent fish in breeding programs. Further, the large families and the practical feasibility of large scale disease challenge experiments make salmon excellent models to discover genes and mutations underpinning host response to pathogens. Focusing on two of Chile&apos;s most problematic diseases (sea lice and Salmon Rickettsial Syndrome; SRS) in Atlantic salmon, this project will harness these genomic tools to (i) discover genes and functional variants affecting host response to infectious disease in farmed salmon and (ii) improve the use of genomic tools in breeding programs to increase population-level disease resistance via genomic prediction, and reduce the negative impact of outbreaks. There is now a substantial genomic toolbox now available for Atlantic salmon (e.g. an advanced reference genome assembly and high density genetic marker arrays), this offers an unprecedented resource to locate specific genes and causative genomic variation underpinning host response to pathogens. In the proposed project, we will utilise data and samples previously collected from two large-scale disease challenge experiments (sea lice and SRS challenges. Genome-wide genetic marker data will be generated for all animals, and locating functional variants for resistance to each of the diseases will be achieved using the complementary approaches of (i) high power genome-wide association analysis; (ii) RNA-Seq (gene expression) comparison of the most resistant (R) and susceptible (S) individuals; (iii) Whole genome resequencing of pools of the R and pools of the S individuals combined with functional annotation. In addition to improving knowledge of the fundamental biology of host response to pathogens, these results have potential commercial relevance in at least two important fields. Firstly, the genes identified and their encoded proteins are potential drug or vaccination targets. Secondly, genomic regions and specific variants can be incorporated into selective breeding schemes, via improvement of the accuracy and cost-efficiency of genomic prediction of disease resistance. These results and techniques will lead to improved control of disease in Chilean aquaculture, and also provide a paradigm for tackling infectious disease problems via selective breeding in other farmed aquatic species worldwide.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project has two major overarching aims: (i) To discover genes and functional variants affecting host response to Salmon Rickettsial Syndrome (SRS) and sea lice (Caligus) in farmed Atlantic salmon. (ii) To optimise genomic prediction for accelerated improvement of population-level disease resistance in breeding schemes by prioritising functional genetic variation. These broad aims can be achieved via the following specific and measurable objectives: (a) To investigate the genetic architecture of host resistance to SRS and Caligus using data collected from large-scale disease challenge experiments on pedigreed, commercial Atlantic salmon populations. This will be achieved using mortality as the primary trait for SRS and lice count as the primary trait for Caligus. Parents will be genotyped for a 50 K SNP array. Offspring will be genotyped using a low density custom SNP panel, with high density genotypes imputed for all animals. Heritability of host resistance will be estimated using both pedigree and genomic relationship data. A high power genome-wide association study (GWAS) will be performed for host resistance for each disease, and the genomic regions contributing to the heritability of resistance. (b) To discover candidate functional genomic variation using whole genome resequencing of pools of resistant and susceptible individuals. By high depth resequencing of pools of genomic DNA from the most resistant and the most susceptible individuals for each disease, all polymorphisms contributing to host genetic variation will be discovered. With a focus on SNPs or other polymorphisms that differ in allele frequency between the pools *and* map to the QTL regions identified in objective (a), SNP effect prediction software will be used to identify and prioritise putative functional variants that have direct effects on host resistance to these disease. (c) To characterise the gene expression profile differences between resistant and susceptible fish. By RNA-Sequencing of individual resistant and susceptible fish at key timepoints in the infection process and under basal conditions, the gene expression profiles defining genetic resistance and susceptibility will be identified. Gaining this insight will lead to fundamental knowledge of the host response to infection and they key differences between a successful (resistant) and unsuccessful (susceptible) response at different timepoints in the infection process. Further, differentially expressed genes and pathways will guide the identification of candidate causal genes and mutations. (d) To identify and prioritise candidate disease resistance genes and mutations: The results from the first three objectives (GWAS, whole genome resequencing and RNA sequencing) will be integrated with the high quality annotated reference genome for Atlantic salmon. This will enable positional and functional candidate genes and mutations to be identified as potential causative variants for the identified resistance QTL. (e) To optimise genomic prediction of disease resistance breeding values with functional variation: The large genomic and phenotype datasets collected will enable testing of genomic prediction methods for estimating breeding values for selection candidates. This will be tested using all (50 K markers) and also using a select panel of SNPs identified from objective (d) that will contain high priority potential functional variation. Accuracy of prediction will be tested across both related and unrelated samples using a cross validation design, and the benefit of incorporating the functional variation into prediction models will be assessed in a commercial population.</narrative>
