   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Xanthomonas citri subsp citri citrus tree cankers in Sao Paulo : molecular epidemiology and assessment of lytic bacteriophage as biocontrol agents</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Asiatic Citrus Canker (ACC) is a serious, untreatable infection of citrus trees that threatens sweet orange production in the state of Sao Paulo - a key industry economically.   ACC is caused by the bacterium Xanthomonas citri subsp. citri. Infection with this organism necessitates removal and destruction of infected trees and prevention measures typically rely on the use of spraying with environmentally harmful copper bactericides. In this project we will examine the current genetic diversity and molecular epidemiology of X. citri from infected plants in Sao Paulo using whole genome sequencing. This will allow us to study how the pathogen is spreading in the current endemic situation - following legislative changes that ceased control efforts and now allow the presence of the bacterium in the orchards. This information will give us important new knowledge regarding the species population biology.   In this project we will also isolate and characterize X. citri specific viruses (known as bacteriophage). Bacteriophages are proposed as an alternative to antibiotics in human health and they are currently used in the food industry eg for controlling Listeria contamination in cheese production. They are also used in the control of bacterial infections in tomato and pepper crops in the United States. We will isolate and characterize a large collection of bacteriophage from infected plant material to assess their suitability for use in biocontrol of ACC. This initial pump-priming proposal will be developed in years two and three to include in vitro infection studies in greenhouse using bacteriophages as treatments or protective agents. We will also investigate bacteriophage host-binding structures as possible species-specific ligands for delivery of antimicrobial compounds.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Xanthomonas. citri subsp. citri (X. citri) causes Asiatic Citrus Canker a devastating disease of orange plants that is only treatable / preventable by removal of infected trees and the widespread use of environmentally damaging copper biocides to which bacterial resistance has emerged and is spreading.   There is currently a lack of detail regarding the population structure of X. citri as there are very few published studies and these have used poorly discriminatory methodologies such as ribotyping that are unsuitable for robust evolutionary or epidemiological analyses. This study will give a detailed picture of the epidemiology of ACC in S&#xE3;o Paulo  and assemble a collection of lytic bacteriophages with specific antimicrobial activity against the major X. citri  genotypes for possible future use in control of ACC. In this proposal we will :-  i) apply whole genome sequencing to examine the epidemiology and evolution of X. citri causing ACC infections in S&#xE3;o Paulo and relate this to strains from other countries to examine the phylogeography of this pathogen  ii) isolating a panel of bacteriophages from plants and soils and characterizing their genomic diversity and in vitro activities, such as host-range and infectivity against X. citri isolates  iii) examine the genetic nature of phage / host -ligand binding through studies on phage receptors.  This pump-priming proposal will form a solid base for further development of the project&apos;s aims which are to precisely characterise the epidemiology of X. citri  causing ACC disease in S&#xE3;o Paulo and to develop specific, environmentally sustainable control measures to treat and prevent the disease.</narrative>
