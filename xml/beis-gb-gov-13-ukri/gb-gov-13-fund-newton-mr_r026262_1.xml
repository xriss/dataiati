   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Helicobacter pylori (HP) infection currently afflicts over half the world&apos;s population. Typically children are infected with this bacterium and carry it without symptoms. Only much later in life a percentage (~15%) of people go on to develop symptoms typically gastritis reducing the quality of life. Unfortunately, for some, gastric cancer can also manifest with HP-induced gastritis being the most common underlying cause. There remains no preventative measure for this disease and only antibiotics are used. However, HP is remarkably resistant to antibiotics and in some cases they no longer work making the need for a vaccine of great importance. In Asia and Vietnam in particular HP infection is widespread with over 70% of people carrying the bacterium.   Here we propose to develop an oral vaccine candidate to HP infection. The UK-Vietnam initiative will use a novel method for oral vaccination which has been shown to be effective with a number of similar intestinal diseases. The vaccine candidate will be evaluated in animals to show that it performs and will then be optimised. The consortium includes a renowned Vietnamese vaccine manufacturing group where there exist possibilities for post-project development and technology transfer. This proposal will also bring together a large collection of HP strains isolated from humans into a central depository. These strains will then be examined for their capacity for resist antibiotics with the aim of providing a useful understanding of the prevalence of antibiotic resistant HP in Vietnam.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="1. To develop methods to control Helicobacter pylori (HP) infection in Vietnam and elsewhere. 2. To develop an oral prophylactic vaccine candidate to HP that would be administered to children. 3. To improve our understanding of HP infection, its prevalence, its antibiotic resistance from pathogenic strains isolated in Vietnam. 4. To provide an alternative to antibiotics for treatment of HP infection and so contribute to a reduction of AMR in Vietnam. 5. To provide measures that reduce the risk of developing AMR. 6. To engage Vietnam vaccine groups in the development of a vaccine that could be developed locally or regionally. 7. To collate a collection of HP strains in a central depository and characterise these. 8. To raise the importance of AMR in Vietnam by dissemination of message and project outputs. 9. A second outcome would be to initiate development of a therapeutic vaccine."></capital-spend>
