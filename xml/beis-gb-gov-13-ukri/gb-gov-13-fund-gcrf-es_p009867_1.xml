  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This research addresses one of the most significant challenges facing conflict-affected borderlands across the world: how to build sustainable peace in the aftermath of war. Although there is a growing body of research on the political economy of conflict, we still cannot answer with any confidence the question, how do war economies become peace economies?  Many of today&apos;s development challenges surrounding migration, trade, violent conflict, transnational crime and poverty emanate from the margins of nation-states. Borderland regions are frequently &apos;black spots&apos;, embodying zones of persistent conflict and home to some of the world&apos;s most vulnerable and impoverished populations.  Illegal cross-border economies are deeply embedded in borderland regions of many conflict-affected countries, capitalizing upon weak state authority and easy access to lucrative foreign markets. In countries undergoing protracted war to peace transitions these illegal cross-border economies frequently continue even as conflict recedes, mutating into criminalized peacetime economies in ways that have significant adverse impact upon the stability and sustainability of peace, how states function and processes of economic development.  In response to these challenges, the aim of this project is to use the evidence base generated through the investigator&apos;s PhD research, which analysed the relationship between peace-building and illegal drug economies in Myanmar&apos;s borderlands with China, to improve understanding of, and policy responses towards, how to address instability, tackle drug production and promote inclusive health and development in conflict and drug-affected environments.  The research focuses specifically upon illicit drug economies for two reasons. Firstly, there is growing realisation that today&apos;s current drug policies are not working. The research will therefore position itself to influence changing global debates on illicit drugs and efforts to establish more effective counter-narcotic strategies, which prioritize poverty reduction and move away from the current highly securitized approach to the &apos;war on drugs&apos;.  Secondly, drug economies pose a particularly difficult challenge to peace-building efforts. Drugs may continue to finance violent conflict; yet deals brokered around lucrative illicit activities may also serve to consolidate political settlements between former combatants and deliver greater stability. Drug cultivation has adverse health impacts by encouraging drug use among local communities; yet the drug economy is also a source of social protection by providing income support to farmers, ensuring greater food security and allowing vulnerable rural households to afford education and healthcare.  In ways that have not been done before, this research project will integrate political economy analysis of the role of drugs in processes of political bargaining during war to peace transitions, with a livelihoods approach that focuses on the relationship between drugs and the multiple coping strategies of rural communities. In doing so, the research aims to address important theoretical gaps in our understanding of the relationship between illicit economies, poverty and contested war to peace transitions, and engage proactively with policymakers and practitioners in order to develop more effective peace-building and poverty alleviation responses in Myanmar and other conflict-affected environments.  The research aims to generate impact through: (i) an interactive project website centred on the innovative use of &apos;pattrn&apos;, a new digital mapping tool that will be developed in collaboration with Myanmar research partners to present the changing dynamics of conflict and peace-building in Myanmar&apos;s borderlands across space and time; (ii) generating a strong track record of academic publications, including the conversion of the investigator&apos;s PhD into a manuscript targeting Amsterdam University Press.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This research addresses one of the most significant challenges facing conflict-affected countries: how to build sustainable peace in the aftermath of war. Although there is a growing body of research on the political economy of conflict, we still cannot answer with any confidence the question, how do war economies become peace economies? In response, the primary objective of this research is to use the findings of my PhD thesis, which analysed the relationship between illicit drug economies and war to peace transition in Myanmar (Burma), to improve understanding and policy responses to promote inclusive development and stability in fragile countries undergoing protracted peacebuilding processes. This aligns with the ESRC&apos;s thematic priority for GCRF research to address &apos;building effective institutions in conflict-affected and fragile institutions&apos;.  In order to achieve this objective, I will structure the Fellowship to achieve five aims. First, I will build upon my existing publications to establish a strong academic track record by targeting submissions at high-ranking journals, including Journal of Peace Research, Journal of Conflict Resolution, and Development and Change. I will also use the Fellowship to dedicate time to co-edit (with Professor Goodhand) a Symposium of the Journal of Agrarian Change entitled &apos;Drugs, (dis)order and Agrarian Change&apos;, which the journal have confirmed will be published in 2017. I will also convert my PhD into a manuscript targeting Amsterdam University Press&apos;s Asian Borderland Series following the unanimous belief of both my PhD examiners that my thesis &apos;certainly merits publication&apos;.  Second, the research will develop an innovative conflict-mapping tool to capture the changing dynamics of conflict in Myanmar&apos;s borderland with China. By working in close collaboration with researchers at Goldsmiths University, where the open-source conflict-mapping software has been developed, and with Myanmar research partners, the project will develop the first conflict mapping tool of its kind in Myanmar, with huge potential to support researchers and policymakers engaged in Myanmar&apos;s peace process.  Third, I will undertake an overseas institutional visit to the University of Melbourne in order to extend my existing role in a joint research program between SOAS and Melbourne, entitled &apos;State, Frontiers and Conflict in the Asia-Pacific&apos;. I will maximise the impact of my research by working within a collaborative and comparative research project, which is designed explicitly to engage policymakers in Australia and the UK to improve responses to violent conflict and inequitable development in Asia.  Fourth, I aim to use the Fellowship to further develop my academic skillset by undertaking the advanced Burmese language course offered by SOAS, building on the language skills I developed during my PhD. I will also strengthen my research skills by enrolling on two courses convened by the NatCen social research agency: &apos;Analysis of Qualitative Data&apos;, which will enable me to analyse more effectively data collected during my PhD fieldwork as I write my manuscript; and &apos;Influencing Policy with Research&apos;, which will strengthen my impact plan. I will also enrol on SOAS&apos;s Professional Development in Higher Education Program.  Fifth, I will use the Fellowship to share learning and strengthen institutional links within the Bloomsbury DTC by: (i) Developing an interdisciplinary research proposal with academics at SOAS and LSHTM combining political economy and health perspectives to address the challenges of supporting sustainable and equitable transitions away from drug-production in Myanmar and Afghanistan. I have already discussed this proposal with academics at SOAS and LSHTM and it will target ESRC International research funding streams; (ii) Strengthening links between Development Studies departments at SOAS and Birkbeck through my role teaching the MSc War, Conflict and Development module at Birkbeck in 2017.</narrative>
