   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Enset is a large perennial herbaceous plant similar in form to the related banana. It is distributed across central, eastern and southern Africa, a crop in the banana (Musaceae) family, and currently provides a food source for ~20 million people in Ethiopia alone via its corm and stem base supplying dietary starch. It also supplies fibres, medicines, animal fodder, a key food source for bees, is culturally significant and stabilises soils.   Enset is potentially very important as a climate-smart crop for the future because of its apparent ability to withstand long periods (&gt;5 years) of drought. However, little is currently known about its biology, including the genetic variation of both wild and cultivated forms, its fruiting biology, soil fungal associations or ability to withstand pests and diseases. We seek to promote enset as a source of dietary starch build collaborative UK/African research strengths in four principal ways:  1) Gathering a range of data from across its distribution in Ethiopia including the physical traits of enset alongside information about the local climate and soil in each area sampled and data from farmer interviews. This will then be used to create a data resource via computer models that will generate the understanding to underpin breeding, food security and supply of products and enhanced government policy in this crop.  2) Studying enset in the field so that its flowering, fruiting and seed production is fully understood to assist in developing a breeding programme.  3) Unravelling the genome of the banana family, and especially enset, to understand overall diversity patterns and discovering the genes associated desirable characteristics such as control of flowering, disease resistance and root and corm development.  4) Surveying the occurrence of disease-causing organisms in the field to discover non-susceptible populations and varieties for genetic study and conservation at in-country seed banks and living plant collections with those displaying other useful traits.  These research activities will help improve security of food supply  and help to plan for and breed varieties that can withstand climate change and disease. They will prevent enset being supplanted by a global crop such as maize, reducing the diversity of both agriculture and diets. It will be protected as a source of pharmaceutical products and potentially could be more widely grown in Africa as a source of starch for food, biofuel or industry. It is already a low input crop in terms of fertilisers and pesticides and research can make it lower still. We also plan to unlock the value of wild forms as sources of key traits and the genes that underpin them for breeding into cultivated plants such as drought resistance or formation of suckers so plants can be divided vegetatively. The research we plan to undertake helps the UK and the global community to meet its obligations under the UN Sustainable Development Goals. Most importantly, the project will support improvement of people&apos;s standards of living within five years by providing disease free planting material through tissue culture methods and methods to identify (and therefore help treat) diseases or remove diseased plants.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">There has been minimal research on enset compared with banana or other tuber crops. We seek to develop the resources needed via the research objectives below for a subsequent comprehensive research programme exploiting diversity as a source of resilience via modelling and genomics. This will enable the realisation of the full potential of this culturally embedded, high yielding, sustainable and perennial starch staple crop to maintain a resilient food supply in Ethiopia despite climatic perturbations and pest and pathogen outbreaks.  1. Determination of distribution, morphology (physical traits) and ecology (climate and soil) of wild and cultivated enset in Ethiopia  This research will include comprehensive field diversity surveys to identify taxonomic variation in wild and cultivated enset. It will obtain essential baseline information on variants&apos; traits and environmental tolerances to local environmental conditions. We will integrate farmers&apos; knowledge and season-by-season feedback on enset cultivation, and gather further data on market price, use, associated biodiversity and ecosystem service provision. These data will be used to build a multi-dimensional, multifunctional baseline data resource for enset, based on bioclimatic and environmental envelopes developed through state-of-the-art species distribution models.  2. The flowering and fruiting biology of enset and its propagation This research will investigate flowering phenology and development, pollination mechanisms and seed germination biology.  3. Realising the potential of the genetic diversity of cultivated and wild enset. This will be carried out using germplasm collected under 1 and 2. We will recover the diversity and nature of genes and repetitive DNA sequences in Ensete, identifying chromosomal structural differences and translocations via comparative analysis and whole genome sequencing. Genetic markers and appropriate genotyping-by-sequencing strategies will be developed to understand and test DNA diversity in Ensete, including levels of heterozygosity and population genetic structures. Specific genes we will seek to identify by comparison with Musa genomes relate to parthenocarpy (the development of fruit without fertilisation), transition to flowering, biotic and particularly bacterial stress resistance, including effector (avr) and activator (TAL)-like genes, root and corm development, starch storage and amyloplast development. To generate new diversity we will test the potential for cell-fusion or sexual hybrids between Ensete and other species in Zingiberales. This will lead to improved tissue culture protocols for enset, particularly focusing on how they can be used by smallholders and rural businesses to rapidly provide high quality, disease free planting material, and in the longer term support transformation and gene editing protocols. 4. Determining the resilience of enset to pests and pathogens, specifically bacterial wilt (Xanthomonas campestris pv. musacearum), viruses, fungal and nematode infections.  We seek to detect, map and model the occurrence of pest and pathogen organisms associated with enset. Very little is currently known about the pests and pathogens of this crop, except the occurrence of bacterial wilt. We will determine patterns and intensity of occurrence, pinpointing unimpacted populations and varieties within outbreak areas to serve as sources of resilience. Stress resistance genes will be sought and characterised within these populations. We will conserve disease resistant forms as seeds and in germplasm collections. We will also survey and map ploidy diversity.  The research outcomes from this project will be key in improving understanding of resource security and supply of enset. Specifically the outputs will fill a knowledge gap and will be of direct relevance in planning for, and breeding resilient varieties.</narrative>
