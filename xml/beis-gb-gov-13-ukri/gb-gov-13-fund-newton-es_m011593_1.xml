   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The research and partnership activities are framed by and will build a &apos;research platform&apos; capable of investigating the following propositions:  The promotion of sustainable economic development and welfare in rural regions of Brazil depends on local/regional responsibilities relevant to the &apos;food energy water environment nexus&apos;: 1. integrated management of the &apos;nexus&apos; must be underpinned by sustainable management of water resources, which in turn depends on management of land; 2. many inter-dependencies of environmental processes and human activities occur within catchment boundaries, and create a strong logic for assessment and management of natural resources and rural economy at a catchment (or sub-catchment scale); 3. sustainable management of land, water and energy use depends on the actions of farmers, other land users, businesses and communities as regulated by delegated local/regional authorities;  4. sustainable and integrated management of the &apos;nexus&apos; thus depends on local/regional responsibilities  and requires inclusive deliberation and action at the local/regional level under the frameworks of existing law and multi-level government; 5. catchment management programmes to enhance and sustain multi-functional landscapes must be built from existing agency responsibilities, organisations and partnerships, supported by provisions for inter-locality and inter-sectoral collaboration and coordination;  6. provisions for genuine and effective public participation can create a forum for information sharing and deliberation, essential to integrate national policies with local economic and social goals, whilst using local knowledge, acceptance and &apos;ownership&apos; to enhance assessments, planning and actions; 7. the complexity, temporal and spatial scales, dynamics and trade-offs of &apos;nexus&apos; management at catchment scale necessitate an adaptive and &apos;analytic-deliberative&apos; management cycle.  These propositions similarly apply to the challenges in the UK of sustainable intensification of agriculture whilst conserving and enhancing multi-functional landscapes.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="Overall objective: promotion of sustainable economic development and welfare through integrated, collaborative and adaptive management of the &apos;food energy water environment nexus&apos; at a catchment scale.  Specific objectives: 1) to build the capacity of a sustained collaboration between researchers from Brazil and UK, and a wider partnership of international water professionals and stakeholders; 2) to develop excellent interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary research (including participatory action research), engaging natural and social scientists, governmental practitioners and managers, policymakers, civil society and rural communities; 3) development of a conceptual model and provisional operational guidance for participative governance and integrated, collaborative and adaptive management of natural resources at a catchment scale to support sustainable intensification of smallholder family farming in Brazil, with secondary lessons where transferable for sustainable intensification and catchment-based management of natural resources in the UK; 4) to establish a &apos;research platform&apos; with these elements that merits further research and funding."></capital-spend>
