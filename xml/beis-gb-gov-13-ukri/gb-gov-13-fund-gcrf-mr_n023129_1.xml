   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Shifts in the metabolic and virulence profiles of Streptococcus pneumoniae following the introduction of conjugate-polysaccharide vaccine in Malawi</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">It is estimated that in 2010-2011, there were 120 million episodes of pneumonia in young children worldwide, and 1.3 million pneumonia-related deaths. A microbe called Streptococcus pneumoniae or the pneumococcus, which frequently lives at the back of the nose in healthy children and adults, is a leading cause of childhood pneumonia in many African countries, and is also associated with a high burden of meningitis and severe blood infection. Reducing the burden of pneumococcal disease is therefore a major public health priority. Pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV) are highly effective at reducing this disease and have been introduced into the routine infant immunisation programmes of several sub-Saharan African countries, including Malawi. We now have evidence from our ongoing work in Malawi that there has been a large direct benefit of vaccination occurring early after introduction. The critical question is whether this protection will be long-lasting and result in protection of individuals in the wider community who have not received or have responded poorly to the vaccine (so-called &quot;herd immunity&quot;).   We have recently established a programme of surveillance in Malawi that is looking out for changes in the pneumococcus carried by otherwise healthy children and HIV-infected adults that may indicate that the vaccine will become less effective. In this proposed project we will exploit this ongoing work together with a wealth of data from pneumococci causing pneumonia, meningitis and blood poisoning to find out whether the introduction of PCV into the national childhood immunisation programme in Malawi leads to a change in the profile of carried pneumococci that has the potential to undermine vaccine impact; and then use a mathematical model to test potential strategies to prolong PCV effectiveness in Malawi and in other similar settings. This study will draw on expertise in Malawi, Liverpool and  Oxford enabling us to exploit state-of-the-art genetic fingerprinting of these bacteria and new mathematical modelling approaches. Given that maintaining the effectiveness of pneumococcal vaccines is critical in resource constrained sub-Saharan African countries such as Malawi, this project is very timely in addressing the long term impact of these vaccines, particularly in vulnerable populations with a high burden of HIV, malnutrition and malaria.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The overall aim of this project is to determine whether the introduction of conjugate-polysaccharide vaccine in Malawi has led to shifts in the metabolic and virulence profiles of Streptococcus pneumoniae resulting in the emergence of invasive pneumococcal genotypes that are capable of undermining the long-term success of the vaccine; and further develop a previously described theoretical framework to explore the effective use of pneumococcal vaccine. This aim is made possible through an extensive isolate archive and ongoing carriage, pneumonia and IPD surveillance in Malawi, and will be addressed through the following objectives:  a)  Establish whether there is segregation of metabolic/ virulence profiles in geographically distinct populations. Following WGS of our carriage strain collection from Malawi and using genome sequences already available in the public domain from carriage isolates from Thailand (refugee population) and New England (day-care centres) , we will establish the degree of segregation of pneumococcal metabolic/ virulence profiles in these very different populations, before vaccine introduction.  b) Determine whether there is segregation of metabolic/ virulence profiles in vaccine exposed and non-exposed individuals in Malawi: Using our ongoing strain collection from (i) children who have received PCV; (ii) children who were born before PCV was introduced and (iii) HIV infected adults who have not received PCV (not in routine use in this group), we will determine whether vaccination has a lasting impact on the metabolic/ virulence profiles of carriage isolates in vaccinated children over time. Comparison of vaccinated and unvaccinated populations will allow us to determine the extent to which successful metabolic/ virulence profile phenotypes migrate into unvaccinated populations.  c) Detect metabolic/ virulence profiles in invasive, pneumonia and carriage isolates: Using our longstanding invasive strain collection from children with IPD, together with our carriage strain collection from children with pneumonia, we will look for the appearance of successful metabolic/ virulence profiles (identified above) amongst disease-associated strains.   d) Further develop a theoretical framework to explore the effective use of vaccine: By profiling pneumococcal strains by their capsular serotype, metabolic type and virulence factors, we will be able to validate and extend the mathematical model developed previously to explore the effective use of vaccine. This will exploit data from a globally rare, well-phenotyped collection of pneumococcal carriage, pneumonia and invasive isolates. The main questions that we will answer is whether increasing the number of capsular antigens would be paradoxically permissive for shifts in metabolic and virulence profiles of carried S. pneumoniae, and whether interventions such as vaccine cycling of different serotype combinations and/ or non-capsule directed vaccines, targeting carriage as well as disease may sustain the effectiveness of PCV.</narrative>
