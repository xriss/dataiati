   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Development of novel value chain from cocoa pod husks in Indonesia: Technological, environmental and socio-economic challenges of a value chain</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Indonesia is the world&apos;s 3rd largest cocoa producer, producing around 400,000 tonnes pa of cocoa, primarily in small family farms, and this industry contributes ~14% to GDP. Cocoa farming is the main source of income for more than one million smallholder farmers and their families, therefore the economic and environmental sustainability of cocoa production is key for the long-term social and economic stability of farming communities. The sector though is facing significant technical and business challenges which lead to low farming productivities and consequently to low profitability for farmers. Despite a number of public-private initiatives over the last 8 years, significant changes are still needed to improve the sustainability of cocoa production and have an impact on farmers&apos; welfare and economic stability. These include implementing best-known farming practices (e.g. efficient use of fertilisers and pesticides), developing approaches for the exploitation of by-products, improving post-harvesting techniques for cocoa beans, improving infrastructure and transportation, developing education and training programmes for farmers and promoting the development of farmers&apos; co-operatives.  The commercial exploitation of cocoa pod husks through their conversion to added-value products, such as biomaterials for food and non-food uses, is a promising strategy and a timely opportunity to address effectively and efficiently some of the sustainability issues of cocoa production. This is high up on the R&amp;D agenda of our industrial partner (Mars Chocolate Ltd) and Indonesian government agencies. Currently, most farmers, after extracting the beans, leave the pod husks on cocoa plantations. This can return some nutrients to the soil (in the absence of any other fertiliser being used), but untreated pod husks can lead to increased pest and disease pressure from cocoa pod borer moth and black pod disease, thus decreasing the productivity of the farms. The aim of the project is to develop a novel value chain for cocoa pod husks which upon implementation will have an impact on the economic stability and welfare of cocoa farmers. The specific objectives are to: (i) elicit the willingness of farmers in Indonesia to adopt the proposed practice changes and assess how these might be aligned with farmers&apos; preferences; (ii) develop scalable process designs for the efficient fractionation of cocoa pod husks into non-soluble fibre, soluble fibre and lignin fractions; (iii) identify and evaluate value-adding applications for such fractions with market potential within the food and non-food sectors; (iv) understand the potential impacts on soil properties and soil nutrient cycling of off-farm removal of husks; and (v) propose a supply chain based on scale and mode of operations (e.g. centralised or decentralised) and evaluate the economic viability from a farmer&apos;s and private sector perspective.  Developing a new value chain based on the use of cocoa pod husks husks will minimise potentially negative environmental effects associated with their disposal and diversify the activities of farmers through the collection, primary processing and transportation of the husks. All these changes will considerably improve the sustainability of cocoa production. This can potentially have significant impact on the farmers&apos; economic stability and welfare through increased household income, incorporation of modern and sustainable farming practices, public-private investments in infrastructure, manufacturing operations and transportation, introduction to new technologies, development of new skill sets, creation of jobs and entrepreneurial opportunities. The project&apos;s outcomes will make a strong case for use of the novel value chain and identify the socio-economic and technological challenges (e.g. adoption of new farming practices by farmers, process efficiency and scalability) and opportunities as well as the risks for its successful implementation.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The aim of the project is to develop a novel value chain for cocoa pod husk which will be implemented in Indonesia and have an impact on the economic stability and welfare of cocoa farmers. The specific objectives are:   Objective 1: Elicit the willingness of farmers in Indonesia to adopt the proposed practice changes and assess how these might be aligned with farmers&apos; preferences. The uptake of a new value chain by farmers is influenced by a number of factors including the scale of operations, the behavioural and practice changes required by farmers to switch to the new operations, the institutional arrangements deployed for the introduction of the new value chain, and the incremental economic return accruing to the farmers. These will be critically examined through two farmers&apos; surveys, and the outputs form the basis for designing a value chain with high potential for uptake by the farmers.   Objective 2: Identify an effective and efficient protocol for the fractionation of cocoa pod husks into non-soluble fibre, soluble fibre and lignin fractions, which is commercially attractive and achievable on an industrial scale. On the basis of the above criteria three types of processes will be explored, which have also shown promise from our preliminary research with cocoa pod husks and previous works with other lignocellulosic materials; these include steam explosion, alkali extraction and acid extraction (organosolv processing). The best fractionation protocol will then be carried out on a larger scale (processing of ~5-10 kg of husks) to generate important scalability data and provide additional material for product evaluation studies.  Objective 3: Identify and evaluate value-adding applications for such fractions with market potential within the food and non-food sectors in collaboration with our industrial partners (Mars Chocolate Ltd) and by linking up with Indonesian food and packaging SMEs. Fibre-rich husk fractions will be evaluated as: (i) functional ingredients in bakery, dairy and confectionary chocolate products targeting the design of novel low fat/sugar, high fibre formulations with appropriate textures and food structures; and (ii) as biodegradable biomaterials that can be used as alternatives to chemically synthesised plastic film and styrofoam packaging materials.  Objective 4: Understand the potential impacts on soil properties and soil nutrient cycling of off-farm removal of husks (for proposed use in novel value chain), which would under current practise, be returned to soil. We will examine the direct contribution that husk return to soil makes to overall nutrient budgets and the impacts on the potential short-term plant availability of N and P. This knowledge is critical and will inform the design of the novel value chain with respect to appropriate systems to optimise nutrient cycling and soil quality (e.g. through addition of inorganic fertilisers, composted materials or re-introduction of husk-derived fractions).  Objective 5: Propose a supply chain based on scale and mode of operations (e.g. centralised or decentralised) and evaluate economic viability from a farmer&apos;s and private sector perspective. The knowledge gained from the individual objectives will be integrated and in collaboration with various stakeholders (farmers, Indonesian government, industry) we will assess alternative scenarios (e.g. location of manufacturing plant, scale of operations, changes in farming practices, infrastructure needs, etc) and produce relevant flow designs. The economic viability of the most promising value chain will then be assessed from a farmers&apos; perspective and from the perspective of a commercial operation using cost-benefit analysis taking into account a number of factors including the volatility of cocoa prices, capital investment, process yield and productivity of manufacturing plant, transportation costs, market potential and the volumes of valorisation products.</narrative>
