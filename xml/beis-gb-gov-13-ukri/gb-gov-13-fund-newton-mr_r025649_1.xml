   <narrative xml:lang="EN">SPEEDIER - Surveillance integrating Phylogenetics and Epidemiology for Elimination of Disease: Evaluation of Rabies Control in the Philippines</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Rabies, a horrific but preventable disease, kills over 200 people annually in the Philippines.  The National Rabies Prevention and Control Program in the Philippines has catalysed rabies control efforts with some provinces now aiming to declare freedom from disease. However, incursions and outbreaks continue and human deaths still occur. While improved postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) access has reduced mortality, it has proven expensive. Indeed rising PEP use has put a strain on local and national budgets, even as rabies circulation has declined, raising the question of how these efforts can be sustained. Meanwhile, routine rabies surveillance in the Philippines has major shortcomings and is not sufficiently sensitive for international agencies to recognize rabies free areas or to rapidly respond to incursions which remain a risk while rabies circulates in other provinces. As a result, surveillance measures need strengthening and use of PEP needs rationalizing for the Philippines to fully benefit from rabies control measures that are currently underway. Our overarching aim is to deliver a cost-effective, epidemiologically robust surveillance package that can be rolled out across the Philippines to guide and sustain the elimination of canine rabies. Through implementation research we will develop best practice for an enhanced surveillance approach using Integrated Bite Case Management (IBCM) as a strategy to detect rabid animals, with risk assessment of bite patients triggering epidemiological investigations. IBCM has been identified as a potential strategy that can sufficiently enhance surveillance to enable verification of rabies freedom by international organizations and rapid detection of incursions for effective outbreak responses to maintain rabies freedom. Operationalizing IBCM as a key component of enhanced surveillance will have immediately beneficial applications within the Philippines and is of critical importance for the global campaign to eliminate human rabies deaths by 2030. IBCM has also been demonstrated as an effective way to improve PEP administration, ensuring at risk persons are treated and unnecessary PEP use is reduced. Within our implementation study, we will conduct a pragmatic stepped-wedge cluster randomized controlled trial to evaluate the potential for cost savings and improved patient care through rationalized PEP. We estimate that if implemented effectively, rationalized PEP could save over $9 million every year in the Philippines. Focusing on the low socio-economic class provinces of Romblon, Occidental Mindoro, and Oriental Mindoro, that include geographically isolated and disadvantaged communities, SPEEDIER will provide learning opportunities to local health and veterinary professionals and support communities to attain disease freedom, contributing to the Philippines developmental goals (2014 Kalusugang Pangkalahatan (&apos;Universal Health&apos;) Road Map). Integrated, intersectoral, surveillance and response systems are advocated by international agencies, but rarely operationalized in resource-poor settings.  Using our detailed epidemiological understanding of rabies and experience of deploying new technologies, we will develop an integrated surveillance and response system that enables effective working between sectors at multiple scales of governance. This is important; international agencies like the World Health Organisation and the World Organisation for Animal Health recognize the essential need to develop effective surveillance and sustainable approaches to guide rabies elimination programmes. The tools and best practice produced by SPEEDIER will therefore be invaluable for the global target to achieve zero human rabies deaths by 2030.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">SPEEDIER&apos;s aim is to deliver a cost-effective, epidemiologically robust, enhanced surveillance and response package to guide and sustain the elimination of rabies from the Philippines. The package includes integration of surveillance and response activities by the human and animal health sectors (&apos;One Health&apos;) through a program of Integrated Bite Case Management to improve patient care and trigger early detection of animal rabies cases. As part of the package we will develop a genomic surveillance platform as a decision support tool to inform control activities and assess incursions risks, and undertake epidemiological modeling to inform contingency planning for managing re-emergence and maintaining disease freedom.  Through an implementation study of enhanced surveillance and response (SPEEDIER) in 3 provinces: Romblon, Occidental Mindoro and Oriental Mindoro, that span rabies endemic, rabies endgame and potentially rabies free situations, this project aims to achieve the following objectives: 1. Assess the impact of SPEEDIER on increasing case detection of rabies and thereby enabling rapid and effective outbreak responses to maintain freedom from disease 2. Assess the impact of SPEEDIER on reducing unnecessary use of rabies post-exposure prophylaxis and therefore the potential for generating cost savings, including the timeframe over which benefits are achieved 3. Assess the potential for SPEEDIER to improve patient care, by identifying and treating persons bitten by suspect rabid dogs who would otherwise be overlooked by the health system. 4. Determine whether SPEEDIER can be implemented as intended in different local contexts, identifying facilitators and barriers to successful implementation and sustainable roll out;  5. Develop best practices for delivering enhanced surveillance to support rabies elimination, bridging research to policy and implementation. 6. Develop decision support tools and guidance for risk assessment, outbreak response and maintaining rabies freedom in the Philippines. Epidemiological modeling and phylogenetic inference will be used in developing risk analysis and contingency plans drawing from the detailed genomic and epidemiological data generated through enhanced surveillance, and through close consultation with local and national stakeholders to address questions of immediate local and national relevance. Through the implementation of SPEEDIER we aim to generate evidence that will enable provincial verification of freedom from rabies, and tailored guidance for how to imminently achieve elimination for provinces encountering challenges. The resulting evidence and best practice generated will provide an effective and sustainable model for the scaling up of enhanced surveillance nationally. Moreover, international agencies recognize the important need to develop effective surveillance and sustainable approaches to guide rabies elimination programmes, and therefore the tools and best practice developed will be invaluable for supporting efforts to achieve the global target of zero human rabies deaths by 2030.</narrative>
