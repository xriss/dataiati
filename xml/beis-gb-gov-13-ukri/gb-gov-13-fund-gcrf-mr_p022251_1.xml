   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Around one-quarter of people with HIV in Africa have very advanced disease when they start treatment, and one-in-ten die during the first few months of taking HIV medicines. Deaths occur due to a variety of different infections and from a failing immune system, which is over-active but not efficient at fighting infections (so-called &apos;immune activation&apos;). In the REALITY clinical trial, which enrolled 1805 children and adults in four African countries, we showed that giving these patients a &apos;bundle&apos; of 5 different types of anti-infection medicines during the first 3 months of HIV treatment led to a 27% reduction in deaths. This new approach could save 3 lives for every 100 people treated with these extra anti-infection medicines, and has the advantage of being easy to deliver at community-based health clinics in Africa. Before scaling up this new intervention to reach more people with advanced HIV, decision-makers (such as the World Health Organization and National Ministries of Health) need to understand the pros and cons of such an approach. To help inform this process, we now need to understand exactly how this bundle of anti-infection medicines works.  In the REALITY study, the &apos;bundle&apos; reduced tuberculosis and fungal infections, but did not seem to have an effect on the number of worm or bacterial infections that were reported during the study. It is possible, therefore, that we do not need to include the 2 antibiotics (albendazole and azithromycin) that were meant to prevent worm and bacterial infections. If these two medicines are not needed in the &apos;bundle&apos; this would save costs and reduce the risks of both side effects and developing antibiotic resistance. On the other hand, we may have missed diagnosing bacterial and worm infections in patients who died, because there are few facilities that can test for these infections in Africa and some patients died at home. This study will use blood and stool samples collected from patients who died or survived in the REALITY trial to try and understand how the bundle of anti-infection medicines worked. We will look at using more sensitive methods for detecting these bacteria and worms (by identifying their genetic material in patient samples) to see if azithromycin and albendazole helped to prevent infections in the bloodstream or gut. We will also look to see if these anti-infection medicines helped to reduce the high levels of unhealthy immune activation, which may stop people dying by preventing the immune system from getting exhausted and failing completely.   If we find evidence that albendazole and azithromycin are important in reducing deaths, then they clearly need to be included in the bundle of anti-infection medicines. If we find no evidence that they contributed to reducing deaths, then they could be removed from the &apos;bundle&apos;. Finally, even with this new bundle of care, 11% of patients with advanced HIV died by the end of the first year of HIV treatment, and we clearly need new ways of reducing this high ongoing death rate. It is possible that the 5 anti-infection medicines and the way in which we chose to give them were not enough, and that other approaches to preventing infections, reducing immune activation and improving the health of the gut are needed. The laboratory studies we plan to do will help to understand the reasons people still die, and what the next intervention trial might be to help avoid this.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="Our overarching aim is to determine which underlying pathogenic pathways are impacted and not impacted by a bundle of enhanced infection prophylaxis in adults and children with advanced HIV, to inform whether all components of the bundle are required when implemented at scale in a similar patient population.  We will achieve this by focusing on three key mechanistic pathways that may underlie early mortality in advanced HIV infection and could plausibly be impacted by the enhanced infection package, as follows:  Aim 1: Do subclinical bacterial infections drive mortality in advanced HIV? Aim 2: Does enteropathy drive mortality in advanced HIV? Aim 3: Do inflammation and T-cell activation drive mortality in advanced HIV?  Our objectives are therefore:  1. To determine whether azithromycin and albendazole contribute to the mortality reduction seen in the REALITY trial, by evaluating whether they perturb the key pathogenic pathways associated with early mortality either through a direct antimicrobial and/or anti-inflammatory effect and/or other pathway. 2. To evaluate the residual drivers of mortality in advanced HIV infection in sub-Saharan Africa, to inform future approaches to improve survival even further than that achieved so far in the REALITY trial. 3. To refine the bundle of care that should be implemented at scale in sub-Saharan Africa, based on the mechanistic findings from this study. 4. To strengthen basic science capacity at our partner sites in sub-Saharan Africa through specific activities to develop key individuals through this project. 5. To communicate in a timely manner these findings to basic science researchers, clinicians and policymakers to maximize impact from our research.   In order to achieve these objectives, we have set the following milestones:  1. Recruit and train UK study staff in laboratory methodology to be used. 2. Identify key laboratory scientists at each site to undertake this work, including one individual to undertake an MSc/PhD and one individual to undertake a mentored research project through the PERFECT program in Zimbabwe. 3. Optimize laboratory techniques in the UK and produce SOPs which will include quality assurance and quality control for each assay performed. 4. Secure regulatory and ethical permissions in each country to use the stored samples as proposed. 5. Secure study sponsorship in the UK. 6. Transfer the necessary laboratory techniques for these assays to each lab in Africa; train, mentor and support scientists at each site. 7. Undertake standardization of laboratory methods and data across sites. 8. Undertake ELISA assays and flow cytometry laboratory work in Africa. 9. Provide supportive supervision for two laboratory scientists to ensure completion of MSc/PhD and/or mentored research project in PERFECT. 10. Ship samples to the UK and undertake Taqman Array Card analysis, PCR and reporter cell line work. 11. Analyze data in conjunction with site teams and statisticians at the MRC Clinical Trials Unit. 12. Present study results at two international meetings, including one in Africa. 13. Publish 3 open access papers presenting results of this study. 14. Use results to refine the bundle of care taken to scale for mortality reduction, through dialogue with clinicians and policymakers at local, national and international level. 15. Disseminate our study findings and their implications through multimedia sources, and ensure impact through implementation of our &apos;Pathways to Impact plan&apos;. 16. Use results to inform the design of a new trial to further reduce mortality in advanced HIV infection."></capital-spend>
