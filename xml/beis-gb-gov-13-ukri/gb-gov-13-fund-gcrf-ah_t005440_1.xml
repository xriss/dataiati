   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Disability under Siege - Development Award</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">15% of the world&apos;s population - 1 billion people - experience some form of disability, with the prevalence even higher in lower- and middle-income countries exacerbated by poverty and conflict (LMIC) (World Bank, 2018). Furthermore, there is a significant gendered dimension to disability, where three quarters of disabled people in LMICS are women. Disability negatively affects socio-economic outcomes, including education, employment and participation in society, and the gendered dimension of disability exacerbates these outcomes for women and girls. Therefore, the need to map, review and build on this body of work in contexts of conflict and crisis is essential in order to make meaningful progress toward meeting the SDGs focused upon inclusive quality education provision (specifically UN Sustainable Development Goals 4.2, 4.5, 4.6, 10.2 and 10.3).   While the challenges arising from provision for disability in education in conflict-affected states is a global issue, the work of this project focuses on one specific region: The Middle East - and specifically the countries of Lebanon, Jordan and Palestine. This region has been chosen as it provides a differentiated conflict and crisis context through which to strengthen the theoretical and empirical evidence base on the subject of Education in Conflict and Crisis with a focus on disability.   Project team members and partners in the region have identified and prioritised the importance of understanding, challenging and co-producing new ways of understanding disability as a pre-requisite for addressing the challenges in implementing inclusive, quality education, a global challenge exacerbated in LMIC countries and further compounded in contexts of conflict and crisis.   This Development Award will be used for developing equitable partnerships with local organisations, mapping research and policy, gathering and disseminating information via inclusive workshops, developing educational training materials and constructing a range of legacy-building activities to ensure the outcomes of the Award are taken forwards for future beneficiaries. Each of the planned actions and activities are intended to raise awareness of issues surrounding education provision for those with disabilities and to improve the quality of this education to support those where they need it most.  The Award will allow local partner organisations in the regions to lead on the identification of the issues they feel are most problematic based on their direct experiences. Expertise and knowledge will be drawn from all levels, from international organisations such as UNESCO, to local schools and educational experts, in order to share best practice and build capacity. The Award team will share outcomes directly with local communities in the pursuit of social, educational and economic benefits for all of those involved. Training and educational materials will be developed in conjunction with schools and academic networks will be established to drive forwards the agenda of improving educational outcomes for those with disabilities.  By providing more effective education, the Award team hopes to reinforce a pathway out of poverty by increasing potential for economic activity and eroding social barriers experienced by those with disability as a result of limited access to education.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="The objectives for the proposed work supported by a Development Award would be three-fold:  1.Cross-cutting research development: i) The development of equitable and sustainable partnerships built on trust and shared aims. ii) Reviews and mapping of existing research from multi- and interdisciplinary perspectives, identifying critical gaps in knowledge. iii) Reviews of policy and practice, with a particular sensitivity to the socio-political contexts. iv) Focusing on gender, identifying data sources for baseline data on the intersectionality of disability and gender.  2. Network Plus-specific development issues around consolidating and extending the networks in Jordan and Lebanon: i) Extending the network partners through key &apos;gatekeepers&apos; such as our partner, the Queen Rania Foundation, providing a key means of access to their own extensive local and national partners. ii) Development work on theory of change with LMIC partners. iii) Supporting the preparation for interview and costs to interview, including assessing accessibility, where two of the proposed interviewees will be traveling from Lebanon and Palestine respectively.  3. Sustainable legacy development activities: i) Developing equitable partnerships, South-South collaboration, and proposed sustainable activities and practices, potentially independent of possible Network Plus funding, thus building a strong basis upon which to subsequently apply for further funding of this work."></capital-spend>
