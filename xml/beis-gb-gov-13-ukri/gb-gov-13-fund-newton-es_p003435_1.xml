   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Financialisation of Urban Development and Associated Financial Risks in China</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Chinese financial system has fostered rapid economic growth in recent decades through so-called &apos;land-based financing&apos; (tudi chaizhen) in housing, land and infrastructure development. The &apos;financialisation&apos; of Chinese housing, land and infrastructure - the use of financial instruments to convert the built environment into investment opportunities -  generates momentum and vitality in the Chinese economy and has led to wealth accumulation. Real estate financing instruments such as the real estate investment trust (REITS), mortgage securitisation, reverse mortgages and public-private partnerships (PPP) in infrastructure have been recently invented. On the other hand, traditional real estate financial products such as household mortgages and real estate loans benefit from new internet-based finance. Chinese real estate finance has now entered a phase of &apos;financial explosion&apos;.   However, the concrete channels, complex arrangements and new instruments are not entirely known. This research project aims to investigate how housing, land and infrastructure are actually financed, what are the new financial instruments, to what extent there is a trend of &apos;financialisation&apos;, and what are the risks associated with this transformation. We examine the recent trend of financialisation in terms of the forms and extent of the involvement of both the formal and the unofficial (&apos;shadow banking&apos;) sectors in real estate development. Recent developments in REITS and PPP will be examined to show the inflow of financial capital in housing, land, and infrastructure projects. We explore how the Chinese housing boom has been financed in the absence of a more developed financial system, and to what extent the financial sector has contributed to the overall appreciation of housing and land assets. We will also try to understand the potential impacts of financialisation on households, enterprises and local government finances (i.e. the issue of &apos;local debt&apos;) and what are the main factors affecting financial stability.   The project investigates three levels of financing mechanisms: projects and enterprises, local governments, and individual households. We choose six case cities: in the coastal region, Shanghai and Shenzhen; the central region: Zhengzhou and Changsha; the western region: Chongqing and Chengdu. At the project level, we will conduct in-depth interviews with developers, real estate agents and local government officials so as to understand the complex financial arrangements of these projects. At the local government (city) level, we will examine the institutional environment and policies regarding built environment finance, including the involvement of housing provident funds. At the household level, the project will conduct a survey of 3,000 homeowners in these cities to understand household access to the financial sector.   This research project will assess the recent trend of financialisation in Chinese housing, land and infrastructure sectors and provide a nuanced understanding of the changing financial mode, its dynamics and the new institutional environment. The project will examine emerging financial products and new channels in these sectors and their operational mechanisms. The project will focus on household financial behaviour to understand the new trend of financialisation of real estate and its impact on housing consumption, investment behaviour, and job preference. The project will further assess macroeconomic implications such as the impact on the Chinese financial system, financial product innovation, fiscal policies and company investment. Finally, these findings will lead to an assessment of the potential risks associated with financialisation and recommendations for risk management.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project aims to examine new financial modes of urban development (housing, land and infrastructure) in China and assess the extent of &apos;financialisation&apos; along with Chinese urbanization. The research will provide a deeper understanding of the financialisation process, financing Chinese economic growth and urban development and its current transformation at multiple scales: household behaviour in financing housing consumption, housing and land development projects, infrastructure financing and their macroeconomic implications. The project will reveal the complex operational dynamics and financial instruments that have allowed the recent fast urban expansion and real estate boom and gauge their associated financial risks. This will help to reduce the financial risks and threats to the sustainability of Chinese economic growth associated with the recent trend of excessive &apos;financialisation&apos; of urban development in China.  1) To examine the historical evolution of financialisation modes of urban development in the last twenty years so as to provide a nuanced understanding of the channels and forms of financial operation in three major areas of urban development: housing, land and infrastructure construction;  2) To examine recent trends and new forms of financing urban development (housing, land and infrastructure) such as mortgage securitisation, real estate investment trusts (REITS), reverse mortgages, and public private partnerships (PPP) in infrastructure development;  3) To examine the mechanism and behavioural implications of the financialisation mode of urban development. In particular, we examine how housing finance produces distorted housing purchase and distorted consumption behaviour;  4) To consider the macro implications associated with the recent financialisation trends of urban development, which have led not only to urban expansion but also to distortions of the urban economy, and how these distortions produce spill-over effects on the financial system and macro economy. In particular, we examine how the housing and infrastructure finance system produced the distortions that led to housing bubbles, a housing affordability crisis and distorted consumption behaviour. For example, we examine how the financialisation of housing and land leads to compressed domestic consumption, depression of entrepreneurialism, distorted investment behaviours among enterprises, over-reliance of local government on land financing, enhanced risks for the banking system and the financial system, and associated financial risks;  5) To develop policy recommendations for risk management, with regard to potential negative impacts on the economy due to the excessive financialisation of urban development, especially in the fields of housing and land.</narrative>
