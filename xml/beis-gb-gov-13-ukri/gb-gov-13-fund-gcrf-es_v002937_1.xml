   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Mainstreaming climate resilience in Philippine flood risk management and land use planning</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Approximately 40% (43 million) of the Philippine population live on land with a 1% chance of flooding each year. Climate change is expected to exacerbate flooding across the tropics and sub-tropics. Increased occurrence of extreme rainfall events that result in flooding require explicit consideration in disaster adaptation strategies, yet the impacts of climate change on flood risk have been investigated in few Philippine river catchments. Our vision is to develop fast-responding researcher, policy maker and practitioner network to improve climate resilient system-scale river and flood risk management and land-use planning in the Philippines that is environmentally, economically, socially and culturally informed. This project builds on our existing UK-Philippines river science network and expands the network to include economics, social science, human geography and land use planning to address this multi-disciplinary challenge. Our objectives are to: (1) evaluate Philippine policy and practise context in general, and one catchment in particular, at the intersection of climate change impact assessment and resilience, land use planning, and river and flood risk management; (2) numerically model and graphically illustrate the impact of climate change on flood and erosion risk for different river management options; (3) investigate citizens&apos; relations with rivers and explore how different management options may intersect with inequalities and affect social groupings; and (4) collaboratively evaluate this scoping project and develop a follow-on Network Plus proposal. We will investigate the first three objectives by undertaking research in the Bislak catchment, North-West Luzon. This proposal represents the first stage in mainstreaming climate resilience in Philippine river/flood risk management and land use planning. We envisage that outputs from the project will strengthen the capacity of Local Government Units (LGUs) to strengthen the fluvial flood/erosion risk climate resilience of their poor communities through the development of their: (i) Local Climate Change Action Plan (LCCAP); (ii) Climate and Disaster Risk Assessment Report; and, (iii) Comprehensive Land Use Plan (CLUP). We will also build capacity to demonstrate how LGUs can collate evidence to access the currently undersubscribed PHP1 billion (&#xA3;15M) Philippine Climate Change Commission (CCC) People&apos;s Survival Fund (PSF) to improve climate resilience to river hazards.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project aims to assess and facilitate the mainstreaming climate resilience in Philippine river/flood risk management and land use planning. The project will develop a fast-responding network of interdisciplinary policy makers, practitioners &amp; researchers.   Specific objectives are to:  Objective 1. Evaluate Philippine policy and practise context in general, and one catchment in particular, at the intersection of climate change impact assessment and resilience, land use planning, and river and flood risk management;  Objective 2. Numerically model and graphically illustrate the impact of climate change on flood and erosion risk for different river management options;  Objective 3. Investigate citizens&apos; relations with rivers and explore how different management options may intersect with inequalities and affect social groupings;  Objective 4. Collaboratively evaluate this scoping project and develop a network plus proposal.  During the scoping phase, Objectives 1-3 will be examined in the Bislak catchment (Figure 1). This exemplar has been chosen due to our existing catchment knowledge and project partner links. We will investigate the following key research questions (RQ):   RQ1 How can evidence-based policies be formulated, and their implementation be substantially increased, in the conditions expected in the Philippines under climate change?;   RQ2 What are the river flood/erosion responses to climate change, and how may different river management approaches influence, amplify or dampen these responses?;   RQ3 How are people&apos;s relations with the river influenced by factors such as livelihood practices, class, and gender, and how do these alter conceptualisations of resilience and the potential impacts of river management approaches?;   RQ4 What are the economic benefits and costs of a move to nature-based solutions to flood management, and how are these distributed across stakeholders and over time?   RQ5 What activities and further research are required to co-design implementable and sustainable policy and practice solutions (e.g. to strengthen capacity of local government units to make applications to the Philippines&apos; PHP1bn (&#xA3;15M) Climate Change Commission People&apos;s Support Fund (CCC PSF))?</narrative>
