   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Leishmaniasis is a neglected tropical disease with strong and complex links with poverty. The burden of leishmaniasis falls disproportionately on the poorest segments of the global population, including within Brazil, where there are 30,000 cases/year. Leishmaniasis diagnosis and treatment are expensive and many of the drugs used are not fit for purpose; drug resistance is an increasing problem. Public investment in treatment and control would decrease the leishmaniasis disease burden and help to alleviate poverty, yet more research is required to facilitate implementation.  This project aims to increase capacity in Brazil for early phase drug discovery by enhancing research links between the UK and Brazil in the molecular, cell and immunobiology of Leishmania parasites.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="To enhance research links between the UK and Brazil in the molecular, cell and immunobiology of Leishmania parasites, which cause the Neglected Disease leishmaniaisis, and their interaction with the mammalian host.  To provide advanced skills training in state of-the-art in vivo imaging, RNA-seq and novel concepts in computer modelling of infection to drug development and the understanding of pathogenesis of leishmaniasis.  This will address specific skills shortages in Brazil and highlight the reduction and refinement of animals in scientific research.  To provide residential advanced training in Rio de Janeiro to integrate UK and Brazilian experts in in vivo imaging, advanced meta-approaches of genomics/transcriptome and computational modelling.  This will allow established investigators and early career scientists to interact and will offer the opportunity for people with common research interests to develop new projects.  To develop hypotheses and generate pilot data in Brazil that will underpin future research collaboration and funding applications."></capital-spend>
