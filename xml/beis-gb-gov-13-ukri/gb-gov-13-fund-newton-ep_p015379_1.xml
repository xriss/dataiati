   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Rapid urbanisation in Malaysia and globally is driving socio-economic change and infrastructure development that is resulting in high levels of current and projected demand for digital connectivity and data handling. Data centers are key, but globally they are large consumers of energy with substantial emissions of greenhouse gases and other pollutants that degrade urban air quality. Cooling represents more than half of the energy consumption. To be located in the highly urbanised city of Petaling Jaya, the Next Generation Green Data Centre Living Lab proposed for this industrially driven collaboration will innovatively integrate novel Malaysian and UK green energy and cooling technologies to reduce energy consumption by 50%, improving energy security and reducing emissions. The project will create a replicable and commercially viable approach to sustainable computing for reconciling urbanisation with environmental risk and climate change globally. In parallel the collaboration will lead to significant social impact through improved urban air quality, enabling sustainable connectivity, and the creation of a green technology commercialisation hub in Malaysia.</narrative>
