   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In most African settings, there is huge enthusiasm for the transformative potential of digital health solutions, especially given the availability of mobile technology. New digital health initiatives are frequently piecemeal, single-issue-focused, are responsive to select vertical reporting needs of donors, and do not interoperate or integrate well with routine health care information systems.  Patients in long-term chronic care continue to be asked to visit over-burdened health facilities frequently, where they often experience long waiting times and receive very limited services. This frequent visit schedule occurs as this is often the only mechanism health services have of verifying that patients are in care, and of providing medicines and laboratory or clinical (e.g. blood pressure) monitoring. Clinicians are faced with incomplete information about their patients as details of care provided elsewhere are not readily available, and paper-based records sometimes spanning decades are poorly maintained and difficult to assimilate in short consultations. Health systems are poorly equipped to respond to patients who fall out of care, are being sub-optimally managed, or have multiple morbidities with poorly co-ordinated care, and as a result often fail patients.  Pragmatically applying the principles of inter-operability where all solutions share a common unique client identifier, and interact with a health information exchange, requires long term investments and systems maturation.  This approach however has immense transformative potential, especially if coupled with empowering patients through access to their own health data, and direct enrolment in digitally-supported programs which link to their government health profiles and services. Achieving this requires partnerships with local long-term stakeholders who are in the business of supporting public sector health care and digital health solutions, and who have the institutional memory to transcend changes in health service management and donor funding cycles.   Sustained investments over time and long-term partnerships between civil society and government have helped to achieve some measure of digitization and interoperability for HIV and tuberculosis services, including in the proposed implementation sites for the currently proposal, initially in South Africa. The proposed network of academic, technical and industry partners who work directly with health service providers, seeks to extend and generalize these approaches to all chronic conditions, and to harness the potential of direct-to-patient communication opportunities which arise from patient-facing digital solutions.  This potential is maximized when these patient-facing solutions integrate with a functional health information exchange. There are limited African jurisdictions where this is currently possible, but many more will come on-line soon as unique health identifiers and health exchanges become more widely adopted.  The required technologies are well-understood - the challenge is pragmatically optimizing them in support of specific health objectives in unique health and technology contexts.   Working with and adapting existing scaled technology platforms in the selected implementation contexts, the network and collaboration will: focus on developing these new patient-facing interfaces to directly support self-management and interaction with the health services; utilise direct-to-patient digital interfaces and the inter-operability and connectedness of all health service delivery components to assist government to provide patients with out-of-facility service options such as for medicine collection; ensure the ability to intervene efficiently when patients fall out of care, based on system-wide data availability; and, utilize system-wide data intelligently to enhance care at all levels based on cutting edge data-science techniques and associated data competence in government health services.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="The &quot;African Health Information Exchange network: transforming chronic disease care&quot; application seeks to partner academic, civil society and industry digital health stakeholders who have long-standing commitments to developing context-appropriate integrated public sector digital health solutions, with health service providers responsible for whole health jurisdictions.  These jurisdictions have solid foundational digital health assets and a shared vision to leverage end-to-end interoperability in support of improved chronic disease care. Working in these selected implementation sites to achieve scaled government-led implementation successes and learnings, the network, if funded through to stage 2, will assist the sites to:  1) Leverage patient autonomy and agency through client-facing solutions and a rights-based approach to accessing one&apos;s own health data, to support adherence, self-management and differentiated care for chronic health conditions  2) Support the introduction or refinement by government of out-of-facility digitally-supported service delivery channels (e.g. non-clinical logistics hubs for medicine distribution and diagnostics, medicine lockers, self-testing and community health worker programs) ensuring that these interoperate seamlessly with the fixed health services through a health information exchange or equivalent  3) Use digital safety-nets and direct interactions with patients to safely enable out-of-facility care delivery approaches and ensure appropriate follow-up and (re)engagement  4) Apply modern data science approaches to population-wide consolidated data to intelligently support clinical care, service management and digital patient interactions    During stage 1, the network will use the seed funding for extensive participatory requirements gathering and network expansion with the following objectives:  1) To actively expand the network to other civil society and academic partners in the region who are working in jurisdictions amenable to partnerships with government health service providers, and which have sufficient digital health foundational investments to potentially achieve the overall project objectives.  2) Through direct engagement with healthcare clients, patient advocacy groups, lay health care workers, clinicians and health service managers, to develop a clear understanding of health system care delivery modalities which need to be accommodated in implementation sites, with identified digital tools, and integration, inter-operability, and user-interface requirements, culminating in a Requirements Consolidation workshop where all inputs will be synthesised and aligned  3) To develop high-level specifications for technological design and innovation which will address requirements prioritized during the Requirements Consolidation workshop, including proposed extensions to the African Health Information Exchange enterprise architecture, by engaging digital health and data science specialists in a two-day Technology Deep Dive workshop  4) To develop an initial stage 2 proposal based on the above activities which will be iteratively refined for submission against the full proposal call  5) Following the submission of the stage 2 proposal, to release working papers detailing the findings from the functional and technical requirements gathering initiatives"></capital-spend>
