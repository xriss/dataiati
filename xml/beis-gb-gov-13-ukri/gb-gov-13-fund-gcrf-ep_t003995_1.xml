   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In many nations in sub-Saharan Africa, including Ghana, Kenya, Mozambique, Nigeria, Senegal, and South Africa,  as well as beyond the region, for example, Brazil and Thailand, coastal communities are facing increased risks from extreme events.  Sea level rise, storm surges and flooding not only cause loss of life and property, but also have damaging, and long lasting impacts on sectors such water and sanitation, housing, health and energy infrastructure. It is often the case that national policies and programmes which aim to support community level resilience planning are often top-down despite the importance of local communities&apos; participation in decision making processes. Participatory processes ensure that actions taken are inclusive and mindful of different capabilities and resources in these communities due to the diverse socio-economic and cultural interests, socially differentiated and marginal groups.  Given the importance of these spatial and social contexts in risk, resilience and provision of services, the aim of the Partnerships for Resilience through Innovation and integrated Management of Emergencies and Disasters (PRIMED) network is to harness the power of local innovation to enhance the resilience and sustainability of coastal communities in the Global South. Our overall objectives are: i. To create a long-lasting network of excellence for co-creation of climate resilience, disaster risk reduction and development research in the Global South. ii. To co-develop examples of best practice and resources which improve leadership skills of community members, improve their capacity to take action and build their overall resilience to coastal hazards and ability to plan sustainable infrastructure accordingly. iii. To facilitate information and knowledge sharing on successful applications and models of resilience interventions achieved through improved community partnerships, leadership training and action oriented education.  iv. To provide opportunities for network members to collaborate on further proposals for GCRF funded research which co-develops solutions for climate resilient, low carbon and poverty compatible development.  These objectives will be met by the following sub-objectives: i. Map expertise in academic, government, business, NGO and third sector organisations working in local communities to support climate actions, including resilience interventions and sustainable energy service provision. ii. Invite a diverse community of participants to join the PRIMED network. iii. Understand the needs, ideas, and ambitions of network members for the activities, engagement approach and outputs of the PRIMED network. iv. Co-develop approaches which support increased participation of diverse social groups, including the marginalised in resilience, disaster mitigation and sustainable energy planning. v. Monitor membership of the network to ensure that diversity and inclusion of unheard voices  vi. Enlist the experience and knowledge of network members to identify examples of best practice for resilience and sustainable energy service provision which have been achieved through community based initiatives. vii. Use a social-innovations perspective to co-develop a framework for understanding the key-contributing factors to the success of these initiatives. viii. Use innovative methods for ensuring greater dissemination and uptake of knowledge and information on resilience interventions ix. Co-develop resources, which use appropriate and innovative engagement approaches, to enhance the capability of community leaders and other decision makers to take actions which build the overall resilience of their communities to coastal hazards and ability to plan sustainable infrastructure accordingly.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The network for Partnerships for Resilience through Innovation and Integrated Management of Emergencies and Disasters (PRIMED) primarily aims to strengthen community preparedness and resilience as a strategic approach for addressing three key global challenges, i.e., sustainable development and poverty reduction, disaster risk reduction (DRR) and climate change.  Participation of communities in disaster management programmes is recognized as key for minimizing the severity of natural and climate related hazards on the most vulnerable and recovery from disaster, thus ensuring sustainable development for all. Efforts are shifting away from reactive emergency response frameworks to more proactive management approaches that incorporate varying socioeconomic and cultural interests, socially differentiated groups (such as those based on gender, age, physical challenges), capabilities and resources for effectively reducing vulnerability and sustainably increasing resilience at the local level.    Many of these communities struggle with deploying and managing sustainable infrastructure, such as services for energy access via renewable or fossil fueled electrification programs, roads and transport services. Small and medium sized municipalities in these developing nations, especially, are often constrained in terms of financial and professional capacity. At the same time, public servants need to manage complex planning and policy processes to ensure that the communities they are serving will have appropriate systems in place to respond to climate shocks. This includes sufficient information to ensure that new human settlements, and associated energy and transport services settlements, will be built so as to be climate compatible, with reduced vulnerability to future events, whilst at the same time enabling sustainable development.   The PRIMED network will, therefore, facilitate social innovation and knowledge co-creation, taking as a starting point, applications and models of resilience interventions and building sustainable infrastructure where success has been achieved through improved community partnerships, leadership training, participative research and action oriented education. Partnerships created within the PRIMED network will bring together international and national academics, researchers, policy and decision makers, practitioners, and community members that represent the various social groups, to share their varied perspectives, reflections and experiences of what works. These interactions will enable the team to:  1. Understand and define constraints and opportunities  2. Define mechanisms required for increasing the participation of diverse coastal social groups, including the marginalized, in disaster mitigation and preparedness 3. Identify effective educational tools that improve leadership skills of community members 4. Improve community capacity to take action and build their overall resilience to coastal hazards 5. Improve the management of complexities associated with climate resilient and low carbon development policy and planning.</narrative>
