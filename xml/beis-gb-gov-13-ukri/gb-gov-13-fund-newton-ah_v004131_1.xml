   <narrative xml:lang="EN">1.  Establish a network to support collaboration across musical traditions, utilising groundbreaking research on performance practices of traditional musics, to inform creation across traditions, here specifically between traditional Anatolian musics of Turkey and (Western) classical and contemporary music. The network recognises inter- and intra-cultural challenges as we begin the second twenty years of the 21st century as pivotal issues in today&apos;s world, positing music as a key tool for creating societal understanding, development, and change.    2.   Consolidate individual and collective research from research-intensive partners in the network, offering practitioners tools for meeting the challenges of transtraditional work. This includes, especially: a. discrepancies in tuning systems, and b. fundamental differences in approach between oral and written performance practices, and approaches to notation. This aims to create a forum to bring innovative methodologies and tools now being developed transtraditionally into a wider sphere that is both influential and more accessible for both young musicians, and for partners working across disciplines who recognise that today&apos;s diverse society and its functioning can be positively effected through such emerging practices  3.  Introduce a series of six, public facing, practical workshops at IKSV Alt Kat bringing this practice-based research on transtraditional music-making to young musicians, with a series of full day sessions with musical activities, coaching and mentoring in Istanbul led by leading musicians with extensive experience in transtraditional music-making, applying groundbreaking methodologies, developed over the past five years, directly to train and inspire young musicians to understand and meet such challenges at an earlier stage than their predecessors in the IKSV Alt Kat workshops.   4.  Probe specifically in the workshops how Anatolian Bozlak and Y&#xF6;r&#xFC;k women&apos;s Bogaz Havalari and Gurbet Havalari singing traditions can be drawn on in creating new work.  Such source material provides a superb starting point for illuminating key challenges of transtraditional music-making; helping to inspire the expansion of participants&apos; musical horizons and skills.  This will help establish a new &apos;tradition&apos; for this &apos;best practice&apos; in its own right in Istanbul, moreover inspiring young players who are already learning Anatolian music to consider the challenges of creating music at the level of the taste and integrity level of Muharrem Ertas, Haci Tasan and Y&#xF6;r&#xFC;k women creators, inspiring young musicians from Western music with the remarkable qualities of their colleagues&apos; music.  5.  Produce performance by Simsek Trio of kemane, baglama, and sipsi/kaval, who will also lead the IKSV Alt Kat workshops. The &apos;Opening set&apos; on the same concert will be performances by the young musicians in IKSV Alt Kat programme showcasing their own work.    6.  Recording of Simsek Trio programme-including the three new works for CD label studio recorded at MIAM and published (Kalan, or international label, tbd) will also be made.   7.  Composition of three new transtraditional works for Simsek Trio programme, third for a young persons (ages14-18) choir engaging disadvantaged youth in the Istanbul area (&apos;Gurbet Korosu&apos;) reaching across traditional societal divides to a wide range of participants. The traditional theme of Gurbet (migration) is thus brought into a modern urban context.   8. Convene international conference on Y&#xF6;r&#xFC;k and pastoral musics (including Bogaz and Gurbet Havalari) at IT&#xDC;   9.  Produce non-academic, illustrated book, 25-40 pp. in Turkish (author observes workshops) designed by authors and illustrators  recommend by Alt Kat, telling the story of two children from diverse cultural, economic, and musical backgrounds. Distributed Pan, Arter, Alt Kat  10. Promote interdisciplinary models using all above to policy makers, festival directors, and other cultural operators</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Our AHRC-Istanbul Development Agency Networking project Transtraditional Istanbul follows two basic, key principles: first that society and its functioning can be positively affected through music, and second that research demonstrated in practice creates real change. TTI addresses key development challenges for Turkey by establishing a network with four key partners (TMDK, MIAM, UoB and IKSV) dedicated to the preservation and development of traditional Turkish musical cultures in danger of disappearing--namely Bozlak and women&apos;s throat songs (Bogaz Havalari) from the Teke region, and by bringing this music into a contemporary, urban musical discourse. TTI&apos;s Altkat workshops and Gurbet Korosu, provide core activities that support development and empowerment of culturally underrepresented and disadvantaged groups within Istanbul and Turkey, youth, women and girls, powerfully influencing the young musicians of tomorrow. TTI incorporates methodologies modeled over the course of the PI&apos;s five-year, ERC-supported Beyond East and West (BEW) project to address issues often arising in common transtraditional musical situations, bringing such methodologies into situations where they will achieve maximal impact: &apos;on the ground,&apos; in practice. It presents proof of solutions we have developed in response to cross-cultural challenges, with public-facing learning and performance activities to increase standards and common understanding of each other&apos;s musics--with workshops led by professional musicians who have already had key role in BEW themselves. This aims to elicit the development of intercultural skills to young musicians at a far earlier age, better preparing them for the diverse 21st century musical landscape, especially represented in places such as Istanbul. Our longer-term aim is to positively change pedagogy and performance of music in Turkey, raising awareness of the importance of Bozlak and Bogaz Havalari traditions, embedding TTI&apos;s principles and processes first within workshops, and eventually the curricula of schools and conservatories to ensure lasting impact. Such transcultural methodologies and models meanwhile will be found applicable to a wide variety of disciplines, providing models for a society today frequently faced with the selfsame communicative challenges.</narrative>
