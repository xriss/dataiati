   <narrative xml:lang="EN">AFIRE - Assessing ENSO-induced Fire Impacts in tropical Rainforest Ecosystems</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The AFIRE project seeks to advance the understanding of the impacts of ENSO wildfires on the Amazon forest structure, biodiversity and ecosystem processes by addressing three key knowledge gaps: (i) the rareness of detailed ecological information before extreme wildfires and drought years caused by ENSO-events; (ii) a complete absence of research on fire impacts across existing gradients of pre-fire forest disturbances; and (iii) the lack of accurate field data evaluating fire intensity and severity to link with remote sensing information, which limits the extent to which we can to scale up fire consequences across human-modified Amazon forests.  This AFIRE proposal intends to use a rigorous before-after control-impact (BACI) experimental design to make novel ecological insights into the impacts of very intense ENSO-induced wildfires by addressing the following specific objectives:  (a) Quantify post-fire and post-drought plant mortality, survival and recruitment across human-modified forest gradients for the first 18 months after drought and fires took place (when most mortality occurs);  (b) Identify the plant functional traits that can predict the post-fire and post-drought plant mortality, survival and recruitment across human-modified forest gradients;   (c) Use the relationships between traits and mortality to develop scenarios that outline how the Amazon could look in the future.  (d) Assess the impacts of severe wildfires on tropical fauna (i.e. bird and dung beetle communities) and ecosystem processes (i.e. faunal-mediated seed dispersal) across human-modified forest gradients;  (e) Explore the relationship between remote sensing information and ground-based measures of fire intensity, severity and the forest recover across human-modified forest gradients   (f) Engender a greater awareness of wildfire impacts among local, regional and national stakeholders.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Tropical forests store more than a half of the world&apos;s forest carbon and produce over one third of the productivity of all terrestrial systems. They are also biodiversity hotspots, and host a large proportion of the world&apos;s terrestrial flora and fauna. However, growing evidence shows that the ability of tropical forests to perform important ecosystem services (i.e. carbon sequestration and biodiversity conservation) has been dramatically reduced by multiple pressures associated with human-induced forest disturbances (e.g. agriculture, logging, fire and fragmentation) and extreme climate events. Of these disturbances, fire represents of the greatest threats. Rainforests have not co-evolved with fire, and species have not adapted to withstand fire or the changes it imposes on the forests.  Yet today, ignition sources are common in most human-modified regions, as many local farmers living within tropical forests traditionally use fire as a management technique to prepare their land for planting. This is compounded by selective logging and fragmentation, which increase the flammability of the remaining forests. Critically, fires are much more likely to escape their target area and enter the surrounding forests during severe drought events.  This is exactly what happened during the current 2015-16 El Ni&#xF1;o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) - considered one of the three strongest events ever recorded. The prolonged dry season allowed thousands of fires to get out of control in Amazonian and SE Asian tropical rainforests. Specifically in the Brazilian Amazon, the end of 2015 was marked by over 87,000 fire events, a 48% increase in relation to 2014 (a non-ENSO year). As a result, the widespread wildfires affected half of our 20 permanent plots near the Santar&#xE9;m region in the state of Par&#xE1;, while fortunately preserving the other ten plots unburned. The Sustainable Amazon Network (SAN) has established these plots along a gradient of forest modification in 2010, and since 2014 a joint project between UK and Brazilian scientists (ECOFOR) has been carrying out research in this region. Consequently, the work we are proposing here benefits from unique and detailed pre-fire information on carbon dynamics and plant functional traits (from ECOFOR) as well as the distribution of three distinct taxa (birds, dung beetles and plants) and secondary seed dispersal processes (from SAN). Uniquely our network of permanent plots is established along an existing gradient of forest modification before the 2015 fires, allowing us to undertake the first rigorous evaluation of fire effects across different forest disturbance classes.   This ability to examine fire impacts using detailed pre-fire data allows us to develop three major avenues of research across a human-modified gradient of forest disturbances: (1) the impacts of very severe wildfires on plant communities and carbon dynamics, assessing therefore which plant functional traits may predict species mortality, survival and recruitment; (2) an investigation into the fire impacts on forest fauna (i.e. birds and dung beetles) and associated seed dispersal processes; and (3) the development of a detailed understanding of scale and impacts of the current extreme ENSO-event, exploring the relationship between remote sensing information and ground-based measures. The better linkages between remote-sensing products and actual measures of fire severity will allow us to scale up the carbon emission and biodiversity loss estimates across the whole region.   The results fo AFIRE are critically important, as tropical forests around the world may be threatened by drier, hotter and longer dry seasons with climate change. Our findings will help inform mitigation strategies to manage the impacts of future ENSO-mediated droughts and severe wildfires on tropical forests. We also expect AFIRE plots to form the basis of much longer-term research on the impacts of tropical wildfire</narrative>
