   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Context of the research, This 24 month project will provide novel IP and commercial readiness to supply plastic films that will be able to help deliver a key Indian Government objective of reducing the 40% post harvest food wastage to enable more efficient use of the food for nutrition of the growing population. This is especially important for India as it is one of the world largest growers of fruit and vegetables and yet has 25% of the worlds hungry poor. The Indian plastics industry is growing rapidly (5-6%) and industry leader Reliance has stated that the current volume of 5.3M tonnes will double by 2020. Some of the long-term drivers include rural income that&apos;s expected to triple by 2020, to a total of $1.8 trillion, and annual car production projected to grow from 1.7 million vehicles last year to 9.3 million by 2020. (Kamal Nanavaty). In addition, the Indian government plans to spend $1 trillion dollars on infrastructure by 2020, the market for electronics goods will grow by 700 per cent and country&apos;s manufacturing sector will likely jump from the world&apos;s 12th largest now to number seven by 2025. These factors along with a middle class estimated to be 50 million, will create a strong market for food that has been protected by packaging as well as vigorous plastics industry that is looking for technologies that can meet market demands in this nationally crucial area. The innovative films will have selective humidity and gas permeability control and improved shelf-life performance with enhanced environmental characteristics in being recyclable and/or compostable. These films will be made more cost competitive by blending local starch recovered from waste streams to create materials that are more breathable to moisture vapour while providing a barrier to oxygen and external contamination. Current films that perform this function are relatively expensive and cost 3 to 5 times the cost of conventional plastics such as LDPE. General aims and objectives, These films, based on hybrid blends, will be either recyclable or compostable based on the formulations selected to ensure that the growing use of efficient packaging improves the current environmental scenario of plastics at the end of life which is currently difficult in both market areas. The recovery of starch from waste sources will be a positive outcome for starch producers as residues in waste water are a significant pollution problem across India ensuring that this source of starch would be readily available for compounding applications as well as using starch from non-food sources. This project is being addressed by a strong UK/Indian consortium that has expertise across all the areas of challenge in this project; in biodegradable plastics films and recycling (Nextek and Solutions 4Plastics) as well as polymer science expertise (BUL and the MIT), food production and preservation expertise (College of Agriculture, Pune), and expertise in environmental best practices and dissemination to communities and industry (Earth Champions Foundation and PlastIndia Foundation). Potential applications and benefits,The rate of consumption of plastics in India was 8kg/person in 2011 and estimated to be 15kg in 2015 (BPF) yet in UK it is approx 80kg/person. With a population of 1.15 billion there will be strong demand for packaging of food as the middle class incomes rise and the volume of plastics would rise to 20M tonnes/year by 2020 and the films sector used in packaging would represent 9M tonnes up from 2.25M tonnes in 2015.This potential application of competitive technology with positive features to extend food shelf life would be able to capture a significant part of the food packaging market and potentially capture another applications such as carrier bags and food trays as well as disposable bags. UK with a population of 63M people, film volumes used by consumers was estimated by Valpak and WRAP to be 1.53M out of a total of 2.6Million.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project is to create improved storage condition for fruit and vegetables by regulating the high moisture content of a range of foods. Typically plastics Like PE and PP are excellent barrier to moisture and can keep from loosing water and thereby preserving the shape, colour and condition. The classic case is the plastic wrapped cucumber that can last a week longer than one unwrapped. BUL will benchmark and evaluate from current commercial range for use with suitable foods. Many fruits and vegetables not only expire moisture in large quantities during ambient storage (mushrooms, bananas) but also gases such as ethylene that speed up the ripening process. In these cases the use of an impermeable gas barrier will accelerate ripening and eventually shorten the storage life of the foods. Consequently these fruits greatly benefit from films that are permeable to moisture and these gases yet can still keep the food hygienic and free from pools of water that will cause localised microbiological and fungal activity resulting in premature rotting of the food. Bio-Based films are particularly suited to this application as they in general are more polar and less restrictive to vapour transmission. Materials such as PVOH (Polyvinyl alcohol), PBAT (poly butylene adipate terephthalate), PCL (Polycaprolactone) and PLA (polylactic acid) are often combined with starch that has been gelatinised (Thermoplastic starch) to create a permeable film. However these bio based polymers are expensive often being in the range &#xA3;3-5/kg. It is also possible to achieve similar permeability effects by blending PP and PE with TPS at higher levels such as 50% w/w. These materials are known as &quot;hybrid polymers&quot; and they form a co-continuous network at these proportions. The TPS is also typically grafted or bonded to the PE or PP to improve the mechanical strength of the film. This is achieved either by the use of appropriate compatibiliser or by the use of free-radical grafting agents. These compounds are typically recyclable and depending on the matrix selected, like starches and particularly cassava starch abundantly available in India. This project will prepare a range film materials from PP and PE as well as bio-plastics such as PLA using the TPS derived from the waste starch recovered from tapioca production which is widely encountered in India and is much lower in cost (as low as 10% or &#xA3;256/tonne) than the polymer itself. Blends of 50% would be virtually half the price of the resin making these high performance materials much more affordable. Identification of films and products for long shelf. Characterisation of hybrid plastic films from existing commercial sources will be led by MIT. Recovery process for waste starch. Development of hybrid plastics based on different starches e.g. tapioca and cassava led by Brunel University London (BUL). Shelf life extension with hybrid films. Composting and recycling performance led by Nextek (NT). End-of-life best practices for plastics films Earth Champions Foundation (ECF) and PlastIndia Foundation (PF). Commercial production of reference and novel hybrid films led by Solutions4Plastics (SP) Testing of prototype hybrid films on food products. LCA analysis and economic analysis led by Nextek.
