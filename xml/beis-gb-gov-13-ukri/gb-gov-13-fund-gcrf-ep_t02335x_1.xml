   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Developing Community-Led Solutions to Antimicrobial Resistance: Building a One Health Approach in Low and Middle Income Countries</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The One Health CE-AMR Challenge Cluster is an ambitious 12 month project, which brings together experts in the fields of Social Anthropology, Community Engagement, Health Economics, Participatory Arts for Development, Policy Development, Participatory Design for Global Health, Public-Health Epidemiology, Health Communications, Experimental Parasitology, Veterinary Science, Environmental Science and Zoology. Our aim is to investigate the potential of community engagement (CE) to address the global threat of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) particularly within the context of low- and middle- income countries (LMICs).  AMR is a major challenge, particularly acute in LMICs, including in our focal countries (Nepal, India, Vietnam, Bangladesh and Ghana) due to a combination of factors, including growing populations, limited health infrastructure and the accessibility of antimicrobials without medical advice or prescription.  We are especially interested in developing One Health approaches, which understand the need to address AMR holistically through an exploration of human and animal health, agriculture and the environment.  The Cluster will synthesise learning from within six constituent projects. We will explore best practice within these projects by addressing key research questions collaboratively across the project teams and with wider stakeholders within each country. Our learning will be synthesised into a handbook that will include: (a) guidance on unpacking the drivers that underpin the demand side of antimicrobial usage within specific communities in the Global South; (b) a methodological process for identifying relevant community stakeholders, as well as guidance on considering complexities around gender and intersectionality; (c) a set of behavioural objectives (specific practices that individuals and communities implement that will impact on AMR) that span the One Health spectrum, with specific attention to public health, animal production, and the WASH sector; (d) best practices around embedding CE into existing health, veterinary, agricultural, WASH and other systems; and (e) methodological process for identifying and influencing national and international stakeholders. We will engage extensively with non-academic stakeholders who represent sectors important to addressing AMR from a One Health perspective in the national context. They will include representatives from the health, agriculture (including livestock and fisheries), and environment sectors, as well as local and national policymakers and development partners. Through two workshops per country, we will collaborate in the development of global-south led research projects that are informed by the particular social and political contexts at play in each setting - we will emphasise the importance of developing CE approaches that can work well within existing national systems and that, therefore, will be sustainable and appropriate to deliver at scale.  We anticipate the emergence of new national networks that focus on addressing AMR from a One Health perspective through community engagement. In some settings that we are working in (e.g. Bangladesh and Nepal), such networks are already developing and we anticipate that they will be strengthened through this focussed collaboration. In other settings, these networks will be new and potentially influential players in contributing to national planning to address AMR. The overall ambition of this project is to contribute to decreasing the demand for antimicrobials and ensuring good usage of necessary antimicrobials in low and middle income countries. Whilst this project alone cannot solve these issues, by bringing together the expertise of multiple researchers and stakeholder networks, we hope to move towards this ambition. Throughout the project, we will liaise with policy makers, development partners and academicsto highlight the potential of CE to address AMR.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This Cluster application has 4 key objectives which address the potential for community engagement (CE) methodologies to tackle the catastrophic threat of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) from a One Health perspective in low- and middle- income countries (LMICs): 1. We will establish best practice within community engagement methods, in order to: a. Evaluate and draw out synergies between current projects to generate an understanding of CE best practice, challenges and key impacts. b. Develop resources and guidance to support academics and practitioners to understand, develop, implement and evaluate their own CE projects. 2. We will engage with AMR-focussed projects that do not use community-generated knowledge or participatory practices in order to: a. Explore the potential of CE to support the entire AMR research landscape. b. Identify research gaps where CE has not yet been utilised or tested. 3. We will use the learning available from current GCRF projects to develop a series of Global South-led interventions that address AMR through CE approaches that are informed by a One Health perspective:  a. Our primary focus will be on &apos;demand&apos; as a driver of AMR. b. We will robustly test the ability of CE to accelerate attitudinal change, and thus reduce the demand for antimicrobials via locally appropriate, yet scalable, approaches to AMR. 4. We will work with the public-health policy community and other relevant institutions to ensure that community-level insights inform national AMR action plans in and beyond the LMICs in which we are working. In order to achieve these objectives this One-Health focussed CE-AMR Challenge Cluster will engage 6 projects across 10 global institutions.  All currently work at the intersection of STEM, social science, arts and humanities, and creative disciplines to tackle AMR in a LMIC setting.  Using these 6 projects, we will synthesise case studies and examples of best practise to develop methodological guidance on CE.  We will discuss key challenges and barriers to executing such research and also the avenues where CE could be appropriate but has not yet been applied.  These conversations will form the basis for a suite of research proposals developed during the Cluster funding to tackle AMR via CE. Finally we will evaluate the current projects and impact of CE methods in their scope to generate bespoke, community-appropriate solutions to AMR that are, at the same time, scalable and sustainable.  Our ultimate goal is to facilitate global dialogue between community-level actors, public health policy, practitioners (medical, veterinary), NGOs, and key societal influencers in order to increase substantially the effectiveness of national AMR action plans in LMICs.</narrative>
