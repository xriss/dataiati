   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major pathogen worldwide, causing progressive and often severe liver disease in the estimated 160 million people infected with the virus. In the UK, a substantial proportion of the estimated 350,000 individuals chronically infected with HCV will eventually develop cirrhosis and liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma; HCC) if left untreated. While there is treatment available, conventional therapies based on interferon are effective in only a proportion of those treated while more recently developed antiviral therapy that directly targets the virus is expensive and its use will remain cost-limited for many years. Importantly, such treatments will not stem the spread of HCV and the large numbers of new infections recorded every year; even those who have been effectively treated remain prone to re-infection. HCV also poses a much greater medical problem worldwide where access to treatment will remain limited in much the same as HIV therapy. HCV-related deaths worldwide exceed 350,000 per year, of the same order to those attributed to AIDS, TB and malaria.   Large scale immunisation with a safe and effective HCV vaccine would induce life-long immunity to HCV and prevent further spread of the virus to those currently at risk for infection. Secondly, the therapeutic use of a vaccine in which immunisation would control and clear infection in those already infected with HCV would prevent and in many cases reverse development of liver disease complications, such as cirrhosis and HCC associated with long term chronic infection. The development of such vaccines would therefore have profound effects on global health.   The development of HCV vaccine has been hampered by a lack of animal models with which to test different type of vaccine. It has also proven exceptionally difficult to develop vaccines that induce long-lived protective immunity - even clearance of natural infections does not protect from subsequent re-infection, quite unlike the situation of poliovirus, measles and hepatitis A virus (as examples) for which effective vaccines have been developed.   We believe the solution to the problems is to generate novel vaccines in which viral proteins, such as those from HCV, are inserted into another virus, cytomegalovirus (CMV) or adenovirus (AdV). A feature of CMV infections is that although harmless, infection leads invariably to persistent infections. Infections with CMV containing inserted HCV genes, once established, would therefore continuously immunise the body against HCV, much more so than infection with HCV itself. The most compelling evidence for the effectiveness of this method of immunisation arises from HIV vaccine research, where CMV vectors were effective at preventing infection of macaques with SIV, a monkey version of HIV. Furthermore, the CMV/SIV vaccine was able to clear infection from macaques already infected with SIV. A human version of this CMV vaccine, containing HIV genes, is currently entering human clinical trial. AdV-vectored vaccines for HCV have proven efficacy in animal models and are currently in human phase I/II clinical trial.   The other development that will enable us to develop an effective HCV vaccine is the very recent discovery of a virus called rodent hepacivirus (RHV), closely related to HCV, that infects rats and causes the same pattern of liver disease and frequency of persistence as HCV in humans. In our planned project, we will develop CMV and AdV vectors containing genes from RHV to directly evaluate whether this approach can generate protective immunity and can clear RHV infection in rats that are chronically infected with the virus. Based on previous experience with CMV/SIV vaccine candidates in macaques, we believe this strategy will also prove effective for HCV and if confirmed, could translate through very rapidly into human clinical trials.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="The aim of the project to is to develop a rodent model to compare immune responses and vaccine efficacy of cytomegalovirus (CMV)- and adenovirus (AdV)-vectored vaccine constructs for a rat homologue of hepatitis C virus (HCV). These will express transgenes of rodent hepacivirus (RHV) as candidate protective and therapeutic vaccines The project allow vaccine strategies, relative efficacies and effects of compositional modification of transgene sequences on gene expression and immunogenicity to be evaluated   1) Phase I - Vaccine Development. The initial steps will be in the construction and evaluation of the immunogenicity of a series of CMV and AdV constructs containing RHV transgenes.   a) To construct vectors using established baculovirus reverse genetics systems that allow infectious rat CMV to be recovered. AdV vectors will be constructed by existing providers (Jenner Institute)  b) Evaluate gene expression of CMV/RHV and AdV/RHV vectors in cell culture and their ability to infect immunocompetent rats.  c) To estimate levels of RHV antigen expression and potential enhancement of expression in vectors containing synthetic transgenes with altered CpG/UpA frequencies.  d) To evaluate the strength, breadth and durability of T cell responses to RHV induced by CMV- and AdV-vectored transgene immunisation.   e) Establishment of the RHV / rat infection model; titration of challenge stock for vaccine evaluation in phase 2. Investigation of natural history, pathogenesis and immune response to RHV infection.    2) Phase 2 - Vaccine optimisation and evaluation of efficacy. CMV/RHV and AdV/RHV constructs will be evaluated for efficacy as prophylactic and therapeutic vaccines.   a) Efficacy evaluation of the optimised CMV/RHV and AdV/RHV constructs for protection of na&#xEF;ve rats from experimental challenge with RHV   (i) Immunisation of na&#xEF;ve rats followed by challenge with two doses of RHV  (ii) Monitoring of rats post challenge for RHV infection  (iii) Measurement of T cell immune responses  (iv) Investigation of potential correlates of protection (innate, T cell responses)  b) Evaluation of CMV/RHV construct for virus clearance (therapeutic vaccine).   (i) Infection of rats with RHV. Monitoring over 3 months to identify subset with persistent infections (ii) Infection of RHV carriers with CMV/RHV construct  (iii) Post-immunisation monitoring of rats post to investigate potential RHV clearance  (iv) Investigation of immune response parameters associated with RHV clearance   3) The demonstration of efficacy of novel vaccines in a realistic animal model would underpin the use of this strategy to create a human vaccine for HCV. The applicants would engage potential commercial partners for vector development and future evaluation in human clinical trials."></capital-spend>
