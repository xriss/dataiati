   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Exposure to poor air quality is the top environmental risk factor of premature mortality globally with an estimated 4 million premature deaths in 2015 from long-term exposure to current levels. By far the most damaging air pollutant to health is particulate matter (PM). The International Agency for Cancer Research has recently classified air pollution as a known carcinogen, with particle pollution being most closely associated with increased cancer rates. Chinese megacities, such as Beijing and Guangzhou, frequently exceed recommended exposure guidelines for particles less than 2.5 microns in diameter (PM2.5).   According to official data, the annual mean concentrations of PM2.5 in 2016 in Beijing and Guangzhou were nearly 7 and 4 times higher than World Health Organisation guidelines. A study of 272 Chinese cities found that increases in PM2.5 could be linked to increases in mortality, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, respiratory diseases, stroke, coronary heart diseases, hypertension and from cardiovascular disease. Therefore the population in Chinese megacities is subjected to damaging levels of particles over extended periods.  One of the aims of the recent NERC/MRC funded Air Pollution and Human Health in a Chinese Megacity program was to investigate the sources of PM and develop strategies to reduce exposure to harmful levels of air pollution.  Aerosol samples collected during two field deployments in Beijing were analyzed and unusually high levels of nitrophenolic compounds were observed. Nitrophenols can have a range of important atmospheric impacts.  Nitro-aromatic compounds, and their atmospheric and biological reaction products, have detrimental effects on human and plant health. For instance, toxic effects in humans after dermal, oral, or respiratory exposure include gastrointestinal, neurological and reproductive disorders, cirrhosis of the liver, hepatitis, cataracts, respiratory and skin irritation, nephrotoxicity, and haematological defects.  Some nitrophenols are phytotoxic and may be harmful to plants and aquatic life. The amounts of nitrophenols observed in Beijing were much higher than in previous studies in urban areas and the source of these compounds is unclear.    This ambitious project will bring together expertise in chemical mechanism development (Rickard), simulation chamber experiments (Wang) and detailed aerosol composition measurements (Hamilton) to understand the sources and formation processes of nitrophenols and secondary organic aerosol from the atmospheric oxidation of aromatics and phenolic species, under conditions observed in the Beijing urban atmosphere.  This project will address key uncertainties arising from the measurements of particle composition during haze events in Beijing and widen the results by applying the methodologies to a different Chinese megacity, Guangzhou. We will improve current representations of phenolic chemistry in the Master Chemical Mechanism (MCM), which is extensively used in a wide variety of air quality science and policy applications.  This will be used to design simulation experiments at the Guangzhou Institute of Geochemistry to study the formation of nitrophenols under controlled conditions. We will measure the atmospheric levels of nitrophenols in Guangzhou in summer and winter and combine this with additional data from Beijing to determine the sources and factors that control nitrophenol concentrations.  We will also initiate collaboration between the Chinese partner institute and the EUROCHAMP-2020 network, which aims to integrate the most advanced European atmospheric simulation chambers into a world-class infrastructure for research and innovation.  Long lasting impact will be achieved through a knowledge exchange placement, where a member of staff from GIG will spend 12 weeks in York to receive training on the MCM and the protocols developed in Europe to model the background chemistry within simulation chambers.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="During the recent APHH field experiments in Beijing, unexpectedly high levels of nitrophenols were observed but the sources of this material can&apos;t be determined without additional research. This ambitious project will bring together expertise in chemical mechanism development (Rickard, York), simulation chamber experiments (Wang, Guangzhou Institute of Geochemistry, GIG) and detailed aerosol composition measurements (Hamilton, York)  to understand the sources and formation processes of both secondary organic aerosol and nitrophenols from the atmospheric oxidation of aromatics and phenolic species, under conditions observed in the Beijing urban atmosphere. Complementary expertise from UK and Chinese scientists will address key uncertainties arising from the measurements of particle composition during haze events in Beijing and widen the results by applying the methodologies to a different Chinese megacity, Guangzhou.   Specific Objectives include WP1 1) Carry out a literature review of recent improvements of understanding of phenolic chemistry and use this to develop and update the Master Chemical Mechanism (MCM) for aromatic chemistry. 2) Develop a chamber auxiliary mechanisms for the atmospheric simulation chamber at GIG using protocols developed by the European consortium of simulation chambers (EUROCHAMP2020) 3) Carry out a series of simulations and sensitivity analysis to determine the most appropriate conditions for chamber experiments. 4) Participate in a knowledge exchange placement (12 weeks), where a member of staff from GIG will obtain training on the MCM and chamber protocols at the University of York.  WP2 1) Carry out two simulation chamber experiment campaigns in Aug 2019 and Jan 2020 at the GIG simulation chamber on phenol, benzaldehyde, methylphenol, napthalene and dihydroxybenzenes, the precursors of nitrophenols in the atmosphere. Experiments will be performed under two different oxidants regimes.  Firstly, oxidation by hydroxyl (OH) radicals in the presence of NOx will be used to study day time polluted chemistry, relevant for local traffic emission sources. Secondly, oxidation by nitrate (NO3) radicals will be used to simulate night time chemistry of biomass burning emissions in a regional residual layer.  The impact of acidified seed particles on the yields in the chamber will also be determined.   2) Filter samples will be collected and transported to York for analysis by ultra performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem high resolution mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS).  The data from the experiments will be used to determine the amount of nitrophenol formed and its distribution between the gas and particle phase from each precursor.  We will also determine the yield of secondary organic aerosol.  3) The evolution of reaction products, including ozone, NO2 and oxidised organics will be compared to the chamber modelling simulation carried out using the new phenolic scheme developed in WP1.  Results from the first campaign will be used to modify the mechanism to improve its performance.   4) Nitrophenols and other SOA tracer molecules will be added to the York Mass spectral database  WP3 1) An automated sequential sampler will be used to collected high time resolution filters samples during two campaign periods as above and the samples shipped back to York for analysis. Simultaneous measurements of key gases and particulate properties and composition will also be collected. 2) Nitrophenol concentrations in particulate matter in Guangzhou will be quantified using UPLC-MS/MS.    WP4 1) Combine mass spectra data from Beijing and Guangzhou with co-located measurements (from CEDA/GIG) to produce a master data file for correlation analysis.  2) Carry out source apportionment to determine whether biomass burning or traffic emissions are the main source of nitrophenols in two Chinese megacities.   3) Disseminate the results to Chinese policy makers and the scientific community"></capital-spend>
