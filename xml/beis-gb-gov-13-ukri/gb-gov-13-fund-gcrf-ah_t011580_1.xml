   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Digital Innovation in Water Scarcity in Coimbatore, India</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project is an intervention in the current water crisis in Coimbatore, Southern India. The aim of the research project is to be an urgent response to strained and failing strategies of water conversation policy and practise. The project will have immediate and measurable impact and will establish a sustainable legacy of data for ongoing and subsequent development-led research in the region and beyond. The research will use digital humanities methods to assemble data related to imaginaries, regimes and economies of water bodies over a 200-year period. Through the combination of transparent and reflexive practise, the research aims to establish this database as a trusted resource for a range of stakeholders. The research will employ GIS-based strategies to challenge the disambiguation of land and water that was created by colonial cartographies in the nineteenth century and to &apos;return&apos; archived data to localities and to communities. The project will generate innovative, integrated and sustainable conservation strategies. The first stage will create data sets about Coimbatore District from the wealth of textual and cartographic materials about the Madras Presidency and Tamil Nadu. This data will be assembled from a expansive range of pre-digitised texts and the corpus of maps held by the National Library of Scotland. These maps will be digitised and georeferenced for the project. Digital Humanities methods of mining and layering will be used to collect quantitative, qualitative and spatial data about water in any form: aquifers, tanks, riverine systems, domestic water supplies, industrial exploitation, hydraulic interventions (dams, embankments, canals), rainfall and puddles. This data will reveal patterns of historic and contemporary water security and water scarcity in Coimbatore on an unprecedented scale. This database will be developed and refined across the duration of the project and will be made available in a user-friendly format as a free, open-access resource.  The second aspect of the project is intensive fieldwork in the Coimbatore. A series of local interviews and interactions will discuss the aims of the project with local activists, scholars and residents. A key aspect of this work will be to garner information about living, local narratives of water scarcity. The water crisis is universally acknowledged but narratives are characterised, and compromised, by fragmentation. The integrity of the project&apos;s intervention will depend upon our ability to engage with those fragmentations and to establish trust with local stakeholders.   The third aspect of the project will combine the assembled data with the understandings garnered through local interactions to create interactive, culturally resonant digital visualisations designed to disrupt catastrophic patterns of water exploitation in the region. These visualisations will combine and manipulate the data collected in order to create new narratives about the history of water. The visualisations will aim to change the narratives about scarcity, the landscape and rights. The visualisations will challenge the tacit spatial and temporal assumptions that define the categories that separate water from land. One of the broader outcomes of the project is to build and consolidate networks of scholars and environmentalists within South Asia and internationally who will draw on the water data assembled and engage with the visualisations created. The digitisation and dissemination of archived materials, and data derived from them, raises a number of difficult questions about the subsequent use of that data in the contexts of informal and profoundly unequal terms of property and resource entitlement. A key aim of the project is to conceptualise a strategy to nuance a methodological commitment to open data for data-led projects in the Global South. This approach will engage with analogous data interventions elsewhere and refine an approach to sensitive data.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project is designed to be a rapid, reflexive intervention in the ongoing, and worsening, water crisis in Coimbatore in Southern India. The project will build the considerable potential of digital humanities to generate robust and trusted data sets and to design meaningful, resonant visualisations that will reframe and subvert cycles of water over-exploitation and depletion. The depletion of the region&apos;s water resources is abundantly documented: river basins are shrinking, droughts increasing, water tables lowering and rivers are being transformed from perennial to monsoonal as tributary aquifers and rivers vanish. However, there is a paucity of trusted quantitative data that connects water to the localities faced with an acute and immediate resource crisis. Pan-regional or national aggregate data is dominant in the crisis discourse and, while significant, these figures have little relationship with quotidian patterns of local water use.  There is an urgent need to challenge the disjunctures created between locality and information, and between water and land, created by colonial and post-1947 practises of cartography, governance and water exploitation.  This project will draw on the concepts and methods of spatial humanities - georeferencing, entity recognition and corpus linguistics methods - to restore meaningful associations between landscape, people and water. Text mining and geotagging can create a unique data base relating to the water resources of the Coimbatore region. Digital Humanities methods are uniquely capable of drawing data, at great speed, from a wide-range of materials (for example, revenue statistics, cartographies, hydrology interventions, poetry, geology, agrarian history, art, advertising, industrial expropriation, medical topography and contemporary oral testimonies) in order to create data sets that can radically re-frame the water crisis and create innovative, integrated strategies of conservation. The project will assemble a range of qualitative and quantitative data relating to water bodies in Coimbatore: volume, surface area, distribution in urban, semi-urban and rural, quantification and naming of dry and perennial water resources (canals, tanks, lakes and rivers). This data will be gathered from digitised materials drawn from across the world and returned to Coimbatore. The project partners include journalists, activists and scholars. Their participation allows both the formulation, the development and the outputs of the project to be embedded within ongoing conservation strategies and debates in the region (see Pathways to Impact). Third sector partners include five local NGOs engaged in activist work in Coimbatore: Kovai Kolangal Paathukaappu Amaippu, Sirithuli, Siruvani Vizhudhugal, Osai and Kurichi Kulam. These NGOs undertake a range of information, engagement and conservation work and have made explicit their interest in collaborating on the proposed project. Other participants include scholars, writers and academics working on water histories and conservation in Southern India. Digital data can provide the foundations and tools to create new, robust practises of water conservation only if it has credibility and resonance with a number of stakeholders: communities, activists, local, regional and national officials with jurisdiction over water. Digitised media and platforms will be used to return water to the localities of Coimbatore through creative visualisations - animations, imaginative counter-mapping and narratives - that are based on historical, literary, linguistic and cultural understandings of the Coimbatore region. These data visualisations will be framed and determined by local collaborations and interactions. Project collaborations will ensure that the outcomes of the project  are meaningful resources and interventions that can be used to re-frame and re-orientate struggles for water conservation, management and access in Coimbatore.</narrative>
