   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project aims to investigate the construction of memorial heritage sites through the deployment of local plurilingual repertoires in postcolonial settings, namely Algeria, Cape Verde and Eritrea. Drawing on scholarship relating to critical language policy, Linguistic Landscapes and geosemiotics, the research will explore the role of memory places such as museums, memorials and monuments in addressing issues of social inequality, and foreground to what extent multilingualism challenges the legacies of colonial experiences that can have a significant impact on prosperous and peaceful communal living. This project therefore engages directly with two AHRC priority areas, namely Heritage and Modern Languages, to bridge the gap between existing AHRC projects, all of which currently link multilingualism with education rather than heritage.  This network will bring together researchers, practitioners, and policy-makers from countries which are simplistically described in linguistic terms according to the standard language spoken by the former colonial power. The network will pay critical attention to how multilingualism in memorialisation can address voicelessness by bringing sociolinguistic approaches to bear in questions of heritage. Although the University of Liverpool participants will bring to the network their expertise in multilingualism and language policy, one of the aims of the collaboration is to negotiate research perspectives, practices and aims in order not to impose western-centric methodologies and epistemologies on the investigation of the relevant settings. By embracing the principles of Southern Theory, the project will be grounded in local modalities of memorial narratives and discourses, and integrate alternative experiential universes. This is the ethical stance that informs the project, starting from a first &apos;agenda setting&apos; meeting of the participants. This will ensure co-creation of shared objectives and outcomes in the respect of local priorities and needs.  There are three planned workshops in Africa, each of which is immediately preceded by a half-day session in the memory place used as a case study and backdrop to the roundtable discussions. This half-day practical session draws on Blackwood and Tufi&apos;s expertise in Linguistic Landscape research in order to record and analyse the memory places, involving not only the core network members but also the practitioners and policy-makers. This activity not only shares the latest developments in best practice for data collection and analysis but also provides the material for the evidence-based policy recommendations. The collective analysis of the material recorded in the three memory places facilitates the transnational dimension of the project, drawing on the range of approaches that have evolved in each of the national traditions. The core network members co-lead the three workshops, with a different member of the Advisory Board at each workshop, in order to maximise input from different academic perspectives, using local interpreters to avoid the replications of models of academic interactions which perpetuate the dominance of standard language - and in particular English - in scholarship. Local practitioners, policy-makers, and researchers will attend and contribute actively to the three workshops, each of which will take place in the respective memory places. As such, this network will provide a new narrative on the management of heritage, privileging multilingualism so as to reduce inequalities as well as to develop a shared arena of research.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="This network will bring a range of cutting-edge findings from multilingualism to apply to representations of heritage, with particular emphasis on how heritage is arranged and presented in post-colonial settings in non-Anglophone Low- and Middle-Income Countries in Africa. The network intends to bring a new perspective to the organisation and study of memory places (such as monuments, memorials, and museums) in multilingual settings where post-colonial governments have replicated colonial-era language policies that privilege a single, standardised language.  The network challenges voicelessness and social inequalities, using methodologies from critical language policy and Linguistic Landscape studies to record and evaluate three different kinds of memory places (a memorial site, a historic district, and a museum). This second objective, therefore, establishes a baseline for discussions which question the dominance of monolingualism (or, in some cases, bilingualism featuring the language of the former colonial power) in heritage sites.  Third, the project draws on non-Anglophone traditions and approaches in sociolinguistics and heritage studies, embedding a transnational approach to interrogate postcolonial practices in Francophone, Italophone, and Lusophone Africa. As a project conceived from the perspective of Sociolinguistics within the tradition of Modern Languages, the network will be characterised by the cross-fertilisation of ideas and methods which cross national and language boundaries. The network will draw on and develop Southern Theory by its bifocal emphasis on multilingualism and heritage.  The activities of the network will investigate the extent to which ethno-linguistic groups are disconnected from the public articulations of collective memory. These will therefore privilege participants from the so-called minority groups, such as Kriolu speakers in Cape Verde, the Tamazight communities in Algeria, and speakers of languages other than Tigrigna and Tigre in Eritrea.  Based on the experiences of a successful pilot study in Zambia, undertaken by Blackwood using ODA Seed Corn Funding, the workshops will take place within the memory places, or - in the case of the casbah in Algiers - as close as is feasible. This approach not only embeds the activities of the network within heritage sites, but it facilitates the participation of practitioners, such as museum curators, guides, and directors. The network involves academic and non-academic partners in the setting of agendas, the co-production of outputs, and the development of policy guidelines and recommendations. In each memory space, the workshop is scheduled to take place after a day of training, provided by the PI and CI, in Linguistic Landscape methodologies for local researchers and practitioners to increase local capacity to undertake high quality collaborative research. The workshops and training days will use local interpreters to ensure full participation by minoritised groups, thereby avoiding the replication of monolingualism this network explicitly seeks to challenge. Sequenced in order to build on the conclusions of the preceding workshop, each of three meetings in Africa has its own specific focus.  The first workshop, planned to take place in the Tarrafal prison camp in Cape Verde, will be devoted to setting the agendas, as identified by the academic and non-academic participants.  Using Dourari&apos;s long-standing contacts and networks, the second workshop, based in the casbah of Algiers in Algeria, brings in policy-makers so as to ensure best practice in the devising of the toolkit - one of the outputs of the network.  The third workshop is scheduled to take place at the National Museum of Eritrea in Asmara, Eritrea, within the UNESCO Heritage Site of a Modernist African City. This final workshop will be the forum to synthesize the findings of the project and to confirm and complete the outputs for the project."></capital-spend>
