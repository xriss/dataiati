   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Digital Health for Migrant Mothers Network: Maternal Care in Dadaab Camps</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Our Network entitled &apos;Digital Health for Migrant Mothers&apos; establishes an innovative collaboration between the UN, African and UK-based academics, industry (African-based VR company &apos;Black Rhino&apos;) and midwives to explore how digital tools can be used to enhance maternal care for refugees within camp environments.   The UN has noted that despite improving global trends, maternal and neonatal mortality rates remain disproportionately high for women living in humanitarian settings, such as refugee camps. A central component in this challenge is the lack of trained midwifes with Combating these pressing challenges facing women&apos;s maternal health care has been strategically identified as part of the SDGs (5 &amp; 3). Our project builds upon previous GCRF-funded research (&apos;Birthing at the Borders&apos; PI Bagelman) and addresses these challenges in one of the worlds&apos; largest and longest-standing refugee camps: Dadaab camps in Kenya which borders Somalia.   The Dadaab camps currently host over 400,000 refuges (40% of reproductive age) where maternal morbidity and mortality is notably high (Gee et al, 2019). Our project proposes an innovative Network bringing together a diverse but coherent team to co-design a digital health response to the urgent challenges facing migrant mothers in an environment of protracted displacement. Our project is collaborative in nature, employing agile participatory modes of research rather than imposing models from above. Given the urgent need for midwives to have a more empowered role in the digital provision and education of maternal care our project will develop an engaged Network to explore the possibilities of &apos;training up&apos; midwives, enhancing their digital literacy through the design of digital &apos;teaching toolkits&apos; for midwifery education supported by UN.  Despite significant international funding spent on reproductive health in Dadaab, maternal and neonatal death rates are disproportionately high as compared to other hardship areas in the region (Gee et al, 2019). Research demonstrates that this discrepancy is due to a systemic disconnect in maternal care within the camp: while most refugee women rely on midwives (as they perceived to provide emotional, culturally-sensitive support) there are only few trained midwives available (Bagelman et al, forthcoming. See CV). Despite the key role that midwives play in supporting refugees in pre to post-natal care, midwifery training remains under-resourced and designed on an ad-hoc basis. While significant resources are earmarked for promoting digital learning and training for biomedical practitioners, midwifery-led health education platforms remain under-supported (WHO, 2016). In particular, digital health tools remain inaccessible to most midwives. For instance, while Virtual Reality (VR) have been well-established within biomedical communities as a productive mechanism for learning and teaching, midwives have little access to such tools. This digital gap is problematic for two main reasons: 1) the absence of digital technology underprivileges women in their ability to provide care 2) and directly impinges upon refugee women in camps who rely - sometimes exclusively - on midwives in receiving care.   In sum, our Network places primacy on African digital expertise, is gendered in its approach and centres those often marginalised in digital debates to promote an innovative, and agile response in emergency camp geographies.

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Our Network has the main objective of addressing maternal care in emergency contexts. We do so by bringing together experts by training and experience to examine how digital tools may be used to enhance refugee-relevant midwifery education which is deeply under-supported (See UNHCR Letter of Support). To this end, our objective is to bring together African and UK-based academics, the UN, midwives and industry-partners in four events. These networking sessions are carefully planned to address the six objectives listed below:  1. According to MDG Goal 5, improving maternal health globally is vital. So too, SDG Goal 3 emphasises the need to reduce maternal morbidity. The main objective of our Network is to addresses these critical development challenges in an innovative manner, providing digital learning opportunities to &apos;train-up&apos; refugee midwives who are providing a large portion of informal care, but often without adequate resources and training. Our Network is collaborative in nature (employing participatory modes of research rather than imposing models from above) seeking to develop agile, community-based responses to maternal care that will lead to community mobilisation.   2. A key objective of our Network is to directly empower Somali refugee midwives living in Dadaab&apos;s camp, by creating opportunities for their informal maternal care to be more formally recognised in an educational environment. Our Network will provide training for refugee midwives in Virtual Reality (VR). These are women who are systematically excluded from digital learning and teaching. Thus, an attendant goal is to address the digital gap particularly experienced by women refugees.  By working with refugee midwives who provide much of the informal maternal care in camps, our Network will develop tangible, accessible, digital &apos;teaching toolkits&apos; to educate and empower current and future midwives.   3. Beyond improving lives of women in Dadaab, our Network aims to economically benefit the wider region. If and when refugee midwives are repatriated they will be equipped with transferable skills that will promote economic development and sustainable health futures. Moreover, as a Network we have an objective to identify possibilities to &apos;scale-up&apos; our digital toolkit to provide training for midwives in other emergency camp environments.   4. Our Network has the objective of designing a concrete plan (see pathway to impact) to embed digital toolkit into existing educational infrastructure at Kenyatta University (run by Co-Investigators Dr. Gitome, Dr Mwoma).    5. Our Network seeks to develop longer-term opportunities for commercialising toolkits so that they may be purchased by practitioners and embedded into midwife curriculum in other more developed regions. Commercialisation of these toolkits represents a key social-enterprise opportunity for midwives working and living in Dadaab camps.   6. Raise the profile of refugee voices within academic conversations on technology. Based on the exchange events that we are leading, we plan to publish a paper exploring the intersections between gender, health and digitally in camps.</narrative>
