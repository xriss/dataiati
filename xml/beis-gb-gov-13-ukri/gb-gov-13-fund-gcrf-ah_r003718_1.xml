  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">-To harness energy, expertise and support from both academics in the Arts &amp; Humanities and NGOs and community groups assisting persons harmed by and vulnerable to gender-based violence and inequality (GBV/I) across all four project countries (South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, UK) and directing these towards fulfillment of UN Sustainable Development Goals #5 (to achieve gender equality and empowerment of all women and girls), #4 (promotion of education) and #16 (promotion of peace, justice and strong institutions).  -To facilitate international and cross-sectional collaboration towards a full understanding of the intersections of religion and rape culture and to devise innovative and versatile strategies to resist GBV/I effectively and comprehensively.   -Through maximizing existing and devising new resources informed by biblical and gender studies, to improve significantly access to information, physical and mental health, and prospects of personal &amp; economic empowerment and fulfillment for those at risk of GBV/I, e.g. through creative collaborations, including workshops, contextual bible study, and a sustainable media of resistance. Emphasis in all of posters, song and live performance strategies will be on self-representation and on engaging those most affected but also most under-represented publicly (e.g. vulnerable women/girls, members of the LGBTQ community).    -To promote solidarity and support structures among persons vulnerable to GBV/I at local and international levels through stronger regional support networks and international knowledge exchange.  -To create a significant, meaningful and cross-cultural contribution to the wide-ranging international debate on sexuality and gender-based oppression through participation of diverse academic and non-academic contributors. Every effort will be made to include unfiltered, self-representational contributions, including by subalterns, e.g. in the form of self-produced footage and artistic expression.  -To promote development opportunities sensitive to indigenous knowledge, beliefs and practices through locally engaged approaches and close collaboration with participating partners based in southern Africa (e.g. dissemination of resources of KwaZulu-Natal&apos;s Ujamaa Centre, a hub of contextual bible study, in Lesotho and Botswana) and by extending and energizing existing networks (e.g. Boleswa, a University support network dating back to the apartheid era which links academic departments in Botswana, Lesotho and Swaziland but which is currently under-resourced).  -To facilitate the creation &amp; distribution of professional footage and recordings of songs/performances to create a sustainable media of resistance, thereby bringing about consciousness-raising, educational and knowledge enhancing resources (visual, audio, film and text-based) on the topic of rape culture, which will be freely and easily accessible on a comprehensive website.   -To explore fully the adaptation of project resources for integration into public education on rape culture at every level, through consultation with Botswana&apos;s Minister of Education.   -To promote internationalisation and cross-boundary exchange and solidarity by sharing expertise and resources between the UK and southern Africa in both directions, including through teaching and presentations. PI &amp; CI will teach and present at institutions of learning in southern Africa and Botswana-based project partner Kebaneilwe will present at the Centre for Religion and Public Life (Uni Leeds) and at both Hidden Perspectives and the Shiloh Project (public engagement projects hosted by Uni Sheffield), as well as at the Unis of York and Leeds Trinity.   -To advance the inclusion of minority perspectives in the academic study and teaching of both the Bible and gender in the UK by incorporating materials from case studies in southern Africa in University modules, conference presentations and peer-reviewed as well as popular publications.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">As highlighted in UN Sustainable Development Goal #5, gender-based violence and inequality (GBV/I) disproportionately deprive women and girls of personal, social and economic fulfillment and health: physical, emotional and mental. All countries at the centre of this project - South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, UK - are impacted by GBV/I but in South Africa and Lesotho, which have among the highest rates of reported rape worldwide, the situation is particularly acute. In all of South Africa, Lesotho and Botswana, moreover, GBV is compounded by high risk of HIV infection, with socio-economically deprived women and girls particularly vulnerable to both GBV and the hardships procured by HIV and Aids.  Expertise and resources from the Arts &amp; Humanities (A&amp;H) alongside targeted international collaboration can go a long way to providing sustainable support and development in innovative and effective ways. The A&amp;H expertise focal to this project focuses especially on two disciplines:  - biblical studies, because the Bible is highly influential and unprecedentedly available (in all indigenous languages) in all project countries, which all have Christian-dominant populations; - gender studies, because GBV/I perpetuates damaging gender stereotypes which must be fully understood first to be effectively detoxified and resisted.  Another area of A&amp;H expertise applied in the project is music and performance arts, in order to foster a creative, interactive and sustainable media of resistance. Outputs in this area - such as photographs, songs, survivor stories and live performance - also lend themselves to self-representation, allowing persons vulnerable to GBV (foremost girls and women but also members of the LGBTQ community) unfiltered media of expression, aimed at all of healing, empowerment and solidarity.  To address especially UN sustainable development goals pertaining to gender equality (#5), quality education (#4) and peace- and justice- building (#16), the project will:  1) Harness energy, expertise and support of A&amp;H academics in the three southern African project countries as well as in the UK and direct these towards social activism in the area of GBV through working together with relevant NGOs and community groups. The project&apos;s three core facilitators (one based in Botswana, two in the UK) are all biblical scholars, with each contributing also distinctive expertise in the areas of sexuality, HIV-theology or ethnicity. All have associations with NGOs and community groups active in addressing GBV/I, as well as passion for social justice. 2) Facilitate existing resources and create also new ones that will in a series of workshops explore the relationship between the Bible and GBV/I. Southern African NGOs and community groups are doing fabulous work in demanding circumstances but this is not always effectively shared due to inadequate networks. The project&apos;s facilitators will train at an established centre of socially engaged Bible study, the Ujamaa Centre in South Africa, and disseminate tried and tested resources as well as devise new ones to be trialled in a series of workshops in both Botswana and Lesotho. 3) Produce collaboratively artistic and self-representational media that actively resist GBV/I. Alongside educational and information resources produced in and for workshops, the project will facilitate also creative ways promoting personal expression and healing as well as community mobilization and solidarity.  4) Disseminate information and resources in academic and popular forums, including on the open-access project website. In diverse and innovative ways, the project seeks both to infuse academia with social justice, as well as creative outlets and social justice endeavours with high quality information and education. This will both strengthen and diversify existing and form also new networks and take a big and promising step towards sustained social betterment and justice.</narrative>
