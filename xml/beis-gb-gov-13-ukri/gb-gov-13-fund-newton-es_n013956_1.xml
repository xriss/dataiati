   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Development of multi-wavelength astronomy in South Africa on the pathway to the SKA, LSST and CTA.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In the 21st century, astrophysics is a multidisciplinary field. Far from the traditional image of the lone astronomer viewing though a telescope with the naked eye, astronomy covers the whole electromagnetic spectrum with an interdependent range of activities including optical and electronic engineering, high-speed signal processing, high-performance computing for processing huge data sets, and advanced numerical simulations. All are sophisticated intellectual endeavours; all are integral to addressing the physics questions of modern astronomy; and all have huge societal benefit in the training of young scientists and development of advanced technologies, in addition to their core value of fundamental research. The Square Kilometre Array (SKA) will be the world&apos;s largest and most capable radio observatory. It is a flagship project in South Africa, being the first international science facility built in the country. It is being highlighted as the project to bring young South Africans into high-tech areas. The South African SKA, through the NRF and RSA government, is providing training across all levels of employment, from engineering through operations and astronomy research. In this background the astrophysics community in South Africa is growing rapidly, from a small base concentrating mostly on traditional optical astronomy. We propose an exchange programme for Ph.D. students in which they will experience the wide variety of multi-wavelength technical and observational aspects of astrophysics, along with big data analysis, theory and simulations.  In our exchange programme ten students from Oxford, and a matching number from the RSA universities, will be jointly supervised by academics at their host institution and at the partner institution. Each student will spend six months, typically in the middle part of their Ph.D., at the partner institute working directly with their co-supervisor. We will also arrange a programme of supervisor exchange visits, and annual network workshops in both Oxford and South Africa, to build up the collaborative ties between the two communities for the long term.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This network proposes an exchange of students between UK and South Africa with the aim of strengthening ties between the astronomy communities in the two countries; building up links with cognate disciplines in engineering; and ensuring the long term strategic success of these ties by fostering collaboration between young scientists and established leaders in the partner countries.  Specifically our student exchange has two goals,   * First, to give the richest possible multiwavelength science background to those students who will go into academia, and who will build the universities and the scientific community of RSA in the 2020&apos;s.   * Second, to give a broad experience of a large variety of data types, data analysis techniques and numerical simulations to students who wish to go into commerce, industry and public sector positions; so they can bring their highly numerate and analytical astrophysics skills to bear on the largest range of problems.  This is supported by our faculty exchanges, and programme of annual workshops, which will foster collaboration between members of the scientific community who are not direct participants in the exchange programme. The goal here is to secure the academic ties for the long term, ensuring a strong base for the upcoming UK and SA researchers to undertake research of global concern and with international impact.</narrative>
