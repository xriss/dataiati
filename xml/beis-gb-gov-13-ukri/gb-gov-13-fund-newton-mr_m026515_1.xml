   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project is primarily about improving the number of people with good research skills through a scientific partnership between the University of Exeter and the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (Fiocruz). Together we will do this by passing on established methods of health technology assessment, particularly health economic modelling. Health technology assessment involves identifying the benefits and harms of any new approach to health care, particularly whether the costs of introducing the new technology seem justified. We will also attempt to improve health technology assessment in an area of common interest, new diagnostic tests for the identification of infectious disease and complications arising from them. In contrast to disease treatments, approaches to evaluating the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of tests designed to improve our ability to identify whether someone has a particular disease such as hepatitis are at an earlier stage of development. From the perspective of the UK, this project will help the University of Exeter appreciate the challenges of doing health technology assessment outside the UK. As well teaching the techniques of health technology assessment, we will improve research skills by jointly working on a specific assessment comparing the impact of two different non-invasive diagnostic methods - AST to Platelet Ratio Index (APRI) and transient elastography (FibroScan) - to monitor whether liver scarring is beginning, getting worse or better in people living with Hepatitis C. There will be reciprocal visits and regular communication between both centres to these ends during 2015.</narrative>
