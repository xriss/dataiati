   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Research Network addresses the key development challenges of clean and affordable energy (SDG7), sustainable cities (SDG11) and gender equality (SDG5). The project builds on the findings of our three interdisciplinary GCRF projects in India and South Africa, addresses the gap identified in these projects (poor communication between policy makers and the local community and lack of women&apos;s participation in energy policy) and aims to maximise their impact.   Energy infrastructure affects women in particular as they are at home more than men, carry out most household practices and are extremely dependant of social networks. In developing countries, women&apos;s traditional role at home leads to them having far more influence than men on domestic energy consumption but women&apos;s involvement in UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) 7 (energy) and 11 (safe, resilient and sustainable human settlements) remains an under-researched area, especially in the urban context. Our previous research has revealed policy makers&apos; total lack of understanding of women&apos;s daily realities in low income settlements in India and South Africa: new energy and housing infrastructure has led to households practices moving from outdoors to indoors, energy intense lifestyle and debt.  Predicting the future of energy demand lies in understanding the everyday life that sources domestic energy consumption. Yet approaches to effectively capture the everyday life in domestic environments are a blind spot in current energy research. The challenges are considerable and call for a radical new approach. Film is an art of recording that is always imbued with a pre-existing reality associated with a social and physical context within given cultural, political and environmental circumstances. Cinema is an unused vehicle to study the unravelling of domesticity within dwellings that are notoriously difficult to access given the sociocultural context. The Research Network explores how cinematic analysis and short documentary films could provide crucial new data concerning womens&apos; daily practices and energy use. This could allow us to make recommendations that could result in the creation of more inclusive, affordable and clean energy infrastructure.   This Research Network will address this development challenge specifically by: a) analyzing our existing CineSpaceMuse database on everyday household practices in Indian and African cinema; b) making a series of short documentary films on location in Mumbai and Cape Town; and c) testing the approach on policy makers in a series of workshops in Mumbai, Cape Town and Cambridge. The international collaborators (Indian Institute of Technology/IITB, City of Cape Town, Development Action Group/DAG, Doctors For You/DFU) have been in key role on developing this proposal and identifying development challenges in the field. Their participation in crucial in the workshops, the analysis and dissemination.   The project uses films in two ways. First, by adopting the methodology and the software developed for the AHRC CineMuseSpace project [https://www.cinemusespace.arct.cam.ac.uk]. This part of the study will directly build on our CineGenus project [https://www.cinemusespace.arct.cam.ac.uk/news/cinegenus]. Second, PI and Co-I will make short documentary films (each 2-5min) on location in low income housing in Mumbai and Cape Town that pin down the occupants&apos; daily practices, which interact with energy, mainly electricity. The novelty lies in using the fiction films&apos; data as a reflective tool to map energy consumption patterns which are in sync with daily lives. Short film database, policy briefing and design guidelines for energy infrastructure in low income housing will be written together with all project partners and discussed in the workshops.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="As a response to the AHRC Research Network Highlight call, the project will establish a novel network of researchers, policy makers NGOs and communities involved in the design and delivery of energy infrastructure of low income housing in India and South Africa. This project will use film as a research method to understand how energy demand is shaped by domestic practices.  To begin to address this challenge, this Research Network will:  [1] organize a series of workshops in Mumbai, Cape Town and Cambridge, that establishes a Network consisting of researchers, policy makers and NGOs to investigate the impact of new energy infrastructure on households in low income housing in Mumbai and Cape Town; [2] help to close the communication gap between policy makers and occupants, by offering a better understanding female occupants&apos; thermal comfort, cooking and childrearing practices, and the underlying socio-cultural norms influencing these practices; [3] explore films as a tool to analyse and communicate user experiences of energy infrastructure to policy makers and building professionals, both in terms of access to our CineSpaceMuse database (https://www.cinemusespace.arct.cam.ac.uk) and creating our own short films on site that are then communicated to policy makers in the workshops; [4] develop future design guidelines and participation models for gender inclusive housing and energy infrastructure in low income sector in the Global South, together with the project partners (City of Cape Town, Development Action Group/DAG, Doctors For You/DFU, IITB);  [5] contribute to the academic discussion by commenting on: a) the application of social practice approach in energy research by gathering new data from developing countries; and b) the use of cinematic analysis and films as a method (with support from Professor Francois Penz and Dr Janina Schupp at the Department of Architecture); [6] furnish the basis for extending collaboration with the workshop participants beyond the life of the Research Network grant and preparing the groundwork for a new, large-scale inter-disciplinary research project to generate new research and interest in the area; [7] help to integrate highly promising early career researchers and graduate students (e.g. PhD and MPhil students in Cambridge and IITB) into this research area. The Cambridge workshop will provide an invaluable context for them to interact with established experts in the field and get feedback for their own research. We will connect with graduate students at IITB through Co-I (Dr Ronita Bardhan) who is an affiliated Faculty member and at the University of Cape Town through an established contact with Dr Jiske De Groot who has been a Co-I in our previous GCRF project in Cape Town. [8] bring insights of arts and humanities to humanise the highly technical approach of energy policy.  The Research Network will address the following research questions: a) What is the end users&apos; experience of energy infrastructure and slum displacement housing in India and South Africa? b) How are women&apos;s thermal comfort, cooking and child rearing practices are related to energy use? c) How does the built environment and energy access influence these practices? d) How can cinematic analysis help us to understand this change in energy cultures that has massive impact on energy demand and wellbeing?  The research project is particularly relevant to this AHRC Research Network Highlight call as it investigates the development challenge of affordable, reliable and sustainable energy (SDG7) that is thematically under-represented in the AHRC research portfolio and establishes equal research partnerships between UK, Indian and South Africa (e.g. Indian Institute of Technology Bombay/IITB, City of Cape Town, Doctors for You/DFU, Development Action Group/DAG), with the objective to establish a consortium for a larger research proposal beyond the scope of this call."></capital-spend>
