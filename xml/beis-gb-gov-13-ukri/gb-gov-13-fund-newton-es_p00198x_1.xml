   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The appropriateness, usefulness and impact of the current urban planning curriculum in South African Higher Education</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">International institutions such as the United Nations have highlighted the significance of planning as a discipline in promoting more sustainable environments and dealing with the core economic, social and environmental challenges faced by Africa. Delivering successful urban planning training in SA Higher Education will thus make a key contribution to addressing SA national Government priorities around equity, social justice and democracy.  For many years post-colonial and post-apartheid SA has modelled its urban planning practices on Western systems which has been reflected in HE curricula. Concerns have been raised about the relevance and applicability of these Western theories and methods when planning African cities (Watson, 2003, 2009). To date, there has been little or no sustained work that brings together post-colonial and Southern debate theories with an examination of transferring northern planning theories to South Africa.  Major uncertainties remain about HE and the appropriateness, usefulness and impact of planning curricula in the last 10 years and their associated teaching methods.  The proposed research also aims to reflect more widely on the implications of the SA study for UK planning education; this is especially important given the recent increase in students from the Global South registering for planning-related courses in the UK.  O1: To investigate the social and economic value of planning education in SA particularly questions of equity and diversity in HE destination choices, graduation rates and employability outcomes. O2: To deconstruct how the development and delivery of the urban planning undergraduate and postgraduate curriculum addresses issues raised by a changing post-colonial context in SA. O3: Drawing on O2, to assess to what extent issues raised by a changing colonial context is considered and addressed in the UK undergraduate and postgraduate planning curriculum.  By doing so and reflecting on lessons from O1, the research will explore the implications for urban planning lecturers in the UK when working with students from Africa and the wider Global South. O4: To create a platform for ideas-sharing between SA academics, professionals and students across the world in order to connect and inform curriculum shaping, teaching methods and wider HE strategies for planning education (especially via SACPLAN) O5: To develop a set of evidence-based resources for HE planning strategies that can address the Global South challenge in SA and across the wider continent.  The potential applications and benefits of the proposed research are diverse.  There will be an immediate contribution to existing teaching programmes and to SACPLAN/RTPI strategies.  There will also be a medium to long-term contribution through the way urban issues are dealt with in SA, what this means for planners when trained and re-trained (CPD) and for the content of planning curricula, teaching methods and thus planning policy. The main targets for dissemination of the project findings go beyond traditional academic audiences to planning practitioners, policy-makers and wider community groups. It will include the production of reports, briefing notes, good practice guides, evidence-based learning and teaching materials as well as academic papers and a book. The development of an online forum will maximise international dissemination of the project and provides long-term impact by creating a dynamic platform for debates among South African (and African) planners.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The research proposed has been developed with the ambition of addressing the ESRC-NRF Higher Education Call 2016, matching the topic &apos;Curriculum, pedagogy and modes and levels of provision&apos;. While some literature exists on South African town and regional planning (see for example Watson, 2002, 2003, 2009, 2013, 2014; Oranje, 2013, 2014) there is yet to be a full scale study that explores the appropriateness, usefulness and impact of the current higher education urban planning curriculum and its associated teaching methods. Beyond carrying out this assessment, the proposed research aims to reflect more widely on its implications for students both from Africa and the wider Global South; this is especially important, given the recent increase in overseas&apos; students registering on planning-related courses. This research draws upon the hypothesis that an increased focus on the Global South in teaching and training will create more socially-inclusive outcomes.  Developing a critical and reflective understanding of post-colonial planning education in South Africa and Africa more widely is crucial to establishing how important the discipline is in structuring local and regional economic development, addressing community welfare and thinking about adequate tools and policy to address and alleviate poverty.  This research will be the first comprehensive study aiming to deconstruct the South African urban planning curriculum at undergraduate and postgraduate level, in order to draw broader lessons for Africa and the UK. It is positioned at the cross-over of urban planning and geography and has been developed in the close partnership with the two planning accreditation bodies, SACPLAN in SA and RTPI in the UK.  The project has five key objectives:  O1: To investigate the social and economic value of planning education in SA particularly questions of equity and diversity in HE destination choices, graduation rates and employability outcomes. O2: To deconstruct how the development and delivery of the urban planning undergraduate and postgraduate curriculum addresses issues raised by a changing post-colonial context in SA. O3: Drawing on O2, to assess to what extent issues raised by a changing colonial context is considered and addressed in the UK undergraduate and postgraduate planning curriculum.  By doing so and reflecting on lessons from O1, the research will explore the implications for urban planning lecturers in the UK when working with students from Africa and the wider Global South. O4: To create a platform for ideas-sharing between SA academics, professionals and students across the world in order to connect and inform curriculum shaping, teaching methods and wider HE strategies for planning education (especially via SACPLAN) O5: To develop a set of evidence-based resources for HE planning strategies that can address the Global South challenge in SA and across the wider continent.  A total of 8 SA Universities will participate in the study as well as the two Schools of Planning in Birmingham. The SA universities offer diversity in terms of geographic location, numbers of students, historical legacy and curriculum. The innovative aspect of the research design relies on the scale, comparative and inter-disciplinary nature of the project. Although there are some regular reviews of accredited planning courses in South Africa, no large-scale, systematic survey has been undertaken which explores urban planning values as well as Global South/North challenges in curriculum delivery at a time when integrated planning is needed to address major urban issues facing SA.  This is particularly timely given the importance of urban planning in driving economic growth and addressing wider social issues.</narrative>
