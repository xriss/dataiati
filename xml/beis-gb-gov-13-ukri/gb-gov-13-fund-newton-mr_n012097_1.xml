   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Targeting the FOXM1 signature for early diagnosis and treatment in cholangiocarcinoma</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is rare cancer of the intrahepatic and extra hepatic bile ducts. High incidences of CCA are clustered in the Greater Mekong sub-region, particularly in the northeast of Thailand. Relatively little is known about the cause of CCA, and the treatment options are limited because of late diagnosis.  Researching for early diagnosis and effective treatment is an urgent need to prevent the loss from this cancer.  Accumulating evidence indicates that the Forkhead box M1 (FOXM1) transcription factor has a key role in tumour initiation, progression, metastasis, angiogenesis and drug sensitivity. A previous gene array study in Thai CCA patient tissues has revealed that FOXM1 and its downstream targets as genes upregulated in almost all CCA cases. We hypothesise that FOXM1 plays a key role in CCA initiation, development and drug resistance. We aim to identify the critical FOXM1 gene transcription signatures involved in CCA tumorigenesis, progression and drug sensitivity. This will not only help to identify reliable biomarkers for early diagnosis and for predicting disease relapse but also aid the design of targeted therapies and strategies to overcome drug resistance in CCA.  This joint project will also strengthen the collaborations between ICL and KKU, and promote the career development of junior researchers from both institutes.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Our work and that of others has led us to hypothesise that FOXM1 has a central role in cholangiocarcinoma (CAA) tumorigenesis, progression, metastasis, angiogenesis and chemotherapeutic drug resistance. A thorough understanding of the role and regulation of FOXM1 and its transcriptional targets in CCA will contribute towards the development of better diagnostics and treatment strategies for CCA. The proposed project consists of 4 overlapping objectives: 1) To characterise the expression and regulation of FOXM1 and its potential targets in CAA cell lines. 2) To identify the role of FOXM1 and its targets in CCA tumorigenesis, progression, metastasis, angiogenesis and chemoresistance. 3) To explore whether inhibitors targeting the FOXM1 transcription signatures/signalling network can be used alone or in combination with the chemotherapeutic agents for CCA treatment. 4) To validate our in vivo and in vitro findings in CCA patient samples and to determine if the FOXM1 signature can be used as diagnostic/prognostic markers in CCA.   It is anticipated these studies will identify key FOXM1 gene expression signatures that are important for CCA initiation, progression and drug resistance and help to uncover crucial early diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets for CCA. Since FOXM1 is one of the central regulators of a myriad of cancer development processes, this research will increase and foster a greater understanding of the biology of cancer. As part of this programme, junior researchers from KKU will also gain from research visits and placements at ICL. There, they will develop expertise in cancer and molecular biology as well as communication skills and research networks, which will aid their career development.</narrative>
