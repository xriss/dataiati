   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The primary objective of this BGS ODA project is to undertake integrated geoscience research that will support development. The research will take advantage of our extensive international experience, and will be informed by current socio-economic strategies and policies. Working with multiple partners across a wide range of countries and sectors, we will develop the research interface between human and Earth sciences to meet development needs and realise a positive impact of science on society.  Multi- and interdisciplinary science are integral to effective policy-making and its implementation. Our research will deliver increased knowledge, new datasets, and build capacity. This will improve resilience to natural hazards, promote effective management of natural resources, enhance food security, and support sustainable cities.  Our research is aligned to the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and will be implemented through three interlinked Research Platforms (RPs). Each RP has a set of coherent objectives, with research being co-designed and co-developed with ODA partners to achieve maximum impact.  RP1: Integrated Resource Management in Eastern Africa. Our objective is to underpin welfare and future economic development in eastern Africa by: - improving community resilience to climate shocks through increased use of sustainable groundwater supplies; - enhancing the understanding of mineral and energy resource potential, whilst promoting efficient production and responsible consumption of natural resources in an environmentally sound manner; and - combining geology with soil type, groundwater, and chemistry to help combat low agricultural productivity and micronutrient deficiencies (&quot;hidden hunger&quot;) in vulnerable communities.  RP2: Resilience of Asian Cities.  Our objective is to improve resilience by integrating geology in urban subsurface planning and urban-catchment science in India and SE Asia by: - demonstrating how the geological setting of the city and its wider catchment supports sustainable urban development;  - embedding geoscience information, modelling, and visualisation in urban policy and decision-making; and - co-developing interventions that improve urban resilience which are appropriate for the geological conditions of the city and its catchment.  RP3: Global Geological Risk. Our objective is to characterise complex multi-hazard processes, and research the impacts of environmental shocks on our environment in Latin America and the Caribbean, and the regions covered by RPs 1 and 2 by: - underpinning disaster risk reduction (DRR) by advancing research into environmental processes, and the interactions of multi-hazards;  - strengthening existing partnerships and building new ones to improve resilience through knowledge exchange and capacity building; and  - building on our humanitarian assistance activities to co-develop proactive systems to improve the effectiveness of geoscience information for use by NGOs, governments, and mandated authorities when geological hazards (geohazards) occur.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Whether at the scale of a field, a village, a city, a country, or a continent, geology is fundamental to understanding human-environment interactions and delivering the UN SDGs. This project will, for the first time, integrate BGS research on groundwater, soils, minerals, energy, urban planning, environmental modelling, and geohazards. Such an approach will deliver applied science that positively impacts on lives, livelihoods, and the natural environment.  Three interlinked Research Platforms (RPs) will help address the development needs of up to 13 countries on the DAC list of ODA recipients (our ODA partners). Key to success is research co-designed and delivered with our partners, sharing experience and building capacity to ensure effective knowledge and data exchange. We aim to leave behind a long-term legacy of UK-international interdisciplinary research networks.  Eastern Africa (RP1) faces severe natural resource challenges due to exponential population growth, rapid urbanisation, and economic development. BGS has strong and diverse research experience in this region. We will build on this to address the responsible use of natural resources by: (i) quantifying how climate and human stressors impact water resources and identifying the appropriate water abstraction technologies and how these are governed to ensure they remain functional in the long term; (ii) enhancing the understanding of the mineral and energy resource potential in the region to facilitate informed policy development, support effective governance mechanisms, and aid inward investment; and (iii) using geological science to increase agricultural productivity and tackle micronutrient deficiencies by carrying out research linking bedrock geology and minerals to soil type thus informing decisions on improving soil quality, use of fertilisers, water retention, and plant nutrition.   Asian cities (RP2) are exposed to multiple natural hazards, the pace of urbanisation is often overwhelming and their resilience to environmental change unknown. Our research will: (i) identify how innovative use of data-informatics, sensor technologies, and modelling systems can improve urban planning; (ii) assess the effect of multiple environmental and demographic stresses on the city and its rural catchment, and the extent to which further urbanisation can be sustained; and (iii) determine inter-dependencies between human and Earth systems in cities, and whether this understanding can be used to make city services more resilient.  Natural geological hazards and their associated risk (RP3), including volcanoes, earthquakes, and landslides, and their impacts, are of key concern to long-term economic growth. Our research, focused on Latin America and the Caribbean, and the regions covered by RPs 1 and 2, will: (i) advance research into environmental processes and the interactions of multi-hazards (e.g., an earthquake triggering landslides); (ii) develop and utilise novel data collection, monitoring, and communication/ visualisation techniques to improve disaster resilience; and (iii) build on our humanitarian assistance activities, and long-term planning experience to co-develop proactive systems to support NGOs, governments and mandated authorities when geohazards occur.  Research will be co-designed using participatory workshops. It will aim to build sustainable networks of scientists, policy makers, NGOs, and communities. The long-term benefits of this research are knowledge exchange and its contribution to achieving the SDGs. Throughout the project, the RPs will act as a catalyst for BGS and UK-based research applications to GCRF, Newton, Royal Society and other funds. It is anticipated that leveraged and parallel funding will provide the principle mechanism to support project partners. Other return benefits to the UK research community will include advances in interdisciplinary understanding of human-Earth systems, open-access data, and new research partnerships.</narrative>
