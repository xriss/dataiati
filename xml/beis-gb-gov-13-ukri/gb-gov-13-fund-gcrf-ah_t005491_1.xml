   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Education in Divided Societies Network: the role of school collaboration in societies emerging from conflict</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Overall aims - To co-construct a network of schools, teachers, academics, education officials and NGOs in conflict-affected societies across the Middle East, South East Europe, and UK (including Northern Ireland, Lebanon, Jordan, Kosovo, North Macedonia and Bosnia-Herzegovina), with the aim of providing mutual support in the development of curricular and pedagogical innovation, and school leadership to promote educational outcomes and address issues of societal division; - To support and facilitate three project meetings with relevant stakeholders from across the ODA partner jurisdictions, for the purpose of refining and advancing development of the EDS-N+ network;  - To contribute to the preparation of the full stage proposal (due September 19th 2019) with specific reference to the feedback from the outline stage and making preparations for the interview stage.  Project governance - Assemble members of the wider project group involved in the development of the EDS-N+ network; - Discuss and finalise a revised EDS-N+ network governance structure, aimed at devolving more resources and responsibilities to LMICs;  - Establish Local Leadership Teams (LLT) in both the Middle East and South East Europe; - Co-design the various frameworks that will underpin the activity of the EDS-N+ network, outlining the principles and values by which we will commit to work together, with specific emphasis on gender, equality, diversity and inclusion, and discussion on the way we will develop equitable partnership working; taking into account multiple contexts and legal frameworks. - Widen membership of the Thematic Advisory Group (TAG) by identifying additional members in the Middle East and South East Europe regions who can make an important contribution to the project; thus providing ODA stakeholders with more opportunity for meaningful participation in the development and governance of the EDS-N+ network.  Project activities - To commission a series of scoping papers from which a comprehensive needs analysis of the training and capacity building requirements of stakeholders across the participating jurisdictions will be conducted;  - Engage with wider networks of local ODA stakeholders, educators, and policy makers to explore the key priorities for implementing the EDS-N+ network, within and across the Middle East and South East Europe; - Consider options for transition to the Network Plus award with the development of an initial programme of activities and the launch of a project website. Consideration will also be given to those aspects of the project which could be linked to one of the other Network Plus projects.   Impact - Prepare and plan capacity-building activities (including seminars, workshops and professional development activities) to support research expertise and the implementation of systems and infrastructure for delivering the EDS-N+ network; - To support the scaling of connections between relevant ODA stakeholders in the Middle East and South East Europe, both within and across these regions.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Societies emerging from conflict, or conflict-affected, often find it difficult to secure peace: there may be challenges in dealing with the legacy of conflict and in finding a cohesive approach to building a better and safer future. In many of these societies school systems are also divided, or have become so, which appears to render the challenges even more difficult. The Education in Divided Societies Network (EDS-N+) project aims to use the transformative potential of collaboration in education to help address these challenges, with the foci of collaboration involving teachers within schools, teachers between schools from different communities, and teachers working across different jurisdictions.  With the support of the GCRF Development Award, we will begin co-constructing a strategic network of key educational stakeholders in Northern Ireland (NI), Lebanon, Jordan, North Macedonia, Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina (BiH), and Kosovo, all of whom work on peace building through education. The network will eventually co-create and co-support projects and activities that seek to address these key challenges. It will look to connect learning and different systems of knowledge around the teaching of history and civics to inform pedagogical change and social empowerment. The EDS-N+ network will support opportunities for collaboration between local, national and international school networks to enhance the social impact of public education, and improve access to quality education for young people, especially those from lower socio-economic groups. Collaboration across the layered networks of educators will enable curriculum and pedagogical innovation to be explored in a joined-up way, providing spaces for dialogue where expertise and experience can be shared, new learning achieved, and educational and social goals pursued. The focus on the teaching of history and civics is important as these are areas of the curriculum that go to the heart of identity and social practice, while the focus on transversal competences highlights the wider educational environment and the experiential opportunities provided to students.  The opportunity provided by the GCRF Development Award will be used to address a number of priorities over two stages of work. In summary, the first stage will involve the wider project group meeting in order to enhance and finalise the full stage proposal in the light of feedback from the outline stage. We will also continue the process of team-building amongst the wider project group and begin the process of expanding the group. In the second stage, two further meetings will be held in the Middle East and South East Europe to which local ODA country stakeholders will be invited. We will start to build and scale wider networks of educators and policy makers, and begin discussions with stakeholders on the key needs and priorities within and across the two regions. During this phase we will also start developing plans for the implementation phase after the final decisions on GCRF Network Plus submissions are made.</narrative>
