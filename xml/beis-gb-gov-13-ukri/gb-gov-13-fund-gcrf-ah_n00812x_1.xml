   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Following the wires: sensing socio-material practices of everyday electricity supply in post-conflict Greater Beirut.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The research explores the consequences of conflicts on electricity infrastructures in Beirut. The impacts on electricity services of the violence and unrest that have affected the city since the beginning of the civil war in 1975 have forced families and individuals to invent new strategies to bring energy to their homes and shops. Informal systems and networks of electricity provision have profoundly altered the urban environment: electricity cables, generators and fuse boxes are now an ubiquitous element of the cityscape. The need to gain access to electricity and to secure stable supply have become part of everyday life and led to new practices and ways of living. Through the evocative power of video this research project follows the wires that crosscut the skyline and buildings of Beirut&apos;s neighbourhoods.  In visually doing so, the project will ground the electricity cables along the lives of the persons and families it connects. By telling the story of the electricity infrastructure and the everyday responses to its failures the project aims to make sense of the lived and material legacy of the conflict. Emphasising the importance of basic infrastructures, the project uses the synthetic power of video, together with ethnographic and sociological accounts, to show through the voices and buildings of Beirut how conflicts shape cities and change how people live and make decisions. As such, research involves formal and informal interviews with residents and other stakeholders in Beirut, biographic accounts and participant observation to capture the everyday experiences of living with power outages in the city and the different strategies adopted to maintain electricity services in homes. In the early 1960s, a programme for the universalisation of services and infrastructure - including electricity - began in Lebanon, spearheaded by the then president Fouad Chehab, culminating in the creation of &#xC9;lectricit&#xE9; du Liban in 1964. Since then, violence and political unrest in Lebanon have upset that effort and reversed the trend, resulting in the debilitation of services and the prevalence of power outages and elongated blackouts. Since the civil war (1975) infrastructure provision has been used as a political weapon, resulting in significant disruptions and changing the nature of provision of electricity. The following years of reconstruction and rehabilitation policies (new infrastructural work) and the management of networks policies (fees collections, theft repression) have added new layers of spatial and social differentiation. Military attacks on power plants and the resulting damage of the electricity grid during the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah conflict have further diminished the capacity of power production, leading to an increase of the shortage at the national and urban scale. The aggravation of the already tensed conditions of supply makes it compulsory for households to rely on alternative means of provision.  By focusing on electricity supplies the research project aims to show how the disruption of services is not only the result of technical vulnerability but reveals social, political and sectarian fragmentation caused by conflicts over the years.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project will use innovative visual methods and combine insights from sociology and anthropology to follow the wires that crisscross the skyline and buildings of Beirut&apos;s neighbourhoods. In doing so the project will make visible the impacts of electricity disruption on everyday lives. The electricity infrastructure, and the responses to its failures, will serve as an analytical lens to make sense of the lived and material legacy of the conflicts that have affected Greater Beirut. The uneven supply of urban services is a major dimension of post-conflict cities in Lebanon but, as Verdeil suggests, &apos;it is a reality which is under-researched&apos; (2009). Whilst infrastructures are usually &apos;invisible&apos; (Star and Bowker, 2006), the inadequacy of the electricity services in the country, the resulting power outages and the perceived failure by the State makes salient the material and institutional elements of this infrastructure. In this way, the focus on electricity provides a useful heuristic for understanding conflict as lived, situating it among the socio-material entanglements that articulate our actions (Latour, 2005). The study will:  - explore how energy infrastructures are revealing of the obduracy of conflict and its changing dynamics;  - investigate informal electricity supply as revealing of the dynamic between State and non-State actors in post-conflict contexts; - visualize the impact of energy disruptions on everyday life and on the urban environment in order to assess the role of communities in negotiating the direct and indirect impact of conflict. This will be accomplished through an experimental, innovative and interdisciplinary research approach that mobilizes perceptual, material and social structures. The project combines:  - sociological accounts of technology that draw attention to the social and material  aspects of everyday life mediated through electricity services and their lack thereof. This will provide both a background and an analysis of the context where the social and the material interact. - anthropological methods and theory to explore the social and political dimensions of electricity supply through the everyday realities and experiences of research participants. - applied visual methods to capture perceptual responses to disrupted electricity services and their impact on the urban environment.  Each methodological and disciplinary approach will influence the others. Sociological accounts of interactions with energy infrastructures will direct the eye of the camera, whilst this in return will capture ways of doing that will inform ethnographic observations. The latter will then feed back into rethinking the overall relation between socio-material structures, post-conflict politics and urban spaces. The project emphasises the synthetic power of visual practice to follow the wires that join the sensorial, perceptual and material structures of electricity disruption in post-conflict Beirut. Visual practice will be an integral part of the research process and will inform from the outset questions of research design, measurement, data collection and analysis, communication. This project proposes an interdisciplinary provocation to literally follow the wires of electricity in order to navigate the everyday city-scape in post-conflict Beirut.</narrative>
