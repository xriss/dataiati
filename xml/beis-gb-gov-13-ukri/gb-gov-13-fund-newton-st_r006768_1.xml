   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Astronomy is known for producing highly appealing images which often get published and re-published world-wide. HST images, for instance, have appeared on web sites, news papers, and even stamps. Less well known is that these images are the tip of the ice berg. The large majority of images, even from HST, do not contain such pretty structures. Astronomers locate the news-worthy ones by manual inspection of all the data. Modern astronomical instruments provide far more data than can even be manually inspected. ALMA, for instance, can produce over 10,000 images from a single observation. Each of these measures a slightly different wavelength of radiation, and many of the images will be empty or near-empty. But without looking at each one, how does the astronomer know which images to select?  This project will look at techniques to let computers do the work. They can investigate all images much faster than people can, and can learn which ones are of interest by looking for characteristic patterns. The problem is that they need to be taught what is &apos;characteristic&apos; something even astronomers may find difficult to put into an algorithm. Malaysian scientists have unparalleled expertise in image classification using deep learning techniques, and in semantic descriptions. This expertise will be brought to the astronomical archives, to develop techniques of computer learning to aid astronomers. Manchester is one of the access points to the ALMA archive. The combination of the data and astrophysical expertise in Manchester  and image classification by deep learning in Malaysia will provide new and powerful tools for science.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Machine learning is used to find relations between structures in images and other data. Malaysia has been closely involved in this development which is of high economic importance. We here propose to study the application of the techniques and algorithms to archival data from modern astronomical telescopes. This will provide Malaysia with a new tool set that can be used on publicly available astronomical data, and by negotiation on access-limited data, and will be a valuable asset to a country that has limited facility access. The data to be used will taken from the ALMA archive, in the form of images for each frequency channel This research has the following objectives, which are to: 1. propose a CNN architecture to automatically classify sources of emission in channel maps of ALMA images, its corresponding observation and proposals for which the data was obtained; 2. analyse the best combination of spatial arrangement (hyperparameters), parameter sharing, pooling layer, Rectified Linear Units and Loss layer in the proposed CNN architecture for unknown ALMA image prediction; and   3. compare the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed deep learning architecture with manual classifications by astronomers and with existing parallel computing techniques. 4. Use text mining on the abstracts of the proposals to add scientific descriptors to the archived data. The result of the project will be a feasibility study and proto-type, and identify the main areas and techniques for future development.</narrative>
