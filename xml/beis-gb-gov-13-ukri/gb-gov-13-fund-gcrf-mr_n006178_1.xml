   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Primary Care Strategies to Reduce High Blood Pressure: A Cluster Randomized Trial in Rural Bangladesh, Pakistan and Sri Lanka</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) have become the leading cause of mortality globally. In South Asia, high rates of CVD are observed at a younger age than in other countries causing a reduction in productive life years with severe economic consequences. High blood pressure (BP) confers the greatest attributable risk to death and disability associated with CVD.  Our Wellcome Trust funded Control of Blood Pressure and Risk Attenuation (COBRA) trial (2004 to 2007) in Karachi, Pakistan, suggested the combined strategy of family based home health education (HHE) delivered by trained community health workers (CHW) plus care of individuals by trained private general practitioners (GP) to optimally manage hypertension had the most marked beneficial impact on BP compared to usual care, or single interventions. However, the COBRA intervention was designed for an urban South Asian setting, where private GPs cater to over 75% of the patients seeking care. Most of South Asia is still rural (73% Bangladesh, 64% Pakistan, 71% India, 85% Sri Lanka) where prevalence of hypertension is high and healthcare infrastructure and provider characteristics are very different compared to the urban setting. The COBRA trial did not evaluate effectiveness of strategies delivered using the public health infrastructure, or generalizability to the rural population in Pakistan. It is also not clear whether any benefit would extend to rural communities in other South Asian countries.  In our ongoing COBRA-BPS feasibility study in Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka, we modified COBRA by developing a comprehensive &quot;multicomponent intervention (MCI)&quot; for effective delivery of hypertension care using the rural predominantly public primary care infrastructure. We also conducted extensive stakeholder consultation and received very favourable response for a full scale trial to evaluate MCI in 3 countries.  We now propose a cluster randomised controlled trial (RCT) on 2550 adults with hypertension in 30 rural communities in Bangladesh, Pakistan and Sri Lanka, to evaluate a comprehensive MCI comprised of specifically comprised 1) home health education (HHE) by government community health workers (CHWs),  2) blood pressure (BP) monitoring and stepped-up referral to a trained general practitioner (GP) using a checklist,  3) trained public and private providers in management of hypertension and using a checklist,  4) designated hypertension triage counter and hypertension care coordinators in government clinics,  5) a financing model to compensate for additional health services including targeted subsidies.    A total of 15 communities (5 in each country) will be randomised to MCI and 15 (5 in each country) to usual care in 3 countries. Individuals with hypertension will be followed for 2 years to assess whether MCI compared to usual care is more effective at lowering BP, and cost effective in terms of preventing CVD related disability and death. We will also interview stakeholders and conduct serial focus group discussions of patients on their experience with the strategy in relation to various components of MCI.  If shown to be successful, our findings will be helpful in securing political commitment from stakeholders for up-scaling MCI strategies at the national level in these South Asian countries. The South-South collaboration and shared experiences will be very valuable in co-ordinating a regional action plan on NCDs with a focus on hypertension as an entry point. Our trial will provide direct evidence of the value of using comparable models and platforms for non-communicable disease management which would extend to other Asian countries with similar ethnic population and healthcare infrastructure.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Hypertension is a major contributor of morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular disease (CVD) in South Asia. About 1 in 4 adults suffer from hypertension in Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka. Furthermore, the vast majority of individuals with hypertension are under-treated thus remaining vulnerable to the adverse outcomes from CVD. Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) have recently been highlighted on the national health agenda in these countries. However, evidence on effective strategies to manage hypertension in this region is limited.  Our Wellcome Trust funded COBRA cluster randomised controlled trial (RCT) in Karachi (urban Pakistan) demonstrated that the combined effect of family based home health education (HHE) plus training private general practitioners (GP) lowered blood pressure (BP) more than usual care, or single interventions, which were no better than usual care. COBRA was conducted in an urban setting using private GPs only. The trial did not evaluate effectiveness of strategies delivered using the public health infrastructure or generalizability to the rural population in Pakistan or other South Asian countries. Our on-going COBRA-BPS feasibility study in rural Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka, funded by the MRC/Wellcome Trust/DfID, aims to modify COBRA to optimise the development a comprehensive &quot;multicomponent intervention (MCI)&quot; for effective delivery of hypertension care using the predominantly rural public primary care infrastructure. The preliminary results of the feasibility study suggest unanimous agreement on usefulness of the proposed MCI strategies and the need for their evaluation in a full scale trial.  We now propose a cluster RCT in 30 rural communities in Bangladesh, Pakistan and Sri Lanka on 2550 individuals with hypertension (systolic BP &gt;=140 mm Hg or diastolic BP &gt;=90 mm Hg, or on antihypertensive therapy) followed over 2 years to evaluate the effectiveness and cost effectiveness of MCI vs. usual care on lowering BP, and averting projected CVD disability adjusted life-years (DALYs), respectively. We will also interview stakeholders and conduct serial focus group discussions of patients on their experience with the strategy in relation to various components of MCI.  The main objectives are to determine whether:  1) a comprehensive MCI specifically comprised specifically comprised of all the following five components: 1) home health education (HHE) by government community health workers (CHWs); 2) blood pressure (BP) monitoring and stepped-up referral to a trained general practitioner (GP) using a checklist; 3) trained public and private providers in management of hypertension and using a checklist; 4) designated hypertension triage counter and hypertension care coordinators in government clinics; and 5) a financing model to compensate for additional health services including targeted subsidies better than usual care in lowering systolic BP among adults with hypertension in rural communities in Bangladesh, Pakistan and Sri Lanka?  2)  Is the MCI cost-effective relative to usual care in terms of cost per projected cardiovascular disease disability adjusted life-years (CVD DALYs) averted from the societal and payer&apos;s perspective?  The ancillary research questions are:  3)  Is the MCI better than usual care in improving medication adherence, and lowering body mass index (BMI), dietary sodium, smoking rates, lipid levels, glucose levels and INTERHEART CVD risk scores?   4) What is the hypertensive individuals&apos; experience during the course of MCI strategy in relation to components of the intervention, diagnosis of hypertension, treatment, quality of life, and sustainability of intervention?  The information from our trial would be very important in seeking political commitment from key stakeholders and is likely to enhance uptake of MCI strategies as sustainable provincial/national/regional public health programmes.</narrative>
