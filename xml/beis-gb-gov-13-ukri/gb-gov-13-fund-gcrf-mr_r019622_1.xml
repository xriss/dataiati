   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Early adversity is known to be associated with later mental health in young people. However, the nature of the early adversities experienced by young people differs considerably across the world, and much research to date has focused on data from high income countries. Here we propose to develop a portfolio of projects across five partner countries spanning three major global regions, to address research questions of direct relevant to those countries and regions, and build research capacity in those countries to ensure that the projects and partnership we help to establish can be sustained beyond the lifetime of this award. The research questions identified include understanding the impact of early adversity on suicide and suicidal ideation, exploring the role of socioeconomic adversity of psychological and psychiatric outomes, and investigating the effects of HIV/AIDS on mental health in young people. We expect this list to grow as the project develops and partnerships are established. Ultimately, we hope to identify risk factors that we can then develop interventions to target, in order to reduce the global burden of mental illness</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The University of Bristol is internationally recognized for excellence in epidemiological research, with a particular focus on developing and applying methods that enable stronger causal inference in observational data. We also have a long track record in working with partners in Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs), such as the Pelotas cohort studies in Brazil, and in particular taking advantage of the cross-cohort comparisons that these allow in the context of strengthening causal inference. Finally, we have a strong institutional culture of fostering the careers of early- and mid-career researchers, encouraging them to lead on projects and grant applications in a supportive and nurturing environment. We are proposing to promote collaborations across a range of LMIC partners spanning three major global regions by awarding seed funding to early- and mid-career researchers to develop grant proposals to examine the role of early adversity on subsequent mental health. These will focus on issues of direct relevance to our LMIC partners and beyond, and incorporate substantial capacity building efforts to ensure the sustainability of the collaborations.</narrative>
