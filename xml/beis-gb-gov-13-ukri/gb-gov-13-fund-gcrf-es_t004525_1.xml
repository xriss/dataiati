   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Out of camp or out of sight? Realigning responses to protracted displacement in an urban world</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Camps remain default response to new crises of forced displacement, capturing the attention of the media, relief organisations and academia. But as short-term emergencies turn into protracted displacement, camp living can erode residents&apos; dignity and increase aid dependency. In response, displaced people are increasingly moving to cities, avoiding camps to seek autonomy and freedom over dependency and isolation. In tandem, international policy has focused on self-reliance as a solution to protracted displacement, currently taking its toll on the overstretched humanitarian system. The different impacts of camp and urban environments on the lives of refugees, returnees and internally displaced people have not been systematically evaluated. Relatively little is known about how displaced people in cities interact with people, institutions, and economies (informal and formal), or how cities can better respond to their needs. This understanding is critical if we are to move towards displacement responses that promote rights, dignity, and well-being, and facilitate displaced people&apos;s economic contributions to their host settings. The research thus examines the potential of urban response to long-term displacement, assessing how cities can foster displaced people&apos;s self-reliance and local integration in ways that benefit host governments and communities. It will achieve this through large-scale studies of displacement experiences in cities and camps in Afghanistan, Ethiopia, Jordan and Kenya. The ultimate goal is to improve the well-being and productive livelihoods of displaced people to enable their full participation in urban life.  Research aims: 1. Build an evidence base for national and local governments, humanitarian agencies and donors on the opportunities and challenges of hosting displaced people in camps vs. urban areas 2. Promote an assessment of current responses to urban protracted displacement, raising awareness of unmet need 3. Build the capacity of municipal authorities, displaced people, organisations of the urban poor and other local actors to use participatory planning to underpin development-based solutions to forced displacement. Research objectives: 1. To examine the building blocks of self-reliance and meaning of well-being from the perspectives of refugees, returnees and IDPs (women and men) 2. From these understandings, to analyse the difference that urban or camp settings make to:  a) households&apos; ability to achieve self-reliance, well-being and productive livelihoods b) the potential social and economic contribution of refugee, IDP and returnee economies (displacement economies) to host communities and local economic development 3. To address the gap in knowledge about the challenges and opportunities of protracted displacement in urban settings for hosts and displaced people, including:  a) the social, economic and institutional (formal and informal) barriers and opportunities to achieving self-reliance, well-being and productive livelihoods for women/men, and  b) the role of municipal government and other local actors in fostering self-reliance, social support and realisation of rights for refugees, IDPs and returnees. The research addresses 3 critical gaps in knowledge. First, the concept of self-reliance holds a central place in international policy on managing displacement, but there is a critical absence in self-reliance and well-being literature of attempts to work with displaced people and their hosts to identify their own definitions of these terms and co-design solutions to protracted displacement. Second, is the lack of evidence on the cumulative effect of displacement economies as a positive force for local economic development. Third is the lack of significant analyses of the role of municipalities in supporting the urban displaced, and of development solutions that can both meet critical needs of the urban poor and the specific needs of vulnerable urban refugees/IDPs.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">For decades, the response by the international community to mass movements of people fleeing war or political persecution has been to provide humanitarian assistance in camps. Yet despite highly-charged debates on the negative impact of maintaining forcibly displaced people in often inhospitable and remote regions and dependent on humanitarian assistance, camps have continued to be a default response to new refugee crises. Camps are not, however, the choice of the majority of the world&apos;s displaced people, and estimates suggest that over 60% of refugees and half of internally displaced persons (IDPs) now live in towns and cities. Research, international policy discourse and local action have been slow to catch up. The experiences of urban refugees and IDPs, their understandings of well-being and self-reliance, and their contributions to host communities remain understudied. There is a critical need for evidence to inform innovative solutions to protracted displacement that support both the specific vulnerabilities of displaced people and the needs of the urban poor amongst whom they often live. With the ultimate goal of improving self-reliance, well-being and the productive livelihoods of refugees, returnees and IDPs this research examines the potential of an urban response to protracted displacement to assess how cities can foster displaced people&apos;s self-reliance and local integration, while benefitting host governments and communities. The research is the first large-scale study to compare experiences of displacement in cities and camps and provide evidenced analysis of the comparative outcomes for displaced people in these different settings. It focuses on four countries with large displaced populations: Afghanistan, Ethiopia, Jordan and Kenya,  The ultimate goal is to improve the well-being and productive livelihoods of displaced people and to enable their full participation in urban life and contribution to host cities. The overall aims of the research are to: 1. Build an evidence base for national and local governments, humanitarian agencies and donors on the opportunities and challenges of hosting displaced people in camps vs. urban areas 2. Promote an assessment of current responses to urban protracted displacement, raising awareness of unmet need and the potential economic and social contributions of refugees and IDP for host cities 3. Build the capacity of municipal authorities, displaced people, organisations of the urban poor and other local actors to use participatory planning to develop innovative, inclusive solutions to forced displacement. The countries studied host some of the largest refugee and IDP populations in the world. All four countries rely on international aid to support the costs of the displaced - particularly those in camps who lack the right to work and whose freedom of movement may be limited. Three of the four countries are piloting the Comprehensive Refugee Response Framework, the UN&apos;s 2016 vision for managing forced displacement.  Through partnership with displaced and host populations, and collaborations between international experts, operational actors, developing-country academics, local NGOs and affected communities, this research project will produce: an assessment of how an urban response can support a rights-based approach to local integration; guidance for municipal governments facing large influxes of people, and evidence to support international policy and decision-making on innovative solutions to protracted displacement.</narrative>
