   <narrative xml:lang="EN">&apos;Learning from the past to inform the present and inspire the future&apos; - Atkins Group  Despite the absence of written historical records, pre-Columbian people of the Amazon Basin developed remarkable soils referred to as Amazonian &apos;dark earths&apos; (ADEs), used to promote sustainable agriculture. With increasing global demand for food, energy and carbon, it is crucial to understand and learn from past land use systems in order to appropriately manage the current and plan the future land uses. The current project will contribute to the knowledge of how soil animals and their biodiversity are related with soil fertility, ADE formation and land use changes in a mega-diverse biome. Furthermore, it will strengthen the &apos;ADE Network&apos;, and provide capacity building to Brazilian researchers and students interested in Amazonian biodiversity and sustainable agriculture. The results will promote better understanding of how to sustainably use and manage Amazonian soils, while simultaneously preserving their rich biodiversity.  Therefore, the proposed project will establish a collaborative network composed by a multi-disciplinary, multi-institutional team of researchers in different areas of Brazil (and the world), therefore solidifying the connection between the UK and Brazil, in particular between Cardiff University and Embrapa Forestry.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">1) Establish a long term collaborative network between Cardiff University and EMBRAPA in order to gain knowledge about the functioning and potential role of soil ecosystem engineers, organic matter and nutrients to Amazon Dark Earth (ADE) formation; this novel approach will aid in understanding the origin and sustainable management of these soils as well as other highly weathered acidic soils under humid tropical conditions.  2) Establish the use of next generation technologies to describe the diversity of the ecosystem engineer community associated with past and recent settlements throughout neotropical forests.  3) Establish an open data interactive online platform for data storage and general transfer of knowledge between project partners.  4) Transfer and implement genomic approaches in Brazilian partner institutions to address diverse biodiversity questions, through the organization of a workshop on &quot;The role of ecosystem engineers in soil fertility and sustainable agriculture&quot; and by providing training of students and staff.</narrative>
