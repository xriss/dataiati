   <narrative xml:lang="EN">A development study to examine feasibility and acceptability of pulmonary rehabilitation in Uganda for adults with chronic respiratory disease</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Arising from respiratory infections such as TB and HIV, tobacco smoking and nutritional impairment, chronic lung disease (CLD) affects around one in five adults in Africa, and is a major threat to health. Patients with breathlessness related to CLD create large but silent burden of human suffering, damage to the economy through lost productivity and disability, and direct health service costs with frequent and prolonged hospital admissions. People with CLD are prone to breathlessness, inactivity, de-conditioning, declining health status and prognosis. CLDs are disproportionately prevalent in deprived populations and many sufferers can neither afford the drugs nor transport to medical clinics. While non-communicable diseases are now recognised as a major public health problem in Africa, CLDs are neglected as a health priority.   While medication may improve lung function and symptoms they do not change prognosis or rate of decline in lung function or health status. However these important systemic effects of CLDs are amenable to treatment with pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) which is a programme of exercise, and education and self management. There is strong evidence that PR improves health status, exercise capacity, social functioning and is recommended in international guidelines. PR involves existing local resources such as nurses, doctors, physiotherapists and clinic staff. PR allows patients to help each other and themselves, without major capital outlay or equipment. PR offers a major and radical new approach to CLDs, an important neglected group for whom no effective therapy is available. A literature review found no evidence of pulmonary rehabilitation being used in Sub Saharan Africa. In a pilot PR study we set up and ran a programme in Mulago Hospital, Kampala. A multidisciplinary team of doctors, nurses, physiotherapist and others have run 2 groups with 23 patients with chronic lung damage secondary to pulmonary TB. Results confirm that the programme is feasible and acceptable to patients and to the hospital staff at all levels. Major improvements were seen in exercise capacity and health status. In many patients the experience was life changing, allowing severely incapacitated patients who were entirely dependent on others to now function normally in work and social activities. The patients in this pilot so far have been post tuberculosis patients, but we are now able to include patients with other CLDs. The objective of this application is to develop PR to a point where it may be deployed widely in East Africa and assessed in a large trial. The main research questions are:      -  What is the optimal design of the PR programme?   -  What are the patient recruitment and retention strategies?   -  What are the optimal assessment strategies and outcome measures?   -  How can the training and roll-out be best achieved? The study has quantitative and qualitative elements. We will continue the pilot PR programme at Mulago hospital for 3 more cohorts, totalling 30-40 people. Quantitative data will be recorded on recruitment, uptake and completion of PR. We will assess a range of measures including exercise capacity and quality of life, satisfaction, and evaluation of chest pains. In the qualitative study, detailed interviews will be held with 25 participants who have completed the programme and 5 interviews will be conducted with people who did not take part or complete PR, focusing on barriers to attending or completing PR. A focus group and up to 5 in depth interviews with stakeholders will explore practical issues of running and extending PR in Africa. Thematic analysis will be performed by Ugandan researchers in local languages initially with further framework analysis in collaboration with the UK team. To inform the development of a full grant application we will host a meeting of all stakeholders to disseminate thefindings of this work and develop the strategy for rolling out PR in East Africa.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Overall objective of the development trial is to use mixed methods to evaluate a pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) programme in order to inform the content and design of a large international roll-out and evaluation trial of a pulmonary rehabilitation programme planned for East Africa. The full trial will be a roll-out project in which the intervention- PR - will be extended using a train the trainer approach from the first centre in Kampala to other centres in Uganda and to centres in Tanzania and Zambia.  The development trial will address key areas of uncertainty before proceeding to the main trial with confidence.  These uncertainties relate largely to the conduct of the trial but we shall take the opportunity to satisfy ourselves that; (i) the rehabilitation programme itself, already established in Mulago, Uganda, is practical and acceptable for use more broadly. We shall assess the content of the programme (e.g. exercise and educational activities), and our ability to teach local practitioners to deliver PR consistently including manuals and educational materials.   This will be achieved through a series of semi-structured interviews and focus groups with practitioners and other key stakeholders.   (ii) the patient engagement is feasible and we will test inclusion criteria, numbers of patients suitable to and willing to enter the programme, strategies of recruitment. We will also examine the extent of engagement in the programme and the numbers prepared to complete outcome measures, and be followed up over time will be assessed via qualitative and quantitative methods.  (iii) the assessment measures will be evaluated to capture not just traditional outcomes used in PR such as walking distance and health status questionnaires but biometrics and patient centred outcomes (for example, impact on social and economic variables) relevant to East Africa. These questions will be addressed during the interviews but also by collecting quantitative data.  In order to deliver the programme expertly, we aim to provide a weeks intensive package of training for the lead physiotherapist in UK, visiting PR programmes and training centres. In order to minimise problems in moving to the full trial we aim to hold a meeting in Kampala with those involved in the development trials and those to be involved in the full trial. The meeting will address the lessons learned, the materials needed to set up PR training hubs and to examine and foresee potential problems and costs.</narrative>
