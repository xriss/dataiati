   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Mobilising Access to Rights for Artists in Morocco (MARAM) will build on and broaden the impact of our innovative GCRF project (&quot;Arts for Advocacy&quot;) in  contributing to debate, shifting opinions, and informing migration policies in Morocco. MARAM (meaning &apos;wish&apos; in Arabic) will foster greater social and institutional recognition for marginal artists (specifically migrants from Africa and the Middle East and Moroccans from disadvantaged communities).  Morocco has become a country of transit and immigration, notably for sub-Saharan migrants fleeing persecution, conflict and economic precariousness, and more recently for those fleeing the war in Syria. Morocco is attempting to implement a new and more inclusive politics of migration, but this has been fraught with contradictions and ongoing violence. As with other progressive reforms across the Middle East and North Africa region (e.g. Arab Spring), activists, artists, migrant leaders and NGO practitioners have increasingly mobilised the arts to advocate for policy changes regarding migration. Researchers and other practitioners often engage with migrant artists, but their specific needs and challenges as both migrants and artists are overlooked. MARAM addresses this gap in collaboration with its Project Partner, Racines, through three objectives:  1. To develop a Toolkit to facilitate the navigation of existing legislation and administrative hurdles by artists based in Morocco;    2. To enhance artistic collaboration and support networks amongst artists based in Morocco, and between artists and cultural professionals;  3. To generate a Manifesto for Artists&apos; Rights to shape policies affecting artists based in Morocco.  In order to broaden the range of user communities, MARAM will work with a new Project Partner, Racines, an association for cultural development in Morocco and Africa. Activities co-designed and co-delivered with Racines in MARAM include: 1) a series of Workshops in which marginal migrant and Moroccan artists based in Morocco will identify challenges to accessing rights, and social and institutional recognition, co-develop solutions, and build capacity; 2) an Artistic Residency Programme in which participants will creatively engage with what it means to be an artist in Morocco; 3) A Forum for stakeholders, decision-makers, and policy-makers to develop a shared vision of future cultural policies in Morocco.     Led by Dr Laura Jeffery (University of Edinburgh) in collaboration with Dr Mariangela Palladino (University of Keele) and Dr S&#xE9;bastien Bachelet (University of Edinburgh) the team consists of researchers from across the humanities and social sciences with experiences in forced displacement, arts-based methods, NGO partnership, knowledge exchange, and capacity building within and beyond the Moroccan context. Through its inclusion of artists and creative professionals in designing and conducting the project, MARAM will deliver short, mid, and long-term impact:  1. MARAM will benefit Morocco-based local and migrant artists by enhancing their capacity as creative professionals trough knowledge and skills (e.g. project development &amp; management, communication, employment rights);  2. MARAM will foster and enhance networks and partnerships in the creative and cultural sector in Morocco;  3. MARAM will contribute to shaping institutional policies at national level in Morocco and help sustain improvements in other ODA countries in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region (see Visual Evidence 1).</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="Mobilising Access to Rights for Artists in Morocco (MARAM) furthers the impact of our ESRC-AHRC (GCRF) project &apos;Arts for Advocacy&apos;. MARAM aims firstly to continue to contribute to debate, influence opinion, and inform migration policy in Morocco, and secondly to address an unforeseen gap in our previous project by fostering greater social and institutional recognition for marginal artists in Morocco (specifically migrants from Africa and the Middle East and Moroccans from disadvantaged communities). MARAM is an innovative project generating long-lasting, sustainable change to enhance artists&apos; rights and access to social, cultural and economic opportunities.  MARAM has 3 interlinked ODA-compliant objectives:   1. To develop a trilingual (Arabic, French, English) Toolkit to facilitate the navigation of existing legislation and administrative hurdles by artists based in Morocco. Through a series of Workshops facilitated by our non-academic Project Partner (Racines), we will generate a Toolkit to assist marginal artists based in Morocco to: a) understand the national policy framework surrounding the status of artists, and b) navigate relevant administrative procedures (e.g. to obtain an artist card, which is an eligibility requirement for accessing Ministry of Culture funds for artistic ventures).  2. To enhance artistic collaboration and support networks amongst artists based in Morocco, and between artists and cultural professionals. In partnership with Racines, MARAM will host an Artistic Residency Programme for marginal migrant and Moroccan artists. As part of the residency, participants will creatively engage with what it means to be an artist in Morocco and will generate creative pieces to be exhibited online and during the Migrant&apos;Sc&#xE8;ne arts and migration festival in Morocco at the end of the project.  3. To generate a trilingual (Arabic, French, English) Manifesto for Artists&apos; Rights to shape policies affecting artists based in Morocco. Through the Workshops co-organised with Racines throughout the Artistic Residency Programme, MARAM will engage participant artists and professionals from the creative sector in Morocco in reflection and debates on artists&apos; status and rights in Morocco. In coordination with Racines, MARAM will run a Forum for stakeholders, decision-makers, and policy-makers to launch the Manifesto with in order to influence and reshape cultural and migration policies in Morocco.    These objectives and related programme of activities will generate transferable outputs (Toolkit, Creative Outputs, Manifesto) with the following short, mid, and long-term impacts:  - Benefit to marginal migrant and Moroccan artists by enhancing their access to rights and their social and institutional recognition;  - Fostering and enhancement of networks and partnerships in the creative and cultural sector in Morocco;  - Shaping institutional policies at national level in Morocco to sustain improvements in other ODA countries in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region."></capital-spend>
