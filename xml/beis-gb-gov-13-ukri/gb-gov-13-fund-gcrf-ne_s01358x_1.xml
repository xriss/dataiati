   <narrative xml:lang="EN">International: A user-friendly tool for effective monitoring and management of forest conservation set-asides in oil palm landscapes</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Our goal is to provide oil palm industry stakeholders in DAC-listed countries with the tools to effectively monitor and manage their forest conservation set-asides. As part of criteria to meet certification standards for sustainability, oil palm growers are required to set aside and manage forests that are important for conservation. Currently, a lack of capacity and standardised guidance for monitoring and managing forest set-asides is a critical barrier to effective conservation in oil palm landscapes. Failure to manage forest set-asides properly puts the credibility of certification standards at risk and threatens market demand for certified palm oil. This will affect future prospects of a sustainable palm oil industry and therefore negatively impact responsible businesses, livelihoods, forests, biodiversity, and carbon emissions.   We have developed and field-tested a simple, paper-based survey tool to monitor forest quality in SE Asia. The survey is a robust proxy for measuring forest quality against a range of independently sampled scientific metrics. To increase the uptake of the survey tool, we propose to develop a smartphone application. This will simplify and speed up data collection, enhance in-field training support, improve the consistency of survey responses, and streamline data aggregation and analysis. Translating monitoring data into meaningful management actions is also crucial to the implementation of successful forest conservation and we will also develop a supporting web-based dashboard for analysis and decision-making.  Specific objectives:  Objective 1: Provide a user-friendly digital survey tool for monitoring forest set-asides that meets end-user requirements Output 1: A prototype smartphone application for conducting surveys in the field, with built-in training and user support, and user-friendly interfaces.  Objective 2: Provide evidence-based decision-support that meets end-user requirements to enable translation of monitoring results to management actions for improving forest quality and conservation  Output 2: A decision-support web dashboard with trend analysis and management recommendations.  Objective 3: Understand the data handling, security and ethics issues in relation to accessing, storing, collating and analysing data centrally to aid auditing and for research purposes. Output 3: A secure and economically robust model for the continued development, uptake and maintenance of the tool beyond the project end.  Objective 4: Understand the extent to which machine learning and integration with other systems (e.g. satellite technology, Global Forest Watch, simplified High Conservation Value assessments for smallholders) can improve survey outputs and decision-making, and expand the potential applications of the tool. Output 4: A funding proposal plan for the further development of the tool post project end.  Milestones: 1) completion of launch workshop with project partners and other stakeholders, 2) completion of initial product prototype, 3) completion of field trials in large estates and smallholder plantations, 4) completion of literature review into forest management and restoration, 5) completion of prototype decision-support dashboard 6) completion of second field trials and end-user consultation, 7) official launch of the digital tool 8) completion of funding proposal plan for the next phase to expand the applications of the tool.  Providing the tools and knowledge for forest monitoring and management will lead to 4 key impacts:  1) Increased capacity to deliver effective environmental management  2) Retention and enhancement of vital biodiversity and ecosystem services within oil palm landscapes 3) A more credible, and therefore economically robust, sustainability standard for the palm oil sector 4) Improved ability for small producers to engage with certification, improving livelihoods.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Tropical forest ecosystems are at risk of clearance for agricultural expansion and the palm oil industry is a key driver of deforestation across the tropics. To tackle this, the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) certification standard requires oil palm growers to set aside and manage forests within their plantations. However, these sites are often managed by companies or smallholder groups that have limited access to knowledge of forest ecology or conservation. A lack of guidance about how to monitor and manage these areas means that the full conservation potential of these policies is not currently being realised.  Assessing and monitoring the quality of forest set asides is vital for applying appropriate management practices. However, existing methods for forest assessment are time-consuming, expensive and/ or require specialist expertise. As a result, monitoring of these forests is often done poorly, inconsistently, or not at all. Small farmers may be prohibited entirely from participating in certification schemes because of the burdens of management and monitoring. Thus, oil palm growers require a robust, inexpensive, quick and easy tool for monitoring forest quality and restoration efforts. They also need the knowledge to effectively interpret and act on the results of monitoring. The RSPO will benefit from a consistent, standardised method which will enable better auditing and assessment of the impact of certification on forest conservation.  NERC-funded research has huge potential to inform the development of simplified conservation tools. As part of PI JML&apos;s NERC Knowledge Exchange fellowship we used data on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning to develop and test a Forest Integrity Assessment (FIA) survey tool for SE Asian forest. Relying only on yes-no answers, with no need for expensive equipment, measurements or taxonomic identification, the survey results of volunteers ranging from post-doctoral researchers to plantation managers revealed strong correlations with a variety of scientific forest quality metrics. These results, combined with positive feedback from non-specialist users of the survey, indicates that the FIA tool is ideal for overcoming the gap between policy and effective implementation.  This project aims to convert the tool from its current paper form to a dynamic smartphone application. The benefits of this include 1) in-app training to improve accuracy, 2) the ability to quickly digitally record and store survey results, 3) improved portability and efficiency in the field, 4) integrated GPS mapping, 5) automated analysis of results 5) in-built decision-support to enable adaptive management.   Digitalisation will provide opportunities to build in further capabilities such as remote sensed information, machine learning, long-term storage, archiving and the ability to expand the product for different regions and sectors. These benefits will transform the usability of the FIA tool, enabling widespread uptake and delivering high quality environmental management.  A robust, evidence-based approach to conservation is necessary to ensure the best outcomes for conservation in vulnerable fragmented forest landscapes. However, the vast body of academic knowledge to inform the development of these approaches is largely inaccessible to end-users. The academic community is thus best placed to deliver this project, in close partnership with the key users of the tool, and in doing so build capacity in forest ecology and conservation expertise within the oil palm industry. Our partners include the RSPO certification standard, one of the largest oil palm growers globally, third sector organisations who work with growers and smallholders to implement sustainable practices, and key academic institutions. This consortium ensures that the tool will be incorporated into policy and guidance at the highest levels, be fit for purpose on the ground, and be supported by the latest world class science.</narrative>
