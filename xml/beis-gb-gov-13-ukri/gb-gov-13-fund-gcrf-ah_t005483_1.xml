  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Our overarching vision for this project is to model equitable and long-lasting working partnerships with research organisations in five low and middle countries (LMICs) - Afghanistan, Colombia, Guatemala, South Sudan and Syria - and strengthen their and our capabilities in regard to the global challenge of understanding the relationship between informal and formal economics in conflict zones and promote more robust research and evidence gathering around these themes. This project will implement a series of five national workshops which will feed into a global workshop to scope out a significant contributing factor to sustainable peace - economic justice and transformation. Set inside a larger funding proposal (GCRF Network Plus), this project will ultimately impact marginalised communities, who often experience economic inequalities connected to conflict and the widespread struggle to understand the interaction of formal and informal economics and what measures lead to sustainable peace. More specifically, this project will enable thematic, methodological and management skills sharing through a series of workshops, virtual capacity-building for partner organisations, and commission scoping exercises to: 1) illuminate context-specific and locally-identified and prioritised themes and issues (related to economic justice) by marginalised people affected by conflict, 2) gather and document local and/or local-language data, literature, commentary and other resources relevant to what economic justice and transformation looks like in specific contexts and 3) map local research institutions and infrastructure. This project will enhance our research network&apos;s ability to strengthen the evidence base for effective and contextually sensitive policies and programmes that prevent conflict and promote economic justice. Project activities are keenly informed by an awareness that global research partnerships have structural, social, material, personal and linguistic issues and exhibit power relations that determine whose knowledge, skills, agendas and values are prioritised. Further, the legacy of historical colonial relationships and current global power dynamics shape each of our five selected contexts and expectations of international development and research partnerships. In response, our proposed activities recognize that partners will have diverse priorities, concerns, schedules and capacities, and that ignoring these differences or assuming that partnerships are built on a level playing field can obstruct effective ways of working and limit our transformative capacity. Thus, this project has been conceived of and developed in partnership with project partners in the five selected LMICs, including five local offices of the international NGO Christian Aid along with a selection of their partner NGOs with whom Christian Aid has already established and nurtured relationships. The input of these organisations has directly shaped our project activities and will amplify project impact due to the knowledge, skills and experience that each partner brings.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This Development Award will build strong international collaboration and its primary aim is to create a strong foundation for equitable and sustainable research partnerships that will underpin our Network Plus proposal. Further, this project aims to strengthen the evidence base for effective and contextually sensitive policies and programmes that prevent conflict and promote economic justice.  This project&apos;s objectives are: Objective 1: Enable the co-development and co-design of the research agenda underpinning the Network Plus proposal on &quot;Preventing conflict in fragile countries through understanding and promoting economic justice&quot; so that it reflects LMIC contexts and the needs of proposed research beneficiaries. Cross-cutting research development: This Development Award will commission a series of national and global workshops that connect LMIC partners nationally and internationally in order to develop a joint research agenda and build sustainable national and international research networks. National workshops will enable more inclusive engagement with a variety of stakeholders and make sure key issues such as research and partnership ethics are explored in local languages and with local contexts in mind. We will ensure that participation is representative of different genders, ethnic groups and conflict-affected communities at both the national and global workshops and consideration will be given to barriers to participation and intersectionality. Objective 2: Develop the foundation for fair and equitable partnerships underpinning the Network Plus by exploring skills, experience, interests, agreeing roles and responsibilities, ways of working and mutual capacity exchanges.   Network Plus-specific development issues: Along with the focus on equitable partnerships within the national and global workshops, our Network Plus will facilitate sustained engagement on equitable partnerships, with expertise drawn from partners in the South in an equitable way. Consideration will be given to power, structural inequalities and the legacies of colonialism. Needs will be identified by southern partners with an emphasis on equitable South-to-North and South-to-South knowledge transfer and capacity-building. Partnerships developed in the Development Award will be expanded in future funding proposals. Objective 3: Develop measures to ensure equal and meaningful opportunities for people of different genders and vulnerabilities in our Network Plus proposal. Our partner Women and Peace Studies Organisation (Afghanistan) and a Christian Aid dedicated advisor on gender and inequalities will both play a role in providing specific gender expertise. Both will lead on sharing skills, experiences, and training in gender analysis with other partners in our network - all with an awareness of Do No Harm gender sensitivity guidelines. Objective 4: Enable a sustained process of engagement, collaboration and legacy through stronger national networks linked to global networks interested in the key issues identified in the Network Plus.   Sustainable legacy development activities: A series of research activities over 12 months will strengthen our research network and contribute to the knowledge base for the themes of our Network Plus proposal. These research activities will be sustainable as stand-alone activities but also inform the Commissioning Strand 2 of our Network Plus proposal. In order to fulfil our aims and objectives, this Development Award will draw upon the findings of the Rethinking Research Collaborative, and will be informed by principles of equitable partnership such as putting poverty first, critically engaging with context, challenging assumptions about evidence, being adaptive and responsive, being transparent, investing in relationships, and ongoing learning.</narrative>
