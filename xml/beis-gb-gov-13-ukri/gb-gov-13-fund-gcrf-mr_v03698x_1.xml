   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Non communicable diseases (NCDs) such as diabetes, hypertension and heart disease are the leading causes of death in Low and Middle Income Countries (LMICs). Caribbean women, urban dwellers and the poor are more likely to have NCDs and a greater burden of NCD risk factors such as obesity, physical inactivity and unhealthy diet.  The recent control measures to limit the spread of COVID-19 in many LMICs interfered with daily routines and food systems. While some control measures such as limiting sale of alcohol and closure of fast food restaurants might have potential benefits on NCDs, these may be counterbalanced by limited access to fresh fruits and vegetables and a tendency to consume unhealthy stored/preserved foods. Additionally, stress, working from home, increased screen time (computer and TV) and boredom also create a change in sleep, physical activity and other NCD related lifestyle practices.  In this study we will examine how control measures used in 3 Caribbean islands affected the health and lifestyle practices of people living with NCDs, particularly women, the poor and those living in urban vs rural communities. By understanding the effects of COVID-19 control measures on NCD risk factors (lifestyle practices), mental health, metabolic health (blood sugar and cholesterol) and physical measurements (blood pressure and weight), LMIC governments can use their limited resources to better care for persons with NCDs during national crises and respond better to future COVID-19 and other infectious disease outbreaks.</narrative>
