   <narrative xml:lang="EN">My goal is to secure a permanent position in academia to become a leading criminologist researcher influencing social and drug policies that prevent factors conducive to violence and crime. The ESRC GCRF Fellowship would maximise my opportunity of achieving this as I would acquire essential training, mentoring and research experience in one year. My objectives for the duration of the Fellowship are:  1. Implement impact strategy to disseminate doctoral research findings through academic channels (peer-reviewed, journal articles, conference papers, book chapter) and to engage with user audience by organising community-based events (workshops and group meetings) in Mexico.  2. Promote and encourage research development capacity for postgraduate students based at three Mexican universities and institutes through seminar programmes and workshops.  3. Develop research and organisational capacity through Early Career Development Portfolio and Contract Researcher training sessions within the School of Law.  4. To address gaps in producing high-profile publications, grant writing, and developing impact by working alongside, and with the support of, an experienced researcher and mentor, and the wider team of experienced socio-legal researchers at the University of Edinburgh.  5. Advance criminological knowledge in the field of organised crime by producing interdisciplinary research using development frameworks applied in post-conflict studies.  6. Build relationships within academic institutions, research clusters, think tanks and third sector organisations in Mexico, US and the UK to ensure long term career development.  7. Enhance academic profile by attending University&apos;s Postgraduate Certificate Learning &amp; Teaching in Higher Education programme and developing original research-led teaching on the MSc programme within the School of Law.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed research draws on my pioneering doctoral research to seek an alternative approach in tackling the  drug problem around U.S.-Mexico border communities. The idea emerges at a time when Latin American countries such as Mexico, begin to recognise the high socioeconomic burden and human cost of ineffective and pernicious drug policies. The drug trafficking phenomenon is a serious security challenge that has obstructed development in Mexico in the last two decades and begs for new approaches to address the problem. My research successfully extended a state crime perspective, to a new context to explicate the experience of border communities at the centre of an unprecedented violent drug conflict in which multiple state actors were active or complicit on both sides of the conflict. Key findings evidence that state security operations involving militarised police operations to fight drug trafficking organisations have not only failed to address the problem around the U.S.-Mexico border communities, but exacerbate and engender violence. Through its provision of a more nuanced theoretical understanding of the drug problem blighting everyday life for border communities, my research findings have significant potential to enhance practical strategies to address this problem. An important first-step towards this would be funding for a follow-up research study to explore the potential application of development frameworks common in studies of post-conflict settings, but hitherto absent from criminology as an alternative to the security approaches. I propose to conduct a short fieldwork trip to Juarez where I will collect data through semi-structured interviews with staff members based at non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and civic community councils (CCCs) in Juarez. Also, academics from the two institutions I plan to visit in Juarez will be recruited as research participants. All individuals will be then invited to take part in the community-based events. These events will be research impact workshops and meeting groups where I will share findings with user groups. The purpose of the follow-up research is to a) identify the current problems and challenges set as priorities by third sector organisations and b) to examine the extent to which the work of these organisations address local community needs. An analysis of the post-conflict situation in Juarez contributes to a better understanding of the basic development needs of drug war torn border communities that will inform the working agendas of NGOs and CCCs on the ground and indeed, inform policy makers decisions in formulating drug policies. After conducting this follow-up study I plan to visit academic institutions in Mexico City and Aguascalientes where there  is significant interest within academic circles in understanding insecurities caused by organised crime and the effectiveness of government responses.  A second series of institution visits will take place in the US, specifically in El Paso, Flagstaff. The universities in these  locations have been selected carefully in order to maximise the potential of building international networks.  Across all six academic institutions I&apos;ll have an excellent opportunity to communicate my doctoral findings  with academic audiences as it will cultivate a variety of capacity development and knowledge exchange prospects. Finally, I&apos;ll be based at Edinburgh University for nine months where I aim to further develop my early academic career as a recent doctorate graduate. I plan to fully engage in training sessions offered within the School of Law through Early Career Development Portfolio and Contract Researcher Programme. As the work plan in this proposal shows I will  be addressing the current gaps in my academic profile (producing publications and developing impact) by working alongside, and with the support of, my mentor and experienced socio-legal researchers at the Edinburgh Law School.</narrative>
