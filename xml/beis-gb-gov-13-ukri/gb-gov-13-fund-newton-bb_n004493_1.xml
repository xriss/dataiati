  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Fusarium head blight (FHB), caused mainly by the Ascomycete fungus Fusarium graminearum, is one of the most serious and hazardous crop diseases worldwide. Wheat crops are particularly prone to FHB if rain prevails during anthesis. The main consequence of FHB is that trichothecene mycotoxins, such as deoxynivalenol (DON), accumulate in the grain, presenting a food safety risk and health hazard to humans and animals. Despite considerable breeding efforts, FHB-resistant wheat cultivars have not been obtained, two decades of fungicide trials have yielded only modest crop protection strategies, and altering agricultural practices have failed to reduce inoculum levels. In Southern Brazil, the UK, the EU, USA, China, Africa and elsewhere, severe FHB epidemic years occur at a minimum every 4th or 5th year. However, even moderate FHB years are highly problematic for farmers and the entire food and feed global commodities supply chains. As a consequence, legal limits have been set on the permitted DON levels in grain used for different purposes.   In this project, we intend to take a novel whole fungal genome and disease modelling guided approach, to start to develop a pipeline of genetically modified wheat genotypes harbouring T-DNA constructs that can silence genes in F. graminearum critical for the wheat infection process by a process called host-induced gene silencing (HIGS). We also intend to determine the plant and fungal mechanisms that control the HIGS phenomenon.  HIGS could be used to control multiple pathogens.  In the pump-priming year, we intend to pursue five inter-related research work-packages (WPs) that will each deliver on specific objectives. A 6th work-package covers the hosting of UK and Brazil workshops, training periods and writing activities that will be needed to form an effective consortium that will jointly develop the full proposal based on existing and newly generated data and knowledge.  The five research objectives to be pursued are as follows:  1. To advance the model-based framework for integrating our understanding on the pathogen-host-environment interactions.  From a pilot experiment, a new data type will be generated and incorporated. Namely, airborne Fusarium spore populations prevalent in Passo Fundo in 2013,  2014 and 2015 disease seasons, will be determined using stored tapes from an air suction trap and various species and gene specific qPCR analyses.   2. To develop a F. graminearum candidate gene target list to inform a possible intervention using a GM wheat approach.  We intend to obtain full genome sequence information from FHB disease causing isolates recently collected in Rio Grande and Parana states. The genomes of the 24 selected isolates will be assembled, annotated and the core set of genes present in all strains computationally identified. A series of additional analyses will be done to generate an initial list of candidate fungal target genes and to ensure that these sequences are not present in wheat or other non-target beneficial species.  3. To develop various T-DNA based constructs to silence F. graminearum gene expression by si-RNA and HIGS and thereby control Fusarium infection.  We will pilot a transient assay system.  In addition, a lead T-DNA construct will be designed to silence simultaneously three F. graminearum gene, this will be transformed into a UK wheat cultivar and the resulting transgenic plant population (20-30 plants) molecularly characterised.    4. To understand the underlying mechanisms to achieve HIGS in F. graminearum and the related species F. culmorum.  We will conduct hypothesis driven experiments in tobacco and Arabidopsis using lines harbouring specific constructs/ single gene mutations and evaluate a F. graminearum strain that lacks functional dicer genes.   5. To harmonise existing wheat and fusarium protocols and methodologies and further evaluate the use of NIR to quantify wheat grain quality and levels of DON mycotoxin contamination.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In total, 22 researchers are involved in this project, 12 in Brazil and 10 in the UK. Ten are EMBRAPA employees located at Trigo, Passo Fundo (5), agricultural informatics, Campinas (1), soybean, Londrina (1) and Cenargen, Brasilia (3). The two additional Brazilian scientists are University based (Vicosa and Maringa). The UK scientists are located at Rothamsted Research (RRes) in the department of Plant Biology and Crop Science (9) and Applied Bioinformatics (1).  The assembled team has highly complementary skills, which are required to deliver the initial project objectives and to develop the joint studies required to deliver the full project. The skills needed to deliver on the six work packages (WPs) proposed are as follows:  WP1: Phytopathology and modelling, specialising in Fusarium head blight (FHB)-wheat (Fernandes, Del Ponte and Tessmann), epidemiology, diagnostics and air dispersal of various pathogens including wheat infecting Fusaria (West).  WP2: Plant, animal and fungal bioinformatics and protein modelling (Martins and Togawa), plant and pathogen genomics (King and Hammond-Kosack).  WP3: T-DNA design, stable plant transformation, analysis of transformants (Huttly, Lee and Jones), transient wheat transformation (Lau), transgenic plant analyses (Bonato). Designing/conducting GM wheat field trials in Brazil (Nepomuceno) and UK (Jones).   WP4: Functional genomics/genetics and plant biotechnology, including Host induced gene silencing (HIGS) and si-RNA of Fusarium graminearum (Fg) in tobacco (Arag&#xE3;o), wheat and Arabidopsis (Kanyuka, Hammond-Kosack). Fungal molecular genetics and Fg transformation (Urban).  WP5: FHB disease assessments in controlled environment and/ or the field (Lima, Urban, Brown, Machado), mycotoxin quantification (Tibola and Urban), near-infrared reflectance analysis of wheat grain quality (Tibola), digital imaging processing (Barbedo).   WP6: Grant proposal and report writing - all, either as a team or as an individual.  This project requires the use of specific resources. These include the already well characterised cereal infecting fusarium isolate collections obtained from previous wheat crops grown Rio Grande and Parana States in South Brazil. The working prototype FHB-wheat prediction model developed for South Brazil. Advanced bioinformatics pipelines established at RRes for Fg genome assembly and annotation, and at Brasilia for elimination of non-target organism effects. The highly efficient wheat transformation facility only available at RRes. The protected GM field trial site at RRes and equivalent GM trial sites in South Brazil. The licensed containment growth room facilities in place at Cenargen and RRes for exploring HIGS and si-RNA mechanisms using various transgenic plant species in combination with transgenic Fusarium reporter strains. Finally, the unique near infrared resonance analysis facility for grain analysis is only available in Passo Fundo.  The four EMBRAPA institutes, two Brazilian Universities and RRes each have well developed scientific infrastructures in place to expedite the experimentation proposed, the data capture, analyses and storage required and the regular communication needed by Skype, e-mail and by using secure data exchange sites.  The proposed project will be closely aligned with activities under the new UK-Brazil partnership for Yield Stability and Protection in a Changing Climate (PYSP). PYSP is part-funded by a Newton-fund joint centre award and is jointly coordinated by RRes and EMBRAPA. This project will be integrated within PYSP activities, ensuring there is adequate coordination of exchange activities with minimal duplication and maximum engagement between different groups from EMBRAPA and research groups at RRes. PYSP will provide a central focus for all RRes/ EMBRAPA activities, thereby strengthening links across projects and ensuring greater impact for all joint research undertaken.</narrative>
