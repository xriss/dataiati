   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Intimate partner violence is a crucial human rights, development and public health issue, with one in three women worldwide reporting physical and/or sexual intimate partner violence. The prevalence of intimate partner violence is particularly high in the Southern and Eastern Africa, where 39 to 46% of women report intimate partner violence during their lifetime. Despite increasing evidence for the worsened health as a result of partner violence, little is known about how to prevent it. Economic empowerment may be a solution, but research has shown mixed evidence for how (if at all) it improves women&apos;s experience of intimate partner violence or reduces men&apos;s perpetration. It is particularly important to understand the dynamics of economic empowerment and partner violence in sub-Saharan Africa in order to design effective interventions and improve health across the continent. We will explore the extent to which economic empowerment is associated with intimate partner violence, what forms of economic empowerment are crucial to reduce intimate partner violence, how men&apos;s access to resources influences male perpetration of partner violence and how economic and empowerment changes affect the occurrence of intimate partner violence. We propose to empirically examine these enduring questions using our team&apos;s existing data from trials we are conducting in Tanzania and South Africa. Data from a rural (Tanzania) and an urban (South Africa) studies will investigate how different forms of economic empowerment affect women&apos;s experience and men&apos;s perpetration of intimate partner violence. Additional qualitative data from Tanzania and South Africa will explore what &quot;power&quot; in economic empowerment interventions and programme actually means to women and how economic empowerment affects their relationship and their experiences of intimate partner violence. These two case study countries will inform a deeper analysis using data from the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) of 21 countries in sub-Saharan Africa, namely Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Congo Democratic Republic, Cote d&apos;Ivore, Gabon, Gambia, Ghana, Kenya, Liberia, Malawi, Mali, Mozambique, Namibia, Nigeria, Rwanda, South Africa, Tanzania, Togo, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe. The DHS analysis will be able to investigate the association between economic empowerment factors and intimate partner violence beyond the individual levels to also explore community level factors that might contribute to intimate partner violence and map these associations graphically. Lastly, longitudinal analysis of the Tanzanian and South African trials will provide evidence for how changes in economic status and empowerment influence women&apos;s experience and men&apos;s use of partner violence.  Lessons from this proposal will guide the field towards interventions that are tailored to reduce intimate partner violence through economic empowerment, but also considering other factors in the ecological framework. The research team will work closely with the World Health Organisation and existing DFID consortia to reduce violence against women as a method to ensure insights are translated into global policy. We will also work with local governments and non-governmental organisations to share the knowledge generated by this proposed research to ensure that women and men are offered tailored economic empowerment interventions that will help them to live a life free of violence. Our team of emerging researchers from the United Kingdom, Tanzania, and South Africa will deepen existing expertise through tailored training opportunities and ongoing interdisciplinary collaboration. With support from the ESRC Secondary Analysis Call, our team will be in a position to apply our secondary evidence towards a novel intervention for reducing partner violence in Tanzania and South Africa.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="Intimate partner violence is known to impact women, children and families, it has significant physical and mental health consequences and carries high costs to communities and the wider society. The knowledge on what works to prevent intimate partner violence has improved significantly and it is understood that intimate partner violence is a probabilistic event that is influenced by factors at different levels of the human ecology (individual, relational, household and community). However, key &apos;enduring questions&apos; remain unanswered, particularly around economic empowerment. For example, we know little about how relative resources in the household frame violence. Moreover, literature around women&apos;s employment and microcredit offer conflicting evidence in terms of their relationship with partner violence - with some showing protective elements of these programs and others suggesting increased risk.  The aim of the proposed research is to generate new knowledge and further our understanding of the effect of economic empowerment on the occurrence of intimate partner violence in sub-Saharan Africa. Using mixed-methods data from studies led by our team, we will answer the following research questions:   1. To what extend is intimate partner violence associated with women&apos;s economic empowerment in sub-Saharan Africa?  2. What types of women&apos;s economic empowerment inform intimate partner violence outcomes in sub-Saharan Africa?  3. What role does men&apos;s access to economic resources play in perpetrating or reducing intimate partner violence? 4. How do changes in women&apos;s economic circumstances affect intimate partner violence?"></capital-spend>
