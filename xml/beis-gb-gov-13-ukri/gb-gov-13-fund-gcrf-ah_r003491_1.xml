   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Gender equality is of central importance to progress within an increasingly global world, but gender roles and attitudes to gender shaped centuries ago continue to influence cultural, social and economic behaviour, and to affect decision making at a local level. This is the case even where equal opportunity policies and rhetoric pertain at a national or corporate level. Too often, policy commitments to equal opportunities for women and rhetorical statements of the importance of women&apos;s contribution to society mask real-life behaviours that inhibit women&apos;s advancement; indirectly, if not directly reinforce women&apos;s subordinate position; and translate multicultural anxieties into conflicts over gender roles and behaviours.   This project offers a unique approach. It is not only multi-organisational, multinational, and multi-disciplinary, but also places theoretical concepts of gender, particularly that of intersectionality, in dialogue both with artistic expression and representation and with the experiences of professionals who make on-the-ground interventions (as teachers, volunteer trainers, academic leaders, those in charge of arts organisations). The interchanges between these strands enable theory to inform, but also to be tested against the expressive and experiential. In the process, public awareness of the complexities of gender issues, particularly within complex social and cultural, and sometimes multi-cultural, contexts can raise awareness about the expectations associated with women&apos;s place in the community while helping to refine current feminist theories of intersectionality. The project facilitates comparative discussions, exposing individual researchers to the possibilities implicit in alternative disciplinary and theoretical methodologies, different cultural frameworks, and diverse historical periods.  The intellectual frameworks developed as part of Second and Third Wave feminism for understanding the dynamics of women&apos;s subordination, together with critiques of subaltern status developed as part of postcolonial perspectives have provided women with a set of methodological tools for responding to consciously perpetuated gender discrimination. These movements have also provided the means of exposing both institutionalised sexism and the assumptions and unexamined preconceptions that unconsciously naturalise women&apos;s subordinate position, often generating hostility when women assume positions of power. Intersectionality has emerged as a promising paradigm for addressing the complexities of compounded social marginalisation, but it is a concept born within a particular socio-historical context. As a result, it needs to be interrogated, translated, and transformed if its potential utility is to be fully realised. Local factors such as caste, which the current framework struggles to fully articulate and analyse, pose a challenge to this and other universalised models and modes of feminist theorising. Understanding and acknowledging this challenge is an important precursor both to refining the concept and to supporting successful interventions-- be they local, national, or international in origin.   The project will strengthen and extend the collaborative activities of four partner institutions dedicated to harnessing research for social change. It will develop support networks among women within academia in both India and the UK, furthering the interests of gender equality within Higher Education and beyond. The project will produce material outputs including documentaries, piloted English Language Teaching resources and volunteer training materials, and the creative reflections of an artist in residence. A volume of selected essays on &quot;Interrogating Intersectionality&quot; is envisaged that would help to clarify the theoretical and methodological issues, possibilities and current limitations of the concept.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="The project seeks to interrogate, refine, and develop current feminist theories of intersectionality in ways that enhance its utility when dealing with complex socio-cultural dynamics in specific local settings. India becomes a test case of its descriptive and analytical power. There has always been a dialectical relationship between theory and practice within the development of feminist thought; theoretical frameworks suggest and support strategic interventions that aim to make a real difference in people&apos;s lives. This project uses the expertise and will for social change within four partner institutions-Liverpool Hope University; Christ University, Bangaluru; FACT, Liverpool; and Bluecoat, Liverpool-to engage issues around gender identity and gender equality in ways that have transformative potential. It brings together small-scale initiatives already under development at Christ and facilitates the expansion and the extension of their field of operation by building a collaborative network across institutions dedicated to public engagement and social justice in Higher Education and within the Creative Arts.  Because our network is both international and multi- and interdisciplinary, and because it includes members drawn from the Creative Arts community and those engaged with education beyond the higher education sector, academic debates on gender construction will inform both professional practice and creative productions. At the same time, lived experiences and complex artistic expressions will test the limitations of current theoretical frameworks, particularly those involving intersectionality. The project foregrounds issues of gender construction and gender equality in ways that raise public awareness, prompt public debate, and sensitise future leaders to the assumptions, stereotypes, and discourses that underwrite and perpetuate inequality within particular cultural and social contexts.   We will build interdisciplinary research capacity at Christ University and beyond in India and will enrich the research and cultural environment in Liverpool and Bangaluru. We seek to support and develop the next generation of scholars, artists, and practitioners whose work is related to the field of gender studies, providing leadership training through PGR conferences, dissemination conferences, and leadership workshops. Such events focus attention on issues of gender equality and on the invisible restrictions that can limit women&apos;s aspirations and achievement. These events help women to build both research networks and virtual communities for mutual support and problem solving.   Because the media and creative industries can either help to perpetuate attitudes that underwrite gender inequalities or counter stereotypes, destabilise expectations, and question assumptions, we engage directly with professionals and creative artists, encouraging them to reflect on the potential and limitations of intersectionality as currently formulated and to develop strategies and public facing activities capable of using the media and creative industries already present in communities to instil greater public awareness of gender issues and gender equality.  The project captures evidence of the diversity of women&apos;s lives in India and works with professionals in teacher training and community work to develop and pilot training materials for teachers and volunteers. Guides and resources will be constructed to help teachers incorporate gender sensitive language and texts into the curriculum; these will highlight the importance of gender sensitivity and suggest strategies for dealing with texts that incorporate biased gender expectations and stereotypes. Influencing teachers and students helps to build a future in which greater gender equality enables women to contribute more fully and equitably."></capital-spend>
