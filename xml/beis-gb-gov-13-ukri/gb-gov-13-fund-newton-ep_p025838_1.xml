   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Newton Fund (Invitation Only) - Dearman liquid air TRU systems for cold chain in India</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The International Institute of Refrigeration (IIR) estimates that 200m tonnes of perishable produce could be preserved if the developing world had the same level of cold chain as the developed world, this accounts for up to 40% of crops harvested in India. The lack of cold chain infrastructure in India, particularly the lack of transport refrigeration (TRUs) for the safe transport of food must be addressed to reduce the losses. India&apos;s National Centre for Cold-chain Development has stated that India requires a further 52,000 TRUs simply to catch up with current production, excluding any future growth. This innovative industrial research project will optimise the proven zero-emission, affordable, novel Dearman transport refrigeration system technology, focusing on the liquid nitrogen tank, for the Indian market. The project will be completed by five core beneficiaries with the support of an advisory partner who will review project aims and achievements on a quarterly basis. The research into the LiN tank design will look at novel ways of dealing with the expected high levels of boil off if a standard tank is used. Using the current configuration would lead to reduced operating times and increased fill frequencies - the new design will look to minimise these issues and develop a new tank design to reduce the sloshing of liquid nitrogen using fluid flow analysis and modelling and mechanical design optimisation. This will achieve a new product optimised for the Indian market that could pave the way for a new commercial product and IP in the form of new patents. The proposed project will be conducted in collaboration with our academic partner, Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (IITB), conducted in parallel to the other work packages lead by our Industrial partners Dearman, Artic Refrigeration, Cartwright and ColdEX. UoB will lead the mechanical design and optimisation of the LiN tank as described in WP6 and will contribute to the fluid flow analysis and modelling. The tank technologies developed at Birmingham will be supported by state-of-the-art facilities housed within the EPSRC funded Birmingham Centre for Cryogenic Energy Storage including a range of measurement and analytical facilities, UoB&apos;s BLUEBear high performance computing facilities and the Government/ INNOVATE UK funded Institute for Thermal Energy Manufacturing Accelerator (part of the Thermal-Energy Research Accelerator, T-ERA).</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed research will address the urgent need for green transport refrigeration technology in India using novel Dearman clean, cold and power technology. To enable the roll out of the Dearman engine TRU, the broad aim of this project will be to optimise the system for the Indian market to allow for fast commercial roll out and an early entry point to support Indian requirements to grow the cold chain. More specifically, a key issue in applying the Dearman technology to India is the on-vehicle LiN tank design. It will be essential to ensure that it can deal with both the road quality and ambient temperature changes (through the year and also across geographical locations). The objectives to meet this aim are to: - Benchmark current tank performance against road conditions and varying ambient conditions, in terms of observations of fluid flow and sloshing, boil off within the tank, engine operating times and fill frequencies. - Develop novel numerical models to predict transient fluid flows within the tank based on a variety of environmental conditions. The models will be validated against the experimental data generated from the benchmark tests. - Apply TRIZ methodologies to the mechanical design of the tank, incorporating an assessment structural characteristics and materials for strength, weight and ambient temperature optimisation. Fluid control measures will also be incorporated into the design, based on the outputs of the fluid flow analysis. - Assess manufacturing methods for composite layup and production. A series of tests will be performed on simplified samples to establish material properties from characterisation tests. - Analyse the structural integrity of the new tank with the development of a series robust finite element models to simulate transient, shock and steady state running conditions. - Optimise fluid control measures to minimise sloshing of liquid nitrogen in the new tank design using fluid flow analysis and modelling. Contrast predicted performance of concept tank against benchmark data from a UK standard tank.</narrative>
