   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Breast cancer (BC) is the commonest cancer in Malaysia. Women in rural areas present with advanced cancer and experience poor survival due to low awareness about symptoms and low participation in BC screening. This project aims to harness the lessons from our previous successful study in Malaysia and the methods of implementation science to develop and evaluate a community education and navigation programme (CENP) that will improve the early detection and diagnosis of BC among rural women. The study will be conducted in Segamat district, Johor State in consultation with local stakeholders and with the support of the South East Asia Community Observatory (SEACO), an established Health &amp; Demographic Surveillance Site. The immediate beneficiaries will be women and families in local rural communities in Malaysia. Our project will benefit rural communities by increasing public awareness about warning signs and symptoms and, more specifically, by navigating women to breast cancer screening. The CENP will identify and counter emotional barriers, dispel misbeliefs and prompt help-seeking behaviour thereby enhancing cancer prevention and leading, where appropriate, to early diagnosis and treatment. Our project via improved prevention and earlier diagnosis will reduce the burden including the personal, financial and psychosocial burden that is experienced by many women and their families as well as the resource burden to the health care system and the wider societal economic consequences for Malaysia. In addition, our project will collaborate with primary care physicians in order to improve their understanding further about the community in which they serve, embed patient navigation in community and primary care services and expedite referral of suspected cases. Furthermore, the project will capacity build&apos; to the benefit of rural communities, NGOs, public health researchers and academics by enhancing knowledge and educational materials and related skills regarding cancer.</narrative>
