   <narrative xml:lang="EN">GCRF Urban Violence &amp; Climate Change Network</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The aim of the network is to promote new understanding and learning about the interactions between urban violence and climate change risks in urban areas of the global South. Such risks are increasingly urbanised, convergent and growing development challenges, negatively affecting the livelihoods, mobility and well-being of the most marginalised urban communities. Bringing together dedicated consideration of the interface between urban violence and urban climate change research and practice for the first time, the project aims to focus in particular on &apos;non-conflict&apos; violence, or the multiple and growing forms of political and inter-personal urban violence that arise within cities themselves. Following this, the objectives of the project are: 1. To structure and deepen a new inter-disciplinary research agenda co-produced between researchers, policy-makers and practitioners about the inter-linkages between climate and violence-related risks in urban areas.  2. To leverage a community of practice for learning about local-level, innovative and participatory interventions working to reduce risks in violence and climate-change affected urban contexts. Small-scale experiments by practitioners to reduce both violence and climate-change risks through urban disaster risk reduction or peace-building interventions are reported, but without systematic review of what works, and under what conditions. Local-level operational tools such as Vulnerability and Capacities Analysis and conflict-sensitivity approaches may need refining for these contexts. Through the network these experiences can be more robustly drawn together to learn, innovate and identify research needs and gaps. 3. To raise the policy profile of the importance of considering urban violence-climate linkages, and the practical and ethical ramifications of the issues for policy and governance, in high-level global debates across the climate change, security and development policy communities as well as with municipal governments and their networks. We aim to generate a more multi-scale, inclusive approach to understanding the climate-adaptation-security nexus in cities, re-orienting security debates towards a grounded understanding of development concerns in urban areas, and climate-adaptation debates towards stronger recognition of the institutional complexities of implementation, as well as possible strategies for more effective urban vulnerability reduction. 4. To underpin the activities above with the development of concepts for thinking and approaches to action that derive from South-South knowledge exchange (rather than the application of Northern-based theory and practice alone).   5. To catalyse new networks and ideas for future funding bids in this area, with the network supporting at least one major follow-on grant application.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Violence and climate change risks in the global South are increasingly urbanised, convergent and growing development challenges, negatively affecting the livelihoods, mobility and well-being of the most marginalised urban communities. Both urban violence and climate change impacts in cities also have economic costs, which affect overall development outcomes. Non-conflict violence in particular - spanning several forms of violence including gang violence, sectarian conflict, landlord-tenant conflicts and gender-based / intersectional violence - accounts for the largest share of the global burden of armed violence and is in large part urban. However, its implications have not been fully understood in the context of the climate change impacts and responses affecting urban areas. Urbanisation in developing countries is driving up climate-related risks and vulnerabilities across a spectrum of hazards, while climate adaptation and mitigation responses are now taking place in ways that alter urban socio-ecological systems. Without explicit consideration of violence-related risks, climate change programmes may exacerbate urban violence, or simply not reach vulnerable areas. Conversely, greater synergy of response in urban planning practices to address public security and climate change vulnerability - through the design of public spaces or public health interventions - can support human development gains. All the countries included in the network face the development challenge of ensuring safe, sustainable and inclusive urban development occurs now and into the future, and without which they will not be able to achieve their Sustainable Development Goals.   Researchers and practitioners working on urban climate change and those working on urban violence have had little opportunity to connect agendas. As a result, we lack understanding of how the two phenomena relate in peoples&apos; livelihoods and influence respective initiatives for risk reduction. The aim of the network is to address this gap through research and practice change, in order to reduce the vulnerabilities of marginalised urban groups. Working across cities in Brazil, Honduras, Kenya, Jordan, Sudan, Pakistan, India, and Sri Lanka, the network will support inter-disciplinary workshops with researchers, local and international civil society organisations, municipal governments and networks and international agencies. These will define a future research agenda. The network will also support related practitioner learning through stronger exchange about initiatives to address climate risks and peace building in urban contexts. This will involve webinars, the development of website resources and a practitioner exchange forum. Finally, the network will support participation of network members in major global policy debates about urban security, climate change and development, to raise the policy profile of the importance of considering urban violence-climate linkages, and the practical and ethical implications of the issues for policy and governance. The network will be led by the Institute of Business Administration, Pakistan, supported by the University of Nottingham, working in strong collaboration with university and non-academic partners in focal cities of the global South. The envisaged outcomes of the network are the clear articulation of a new research agenda (reflected in new collaborations, grant bids, publications and contributions to the global evidence base) alongside a new forum for practitioner learning and the enhanced debate of relevant issues amongst municipal governments and international agencies.</narrative>
