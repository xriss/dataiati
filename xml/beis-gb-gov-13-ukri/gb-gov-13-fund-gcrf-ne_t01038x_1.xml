  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Context Nearly 1 bn people live in mountain landscapes within developing countries. Living with the impacts of multiple hazards in mountainous regions, such as monsoon rainfall, earthquakes and landsliding, is for many a day-to-day reality. Both the short- and long-term impacts of hazards are often exaggerated by their concurrent or sequential timing, and by the socio-political context in which they occur. This context results from fragmented government, rapid population change, and the very localized impacts of global (geo)political interests. As a result, hazards have recurring and disproportionate impacts on some of the most vulnerable members of society. While much research has been conducted on both the socio-political context and the individual hazards and risks that people face, this work is rarely used for disaster risk management.   Aims &amp; objectives To tackle this, we build on our existing long-standing collaborations with the aim of examining how best to develop and use new interdisciplinary science to help inform better decision making and reduce the impacts of multi-hazards in mountain countries. We focus on Nepal, which has many similarities to other lower-income countries that endure complex multi-hazards resulting from earthquakes and monsoon rainfall as well as emerging systemic risks. Nepal is also undergoing complex  social, political and economic transformation associated with a change to a federal system of government and changing geopolitical pressures, all within a hazardous yet densely populated landscape.  The objectives of our research are each designed to make a significant difference to the ways in which residents, government, and the international community take decisions to manage multi-hazards and systemic risks. They include:  (1) Thinking critically about our current understanding of the social, political, economic and environmental context within which disasters occur in Nepal, and the data that we use to assess that context;  (2) Establishing a new approach to national-scale strategic-planning for complex multi-hazard events, which includes the consequences of linked earthquakes, monsoons and landslides;  (3) Developing interdisciplinary science to anticipate, plan for, and communicate the range of hazards that occur during the monsoon; and  (4) Finding the best ways to utilise local knowledge and interdisciplinary science to inform how to prepare for and respond to multi-hazard disasters.  Potential applications and benefit To achieve our objectives, we bring together a team of Nepali and international researchers from a range of disciplines, including geoscience, social science and the humanities, who have track records in various facets of this issue. Together, we aim to: (1) develop new fundamental data and evidence to underpin decision-making, (2) establish pathways for getting the best possible information to those who need it, in a format and timeframe that are useful and usable, (3) think critically about how multi-hazards and risks can be effectively managed, and (4) nurture an environment that supports the young researchers and practitioners who will be the future of disaster risk management in Nepal.  We ground our proposal within the context of our long-term community-based work with rural residents in Nepal, and reflect upon their articulations of the need to make better decisions to reduce the risks that they face. We also build upon our work on managing risks with the Government of Nepal and the United Nations, who coordinate disaster planning in the country. The Government, UN, and major development and humanitarian organisations have been involved from the outset in developing this proposal to ensure an agile, joined-up, evidence-based approach to multi-hazard and risk management.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The aim of our research is to improve decision-making and preparedness in order to mitigate the impacts and reduce the risks from the mountain hazard chain in Nepal. Our proposal builds on long-standing research and practitioner collaborations in Nepal, an ODA recipient and DAC lower income country, as an exemplar of mountainous lower-income countries facing complex multi-hazards in the context of wider transformational change.  Our objectives are structured around four research needs identified by national and international organisations responsible for managing multi-hazards across the development and humanitarian sectors in Nepal and, most importantly, residents who are living with and who have to respond to multi-hazards and systemic risks. Our objectives span a range of time scales, from long-term understandings of how risk evolves to short-term preparations for responding to disasters: (O1) As our foundation, we will contextualise the contemporary multi-hazard and systemic risk landscape in Nepal to understand the wider social, political, economic, and environmental landscape in which people live. This objective has two components: a longitudinal examination of how wider transformations affect everyday lives and resilience, and a novel and much-needed nationwide multi-hazard catalogue for Nepal. Both are pivotal in enabling comprehensive disaster risk management within our project and beyond. This objective will bring local knowledge and lived experience into conversation with natural science understandings of the risk landscape.  (O2) To enable strategic risk-informed decision making, we will develop a new approach for national-scale multi-hazard disaster contingency planning. This extends and transforms current national-scale disaster planning coordinated by the UN Resident Coordinator&apos;s Office, which considers earthquakes and monsoon-related flooding in isolation from each other and from the wider context in which they occur. We will enhance that planning to explicitly consider both dynamic and cascading multi-hazards and systemic risks, and to utilise innovative ways of characterising the dynamics of population exposure and vulnerability, to enable a step-change in the utility of contingency planning based upon a more complete understanding of current and future risks.  (O3) To enable local government to better anticipate, plan for, and communicate around multi-hazards and systemic risks, we will develop the first municipal-level seasonal contingency planning framework for monsoon-related multi-hazards. This will integrate the full monsoon-related hazard and risk chain into current monsoon response planning, which is all but absent at present, and will support innovative risk communication focussed on locally-produced public-facing dramatisations to convey monsoon preparedness messaging.  (O4) To develop new protocols for embedding local and scientific knowledge in disaster preparedness and response. We will tackle the barriers that limit the use of interdisciplinary science and local knowledge in both planning for and responding to disasters, focussing upon equipping decision makers with knowledge on multi-hazards and systemic risks. We will integrate the results of the project in discussion with four end-user groups: local and national government, academic researchers, DRR practitioners, and the national and regional UN system. Our aim is to improve their decision making by taking explicit account of the evolution of the mountain hazard and risk chain.  Our objectives allow us to address the GCRF programme challenges of understanding the drivers of multi-hazard events, with a focus on both earthquakes and the monsoon; characterising the cumulative aspects of risk chains in a mountainous developing country context; and increasing resilience to multi-hazards and systemic risks, through a simultaneous focus on preparedness, long- and short-term planning, and response.</narrative>
