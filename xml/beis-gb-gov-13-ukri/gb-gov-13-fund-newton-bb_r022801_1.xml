   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Beans provide a staple food source and economic commodity for farmers across Colombia. They are a major source of protein and mineral nutrition in the diets of the rural poor. However, bean production is at risk from increasing heat and drought stress associated with climate change. Our project examines how climate information can be better used in CIAT&apos;s bean breeding program. The result will be improved resilience of beans to climate, and improved access to these improved varieties, thus in turn supporting farm income and the promotion of stability of production.  This would protect these fragile communities from fluctuations and shocks within the farming systems.    The project is about opportunities as well as challenges. We will focus in part on post-conflict regions, thus having direct impacts on a number of actors within Colombia. We we look at the potential to breed and cultivate beans where coca once stood.   Since all beans are not created equal - it is the small, red varieties that are generally cultivated and sold at market in this part of Latin America - we will be sure to take account of local preferences throughout the project. In this way we will deliver improvements where they are needed, rather than using only those varieties that are easiest to breed for stress tolerance.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Project aim: we will develop and integrate climate-smart bean breeding and adoption into existing infrastructure   In order to achieve this aim, we will:  1. Identify selection sites for breeding bean for abiotic stress, including new opportunities from post-conflict land availability (year 1)  2. Perform a demand-led identification of key traits  (ie not abiotic stress, important for markets  (year 1)  3. Develop a behavioural model of adoption of new varieties using secondary data within Colombia (years 1 and 2)  4. Use the behavioural model to identify strategies for adoption of bean varieties in post-conflict Colombia (years 2 and 3).   5. Create linkages with harvest Plus and grower associations as mechanisms for influencing and informing policy towards uptake of Beans</narrative>
