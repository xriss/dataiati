   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Facilitating equitable access and quality education for development: South African International Distance Education</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">International higher education, properly devised, can become a route for development in countries of the global South. This promise is already, in part, being delivered by South Africa, - a hub for students from across Africa, particularly Anglophone and SADC countries. Although there is now some research on international student migrants in South Africa, almost 40% of international registrants are distant learners and little is known about them and the role this type of education plays in providing equitable access to quality HE. This project will first explore the geographical distribution, demographics to access, experiences and quality of education among international distance education (IDE) students studying in South Africa. Secondly, it will focus on supply and demand factors in 3 key &apos;sending&apos; countries - Zimbabwe, Lesotho and Nigeria and compare this with a small subset of South African students. By considering those who are unable to move to study abroad but have restricted access to education in their own countries, the project will address the problems of access and equity in higher education that have been signalled as major objectives in the Sustainable Development Goals (Goal 4). Thirdly, given the low rates of retention in students in South Africa overall, including in distance education (DE), the project will look at how to improve learning design and thus the quality of education. It will use the Open University&apos;s (OU) experience of mass DE and how educational technology developed there can be adapted to meet the requirements of African HE. Finally, the project will explore how communicative technologies influence the learning experience of South African and IDE students.  Research Design 1. To produce a comparative database of South African and international DE students 2. To develop a learning analytics tool that can be utilized for IDE in South Africa   Empirical Objectives 3. To investigate factors influencing IDE students&apos; equitable access to education in terms of supply of local education, demographic and socio-economic factors 4. To assess and improve the quality of DE and see how it varies across the student cohort due to socio-economic and demographic variables. The project will then map the learning process in selected subjects in order to explore the assumptions and practices informing disciplinary content, teaching and learning contexts and student profiles as intersecting variables in students&apos; learning journeys. It will provide a benchmark of how to assess and deliver quality IDE 5. To explore how learning design tool (OULDI) developed at the OU and available through creative commons license can be adapted for particular STEM subjects in South African HE and to therefore assess how geopolitical, institutional and regulatory contexts can affect learning design. This will be the first time this design is tested in the global South and the UK will learn from South Africa on the possibility for adapting this tool 6. To understand the role of social communication technologies in learning  Theoretical objectives 7. To theorise international study through a postcolonial lens by going beyond the dominant Anglo-lens and recognizing the multi-centred, multi-spatial character of HE 8. To conceptualise south-north learning in learning analytics in the context of the different power relations, ontologies and forms of knowledge production that the different partners bring to the project  Impact objectives 9. To enhance knowledge of the university support sector (NGOs and associations) in Africa to better understand the role that IDE plays in promoting education on the continent 10. To assist policy makers in understanding the potential of IDE to provide scarce skills to students who are socio-economically or demographically disadvantaged 11. To expand IDE pedagogy for online and blended learning students in South Africa 12. To highlight the flows of skills, knowledge and ideas across Africa</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Presently, the gross enrolment rate for higher education (HE) across Africa runs at only 8 per cent - the lowest in the world. Yet for policy makers throughout the continent, HE is regarded as a vital tool to bring about sustainable economic development. This is echoed by the United Nations&apos; Sustainable Development Goals, adopted in September 2015, which call for equitable access to high quality tertiary education in their toolkit for ending poverty by 2030. This push for an educated population abuts a reality where, in many African countries, HE demand far outstrips supply and is only addressed by the wealthy through migration. Distance education across national borders is filling that gap. Indeed, one third of student registrations in South Africa, a country where higher education is well established, are made up from this international distance education (IDE) cohort. Despite its importance to the African HE landscape, and its potential contribution to continent-wide development challenges, the workings of IDE remain under-researched. Thus, this project fills a significant and timely gap in knowledge which will generate learning of substantial relevance to social and economic development throughout Africa in the decade to come.  This project focuses on two areas vital to the future success of IDE in Africa: equality of access to education, and the quality of that education. Research on IDE in other settings demonstrates that this learning style can improve access for students facing demographic and social disadvantages (including gender, race, and disability, as well as learners studying later in life or learners with caring responsibilities). This project will investigate these issues in the African setting, asking &quot;can IDE can generate equitable access to students from across the continent?&quot; Educational quality is important too. Of the South African student cohort in the year 2000, only 30 per cent graduated within five years with attainment levels. Other research also shows that student retention is markedly lower in students from non-traditional backgrounds. The project will investigate the role of education quality plays here, asking &quot;how can the quality of IDE be assessed, and what improvements can be made to create better student outcomes?&quot;  The project will examine IDE delivered by the University of South Africa (the sole provider of DE in South Africa until 2014) to students elsewhere in the continent. Research will collect demographic and socio-economic data, reasons for study, labour market intentions, migration plans and educational experience of student cohorts in three countries, Zimbabwe, Lesotho and Nigeria using both qualitative and quantitative methods. This will be compared with South African students and with students studying face-to-face where this data exists. The project will also build on the OU&apos;s Learning Design Initiative (OULDI). Using techniques from this innovative programme, existing student performance and reasons for it will be analysed, changes will be made to learning design, and the effects of the design changes will be tested on the following year&apos;s cohort. This knowledge exchange will enable the existing and successful OULDI strategy to be employed in another context, and enhance the future development of the OULDI.  Central to the success of this project is a team of researchers from top DE institutions in the UK and South Africa. The two universities are continental leaders in learning pedagogies and have established links with key players in the field of IDE and the project&apos;s findings will inform teaching approaches at both institutions. The project will be led by Dr Gunter and Prof Raghuram who have a successful track record of collaborative research on South African international HE, with a strong team of co-investigators from each country. The project is informed by postcolonial theory and politics and aims to experiment with two way learning on IDE globally.</narrative>
