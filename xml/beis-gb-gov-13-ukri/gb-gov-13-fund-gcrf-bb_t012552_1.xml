   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Africa SOIL: Soil Organic matter Improves Livelihoods</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Context: Southern Africa is being severely impacted by climate change, resulting in widespread poverty and under-nutrition. These effects are exacerbated by increasing population pressure, limiting resources (e.g. nutrients, water and soils), resulting in low, unstable yields, progressive soil degradation and depletion of inherent soil resources, such as soil organic matter. Smallholder systems, dependent on degraded soil of low fertility, are particularly vulnerable and lead to abject poverty. Maize is the single most important crop for more than 160 million people in eastern and southern Africa, occupying between 50-90% of the cultivated land area (over 17 million hectares, excluding South Africa), with a total production of 31 million tonnes. However, without new practices in the face of climate change and low soil nutrient availability, yields which are already low are predicted to further decline and farmers cannot escape this poverty trap. Technologies are urgently required for these systems that couple sustainable crop production and protection of the soil resource under changing conditions. Breeding for new maize varieties with greater tolerance to drought and enhanced ability to take up nitrogen from soil organic matter holds much promise to transform these cropping systems.   Aims and objectives: Our aim is to provide a solution to this problem by empowering smallholder farmers with the knowledge and tools to replenish and utilise nutrients in soil more efficiently. Specifically, this will involve coupling conservation agriculture practices with selection of maize varieties best able to source nitrogen from soil organic matter. This will reduce the requirement and dependency for inorganic fertiliser application to improve yields. This provides both productivity and environmental benefits: greater yield stability under changing conditions particularly drought, lowering the need for inorganic fertiliser input, and averting further soil degradation through enhancing soil structure.  Firstly, we will translate and build on our existing knowledge of abilities of different maize varieties to source nutrients from organic matter through establishment of demonstration and trial sites across an existing network of smallholder farms in NE Zimbabwe and S Malawi. We will discuss with farmers our approach, strategies to increase soil organic matter and expected impacts on maize yield in the context of local environmental and soil conditions. On-site findings will form the basis for environmental and economic assessments of this technology, and for soil organic matter considerations to be embedded into existing guidelines for conservation agriculture. Finally, we will work with plant breeders to move towards  integrating environmental sustainability criteria into maize breeding programmes.    Potential applications and benefits: Conservation agriculture, based on reduced soil inversion, crop residue retention and diversification is best suited to be practised under degraded, low fertile soils under drought conditions. Some drought tolerant maize varieties are excellent utilisers of soil organic matter replenished during conservation agriculture, which is anticipated to incur both economic and environmental benefits. Embedding this into variety selection criteria, takes us towards future breeding for sustainability that is best suited to the local context in southern Africa. This is an important step for improving food and nutritional security, environmental sustainability, reducing poverty, and enhancing the production environment of smallholder farmers and rural populations, in particular women, in southern Africa.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Our approach is of two pathways to change: Firstly, up- and out-scaling to smallholder farmers the benefits of conservation agriculture (CA) and embedding the benefits of soil organic matter (SOM) management and utilisation into these discussions; secondly, introducing new selection criteria for sustainability of maize varieties prior to commercialisation, specifically tailored to production in the context of CA practices and the low fertility, degraded, low rainfall regions for which CA has the greatest benefits.   O1.1: Convert existing CA on-farm trial plots in Zimbabwe and Malawi into a network of demonstration plots (mother trials) of contrasting soil characteristics (pH, texture) and rainfall, that extension workers and smallholder farmers can use as CA learning centres.    O1.2: Provide the first in situ demonstration of performance (yield, available soil N), priming potential, N supply capacity and stocks of N and C in SOM pools of different maize varieties in these mother trials that have been under long-term CA versus conventional agriculture.   O2.1: Establish baby trials linked to the mother trials, to facilitate closer engagement and wider reach with smallholder farmers, to increase the likelihood of adoption of CA practices on their farms.    O2.2: Train local partners and extension workers in soil sampling and analysis for SOM status on baby trial farms, to supplement existing databases populated with management records and aboveground productivity, to support the development of guidelines for farmers.   O2.3: Provide economic and environmental assessments of our combined CA and maize variety selection approach to inform government policy and to support the development of guidelines for farmers.   O2.4: Embed SOM management and its benefits into CA guidelines bespoke for local contexts, for dissemination across the trial network by local partners and extension workers.   O3.1: Demonstrate benefits and potential trade-offs for yield of specific selection for varieties with high SOM utilisation potentials, through quantification of yields in trials and association mapping to establish possible linkages between drought-tolerance and SOM utilisation traits, and identify loci for genomic selection.    O3.2: Take forward our dialogues with maize breeders and seed companies about selection for this additional criterion, and jointly develop a pathway for implementation and wider promotion.</narrative>
