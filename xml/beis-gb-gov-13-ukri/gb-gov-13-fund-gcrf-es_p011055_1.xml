   <narrative xml:lang="EN">GCRF: Building capacity for the future city in developing countries (PEAK)</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Our aim is to build skilled capacity for decision making on the urban future - generating new research and fostering new leaders that draw on the different forms of expertise offered by data analytics, historical analysis, mathematics, modelling, medicine, engineering, ethnography, finance, technology, planning and good governance to address the challenges found in the 21st century city.  We have identified four overarching urban dynamics (PEAK) that structure the research and advance our understanding of the future city. The PEAK research framing synthesises traditional urban studies disciplines with emergent new urban sciences in a programme of research and capacity building across the humanities, social, sciences and natural sciences. Grounded in the logic of urban complexity and deploying an array of disciplinary perspectives, the PEAK research platform will build the capacity of cities to make sense of the possibilities, constraints and policy trade offs of alternative emergent development futures.    The first objective of PEAK is to produce a pioneering international collaboration, generating comparative learning in the emergent field of interdisciplinary urban scholarship, building on a partnership with research excellent universities globally to serve as regional hubs in a global network of new work  &apos;to grow research capability to meet global challenges expressed in cities of developing countries&apos;, the core objective of RCUK&apos;s GROW call.  The second objective of PEAK is to develop a global platform for cutting edge research scholarship that develops an interdisciplinary urbanism across natural science, social science and the humanities; growing research capacity in ODA eligible sites in China, Colombia, India and South Africa and interventions directly relevant to city governance systems, linked to British research strengths by drawing on a wide range of disciplinary expertise.  The third objective of PEAK is to develop methodological innovation across a range of research scholarship on cities that harnesses innovative ways of generating data and analysis to a transdisciplinary synthesis of research approaches.  The fourth objective of PEAK is to &apos;grow&apos; a global cohort of postdoctoral scholars, collaborating over three years and five countries through sustained support through annual summer schools, extended internships and placements across the international network, equipped to develop new ways of research on the city and new ways of working with cities.  The fifth objective of PEAK is to research the trade offs of city development; identify how research generates, at times solutions for city futures but also commonly options that depend on which forms of research science are prioritised, which normative models of city life preferred; the trade offs of short term and longer term goals, alternative ethical priorities and incommensurable forms of scientific knowledge.    The sixth objective of PEAK is to work with cities in China, Colombia, India and South Africa to develop a platform through which cutting edge research scholarship can serve the interests of the future city; strengthening the science-policy interface around all urban related aspects of the sustainable development goals and related multilateral policy deliberations, learning from and linking to networks of urban labs and city observatories, optimizing the capacity of the city to make strategic evidence based decisions.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">We propose to generate a step change in the capacity of a network of cities in developing countries to address development dilemmas and advance the new &apos;urban&apos; Sustainable Development Goal (11), linking cutting edge research to governance challenges of the emerging metropolis.   The contemporary city presents a major development  challenge. The majority of the world now lives in cities and the proportion is set to increase rapidly.  All SDGs will need to be achieved in emergent cities and through understanding the combination of different development challenges, simultaneously realized. To recognize this and address the development challenges we need to combine the insights of traditionally discrete disciplinary expertise and link the humanities, natural sciences and social sciences in a new interdisciplinary configuration. We propose to &apos;grow&apos; a new generation of urban researchers comfortable taking forward this new interdisciplinary field, working across an international partnership of research intensive universities renowned for their expertise in analyzing contemporary urbanisms.   A global team of partners from China (Peking University), India (India Institute of Human Settlements), South Africa (UCT African Centre for Cities) and Colombia (EAFIT, Medellin) will work together with the University of Oxford. Researchers work across natural sciences (including mathematics, medicine, transport and engineering), the social sciences (including anthropology, development, migration) and humanities (including law, history). We leverage expertise across the University of Oxford and the Alan Turing Institute, building capacity internationally through a partnership networking strategic sites of urban interventions globally, working with a cohort of postdoctoral fellowships to develop a programme of excellent research. The focus is international and interdisciplinary. International networks build on existing collaborations, strong links to cities themselves and on track records of research excellence.   Research proposed uses complex systems framing to synthesise our understanding of the development of future cities. Research addresses urban challenges that focus on data science opportunities of the city and socio-material systems that link built form, technology and behavioural pattern in complex interventions in public health, the nexus of water food and energy, informality, the city commons, mobility, land and the imperative to accommodate new populations. Research embedded in cities themselves will build new forms of learning, co-production and capacity building to promote sustainable urban development.   To maximize the impact of our work the five centres of research will create a platform that will link regionally to linked research centres, urban labs and city observatories in Latin America, Africa, India and China. The opportunity to link the challenges of the global south to the city futures of the global north will be addressed through formal links to impact pathways in London government and European Urban Labs and centres, liaising with three of the Innovate UK funded Catapults (Satellite, Transport, Future of Cities).  In order to meet the global goals of sustainable development cities will have to fundamentally shift developmental trajectories, implying a significant realignment in urban management practice. The knowledge base on which policy makers are expected to make such momentous decisions is fragmented but we will work with cities across the partnership to develop new models of co-production and knowledge exchange. All of the research partners have outstanding records of engagement and coproduction of knowledge with cities themselves, city regions, national bodies and emergent transnational organisations, including UN Habitat, the UN Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN) and the World Bank/UN agency Cities Alliance.</narrative>
