   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Unpacking the effect of the national pay for performance scheme (PMAQ) on inequalities in the financing and delivery of primary care in Brazil.</narrative>

  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Health care providers can be paid in a variety of ways. They can be given an annual budget for agreeing to provide a service or they can be paid on the basis of the size of the population they serve. Alternatively, providers can be paid according to achievement of specific standards or patient outcomes. Such schemes are called Pay for Performance (P4P) schemes and have been used in a variety of setting. These schemes try to change the way health workers behave.  By providing financial rewards, they aim to make health workers and their managers focus on specific outcomes that are important for improving the quality of health care services as well as population health. These schemes have been implemented in the United Kingdom and the United States and a growing number of low and middle income countries.   Although P4P schemes are usually referred to as a single programme, the design of P4P schemes varies a lot from place to place.  For example, some schemes reward the performance of individual providers, whilst others reward the performance of the team. Some schemes base rewards on achieving a fixed target, others set targets relative to current performance. Some schemes involve penalties for poor performance, others do not. From previous research, we know that the design of P4P schemes is important.  Yet we understand little about how variations in the design of P4P schemes affect the impact of such programmes. In particular, we don&apos;t know how changes in design affect who benefits from these schemes in terms of levels of funding and in terms of the improved delivery of services that is intended to be triggered by P4P. It is possible that some scheme designs primarily benefit rich communities (thereby increasing socio-economic inequalities), whilst others benefit the poorest. Unfortunately, we do not know which P4P designs have that effect.    This project will explore how a P4P scheme in Brazil (PMAQ), which was gradually introduced across the country, affected the distribution of health sector funding to health care providers and the delivery of health care services to local communities.  We will also explore whether and how the design of P4P incentives affects levels of funding and service delivery.  The Brazilian experience is a valuable opportunity to explore this question as: 1) municipalities can choose how to distribute financial rewards linked to P4P, 2) there is a lot of data available on the wealth of communities being served by particular providers and on health sector funding received by providers and quality of care delivered by providers, and 3) the scheme is the largest in the world, with substantial variation in geographical context.   The research will begin by reviewing the P4P designs adopted by municipalities nationally and developing a classification of designs.  The project will then investigate whether PMAQ has affected the way health sector funding is distributed across health care providers and how this relates to the wealth of the communities they serve; and whether this differs according to the P4P design adopted by municipalities. We will also examine whether providers receiving PMAQ funding receive more or less funding for health care from other sources. The project will consider how the quality of care delivered by health care providers in terms of the way services are delivered to patients and patients satisfaction with services, as well as the capacity of the providers to deliver services, differs according to community wealth and the P4P design adopted by municipalities.  Finally, we will carry out an in-depth study of 20 municipalities in 2 Brazilian states that have adopted different P4P designs, to see how they affect health care financing and quality of care and the way different communities benefit or lose out.  The study will strengthen relationships between researchers in the UK and in Brazil.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The overall aim of this project is to investigate how Brazil&apos;s national pay for performance (P4P) scheme (PMAQ - Programa de Melhoria do Acesso e da Qualidade in Portuguese) has affected socioeconomic inequalities in the financing and delivery of primary care. A key focus of our study will be to characterise the different PMAQ incentive designs adopted by municipalities and understand whether these variations matter for the financing and delivery of health care.  The research will also investigate the mechanisms through which incentive designs affect team level funding and quality of care. This study will provide recommendations on how to design incentives to achieve a more equitable distribution of health sector funding across teams, and greater equity in quality of care, that are relevant to Brazil and to other settings.    The research has 4 specific objectives: First, we will review the incentive designs adopted by each municipality and develop a typology of designs across the country.  We will examine whether municipalities of differing characteristics (e.g. level and extent of variation in socio-economic status, distance from State headquarters, number of teams, baseline health sector funding levels and baseline performance) are more likely to adopt specific incentive designs.    Second, we will investigate how the level of health sector financing available to family health teams has changed with the introduction of PMAQ and whether the financial incentive programme affects inequalities in the distribution of funding. We will also examine whether PMAQ funding displaces or is additional to other health sector funding.     Third, we will examine the relationship between socio-economic inequalities and quality of care conceptualised using the Donabedian framework for quality in terms of structure and process.  We will generate an index of structural quality based on availability of: 1) staff, 2) physical infrastructure, 3) basic drugs and equipment.  We will measure four dimensions of process quality of care: 1) content of care for antenatal care; 2) content of care for child health; 3) content of care for chronic care consultations and 4) patient satisfaction.   Finally, we will undertake case studies of 20 municipalities across 2 states to evaluate the mechanisms through which PMAQ affects the distribution of financing and equity in quality of care outcomes.  We will also examine how PMAQ affects overall levels of health sector funding and financial flows within the system, and other health system functions, such as staffing levels, governance arrangements at municipal and team levels and the procurement of drugs.  We will examine the receipt and use of PMAQ and other funding by teams and how funds are allocated within teams and how this affects quality of care.    The study will strengthen research links between researches in the UK and in Brazil for ongoing partnership and collaboration.  The study will also involve knowledge exchange across both countries, including strengthening the research capacity of both the UK and Brazilian teams.  Results will be of relevance to international donors and national governments financing P4P schemes, to inform optimal selection of P4P design choices to minimise inequalities and maximise the potential for improvements in health outcomes. Our findings will also result in peer reviewed publications and policy briefs.</narrative>
