  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed Global Ageing and Long-term Care (GALNet) network will bring together academics, policy makers and practitioners from across a range of disciplines to share examples of experiences and best practice from different countries to inform the design of integrated long-term care services that are centred on the needs of older people.  The proposal will establish a dynamic and internationally leading network on ageing and long-term care around the world, which fulfils the following objectives: a) Exchange of information and expertise on population ageing and long-term care in a globalised context, where migration patterns increasingly shape individuals&apos; resources and circumstances; b) Build complementary knowledge to create new insights on theoretical approaches and methodologies and to inform social policies and interventions; c) Promote capacity building and mentoring of early career researchers; d) Build strong partnerships with academics, NGOs and policy makers around the world; and e) Identify and co-produce new and innovative research agendas to inform future policy design and practice.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The world&apos;s population is ageing rapidly. In 2015, there were 900 million individuals aged 60 and over, of whom two-thirds live in the developing world; by 2050 this figure is expected to more than double to over 2 billion and 80% of these individuals will be living in less developed countries, many of which currently lack comprehensive systems of social protection (WHO, 2015).  Globally, the family remains the dominant source of support for social care in later life. However, with increasing participation - particularly of women - in the paid labour market and higher levels of migration, traditional systems of family support are coming under pressure. Across the globe formal systems of long-term care are evolving to complement informal (unpaid) care from family members and non-family networks. In some contexts, such systems are already well developed but in others they are evolving organically with little or no oversight or regulation. The WHO, in its World Report on Ageing and Health (2015) highlighted the imperative of developing long-term care systems that enable older people to receive care and support that is &apos;consistent with their basic rights, fundamental freedoms and human dignity&apos;. Through the organisation of a series of workshops, the Global Ageing and Long-term Care (GALNet) will facilitate the sharing of insights into the factors underpinning the need for, and present realities of, long-term care and how these might vary across different social groups, along with discussion of alternative models for long-term care from different sources, and the balance between informal (unpaid) care provided by family members and non-family networks, formal support provided by the state or Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs), or formal paid for support purchased through the private sector. A key outcome of the Network will be its final report, which will identify a future research agenda for the long term care of older people within a rights based framework, drawing on south-south learning.</narrative>
