   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Addressing malnutrition with biofortified maize in Zimbabwe: from crop management to policy and consumers</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The double burden of malnutrition refers to the suboptimal intake of essential nutrients (minerals, metals and vitamins), either caused simply by inadequate dietary intake and/or due to the intake of &quot;empty calories&quot; i.e., food that has sufficient calories but lacks adequate amounts of essential nutrients. This double burden falls disproportionally heavy on developing countries, and there on women and children. It directly increases child mortality and childhood stunting, and reduces people&apos;s ability mending diseases. In Zimbabwe, an estimated one in four children have vitamin A deficiency, two-thirds are living with iron deficiency and one in three have iron deficiency anaemia (UNICEF, 2019). And a quarter of children (0.76 million) under five in Zimbabwe are currently stunted. Among women of reproductive age, one in four have vitamin A deficiency, six in ten women have iron deficiency and one in four are anaemic.   Malnutrition and its negative effects are particularly common in rural areas where people mostly live from their own crop production and the diet is mostly cereal based. This group is difficult to reach with supplements and has basically no access to fortified processed food. As an alternative method, plant breeders developed &quot;biofortified&quot; crops, meaning crops with a higher content of minerals, metals and (pro)vitamin A (PVA). However, recent research has shown that the effectiveness of such biofortified crops is a) affected considerably by soil characteristics, and that b) their nutrient content can be enhanced with micronutrient fertilizer and other crop management options. To enable making best use of the new biofortified crop varieties we propose the following research:  Work package (WP) 1: what are the effects of agronomic management options on PVA concentration and micronutrient uptake of novel, biofortified maize lines. African soils are often poor and have a low fertility, resulting in low yields and low grain quality. This can, for example, be addressed with soil conservation methods (increased return of crop residues and reduced tillage), with macro and micro nutrient treatments, or with liming. However, little is known how such treatments affect the nutrient content in the newly developed biofortified maize varieties. We will, therefore, test a range of the new varieties under several agronomic management options, to identify the best conditions and treatments for high quality, nutritious maize.   WP2. Testing the effectiveness of agronomic biofortification at the farm-scale. As mentioned above, African soils are often poor, but they are also very variable. Farmers of course know their soils well, they know where the crops grow well and where not, and they often increase soil fertility in particular fields (where they dump kitchen refuse or crop residues, where the cattle are kept at night, etc). Therefore, farmers could grow biofortified crops in preferential places but it is unknown how much this could contribute to an improved nutritional value. We will test these options with 60 farmers for two seasons for their effectiveness, feasibility, and possible impact.   WP3. Closing the nutrient gap or Predicting the effect of bio + agro fortification at the national level. Although maize is a very important staple for most people in Zimbabwe, they also eat other food. And only their total &quot;food basket&quot; determines their nutrient uptake. Knowledge of the food basket composition and of the nutrient content of all items in the basket allows then to estimate the possible contribution of the bio-and agro-fortified food on the nutrition of the people. WP3 will estimate this impact for all regions in Zimbabwe based on WP1 and WP2 results in combination with national statistics on food consumption and, where necessary, some additional analysis of common food items.   WP4. This WP focuses on upscaling and dissemination and has no research components.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">To address the double burden of malnutrition, CIMMYT produced ProVitamin A (PVA) maize lines with conventional breeding (biofortification) and released them already in Malawi, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe. Breeding of the next generation of PVA lines, which also have increased Fe and Zn content, is advanced and the first lines are tested in the field. CIMMYT also conducted feeding studies showing that humans do benefit from the consumption of biofortified maize. But a range of recent studies showed that the nutrient concentration (minerals, metals and vitamins) of maize is affected by a range of factors which need to be better understood to make best use of this breakthrough. The proposed research has the following main objectives: Objective 1: several recent studies found that soil characteristics (especially soil organic carbon (SOC) content) have a considerable effect on grain micronutrient content. SOC can vary naturally in soils but can also be managed by residue application and or reduced tillage (soil conservation practices). Standard NPK fertilizers are also known to have considerable effects on micronutrient concentrations in the grain, usually increasing yields but decreasing micronutrient content. This can be counteracted by blending NPK fertilizers with micronutrients, an increasingly widespread trend. However, these effects have not been analysed in the new PVA maize nor in the next generation of multiple-biofortified lines. The first objective is therefore to evaluate these new lines under different agronomic practices to gain knowledge on the combination of bio + agronomic fortification. Objective 2: breeding new varieties is usually conducted on research stations with close to ideal crop management conditions. These are of course quite different from conditions on fields of poor smallholder farmers in Africa, which will affect the nutrient and PVA content of the grains harvested there. In addition, different farmers&apos; fields can vary substantially in their soil fertility; very often fields close to the house are fertile and fields far away are not. The second objective is therefore to determine the actual nutrient content of the new PVA lines in farmers&apos; fields with different fertility status. This will allow giving farmers advise where to grow the new PVA maize varieties to get the best possible nutritional value. Objective 3: to evaluate the possible impact of the combined bio + agro fortification approach on micronutrient uptake and human health, the new grain composition data will be integrated with food supply data from household/individual dietary surveys to estimate and map dietary mineral nutrient supplies in Zimbabwe. Several data sources will be integrated, including new grain composition data from the objectives above, national food composition data and existing household/individual dietary consumption survey data for Zimbabwe (supported by the Food and Nutrition Council). The combined data sources will then allow predictions of dietary mineral supply at a regional level with and without the proposed interventions. This enables an evaluation of the possible contribution of fortification and a better picture of where the best targets for such interventions are. Objective 4: moving knowledge into practice will be essential, to ensure the information developed throughout the project influences stakeholders working in nutrition in Zimbabwe, and that the knowledge we generate helps farmers and consumers to maximise the benefits from biofortified crops. By engaging key nutrition groups from the start of the project we want to maximise cross learning from other initiatives and help disseminate our results. This objective will enhance learning and decision-making processes and establish local knowledge platforms, including UNICEF brown bag seminars, FAO Outlook on Food Security meetings and Market Linkage Associations. Collaboration with the Food and Nutrition Council will strengthen this objective.</narrative>
