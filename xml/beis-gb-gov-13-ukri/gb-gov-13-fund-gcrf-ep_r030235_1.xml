   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Electricity access is widely acknowledged as one of the key enablers of human development. Bringing electricity to low income areas in the developing world involves great technical, geopolitical and socioeconomic challenges. In recent years, autonomous electricity supply systems (AESS) have found a role in replacing kerosene lamps and candles as sources for basic lighting. However, their power rating was too low to power even small machinery, which made them have very little impact on the way people produce goods. According to the well-established power systems planning paradigm, the way to enable electricity access suitable for more productive applications is to build new transmission corridors to ship power from large power plants to isolated areas where it will be distributed using regional distribution networks. While this approach proved successful in the mid twentieth century, it often incurs prohibitive costs that make such projects infeasible in developing countries. One of the main issues of the old paradigm is that it misses the opportunity to use distributed energy resources (ie small scale generation, energy storage, etc) available today to drive the costs down and achieve better energy supply. The aim of this project is to bring some light over this matter by investigating a new approach where the electrical network would start from the local interconnection of small scale AESS. This ambitious goal will require the investigation of a suitable technological solution to link multiple AESS together, the development of new tools that are suitable to optimise the operation and planning of a network of interconnected AESS with models of demand and generation tailored for rural electrification applications. The work will use Rwanda as the main study case with the cooperation of the University of Rwanda, that will provide support for the derivation of models and will study and characterise the most interesting productive uses of electricity to meet the specific needs in rural Rwanda. The work will also be carried in collaboration with BBOXX and Meshpower, two British companies started by alumni of Imperial College London that commercialise AESS in several countries around the world including Rwanda.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="The project will investigate the development of an electrical power system for rural electrification in developing countries that will start from the aggregation by interconnection of small autonomous electricity supply systems (AESS) of different scales (e.g. solar home systems or mini-grids). The specific objectives of the project will be:  - To draft a roadmap for the cost-effective development of an electrical system starting from the aggregation of AESS with smart controls as an alternative to the old paradigm of building resiliency through redundancy and preventive planning.  - To propose a new concept of interconnection network technology that will enable AESS to exchange energy between them and with an electrical utility network. This will require choosing the specifications of the network, identifying what converter interfaces it would require and how they would be operated to ensure short-term stability.  - To assess the benefits of the interconnection technology for different scales of application (e.g. few households, village level, etc) and derive specifications for it (e.g. tentative costs, ratings, etc).  - To formulate an operational optimization model suitable for AESS and interconnected AESS that includes detailed operational characteristics of the smart enabling technologies and takes into account post-disturbance transient effects and stability constraints.  - To develop models of smart enabling technologies (e.g. interface converters, special protection schemes, etc) for the quantification of their impact in security of supply in planning studies.  - To investigate a suitable protection system for the proposed interconnection network technology to ensure high safety at a low cost.  - To develop models of small-scale renewable generation yield and demand tailored for planning studies in rural electrification considering taking into account specific geographical characteristics and evolution over time."></capital-spend>
