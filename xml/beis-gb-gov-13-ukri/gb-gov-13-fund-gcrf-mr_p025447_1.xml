   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Cultural, social and economic influences on ongoing Schistosoma mansoni transmission, despite a decade of mass treatment, and the potential for change</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Over 240 million people in low and middle-income countries are infected with schistosomiasis which causes severe morbidity and reduces cognitive and physical development. Schistosoma mansoni transmission is driven by poor water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) facilities and practices. At present mass drug administration (MDA) is the main form of disease control, but in high endemicity hotspots additional interventions are required.  The over-arching objective of this proposal is to better understand how people living in endemic communities manage their risk of S. mansoni infection, and how they might change their behaviour if additional resources were provided. This will provide an evidence-base for transmission models, feasibility studies and intervention trials in hotspots across Africa where transmission continues despite MDA. We seek to identify &quot;best bet&quot; combinations of investments likely to reduce transmission and re-infection and which our research shows are likely to be adopted and sustained, displacing existing practices which currently increase risk. This means uncovering and then building on an evidence data base on behavioural practices and social and cultural constraints.  We have two specific objectives focused around key research questions that will enable us to achieve our over-arching objective: 1. To understand how S. mansoni is discussed and understood in the case study areas by local people, and what current WASH practices and behaviours increase the risks of transmission and re-infection. This is addressed through the following research questions:  a. How do local people understand S. mansoni transmission, risk and symptoms?  b. What social practices make local people vulnerable to S. mansoni and which transmission reduction strategies are currently in use?  c. What are the responses to practice-based interventions, such as availability of MDA, improved WASH facilities, safe water sources for washing cars, clothes and people, or filtering/heating infective water before use, and which factors influence their uptake? d. What practical, sustainable, solutions may enable people to reduce S. mansoni infections?  2. To model the factors that determine people&apos;s current risk reduction behaviours for S. mansoni, investigating the effects of knowledge and risk attitudes on these behaviours; and to understand how new resources might reduce risks. This is addressed through the following research questions: a. What is the statistical significance of factors explaining the current uptake of WASH behaviours relevant to reducing transmission and re-infection in different villages and across different village members, e.g. children, fisherfolk? b. If new WASH-relevant resources are provided, what level of uptake can be predicted, and how does this vary across community members?  c. How does (i) information on the effectiveness of WASH behaviours and (ii) information on social norms affect predicted uptake of improved WASH behaviours?   Our Uganda/UK partnerships will strengthen research capacity in both countries, with a particular focus on social scientific capacity in Uganda through the MRC/UVRI Research Unit. Our interdisciplinary approaches will show how the combination of anthropology, economics, epidemiology and parasitology can provide new and important insights into the design of intervention strategies for schistosomiasis and thus insights into how to improve the effectiveness of equivalent intervention strategies for other Neglected Tropical Diseases.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Schistosomiasis, commonly known as Bilharzia, is a parasitic disease which infects over 240 million people worldwide. Over 90% of these people live in poor rural communities in sub-Saharan Africa. The disease causes anaemia, abdominal pain, stunted growth and reduced cognitive development in children, and up to 200,000 deaths per year. Over 600 million people live in areas where they are at risk of infection. The eggs of the parasite Schistosoma mansoni, are excreted in human stool, hatch in fresh water and infect snails, where they reproduce asexually to produce 1000s of larvae (called cercariae) per day. These cercariae infect humans by directly burrowing through the skin, and developing into adult worms. The life-cycle is maintained by open defecation, or inadequate containment of human faeces, enabling eggs to reach fresh water sources, followed by contact with infected water through activities such as bathing, swimming, washing clothes or fishing.  Current control focuses on drug treatments given annually on a national scale to school children. However, despite over a decade of national control programmes in countries such as Uganda, high infection levels persist in hotspot areas. Drug treatment alone will not reduce the disease in these areas and additional interventions are needed. It is known that improved sanitation and access to clean safe water supplies can stop people from getting infected. However, many areas with the disease lack money and resources to improve sanitation and furthermore, when sanitation is improved, it is not always used. We do not fully understand what makes people alter water and sanitation focused behaviours even in the presence of good facilities.  Therefore, the project aims to understand better how people living in endemic communities manage their risk of schistosomiasis and how they might change their behaviour if additional resources were provided.  This project has two overlapping parts. In part one, we will work directly with communities who experience a lot of schistosomiasis to establish how people currently try to reduce the risk of infection for themselves and their families as well as the risk of passing those infections on through open defecation. We will work in three villages in Uganda using social science methods to observe people going about their everyday life. We will interview them in groups and individually about their understanding of the disease, its effects, how they get infected and their current and desired strategies for reducing infections in the whole community. These data will be used to build up a picture of high and low risk practices and perceptions of disease risk, and how practices and perceptions vary by gender, age, occupation and other factors.  In the second part, this information will be incorporated into household surveys to measure what is needed to change an individual&apos;s behaviour. Our methodologies allow us to quantify the ways in which people currently respond to the risks posed by schistosomiasis, and how they might respond if investments in washing, sanitation and hygiene resources in their communities were made. We will also use these models to show how human behaviour is influenced by an understanding of the lifecycle of the parasite, and by knowledge of other people&apos;s behaviour.  Our findings will help us identify &quot;best bets&quot; for investments likely to reduce transmission and re-infection which are likely to work in the long-term. Results will inform future research studies, where these interventions are tried out at village and regional levels. Together the programme of work we plan will inform us on how best to control and potentially eliminate bilharzia in given areas, helping to improve the health of children in infected communities.</narrative>
