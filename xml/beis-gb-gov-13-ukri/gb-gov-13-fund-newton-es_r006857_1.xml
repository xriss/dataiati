   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Learning from small cities: Governing imagined futures and the dynamics of change in India&apos;s smart urban age</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Small cities are becoming the testing ground for governing transitions to &apos;smart&apos; urban futures in India. This two year, interdisciplinary digital and participatory mapping project aims to critically learn from small cities in India through an in-depth investigation into their dynamics of urban change. Strengthening existing foundations between UK and Indian academics and societal partners, the project will learn from three small cities - Shimla, Jalandhar and Nashik, which are all undergoing city-wide retrofitting and area-based improvements in smart technologies and infrastructures as part of India&apos;s national 100 Smart Cities programme. This project will directly address research gaps in the Call themes of Urban planning, governance and management and Small towns, dynamics of change and migration. Using interdisciplinary approaches from urban studies, social and cultural geography, sociology and geoinformatics, it will contribute to evidence based policy related to SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities. It will thus fulfill the following objectives:    1. To produce original, innovative scholarship in urban geography, smart urbanism and postcolonial urban theory by (a) extending research to the much neglected but dynamic context of &apos;small cities&apos;, and (b) enhancing and developing the fields of smart urbanism and urban futures by learning from small cities as they experience far reaching transformations in India.  2. To critically learn from how State, urban authorities and citizens of small cities living through rapid and radical urban transformations imagine and realise new urban futures. Taking an asset-based approach to infrastructure access and provision we will examine how small cities learn to translate state imaginations of urban futures into &apos;actually existing&apos; smart cities, how ordinary citizens in these cities live with the dynamics of these changes, how they value assets (tangible and intangible) and how this combined knowledge might be mobilised towards more sustainable smart cities policies and projects. 3. To produce a detailed evidence base and learn from innovative practices within the three cities that can be communicated widely to policy-makers, practitioners, municipal authorities, civil society organisations and community groups. At the urban scale, we will investigate how the small city learns to innovate not just by integrating smart technologies with urban infrastructure, but also by boosting economic growth, creating capacities for fast development, removing path dependencies, increasing autonomy, and monetizing resources for smart city projects. At the neighbourhood scale, we will critically investigate how ordinary citizens learn to live within the constraints of smart city transformations, but also how they build capacities from the opportunities afforded by smart technologies and infrastructures.   4. To build research capacity on smart cities and urban futures in India and elsewhere. Societal partners are key to the formation, execution and dissemination of this project through access to their networks and their role in the delivery of pathways to impact activities. We will also train local researchers and societal partners and communities to use a range of digital and participatory methodologies including a crowdsourced &apos;Map my Assets&apos; app, conduct Community asset mapping workshops to collect data as well as report findings through writing blogs and journal papers.  5. To develop evidence based policy interventions on smart cities and urban futures in India and elsewhere. A key output will be a &apos;smart city asset toolkit&apos; that will enable communities to speak back to, and inform, smart city planners and policy makers. We will also work with societal partners and local communities to translate the findings into local language pamphlets that make them accessible to lay audiences as well as write blogs and policy briefs for smart city planners.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The coming of an Indian urban age has highlighted the challenges of rapid urbanisation and rural-urban migration in planning for sustainable futures. In India, solutions to this challenge are imagined in two interlinked programmes of Digital India and 100 Smart Cities that claim to present a new &apos;certainty&apos; of governing urban futures. This project begins with the hypothesis that &apos;small cities&apos; are the test-beds of experiments in &apos;futuring&apos;, since a majority of current smart city proposals are in cities with population &lt; 3 million. These small cities present a &apos;double gap&apos; in our knowledge of urban futures since a) there is uncertainty around the role that they will play in delivering on the challenges of India&apos;s urban age, and b) there is a research gap in understanding how their futuring is translated into &apos;actually existing&apos; smart cities in India.  This two year project will critically learn from the dynamics of change in small cities as they are transformed by smart technologies and infrastructures. It will use interdisciplinary approaches from urban, social and cultural geography, as well as sociology and geoinformatics to learn from three small cities - Shimla, Jalandhar and Nashik. Conceptually, we approach &apos;small cities&apos; not as demographically defined entities but as &apos;ordinary cities&apos; with specific social, cultural, political, and historical contexts of &apos;smallness&apos; that has kept them &apos;off the map&apos; of urban studies. This project will focus on three interlinked scales - state, city and citizen through the following research questions:   1. How and why do small cities become the test-beds of state imaginations of India&apos;s urban futures? At a national scale, we will explore how and why state visions of &apos;futuring&apos;, through Digital India and 100 Smart Cities programmes, make specific &apos;assets&apos; in small cities worthy of incubating these imaginaries. Specifically, we will investigate the genealogies of &apos;futuring&apos; in India&apos;s  urbanization and its links to current visions of smart cities.  2. How do small cities translate state imagined urban futures into &apos;actually existing&apos; smart cities?  Building on RQ1, we will explore how small cities imagine their own urban futures, through particular smart city projects. Specifically, we will examine how small cities learn to innovate by championing their &apos;assets&apos; in a competitive international context while negotiating for more autonomous roles in governing their futures.  3. How do citizens of small cities &apos;live with change&apos; induced by smart city developments?  Following on from RQ1 and 2 above, we will investigate how smart city projects are perceived by those citizens who are targets of these projects at the neighbourhood level; how they are experienced, negotiated, challenged and supported. This takes &apos;futuring&apos; as a lived experience of change where everyday knowledge of community assets, resources and infrastructures will be used to inform smart city policies at larger scales.  4. How can we &apos;learn&apos; from small cities to inform practices of &apos;thinking&apos; and &apos;doing&apos; urban policy?   This brings together the above RQs to take learning as a reflective practice in urban theory and policy. Specifically, we will focus on how learning occurs at three interlinked scales of state, city and citizen and how this transform the ways that we might imagine global urban futures.     The project will use a range of interdisciplinary, digital, visual and participatory methodologies. In each of these cities, we will undertake analysis of imagined urban futures through longitudinal mapping and analysis of physical and social transformations, crowdsourced digital and community asset mapping and interviews with stakeholders and &apos;beneficiaries&apos; of smart city projects. The findings will direct specific pathways to impact including an animated infographic of smart city asset toolkit, local language policy briefing pamphlets, dedicated website, blogs, project conference, exhibition and catalogue.</narrative>
