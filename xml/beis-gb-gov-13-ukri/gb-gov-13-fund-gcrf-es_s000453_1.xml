   <narrative xml:lang="EN">GCRF Decent Work: Decent Work in Regional Value Chains: Promoting Public-Private Governance in Sub-Saharan Africa</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The growth of South-South trade involving Southern lead firms and end markets presents critical challenges for the governance of decent work. However, we have limited information on whether the commercial dynamics of domestic and regional value chains (RVCs) coordinated by Southern lead firms undermine decent work. Or do they provide new channels for promoting labour standards through multi-stakeholder public-private alliances based in the global South? Can governance of RVCs in Southern markets become more ethical leading to labour outcomes that support sustainable development? This study aims to address this critical gap by asking: What are the implications of regional and domestic value chains in the global South for public-private governance and regulation of decent work in global production?  This has key policy implications for the potential development of Southern-based multi-stakeholder public-private &apos;ethical trade platforms&apos; to support Sustainable Development Goal 8 (SDG8) on decent work. The research addresses this question on three fronts.  First, empirically it examines South African and Kenyan retailers that coordinate value chains domestically and across the sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) region. African producers have long supplied multi-national companies (MNCs) through global value chains (GVCs). MNCs  apply private governance of social standards (codes of labour practice and fair trade) as a result of civil society campaigns to hold them to account for decent work deficits in GVCs. However, commercial pressures on suppliers to reduce costs and meet delivery criteria often undermine social standards.  Production can shift to suppliers with weak labour rights and intensify use of precarious workers. Private social standards have been largely ineffective in securing decent work for precarious workers, many of whom are women. There are now calls for public governance (national labour regulation and social clauses in trade agreements) to play a greater role. Increasingly SSA suppliers also sell into RVCs coordinated by South African and some Kenyan retailers.  This research focuses on sourcing by South African and Kenyan retailers of horticulture and garments from South Africa, Lesotho and Kenya. It assesses the implications for attaining decent work, especially for precarious female workers.  It examines whether the spread of RVCs imply greater commercial challenges for labour, or could provide a channel for enhancing public-private governance of decent work.  Second, analytically the research advances global value chain and global production network (GPN) approaches to governance combined with gender analysis of decent work for precarious labour. It adapts polycentric analysis of public and private governance of RVCs to incorporate &apos;joint and several&apos; accountability for decent work.  This extends beyond direct employers, involving wider commercial actors that can influence working conditions, including buyers, suppliers and labour contractors across different value chain tiers. It provides an analytical framework for examining governance of decent work in RVCs that overlap with GVCs. This has important implications for analysis of how linkages between public and private governance can be enhanced to support attainment of SDG8.  Third, policy wise the research combines an inter-disciplinary team working in close collaboration with the UK Ethical Trading Initiative (ETI).  ETI has strong connections in sub-Saharan Africa through its company, NGO and trade union members, and with MSIs in South African and Kenya. We aim to provide a research informed contribution to examining how Southern-based multi-stakeholder alliances involving government, commercial and civil society actors could be tailored to South African and Kenyan RVCs.  The research will inform ETI&apos;s 2020 vision of promoting new &apos;ethical trade platforms&apos; in Africa as a new model of sustainable development in support of SDG8 on decent work</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The rise of South-South trade, involving Southern lead firms and end markets, raises a critical challenge for global governance: how can Southern markets be more effectively aligned with ethical and social standards that result in decent work outcomes? Earlier research on global value chains (GVCs), where multinational companies (MNCs) coordinate developing country suppliers, has identified a governance deficit in relation to decent work. Public governance (labour regulation) is often ineffective in a GVC context, and private governance of labour through social standards fails precarious workers, a significant proportion female. Pressure on costs and delivery in GVCs can intensify precarious work.  Growth of South-South trade is linked to a rapid expansion of domestic and regional value chains (RVCs). This raises questions about the way RVCs could be governed. Within sub Saharan Africa (SSA) South African, and to a lesser extent Kenyan, retailers now coordinate suppliers through RVCs, some applying social standards. But little is known about whether the commercial dynamics of RVCs undermine or enhance decent work. This project involves co-production of research and policy analysis by UK, South African and Kenyan academics in collaboration with the UK Ethical Trading Initiative (ETI), an alliance of 100 companies, NGO and trade unions. The aim is to examine whether &apos;ethical trade platforms&apos; based in Africa involving alliances between government actors, firms, and civil society organisations (CSOs), could provide greater synergy between public and private governance of decent work. This vital under-researched topic has important implications for designing public and private policies in support of Sustainable Development Goal 8 (SDG8) on decent work.  The research builds on analysis of governance in GVCs, combined with gender analysis of decent work. It aims to advance analysis of polycentric governance, involving centres of private and public authority, combined with &apos;joint and several accountability&apos; for decent work by buyers and suppliers in RVCs that overlap with GVCs. This has policy implications for examining how Southern-based multi-stakeholder initiatives (MSIs) involving public-private alliances could more effectively promote decent work and sustainable development in the global South. This research gap is addressed through the following key objectives:  1. To examine how sourcing byAfrican lead firms is affecting decent work in RVCs in horticulture and garments in South Africa, Kenya and Lesotho; 2. To assess whether decent work outcomes are shaped through governance by retailers, governments and/or trade agreements linked to RVCs; 3. To examine whether public-private governance initiatives in RVCs could be more effective in promoting decent work for precarious workers, especially women. 4. To extend GVC analysis through an analytical framework of polycentric public-private governance that incorporates joint and several accountability by lead firms and suppliers in RVCs that overlap with GVCs.  5. To examine whether multi-stakeholder alliances and &apos;ethical trade platforms&apos; in Africa involving public-private actors, could more effectively promote attainment of SDG8.  6. To promote capacity building of early career researchers and policy stakeholders within Africa in relation to public-private governance in RVCs that overlap with GVCs. To address these objectives we will undertake comparative research on firms, farms, governments and CSOs in South Africa, Lesotho and Kenya that engage with the garments and horticulture value chains domestically and regionally. In sum, the research aims to examine how multi-stakeholder public-private alliances and &apos;ethical trade platforms&apos; based in Africa, could more effectively promote attainment of SDG8 in a context of shifting end markets to the global South.</narrative>
