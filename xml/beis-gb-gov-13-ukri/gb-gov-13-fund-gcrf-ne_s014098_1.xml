  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Jordan is considered the most water scarce country in the world and water resources are under increasing stress due to increasing population and per capita water consumption, climate change, and ageing infrastructure. Groundwater abstraction is currently almost double the sustainable yield and surface water resources are fully exploited. To exacerbate these problems an influx of conflict refugees entered Jordan from Syria and Iraq in the last 10 years, swelling Jordan&apos;s population of approximately 6 million by around 3 million. International aid provided water infrastructure investment in refugee camps but this increased use impacted Jordan&apos;s available water resources. Failure to plan adequately for the future is leading to continued unsustainable overexploitation of groundwater resources, degradation of groundwater quality, constraining of economic development, and potential political instability which could harm Jordan and the region. Jordan has plans for new infrastructure which will secure additional water resources and ensure that water can be distributed effectively and equitably but their infrastructure plans address only part of the water scarcity challenge; Jordan must also invest in demand management by reducing household, commercial and agricultural water consumption. This could be achieved through reducing wastage and through changing consumption patterns of water consumers.  Effectively combining water supply and demand interventions is not easy as different combinations will perform differently under different assumptions about the future. Jordanian water planners need an efficient and effective way to stress test alternative water plans. This proposal builds on the Jordan Water Project (JWP) (2013-2017) which was funded by NERC (NE/L009285/2), the U.S. National Science Foundation and other national funders in the context of a Belmont Forum and led by Stanford University. The JWP built a national water planning model of Jordan, unique in its ability to help planners understand and predict system performance and to test policy and water infrastructure investment alternatives. This grant application secures the gains achieved by the JWP model by preparing it to be sustainably hosted and used in practice by the Jordanian Ministry of Water and Irrigation (MWI), the main local project partner. The central objective of the JWP was to build an integrated planning model reflecting hydrologic, institutional and economic behaviour at the sub-district spatial scale through to 2050. The purpose of the model was to quantify freshwater supply and demand changes due to hydrological, institutional and economic scenarios and interventions (policy or infrastructure changes). In addition to representing the national hydrological and engineered water resource system, the JWP model is able to represent its links to the economic, institutional, and social aspects of water planning in Jordan over space and time. The model is of unique scale and scope in its ability to account for direct and indirect impacts of consumer decisions by simulating the feedback between consumers, policy makers and the Jordanian water system.   The proposed work is divided into three &apos;Work Packages&apos; (1) development of the browser-based graphical user interface (GUI) for system, data and results visualisation; (2) model improvements and extensions; and (3) knowledge exchange and capacity building for using the JWP model portal for strategic water security planning. Impact will be achieved through working with MWI colleagues, knowledge exchange workshops with MWI employees and contractors, publications, and conference presentations.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Our end goal is to increase Jordan&apos;s water security defined as reducing the economic, social and political cost of water scarcity now and in the future. Our aim is to improve the capacity for state-of-the-art water resources planning and management in Jordan&apos;s Ministry for Water and Irrigation (MWI) by enabling them to simulate socio-economic impacts of water management and planning interventions (new policies or infrastructure) including the behaviours of water management institutions and water consumers in addition to the biophysical aspects of the water resources system. This can be achieved by improving the accessibility and usability of an existing integrated national hydro-economic-institutional simulation model (called the Jordan Water Project &apos;JWP&apos; model) that was funded by a previous NERC &apos;Belmont&apos; fund project.  The concrete objectives of this project are:   1. Make the JWP model easier to use by providing a modern open-source browser-based graphical user interface (GUI) and visualisation tools to help assess water interventions more intuitively. 2. Collaborate with MWI to improve and extend JWP modelling performance and capabilities for advanced analyses. 3. Transfer knowledge of the model GUI and visualisation tools to MWI in partnership with FUSE and JordanCap projects (other JWP follow-on projects). The browser-based GUI will allow MWI analysts to access system data in a secure and modern environment and use the integrated JWP model to simulate and visualise the impacts (spatially and temporally) of water resources development and policy-making decisions on a wide range of water consumers and economic sectors. It will facilitate the rapid updating and saving of input data on future scenarios and interventions (policies, development). Finally, the tools will enable co-creation, knowledge exchange, and co-learning by researchers and MWI employees. Whether they are in the UK, Jordan, or elsewhere they will be able to view the same analysis online and make rapid progress towards understanding Jordan&apos;s water challenge and enhancing water security in Jordan. The work is divided into three &apos;Work Packages&apos; aligned with the objectives above: (1) development of the graphical user interface (GUI) for system, data and results visualisation; (2) model improvements and extensions; and (3) knowledge exchange and capacity building for using the JWP model portal for strategic water security planning.  Work package 1 (&apos;WP1&apos;) will develop a browser-based GUI which hosts the JWP model and enables MWI staff to view and edit input data, run the model, save results of different model scenarios (different futures and/or different combinations of interventions), and view model outputs using a range of customised interactive visualisations. It will enable MWI staff and their contractors to collaboratively evaluate and stress test possible water management interventions aimed at reducing water scarcity from remote locations. WP2 involves collaborating with MWI to identify desirable improvements in the model, intended to include speeding up the model runtime by optimising code, connecting new optimisation solvers to drive the model and enabling multiple concurrent model runs on the cloud to reduce computing time. WP3 enables co-development of strategic plans using the JWP model through the GUI in partnership with two complementary ongoing initiatives which also build on the NERC Belmont-funded JWP project - FUSE (Food-water-energy for Urban Sustainable Environments) research project led by Stanford University, and the JordanCap capacity building programme of the Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research (UFZ). We worked successfully with both these partners on the JWP project and share common goals and a vision of continued partnership with MWI.</narrative>
