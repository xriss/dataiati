  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Despite extensive research on insecticidal compounds, insecticide application regimes, and genetically modified crops, insects continue to evolve resistance against control agents with predictable regularity. Novel, sustainable, and resilient approaches to crop protection are urgently required to secure and maintain future crop productivity in Brazil.   Our stage 1 bid explored how variable fungal biopesticides in combination with host crop heterogeneity can be used to make selection for insecticide resistance inconsistent. The primary aims of our stage 2 proposal address the long-term prospects of this novel solution.    In order to do this, we have three main objectives:  1. We will demonstrate that heterogeneous environments produced by crop and fungal biopesticide combinations can delay the evolution of resistance in the long term.  Our stage 1 project will deliver a proof-of-concept: by varying biopesticide strains and host crop plants, it is possible to create fluctuating selection landscapes that greatly reduce directional selection for resistance on crop pests.  However, the genetic architecture of resistance traits can itself evolve; for example, recombination between host genotypes resistant to different fungal strains could lead to cross resistance to multiple biopesticides. Therefore, the enormous evolutionary potential of insect pests justifies research on the long-term sustainability of our proposed system. To address this challenge, we will combine laboratory studies to measure the long-term stability of the genetic architecture that delays resistance evolution with individual based modelling that clarifies the scale of heterogeneity needed to sustain susceptible alleles. We will also use DNA sequencing approaches to assess whether the genomic basis of pathogen resistance varies under different fungal isolate - crop type combinations.   2. We will demonstrate that our fungal isolates are suitable for commercial production, that we can deliver them viably in the field, and that they control pests at the field scale.  Our stage 1 work will show that by applying multiple fungal isolate strains to H. armigera feeding on multiple crop species, selection for pesticide resistance could be weakened or averted. In this section, we will assess the suitability of these isolates for industrial production and field application, examine technological solutions for overcoming constraints on fungal biopesticide effectiveness in Brazilian climatic conditions, and demonstrate field-scale control of Brazilian pests with our newly developed strains.  3. We will identify social and economic barriers in the agricultural community to uptake of this pest control system, and investigate solutions to overcome these barriers.   The benefits of adopting practices to limit resistance evolution are only realised in the medium to long term, and are contingent on cooperation amongst farmers. Our sustainable pest control solution requires farmers to adopt novel biopesticide products for pest control, spray multiple biopesticide isolates, and diversify crop production. We will estimate direct economic consequences of our proposed approach, and research methods to encourage this behaviour change by investigating short term benefits of our pest control technology, the operational consequences of changes in practice, the efficacy of regulatory and economic incentives, and the factors that moderate behavioural change by stakeholders in the Brazilian agricultural sector.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Despite its place as a global leader in agriculture, each year the Brazilian agricultural economy loses approximately $15 billion to insect crop pest outbreaks. Indeed, insects consume 10-20% of all global crops while growing or in storage. Current agricultural practices in Brazil rely heavily on widespread pesticide application, which has led to the evolution of pesticide resistance in several significant insect pests. Such practices undermine the sustainability of important crop pest control technologies, reduce associated economic returns, and exacerbate the risks to economic production and food security in Brazil. We propose a revolutionary approach to pest management that will enhance the sustainability and long-term resilience of crop production, providing the benefit of managing insect pests more predictably.  Our solution comes from evolutionary science and the particular features of host-pathogen interactions. Insecticide resistance evolution occurs when a single control agent is applied over a broad area, then consistent evolutionary pressures drive rare resistance genes to spread rapidly through the pest population. To prevent these sweeps of resistant alleles, we are investigating how multiple fungal pathogen strains can be used in a spatial matrix across agricultural landscapes, so that selection for resistance varies in different locations, preventing a uniform evolutionary response. On their own, multiple pathogen strains may not be sufficient because of cross resistance: genes making pests resistant to one fungal strain could also confer resistance to others. However, in host-pathogen systems, the optimum genotype to defend against one pathogen is often highly sensitive to the organism&apos;s environment. Simultaneous manipulation of an environmental landscape variable (the type of crop grown by farmers) will substantially decrease the consistency of selection: we predict this will prevent resistance evolution.  In order to achieve real-world effectiveness of this pest control system, an integrated team of Brazilian and UK researchers will work together to establish the long-term prospects of our new solution. The aims are to:  1. Examine whether genetic variation for insect susceptibility to multiple fungal biopesticides under heterogeneous agricultural landscapes is stable, and assess how it responds to selection in the long-term. This will allow us to anticipate and avoid selection for resistance to multiple strains, and ensure the long-term sustainability of our pesticide resistance management system.  2. Investigate the suitability of fungal biopesticides for industrial scale production and field application in Brazil, which will facilitate product development for future industrial investment. We will also provide farmers and the crop protection industry with solutions for crop protection technology deployment, including improved delivery systems, higher pest control consistency and enhanced performance under field conditions.  3. Identify the barriers to uptake of our new pest control technologies and research methods to encourage farmer behavioural change. This research will provide economic and social science data to underpin advice for policy recommendations regarding incentive schemes, publicity campaigns and marketing strategies, thereby promoting uptake of these sustainable pest management practices.</narrative>
