   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Mun river basin in Northeast Thailand is a prime example of the area impacted by hydro-meteorological hazards. Its specific vulnerability lies in the fact that its upstream parts are more prone to droughts, whereby the downstream part of the basin is a flood risk zone. About 80 to 90% of rice cultivation area in the Mun river basin is rain-fed. Rainfall in the study area is highly erratic both in space and time even though the annual average amount is near to the norm of Thailand. This unevenness has serious effects on rice production, living conditions and income of farmers who are the main population in the region.  ENRICH will bring together expertise and experience from UK and Thailand in the areas of climate variability and climate change, floods and drought modelling and water resources management. The ultimate aim of this project is to establish a strong collaboration and exchange of knowledge between the University of Exeter and AIT, to develop innovative integrated solutions to address the pressing problem of hydro-meteorological extremes and adaptation strategies and measures in the Mun river basin. The proposed project will address the following research questions:  - What are the main environmental drivers affecting the meteorological and climate variability and change in Northeast of Thailand? - What are possible hydro-meteorological scenarios and extremes in future in the study area? What is the level of confidence that the projected changes can be attributed to environmental and climate changes? - What are the expected changes in hydro-meteorological hazards and risks due to future climatic extremes? - What are the possible and plausible adaptation strategies and measures to improve climate resilience in the study basin? In line with the recent policy and planning of the Royal Irrigation Department and Department of Water Resources of Thailand, this study will investigate drought hazard due to future climate change, and its impacts on vulnerability and risk in the study area. Furthermore, analysis on current adaptive measures and recommendation for further improvement to cope with future climate change will be produced.  The proposed two and a half year research programme will be realized through four integrated Work Packages (WPs):   WP1 Land use changes    WP2 Climate variability and climate change    WP3 Hydrometeorological extremes   WP4 Adaptation strategies based on the synthesis of results  The ENRICH team will work closely with the Thai Department of Water Resources and the Royal Irrigation Department, from the project inception workshop, through data acquisition and analysis and finally during the dissemination phase, so that the outputs can be taken up.  Two public participation meetings will be organised in the study area with local stakeholders - farmers, industries, local line agencies at provincial/district levels etc. - to understand the hydro-meteorological hazards related issues (at the start of the project), and discuss adaptation measures (towards the end of the project while developing the adaptation strategies and measures) with them.  Whilst ENRICH is a stand-alone initiative that can be completed independently, from an early stage it will seek cooperation with other projects funded within this programme to identify the potential for synergies through sharing data and expertise.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="RESEARCH AIM  The overarching aim of this project is to understand the impact of the combined stressors of climate variability, climate change and land-use change on hydro-meteorological extremes in the Mun River Basin and to recommend adaptation measures to enable sustainable management of water resources and improve water security in the coming decades. This will be achieved by:  - Exploiting state-of-the-art global climate model simulations to advance our understanding of drivers of meteorological and climate variability and change in Thailand. The focus will be on changes in mean rainfall, monsoon systems and variability associated with the El Ni&#xF1;o Southern Oscillation and the Madden Julian Oscillation.  - Using the output from state-of-the-art climate models and land-use change scenarios to drive hydrological models that combine information from hydro-meteorological and land-use stressors to quantify future changes in hydrological extremes. - Assessing vulnerability and risk for these combined stressors and produce recommendations for adaptation.  OBJECTIVES  1.1 Gather and process all available information and data on recent land-use changes in the Mun river basin and collect information about population trends in the basin.  1.2 Obtain the latest plans for both agricultural development and urban growth in the basin until 2050. 1.3 Create a series of possible land-use change scenarios in the basin.    2.1 Perform a process-based evaluation of the ability of CMIP6 models to simulate the mean climate in Northeast of Thailand. Models assessed will include both standard (DECK) and high-resolution (HighResMIP) versions. Metrics will be developed that evaluate key aspects of large-scale model climate and their driving processes e.g. monsoon flows. 2.2 Extend the assessment of mean climate evaluation to assess the MJO and ENSO in CMIP6 models using DECK and ScenarioMIP experiments and the impact of MJO and extreme ENSO events on Northeast Thailand rainfall. Adopt the same process-based philosophy as in 2.1. 2.3 Provide an assessment of future changes in mean, variability and rainfall extremes in Northeast Thailand as derived from the new CMIP6 models and simulations linked to their ability to simulate present-day climate. A time horizon of 2050 will be the focus due to its relevance for adaptation planning and actions.  3.1 Evaluate impacts of climate variability and land-use change on streamflow and hydrological extremes, and hydrologic alteration. 3.2 Evaluate the combined impacts of climate change and ENSO on agricultural and hydro-meteorological droughts and its consequences under different land-use scenarios.  4.1  Synthesise the results of the land-use, climate and extremes work packages (WP1-3) and produce an assessment of future risks from these factors. 4.2  Develop vulnerability and risk maps for drought as derived from the new CMIP6 model simulations and future development in the Mun River Basin.  4.3  Provide an accessible assessment of adaptation strategies and measures for drought risk reduction management in the basin."></capital-spend>
