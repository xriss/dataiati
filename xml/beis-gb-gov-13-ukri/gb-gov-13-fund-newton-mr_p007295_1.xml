   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is now deemed to be the biggest global threat facing humanity in the 21C. AMR has taken centre stage as a global health issue yet most non-specialists are unaware the impact AMR will have on global populations and the potential it has of taking humanity back to the &quot;dark ages&quot;. Recent announcements from Prime Minister David Cameron, the UK Chief Medical Officer (Professor Sally Davies), and the US president, Barak Obama, is clear evidence that we are loosing one of medicines precious resources. Therefore, in keeping with the general notion of &quot;One World Health&quot;, there clearly needs to a better alignment of thinking and closer co-operation between countries synergizing activities, knowledge and skills to better understand and prevent AMR.   Hitherto, most studies around the world studying the impact of AMR have been small, one dimensional and often biased -too focused on AMR bacteria as oppose to studying the whole bacterial population. Very recently, we published an article with our Chinese colleagues heralding the breech of the last antibiotic, colisitin, that is used to treat the very serious infections caused by already resistant bacteria such as Escherichia coli (commonly known as E. coli). The difference with this new discovery is that the mechanism of colistin resistance (named MCR-1) is mobile i.e. can be readily passed around from one bacteria to another - even between distantly related bacteria.   Following on from this discovery and using the same network of Chinese colleagues, hospitals and faming sectors, we intend to use MCR-1 (MCRPE) and carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (E. coli and E. coli-like bacteria)(CRE) as markers to understand how it has spread throughout the Chinese animal population (colistin is used in animal feed in China). Firstly, we have a comprehensive sampling platform:  work package (WP) 1, primary and secondary care infections; WP2, normal flora carriage; WP3, chicken farms and slaughter houses; WP4, retail meat; WP5 Environmental sampling. We will analyze at least 100 samples every 3 months to examine seasonal variation and sample from three distinct provinces in China: Shandong, Zhejiang and Guangdong.  Bacteria will be analyzed by basic microbiology techniques and selected to be whole genome sequenced where we can interrogate the bacteria&apos;s whole DNA and compare it to other bacteria to see if they have spread from one sector (e.g. flies) to another (e.g. humans). This study will also sequence all the bacteria in the human gut to understand the dynamics of AMR bacterial populations. We will also undertake controlled experiments in chicken farms to monitor the spread on CRE and MRCPE and use mathematical models to understand how AMR spreads in animals. Importantly, the Chinese government is likely to withdraw colistin from animal feed so this study is very timely in measuring that effect i.e. will withdrawing colistin impact on MCRPE rates in the environment, human gut levels and MCRPE causing human infections?    Unlike previous studies, this study is deliberately holistic in its approach so as to understand the dynamics and transmission of AMR across a broad range of environmental and human sectors. This study will let us understand the impact of CRE and MCRPE on human populations and the burden and cost to the Chinese health system. It will also help us understand the impact AMR on the chicken and pig trade by using mathematical models. The impact of this study will have immense consequences for the animal, human and economic sectors in China. Our network is well established, has a proven track record of working together in China and expertise to undertake this exciting and challenging proposal.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Our network has been aware of the growing issue of colistin resistance in China and recently discovered the world&apos;s first mobile colistin resistance mechanism, MCR-1. (Liu YY, Wang Y, Walsh TR et al., Emergence of plasmid-mediated colistin resistance mechanism MCR-1 in animals and human beings in China: a microbiological and molecular biological study. Lancet Infect Dis. 2016;16 (2):161-8). Previous studies in China have been limited in size and often biased (limited to resistant bacteria only). Therefore, there is clearly a critical need for a holistic and integrated approach to understand that transition of antimicrobial resistance between animal and human sectors in China.  This project addresses this critical need with the following objectives:    1. To determine the prevalence and assess the clinical impact (risk factor associations and outcomes) of carbapenem resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) and mobile colistin resistant positive Enterobacteriaceae (MCRPE) in Chinese patients across three Chinese provinces (Shandong, Zhejiang and Guangdong). We will examine both primary and secondary care patients studying key risk factors to assess associations and outcomes with CRE and MCRPE.   2. To determine the fecal carriage rates of CRE and MCRPE) in Chinese healthy volunteers across three Chinese provinces (Shandong, Zhejiang and Guangdong) and the risk factors for carriage (diet, sanitation, proximity to farms etc.).   3. To understand the main drivers of CRE/MCRPE transmission between animal production/retail/supply and human primary/secondary care by comparing resistance genes, plasmids and strains types (MLST).  We aim to sequence between 2200 and 2400 bacterial genomes in total to gain a better understanding of strain relatedness between human, animal and environmental sectors.      4. To understand the impact of MCRPE on therapeutic colistin use in humans when it is deployed in Chinese hospitals (summer/autumn 2016) and whether MCR-1 mediates clinical resistance. Our sampling strategy will start at the beginning of the proposed Chinese ban on colistin from animal feeds; therefore, we are perfectly placed over the next 30 months (sampling platform) to monitor examine whether there is a decrease in MCRPE from animals, retail meat and human gut flora.   5. To correlate CRE/MCRPE spread in the Chinese environment (poultry and porcine) and how is this affected by seasonal variation i.e. are flies responsible for CRE/MCRPE dissemination? We will not only examine the prevalence of CRE and MCRPE in animal, meat and environmental sectors but will correlate this with temperature, rainfall and in particular the Chinese fly population as our pilot studies have found high levels MCRPE in flies and may act a possible source of contamination.   6. To determine how rapidly CRE/MCRPE transmission occurs in chicken houses, what are the factors influencing transmission and can we apply mathematical models to understand its spread? This will not adversely affect the health of the birds but will allow us to apply mathematical models to examine how MCRPE spreads. We also have the opportunity to alter the chicken feed including traditional Chinese medicines and examine whether this has a positive impact on the spread of MCRPE.    7. To investigate how MCR-1 protect bacteria from colistin, and in which species/strains can this occur and whether MCRPE are altered in their fitness, virulence and pathogenicity? As MCR-1 modifies the outermembrane and lipidA, it is likely to have an effect on the bacteria&apos;s pathogenicity. This will be tested mechanistically by mutating MCR-1 and examining the pathogenicity of MCR-1 in select bacteria.   8. To develop mathematical models to predict the socioeconomic impact (dissemination in the animal and humans) of CRE and MCRPE on the Chinese health sector and economy in the medium to long term (2020, 2030).</narrative>
