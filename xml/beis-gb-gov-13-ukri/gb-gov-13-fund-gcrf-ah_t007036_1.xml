   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Eco-Hammam: Engaging key stakeholders with bespoke low-carbon technologies for lighting, heating and water recycling to sustain a Moroccan heritage</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This impact and engagement project follows on from developments arising from a previous AHRC funded project (AH/D503019/1) during which all the surviving and still functioning historic public bathhouses of the North African heritage cities of Marrakech, Algiers, Tunis, Tripoli, and Cairo were surveyed and documented. One of the key findings of this previous research was that heritage hammams in the Maghreb historic cities continue to be an important living heritage in the 21st Century, providing a much-needed affordable facility for the hygiene and wellbeing of the economically disadvantaged population.  However, the hammams are increasingly facing serious challenges that are likely to lead to their closure and disappearance after having been sustained for many centuries. Amongst these challenges are the increased costs of fuel (wood or diesel) and water (Sibley and Sibley 2015). This current proposal is based on new developments that have emerged from the UN climate change conference COP22, held in Marrakech 2016, when Moroccan hammams were presented as major contributors to air pollution, deforestation and environmental degradation as well as to high water consumption and water wastage. It was estimated at COP22 that Morocco has at least 12,000 hammams, operating with wood burning vernacular furnaces.  The main aim of this project is to facilitate the acceleration of ecological transitions processes in Moroccan hammams (both heritage and newly built ones). This will be achieved through the establishment of regional key stakeholders&apos; networks in each of Rabat, Fez and Marrakech in order to creatively engage them to communicate and co-produce integrated strategies for multi-sectorial coordinated actions for energy transition, enhanced indoor conditions for improved hammam workers and users health and safety and well-being  and responsible water consumption and recycling. Four objectives are set as follows:  1. Establish, in collaboration with the local project partners, a data base of key regional stakeholders and establish social media and web platforms in order to facilitate communication and exchanges between these stakeholders, both pre- and post-regional engagement events, and across regions. 2. Conduct one set of three-day regional public engagement and network facilitation events, involving 120 key regional stakeholders in each of the world heritage cities of Rabat, Fez and Marrakech within three months intervals during the one-year period of the project (see project timetable). These events will be designed and delivered to act as catalysts for self-sustaining coordinated regional processes. Each day of the three-day engagement and impact event will focus on a key area for ecological transition: energy transition; improved indoor conditions; and, responsible water consumption and recycling.  The three events will bring together for the first time various hammam stakeholders in each of the three regions to engage them to creatively coproduce practical strategies and establish self-sustaining regional networks that will facilitate energy transitions and accelerate the adoption of hammam ecological practices.  3. Co-produce with the National Moroccan Agency for Energy Efficiency a toolkit for hammam ecological transition as well as a rating system for the acquisition of the label of Ecological Hammam 4. Co-monitor Hammam stakeholders&apos; social media and web platforms for feedback on events, discussions and follow on initiatives in order to measure the impact of each regional public engagement event soon after its completion and in the duration of the project. Creative engagement will include, the involvement of multidisciplinary and multi-sectorial teams of facilitators who will be working with the participants of regional events to co-produce ecological transition scenarios. These will be based on real case study hammam which will be selected in each of the three cities of Rabat, Fez and Marrakech.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This impact and engagement project follows on from developments arising from a previous AHRC funded project during which all the surviving and still functioning historic hammams (public bathhouses)of the North African heritage cities were surveyed and documented by the PI. Morocco is where the largest number of still functioning heritage hammams was surveyed and where new hammams are part of the cluster of key urban facilities introduced in every newly residential neighbourhood. This proposal is based on new developments that have emerged from the UN climate change conference COP22, held in Marrakech 2016 and during which Moroccan hammams were presented as major contributors to air pollution, deforestation and environmental degradation as well as high water consumption and wastage. It was estimated at COP22  that Morocco has at least 12 000 hammams, operating with wood burning traditional furnaces.  Each hammam consumes on average 1.5 tonnes of wood and between 60 to 120 cubic meter of water per day. The accumulated environmental impact of  hammams is significant. Various un-coordinated attempts were made by both National and International Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency organisations to reduce their environmental impact by facilitating their energy transition. However, it is estimated today that only 67 hammams out of the 12 000 have made some progress in their energy transition. The main aim of this Follow-on Funding for Impact and Engagement is to facilitate the acceleration of ecological transitions processes in Moroccan hammams. This will be achieved through the establishment of regional key stakeholders&apos; networks in each of Rabat, Fez and Marrakech in order to creatively engage them to communicate and co-produce integrated strategies for multi-sectorial coordinated actions for energy transition, enhanced indoor conditions and responsible water consumption and recycling. This project aims to accomplish the following four objectives:  1.Establish a data base of  regional key stakeholders and design social media and web platforms in order to facilitate interaction between them during the one year duration of the project. 2.Conduct 3 sets of three-day regional public engagement and network facilitation events with 120 stakeholders in each of Rabat, Fez and Marrakech.  Each of the three days will focus on one specific area of ecological transition: energy transition; improved indoor conditions for health, safety and well being; responsible water consumption and recycling. An engagement case study hammam will be  used in each region to form the focus of multi-stakeholders&apos; co-production of realistic and feasible scenarios for ecological transitions. These events are designed to act as catalysts for self-sustaining coordinated regional processes and networks that will accelerate energy transition and  ecological practices 3.Co-monitor social media and web platforms for hammam stakeholders to assess the impact of regional events. 4.Co-produce with the National Moroccan Agency for Energy Efficiency a toolkit for hammam ecological transition and a rating system for  Eco-Hammam labelling. The combination of these separate actions will facilitate an integrated approach towards the co-production of holistic eco-hammam practices and the acceleration of their implementation.  This project has the potential to be extended to other Maghreb countries of Algeria, Tunisia and Libya where the hammam is still a living heritage. This proposal is GCRF and ODA compliant and meets 3 of the 5 GCRF categories for equitable access to sustainable development namely: sustainable health and well-being; clean air; water and sanitation; affordable, reliable, sustainable energy.</narrative>
