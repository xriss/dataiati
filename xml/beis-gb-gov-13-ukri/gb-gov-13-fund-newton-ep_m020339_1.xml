   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Operational strategy update for marine energy converters based on dynamic reliability assessment through integration of Structural Health Monitoring</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The objectives of the project are summarised as follows:  - Study extreme environmental phenomena and model resources for integration to the assessment model that will be derived. - Analyse the existing structural configuration and develop an overall Structural Health Monitoring system (&quot;hot spot&quot; locations and quantities for monitoring). - Build simulation models at a component and system level considering appropriate limit states (ie fatigue and ultimate strength assessment etc). - Create a reliability calculation model to allow consideration not only of operational conditions but also taking into consideration the impact of extreme events. - Utilizing real data already gathered during the testing phase of this system, consider scenarios of events for reliability re-assessment. - Projecting existing data to a service life scenario, suggest variation of operational strategy based on the estimated reliability values. - Create a plan for implementation of SHM system on a wave energy system of larger scale than the prototype which is currently under-development from the Chinese partners.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project aims to develop a framework that will integrate data collected and recorded through a Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) system for marine energy converters, in order to estimate reliability levels at component and system level in real time and evaluate its ability to further fulfil its intended function. Obtaining a more well-informed understanding of the actual state of the system, alternative operational strategies can be adopted, particularly taking into consideration its residual capacity after extreme environmental events, optimizing its inspection and maintenance scheduling and hence reducing the OPEX. Application of the developed framework on an existing prototype wave device, already developed by the Chinese partners, will allow its validation and extension to future applications. This reference case will be employed in order to classify its components and determine potential failure modes and limit states to assess failure. From the key failure mechanisms that will be identified,  arrangements for Structural Health Monitoring will be proposed obtaining data from relevant measurements (ie strains and accelerations) that can then inform the reliability evaluation in real time, updating its operational strategy, particularly taking into consideration residual capacity after extreme environmental events. Outcome of the project will be a generic framework applicable to a range of marine energy devices.</narrative>
