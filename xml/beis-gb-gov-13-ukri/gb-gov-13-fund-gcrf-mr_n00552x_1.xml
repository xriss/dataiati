   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Supportive supervision of mid level health workers in rural Nepal for improved job satisfaction, motivation and quality of care.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">1. To describe current systems of supervision for mid level health workers, and explore how they could be improved to support mid level health workers 2. To conduct a realist review of the national, international, grey and academic literature about what works to provide supportive supervision, develop theory around how interventions work and identify potentially effective interventions for Nepal 3. To learn from national pilot projects that aim to support mid level health workers 4. To explore how a lack of supportive supervision of mid level health workers affects health service provision and quality of care 5. To explore how mid level health workers prefer to be supervised, and how district managers and central level stakeholders envisage better supporting mid level health workers 6. To explore the management needs of different mid level cadres, and different genders of health worker in consideration of intervention development.  7. To collaborate with experts and national stakeholders to model intervention designs, costs, and evaluation frameworks.  8. To investigate what tools and training would be required to better support mid levels and what systems changes would need to occur for supportive supervision to be developed. 9. To explore willingness to make systems changes for different interventions. 10. To define the outcomes we would expect to change on the basis of our intervention 11. To develop a theory of change for each intervention identified. 12. To explore potential sources of funding and identify pilot districts where the interventions could be tested. 13. To disseminate the results of our primary data collection, and our learning from the participatory development of interventions.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Many low-income countries are suffering from shortages of health workers in rural areas. To expand access to health care, mid level health workers with up to three years training are being expected to complete tasks that higher cadres of health worker would usually undertake. Yet these cadres are largely ignored at a policy level. To enable these health workers to fulfill their potential and provide good quality care, they need to be adequately supported and supervised. Research suggests that health workers may respond better to supervision if their supervisor is aware of their emotional needs, and they build trust through listening, empathy and responding to their individual concerns (Cummings et al. 2010).   This development grant will enable us to develop supportive supervision interventions for mid level health workers in rural Nepal, which will then be implemented through existing systems and evaluated in subsequent research. We will conduct a review of the literature using a realist methodology to understand for whom and in what circumstances interventions work. This will inform the development of supportive supervision interventions in Nepal. We will collect data from policy makers, programme implementers, managers, and health workers to describe existing systems, their weaknesses and collate the learning from national pilot interventions. This information will be discussed in a working group of government and non government participants who will meet regularly. This will help us to develop feasible interventions that have a broad level of support. A health economist will then model intervention costs. Interventions will be presented, debated and prioritised in a workshop with participants from the district and central level. On finalising interventions, a methodology will be designed to evaluate and understand the effect of these interventions, with input from experts and the working group. Funding sources will be identified to implement the interventions and research the effect of a supportive supervision intervention for mid level health workers in rural Nepal. We will disseminate our learning from this process through international peer reviewed publications, briefing papers, conferences and social media.</narrative>
