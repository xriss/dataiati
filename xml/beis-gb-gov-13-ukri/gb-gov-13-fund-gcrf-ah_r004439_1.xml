   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Language, Gender and Leadership Network will enhance economic development and the welfare of women and girls in LMICs by identifying the key challenges facing them in order for them to become a successful generation of leaders in businesses and politics in Africa and beyond. The Network&apos;s creation will provide an innovative opportunity for academics, policy makers, NGOs, charities and other stakeholders to focus on the core communicative skills required to succeed as leaders in businesses and politics in LMICs, through a focus on the sociolinguistics of narrative life histories. A foundational principle of the Network is to place the voices and stories of women and girls at its core. The narratives that will be focused upon span adolescence, early adulthood and later adulthood and bring together stories told by women and girls about their gender identities to investigate emergent patterns, where key information regarding language, gender identity and leadership can be analysed. We aim to inform and influence policy makers of the gender-based inequality challenges currently being faced, alongside equipping communities of women and girls with the aspirations, role-models and beliefs required to succeed in future leadership positions.   Our goals align with key criteria for bringing sustainable change in international development, identified by the UN&apos;s Sustainable Development Agenda 2030, the World Humanitarian Summit and UN Women&apos;s World Survey on the Role of Women in Development (WSRWiD 2014): if sustainable development and gender equality are ever to be achieved, research and interventions are required to embrace women&apos;s equal participation as leaders and decision-makers within their societies. Communication is a fundamental way in which legitimate participation in public domains is measured and achieved. Without maximizing the potential of its women and girls within businesses and politics, sustainable economic development will not result.  The Network&apos;s initial focus is upon narratives from Uganda and Kenya, both in receipt of ODA, and where core members of the Network already have well-established links across both urban and rural communities, where narrative data capture already exists. We then shift our focus to a pan-African perspective. An interactive, globally accessible website will be developed, where participants from Africa and other global countries who receive ODA funding will be able to join and actively engage in online communities by uploading their own narratives to share experiences, act as peer supporters, role models, mentors and figures of inspiration for each other. The long-term legacy will be the production of a unique, sustainable digital research tool. Alongside this, to address those living in remote communities currently without electricity or Internet acccess, the network will co-create drama-based training interventions and a graphic narrative &apos;storybook&apos; with women and girls themselves. These will then be used as empowerment and inspirational tools by our Project Partner, The Institute of Social Transformation and other charities, NGOs and professional organisations working on addressing gender inequalities in rural communities.  The resultant website and resources will be a unique corpus of oral life-history narratives from women and girls ranging from those who have already succeeded in leadership positions and have strong leadership reputations, through to adolescent girls in schools who could be future leaders with the right levels of empowerment, education and training. This approach enables previously marginalized and silenced voices to be heard and placed at the centre of the Network. Our findings will also be used as a resource to influence and inform policy-making decisions, through the network&apos;s contacts at UN Women Africa and through our Project Consultant&apos;s role as policy maker and member of the pan-African Trade &amp; Impact Group and the African Leadership Network.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Language, Gender and Leadership Network will place the previously unheard voices of women and girls at its centre. It will use innovative sociolinguistic methods of narrative data capture to investigate issues of language, gender identities and leadership in developing countries. This approach involves encompassing a focus on life history narratives, designed to capture the complexities of the issues involved in bringing about gender equality in terms of leadership roles and positions within African societies and beyond. By bringing together a number of academic and non-academic collaborators, the Language, Gender and Leadership Network will identify crucial barriers to career aspirations, to acquiring a role in public life and to career progression, as identified by women and girls themselves, alongside a consideration of how key barriers can be successfully navigated. As part of this process, we will identify exemplars of inspirational narratives of best practice, as decided upon by focus groups of women and girls themselves, in collaboration with the core Network management team.   The Network aims to bring together pan-African stakeholders, including key figures from politics and businesses, to act as role models, figures of inspiration and examples of best practice to inspire other women and girls. The link between empowering women and the successful economic development of a country is well-documented (e.g.,The World Bank 2016). Through collating stories of success, particularly narratives of successful economic growth through women&apos;s entrepreneurialism, activism and mentoring, another of the Network&apos;s objectives is to demonstrate how collectively empowering women and girls to strive for leadership roles in businesses, organisations and political spheres can enable societies to reap significantly increased financial benefits quickly and effectively. Another key objective is to aid access to role models and mentors for young people and women in Uganda, where, due to periods of major civil unrest and its significant death toll, 78% of the population are under 30. Older role models and mentors are thus unusual and are often very difficult to come by.  The Network will develop and launch a major wiki-style website that will continue to grow 5+ years beyond the project. It will be designed to demonstrate the power of online, community-based activism and how digital transformations can empower previously marginalised groups. The launch of a major interactive website at the third and final conference will showcase the capture of narrative data so far, promoting the value of community-based activism and how digital transformations can enable previously oppressed groups to empower themselves. Alongside the launch of the website, the Network will also launch a set of practical training materials to empower women and girls at various stages of their education and career development through the lens of storytelling, via a graphic narrative story book and drama training. The narrative story book and drama training resources will be co-created and will form the basis of future training interventions in rural communities.  The production of these resources aims to inspire members of local communities to be creative, innovative and entrepreneurial by giving them active roles as co-creators, working alongside illustrators to co-produce these training resources. This includes representatives from rural communities attending focus group sessions, embedded as a core part of the first two events, who will decide upon the most inspirational stories to be used for the graphic narrative creation. They will work with a local illustrator to co-create this process. These resources will be of practical use to local NGOs, charities and educationalists, encouraging creativity and enterprise, especially in hard to reach, rural communities with poor literacy levels.</narrative>
