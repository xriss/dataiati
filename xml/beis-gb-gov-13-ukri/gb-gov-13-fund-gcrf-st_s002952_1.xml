   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Namibian participation in the H.E.S.S. observatory 2019-2021</narrative>

  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Our objective is to undertake a research project on two of the most mysterious topics in the physics of relativistic jets - first, fast very-high-energy variability, and second, the potential acceleration of the highest-energy particles by processes within jets.   We will conduct this research project by significantly increasing the host-country participation in the High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.), the world&apos;s leading gamma-ray observatory, which to date has been operated almost exclusively by visiting astronomers from developed countries.   Our specific objectives are:  - To investigate models of fast TeV variability that have been proposed in numerical grid simulations, such as magnetic-reconnection-driven events (e.g., Sironi &amp; Spitkovsky 2014, ApJ 738, 21), but now taking the small-scale numerical results and test how they evolve in an extended steady-jet background (e.g. Potter &amp; Cotter 2015, MNRAS, 453, 4070). The predictions will be tested against unique data from H.E.S.S. for rapidly-flaring sources.   - We will investigate the entrainment and acceleration of heavy particles (hadrons, expected to be mostly protons) as the jets propagate through their host galaxy. It has long been believed that some of the jet plasma will be relativistic protons, with the precise fraction being a topic of much debate. This year, the well-publicised detection of VHE neutrino emission from an AGN jet by the IceCube experiment in Antarctica has provided the first strong evidence that the jets do contain a VHE hadronic component (IceCube Collaboration, 2018, Science, 361, 1378). One signature of hadronic processes in jets is gamma-ray flux at energies above the Klein-Nishina limit. Such emission is unlikely to be from inverse-Compton processes, but is more likely to be muon-synchrotron and other associated emission from high-energy proton collisions (e.g. Reimer, Int.J.Mod.Phys. D, 2009, 18:10, 1511). Again, we will take the steady jet background as an environment in which to set the emission from possible hadronic processes, and the predictions will be tested against H.E.S.S. data, which is currently the only route to do so.  - To achieve the goals we will transfer operations and development for the 28-m telescope camera of H.E.S.S. to a local electronic engineer, on site full-time at the observatory. To date the camera operations and development programme has been carried out by scientists and engineers of the Laboratory of Nuclear and High-Energy Physics (LPNHE), France, in yearly on-site maintenance campaigns. Significant progress has been achieved in recent years, and H.E.S.S. are confident that this trajectory can be continued. But the ongoing development will cease in October 2019 as LPNHE diverts resources fully to CTA. We will take over these operations and thus ensure that H.E.S.S. is at the cutting-edge of gamma-ray astronomy in the coming five years before operations commence for the next-generation instrument, CTA.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">We propose to significantly increase host-country participation in the High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.), the world-leading gamma-ray observatory sited in Namibia. Undertaking a research programme on the physics of relativistic jets in active galaxies, led by two postdocs and with telescope operations and development supported by an electronic engineer, the University of Namibia (UNAM) will take on a sizeable share of observatory operations and science. This will allow the UNAM group to become globally competitive in the field of very-high-energy (VHE) astrophysics, and will have a secondary science benefit for the UK of increasing its participation in H.E.S.S. astrophysics programmes.   The project is particularly timely as the Namibian authorities have recently declared space science including astronomy a Priority Research Area for national socio-economic advancement, and plans are underway for ownership of the H.E.S.S. telescopes to be transferred to Namibia over the next 3-5 years.  The development aspects of the project arise from the capacity-building that will follow from growing the size and capabilities of the physics department at UNAM, as desired by the Namibian authorities, along with specific targeted activities by the postdocs that will guarantee short-term impact, in high-school education and tourism.</narrative>
