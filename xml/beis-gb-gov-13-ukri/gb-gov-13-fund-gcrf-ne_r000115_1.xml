  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The NCEO NC-ODA programme is focussed on a series of generic science issues that are particularly relevant to development challenges: characterisation and forecasting of land surface state including vegetation change and soil moisture; the evolution of forest carbon and characterisation of carbon fluxes arising from deforestation and degradation; the dynamic nature of fires, their emissions into the atmosphere and the development of large-scale air pollution; the development of a cadre of researchers and applications specialists trained in state-of-the-art Earth Observation (EO). We will address specific problems faced by DAC countries: the vulnerability of crop yields in semi-arid regions in Africa to drought, the challenge of protecting and enhancing Kenya&apos;s forest resources to mitigate climate change, the forecast skill necessary to capture hazardous air quality in South-East Asia stemming from open biomass burning, and the current lack of capacity of many African nations to make effective use of satellite EO data.  The programme is structured into four WPs. Relevant UN Sustainable Development Goals are: 2 (Zero hunger), 3 (Good health and well-being), 13 (Climate action), 15 (Life on Land), and 17 (Partnership for the goals). WP 1 will improve crop yield modelling in Ghana and potentially Ethiopia through data assimilation of multiple EO data streams, for example effective leaf area index and soil moisture. The research will yield new knowledge on the value of accurate EO data parameters in a data-model system, to better characterise crop change and increase predictive skill, to examine upscaling from landscape to country scale, and improve soil moisture forecast skill [SGDs 2, 15]. WP 2 will establish a baseline of carbon emissions from deforestation in Kenya, identify different types of deforestation and degradation from synthetic aperture radar, optical and laser ranging (LiDAR) data, and establish areas that are suitable for afforestation to support the Vision 2030 of the Kenyan Government that aims to increase forest cover from 6 to 10 per cent by 2030. The work will establish forest reference emission levels and  above-ground carbon stocks. This research is key to understanding carbon cycling estimates in a REDD+ policy context.  [SGDs 13, 15]. WP 3 will develop and demonstrate new data sources that can improve forecast accuracy for large-scale air pollution during fire events. Currently, forecast models use estimates of fires that fail to capture the magnitude and variability of dynamic large forest and peatland fires and fires due to agricultural residue burning. The research will improve pollutant emissions estimates from fires, EO-based retrievals of smoke plume aerosols and auto-identification of biomass-burning plumes. We will work with stakeholders in the ASEAN countries to co-develop and demonstrate new systems, characterise improvements and train staff in the interpretation of complex EO data [SDGs 3, 13].  WP 4 will build capacity through international EO-related initiatives, including the Group on Earth Observations (GEO) AfriGEOSS initiative and the Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS) Working Group on Capacity Building &amp; Data Democracy, to improve access to and use of contemporary EO datasets in African nations and other DAC nations. Work will include scoping of UK-related EO projects and experts related to AfriGEOSS identified needs, extension of the training of WP1-3 to wider DAC countries and to strategic capacity building, co-ordinated work with the relevant GEO initiatives of GFOI and GEOGLAM, and support of access to EO data for DAC countries. These actions will also benefit UK national priorities such as the monitoring of projects supported by the GNU partnership (Germany, Norway and UK), which is making US$5 billion available between 2015 and 2020 for REDD+ early movers, and the Biocarbon Fund&apos;s Initiative for Sustainable Forest Landscapes (ISFL) [SDG 17].</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The vision of the NCEO NC-ODA Programme is to undertake excellent research led by explicit development challenges in low- and middle-income countries on the DAC list. The programme is co-designed in close partnership with our stakeholder organisations in the DAC countries and based on the intersection of their expressed user needs and NCEO&apos;s research capability. The programme will develop better methods and datasets from state-of-the-art satellite Earth Observation (EO) data and models in order to contribute to the UN Sustainable Development Goals 2 (Zero hunger), 3 (Good health and well-being), 13 (Climate action), 15 (Life on Land), and 17 (Partnership for the goals).  The Spheres of Influence approach described in &apos;Pathways to Impact&apos; shows how our objectives have been devised in such a way as to ensure continuous stakeholder engagement, partnership building and networking and to secure positive development impact from this ODA-compliant programme.  The high-level objectives are: 1.To improve crop yield modelling through data assimilation of multiple EO data streams thus  enabling more accurate forecasts of crop yield in semi-arid Africa, where erratic rainfall regularly leads to crop failure and sometimes famine (WP1). The anticipated development impact from this objective is to reduce hunger during times of drought by enabling government agencies and aid organisations to respond more effectively, based on more accurate crop yield forecasts. 2.To establish a baseline of carbon emissions from deforestation in Kenya, identify different types of deforestation and degradation, and establish areas that are suitable for afforestation to support the Vision 2030 of  the Kenyan Government that aims to increase forest cover from 6 per cent to 10 per cent by 2030 (WP2). The anticipated development impact is that accurate information on the historic and current deforestation situation will support Kenya in achieving REDD+ Readiness, mitigate greenhouse gas emissions from deforestation, unlock international finance to reward reductions in deforestation (e.g. International Climate Fund) and establish its own Measurement, Reporting and Verification (MRV) capacity. 3.To enhance retrieval methods for characterising open biomass burning, the consequent air pollutant emissions and atmospheric concentrations in the region covered by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), which includes 8 low and middle income countries [Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam] (WP3). The primary emissions source is Indonesia, where large-scale forest and peat fires often lead to hazardous levels of air pollution that can extend far beyond national borders, for example into Vietnam,  and are added to locally by sources such as agricultural residue burning. The fires also release significant amounts of greenhouse gases from both effects. The development impact of this objective is ultimately to improve human health in the ASEAN region via information to support air pollutant reduction policies such as the recently ratified ASEAN Agreement on Transboundary Haze Pollution, and through the potential to provide the public with better information on air quality, via early warning systems, to reduce people&apos;s exposure to pollutants. A secondary benefit will be associated reductions in GHG emissions. 4.To build capacity through international initiatives (AfriGEOSS, CEOS WGCapD, GEO GFOI, GEOGLAM and AfriGAM), to enable nations to access contemporary EO datasets more effectively in their national structures and policies, thus benefitting UK priorities for international aid (WP4). A particular focus is user needs for applications and EO data access in African nations, via the AfriGEOSS initiative. We will build on our in-country activities in Ghana, Kenya and South Africa, and share results via the GEO and CEOS networks and communication platforms to widen the impact of this rich source of environmental data.</narrative>
