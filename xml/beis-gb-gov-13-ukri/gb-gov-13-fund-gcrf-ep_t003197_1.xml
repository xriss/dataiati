   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Modelling Emergency Medical Services in Indonesia</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Our overarching research objective is to:  Develop and apply mathematical models that capture and address the particular challenges of providing emergency medical services in Indonesia, that allows the national ambulance service to better design and deliver an emergency care service to maximise the effectiveness and efficiency of resources for improving patient outcomes.  Our specific research questions are:  RQ 1: What is the demand for ambulance services and how is this demand spatiotemporally distributed? RQ 2: How should existing emergency vehicles be optimally located and deployed? i.e. what is the optimal location-allocation of emergency vehicles to available bases and stand-by points across the city, accounting for predicted demand and patient needs, traffic congestion and routing, and vehicle/paramedic availability? RQ 3: Does the answer to RQ2 change if we are seeking either to minimise response times or maximise patient outcomes/survival?  If so, can we consider a mixture of time targets and survival curves for different patient conditions and severities?  RQ 4: How would the EMS system cope with a major emergency event, such as responding to an earthquake, tsunami or terrorist attack?  What resources would be needed for such events of different magnitudes?  How long would the system take to return towards some sort of &apos;steady-state&apos; pre-event conditions? RQ 5: To support future robust planning of the service and for seeking investment, what is the impact of changing overall vehicle capacity (by vehicle type), patient demand and staff resources on key performance indicators such as response times, outcomes and resource utilisation?   Would there be any benefit of utilising different modes of transport within the ambulance fleet and training community first responders (with, for example, provision of local defibrillators), and how would they be best deployed?  RQ 6: How can we use our initial learning and findings from Jakarta, and translate these to other regions across the country to help plan and sustain a national service? RQ 7: How can we locally empower the Indonesian National 118 Emergency Ambulance Service to build and sustain their own capability in the use of modelling to support healthcare services planning across Indonesia in the future?</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Recent events such as the Anak Krakatau eruption and tsunami, and the Lombok and Palu earthquakes and tsunami have once again brought the attention of the world on Indonesia. In 2018 alone, it is estimated that natural disasters claimed the lives of more than 4,000 people and displaced around 3 million people across the country. Natural disasters, manmade conflicts and violence are commonly experienced across the country, alongside a rising demand for emergency services. The lack of emergency medical transportation across Indonesia is a main barrier to the access and availability of medical care for the 264 million population.    Until recently, Indonesia had no public ambulance service but is now moving towards an integrated national emergency response system. There are however many challenges faced including vast geographical areas, severe traffic congestion, and inadequate numbers of ambulances. Making efficient and effective use of such valuable resources is therefore critical and will be the focus of our research, as is helping to empower local services and provide for the poorest in society who cannot afford to take privately run ambulances.    The National 118 Emergency Ambulance Service was established in 2005 by the Indonesian Surgeons&apos; Association, and is the only public ambulance service in the country, operating currently in five cities: Jakarta, Palembang, Yogyakarta, Surabaya and Makasser. Whilst some private ambulance providers are available, these are hugely expensive and thus out of reach of the majority of the Indonesian population who consequently suffer from a lack of timely access to medical care and are at high risk of morbidity and mortality. Traffic accidents account for 70% of the country&apos;s trauma deaths, and nearly 1 in 3 of all deaths are caused by strokes and ischemic heart disease/heart attacks, where rapid access to appropriate treatment is absolutely vital. In Jakarta alone, 118 serves a potential population of 11 million people (the 15th most populous city in the World and the largest in Southeast Asia), covering an area of 661 square km, but remarkably with only 15 ambulances currently available based at 5 locations across the city.  Not surprisingly response times and outcomes are very poor, because of the lack of vehicles, the sheer volume of traffic on the roads (Jakarta is reported to have the worst traffic jams of any major Asian city), and the large area to cover.   Our research programme will use Operational Research (OR) methods for mathematical modelling of emergency medical services (EMS). We will work directly with the Founder and Director of the Indonesian National 118 Ambulance Service, Professor Aryono Pusponegoro MD, PhD, and his EMS team to help forecast emergency demand and make critical decisions on the optimal types, capacities and geographical locations of vehicles for a sustainable emergency service. Such factors directly impact on the probability of patient survival, ability to respond to major disasters, and the overall quality of care provided.  Our ambitious, adventurous and transformative research programme is underpinned by novel scientific methods that will: (i) develop a methodology to forecast spatiotemporal demand without historical call data using census and survey data within a machine-learning framework, and (ii) develop a novel approach to consider EMS capacities and allocations for maximising survival within a heterogeneous population (multiple medical needs) using a heterogeneous fleet with consideration of multiple vehicle types each with differing travel times/speeds. This will be achieved via the creation of an optimisation and simulation decision-support framework that will be deployed by the national 118 emergency ambulance service.</narrative>
