  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The objectives of this International Centre Partnership are: 1. To increase understanding of how undergraduate higher education in South Africa can most effectively contribute to the development of individuals and society; 2.   To develop the capacity of an internationally networked group of South African higher education researchers, with a particular focus on post-doctoral researchers;  3.   To facilitate the development of  larger research scale projects that bring together consideration of access to, students&apos; experiences of, and the contribution made by graduates of an undergraduate education;  4. To produce resources to enable policy makers, managers and practitioners to further develop higher education in ways that enhance the benefits of widening access to higher education in South Africa.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This International Centre Partnership is located within the Higher Education Thematic area. It is a collaboration between the ESRC/HEFCE funded Centre for Global Higher Education and a cluster of NRF projects in South Africa located at the Universities of Cape Town, Rhodes, and the Free State.   The International Centre Partnership will examine the pathways from an undergraduate education to personal and public goods in South Africa through three interlinked themes: access to higher education; students&apos; experiences whilst studying; and the economic and social contributions made by university graduates. It brings together internationally leading higher education researchers from the UK, South Africa and further afield in order to explore the relations between these themes. In bringing together these three issues, it will further understanding of the ways in which an undergraduate education contributes to both personal and social transformation The partnership will also make a significant contribution to capacity building through the development of an internationally networked cadre of South African post-doctoral researchers, who will have the opportunity to work with internationally leading researchers in the field of higher education over a sustained period of time. These opportunities will be further enhanced by their inclusion within the wider capacity building and career development activities of the Centre for Global Higher Education.  The collaboration is ODA compliant because: 1. Higher Education has been shown to play a key role in the economic and social development of individuals and societies; 2. The collaboration will increase understanding of the way in which an undergraduate education makes this form of contribution; 3. It will use this understanding to develop resources for policy makers, managers and practitioners to further develop South African Higher Education; 4. It draws on the UK strengths in higher education research and brings together an internationally excellent group of higher education researchers; 5. It builds the capacity of South African post-doctoral researchers and includes them in a larger group of internationally networked early-career higher education researchers.</narrative>
