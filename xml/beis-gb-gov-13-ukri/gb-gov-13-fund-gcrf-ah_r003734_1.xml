   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Politics of Performance on the Urban Periphery in South India</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project&apos;s principle objectives are: 1) To analyze the emerging role of performance and festival in South India, as they engage with tensions between endangered heritage and rapid urbanization, severe environmental degradation, infrastructural crisis and the impact on built and natural heritage and living environments  2) To approach this through the multiple perspectives of an interdisciplinary network which will draw together experts in performance, archaeology, animal behaviour, urban studies, sociology and economics in order to understand the material, cultural and environmental circumstances and effects of the performing arts in three South Indian cities. This involves paying attention to performance in terms of changing material and economic practices; of curators and artists&apos; direct engagement with the concerns of peripheral communities; and of aesthetic contribution to the ways in which the urban landscape is imagined, designed and experienced 3) To identify models for promoting sustainable cities and communities through performance by engaging in interdisciplinary discussion of four case studies, observed in field trips made by the core group. These provide examples of festival performance across art forms in South India, in sites experiencing crisis through change. We will examine the interconnections and shared concerns of heritage and contemporary practices on city peripheries, and identify transferable examples of innovative, sustainable practices. Thus we aim to establish the potential for performance to support and promote sustainable practices and communities, and to identify urgent challenges (for example, the conflicting positive and negative effects of a growth in heritage tourism). It will also be important to identify the effects of urbanization on the material conditions of heritage performance practices, and the ethical, environmental and economic implications of these changes (for instance the impact on the conditions of performing animals and their keepers) 4)To develop and document new models for using performance as a tool to generate discussion and debate between stakeholders who do not usually meet, and for gathering information from those whose voice is often absent from planning processes - communities who are marginalized not just geographically, but socially. We will work with non-HE organizations in Bengaluru towards this objective, in particular the MOD Institute of Urban Research, aiming to establish ongoing collaborations to develop this enquiry further 5)To share and identify methodologies and findings with a wider public, in order to extend the range of approaches to inclusive dialogues about urban futures and to offer policy proposals based on an holistic, interdisciplinary understanding of the involvement of performance in urbanization and its effects 6)To strengthen and develop connections between NIAS, Bengaluru and the University of Exeter Drama Department, to develop research collaborations and further initiatives. To date these connections have been limited to collaborations on postgraduate supervision (funded by UKIERI and the University of Exeter), but the interdisciplinary concerns of these students demonstrate the potential for further exchange between staff at these institutions 7)To contribute to the development of theatre and performance studies in India through an interdisciplinary project that demonstrates the wider relevance of performance research and its connections with other disciplines, involving postgraduate researchers working between NIAS and Exeter Drama Department, or based at either institution. We will also seek to extend the reach of the network through additional funding for travel bursaries for emerging scholars to join us and to bring Indian and international experts in curation and performing arts to attend events in Bengaluru and Kochi. We will includeat least two emerging Indian performance scholars in our edited, academic publication.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This network will undertake three symposia and four field trips in order to investigate the politics of performance on the peripheries of growing South Indian cities, with four festivals as case studies.We will also pilot and share the use of performance interventions towards inclusive urban planning. The growth of cities in India presents a crisis for many communities, sites and species that lie on the urban periphery and are endangered by rapid re-development and change. The performing arts are directly involved in this change. For instance, they enhance the cultural identity of the metropolis, yet may also communicate the heritage of marginalized communities and threatened sites. Traditional forms are also being developed and politicized in response to urban change, and here they share concerns with the aesthetics of contemporary performance art, which frequently engages in the politics of urban space. Animals and environmental issues are both represented and implicated in performance: for instance, the problematic care of performing elephants is exacerbated by congested urban environments, leading to growing calls for a ban. Understanding the significance of such performance is inseparable from an appreciation of the spectacle of the growing city, and the ways in which it is imagined, whether among the buyers of new property, or among those (human or non-human) who find their ways of life under threat. In order to appreciate the various ways in which performance intervenes in, comments on, and is affected by a crisis of urban expansion, it is necessary to combine expertise from a range of disciplines, particularly in relation to the cultural landscape of South India. Our network will move across humanities, social and natural sciences, including performance, archaeology, animal cognition, and urban studies. Performance studies is a growing discipline in India, but not yet well established, and the UK network participants will bring this expertise and lens to the work, while the interdisciplinary knowledge of South India will be provided by scholars, curators, artists and planning experts based in Bengaluru. The PI brings research expertise in performance, architecture and walking, recently researching Indian live art and the city. Our field trips, symposia and workshops will be held in February 2018 (Event 1), December 2018 (Event 2) and February 2019 (Event 3). The wider group will attend symposia at NIAS Bengaluru at each of the three events to discuss and share their related research alongside reports from the field trips.In February, the core group (the PI, CIs, Von Damm (MOD) and Daboo) will make field trips to observe the Urur-Olcott Kuppam Vizha, Chennai, which works with the fishing community and the Neralu (Tree) Festival, in Bengaluru. In December, the core group and Sreedhar Vijayakrishnan, an expert in urban elephants, will observe the 400-year old Vrishchikotsavam in Tripunithura, and the Kochi-Muziris Biennale.  Our project partners at the MOD Institute for Urban Research in Bengaluru will draw on their past experience to lead a week of workshops/interventions in peripheral Bengaluru, using performance as a tool for stimulating dialogue, debate and expression of concerns in relation to urban expansion . Methods and results will be documented, and shared, discussed and developed at each of the network events in public presentations in Chennai, Kochi and Bengaluru. A closing public meeting will be held at NIAS in February 2019. Other forms of dissemination include policy documents, academic publications and a website. The network builds on the relationship between the Drama Department at Exeter University with NIAS in Bengaluru. This has so far been focused on co-supervision of research students, so this network allows researchers to focus previously informal discussions towards specific concerns and outputs, and will be a starting point for the development of more extended research collaborations.</narrative>
