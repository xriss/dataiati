   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Human Adaptation to Coastal Evolution:  Late Quaternary evidence from Southeast Asia (SUNDASIA)  RESEARCH SUMMARY  Changing sea-levels have had a significant impact on human evolution and history in Southeast Asia, and continue to affect the lives of people living there today. Under glacial conditions the continent of Asia extended into the Southern Hemisphere, but up to 75% of that additional landmass (&apos;Sundaland&apos;) becomes submerged during interglacials, making this the world&apos;s largest single area of land lost cyclically to the sea. The 3.5-year SUNDASIA project, which has already attracted &#xA3;300,000 worth of corporate backing towards its projected c. &#xA3;1m cost, explores how prehistoric foraging communities adapted to cycles of coastal inundation in Southeast Asia and how understanding of those processes can inform on modern responses to climate-induced rising seas. Until now, no archaeological record was sufficiently detailed for these linked topics to be researched comprehensively at a landscape scale in this region. The Tr&#xE0;ng An limestone massif on the southwest margin of the Red River delta, Vietnam, is the first area in the region to provide such a record and as a result has recently (2014) achieved World Heritage status. The current project synthesizes archaeological and palaeoenvironmental evidence from the last three marine transgressions: those occurring between 59,000 and c. 1500 years ago. Through its work in Tr&#xE0;ng An SUNDASIA will demonstrate the impact that changing sea-levels had on early socio-economic systems in the region. This is a body of data that is also highly relevant today: more than 23% of the world&apos;s population currently reside on the coast or low-lying islands. These communities face the urgent threat of climate-driven sea-level rise which is particularly acute in Southeast Asia where sea-levels are rising at a rate three times the global average. Although scientists and policy-makers are now incorporating long-term palaeo-climate records into predictive models of climate change, almost no attention has been paid to considering how people coped with these changes in the past. Incorporating adaptive measures that permit a diverse repertoire of responses to climate-change is seen as key to the accuracy and practicality of these models, yet these measures remain poorly understood. Sea-level change and environmental diversity have been powerful drivers behind culture-economic systems for tens of millennia in Southeast Asia; its archaeological record and particularly that from Tr&#xE0;ng An offer enormous potential to help bridge this knowledge gap.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">MAIN OBJECTIVES  The three principal research questions that SUNDASIA will answer are articulated through nine auxiliary objectives:  Question 1: How do coastal environments shape human behaviour? 1. Create detailed datasets that track cultural and economic changes through time and from sites across the massif in relation to cycles of marine inundation. This will be achieved through archaeological excavation and analysis of cultural and faunal remains (including new and archival material). 2. Compile a series of digitised terrain maps using GIS to show the full extent of coastal flooding across three cycles of marine inundation and recession around the Tr&#xE0;ng An massif. These will be constructed initially from existing data.  3. Obtain new sedimentary, chronological, palaeoclimate, biodiversity and vegetation records relating to cycles of inundation. These will complement exsiting data by bringing fine-grained detail to our terrain maps and context into which early human activities can be projected.  Question 2: How does coastal evolution impact upon tropical settlement systems? 4. Develop a robust protocol for the radiocarbon dating of terrestrial and riverine molluscs in tropical contexts. This will build on recent success at Queen&apos;s University Belfast (QUB) in creating a protocol for AMS dating Mediterranean shells (Hill 2015), and refine the chronology of cultural and environmental transitions in Tr&#xE0;ng An.  5. Establish high-resolution (near-annual) tracking of precipitation, especially monsoon cycles, linked to environmental change. The isotopic samples for this work will be obtained from ubiquitous shell midden material. These data will further assist in identifying patterning in human subsistence and periodicity of site occupation. 6. Build a pioneering reconstruction of tropical forager site networks, how these responded to cycles of coastal change and the transformative impact on cultural and economic strategies. This will be achieved by synthesising the results of archaeological, palaeoenvironmental, climatic and chronological analyses and digital modelling. Particular attention will be paid to tracking transitional and transformative periods of human behaviour in relation to the extent and timing of environmental change (sea-level rise).   Question 3: How do past cycles of cultural adaptation to sea-level change inform on future responses to sea-level change in Southeast Asia and globally? 7. Present a new long-term perspective on human responses to coastal flooding: essential contextual data for Southeast Asian and particularly Vietnamese stake-holders in their consideration of responses to modern rising sea-levels. 8. Streamline methods (e.g. quantifying sea-level change) and outcomes to fit with and address issues of current global climate-change models. For example the project will produce key data on adaptive processes that can be translated into general principles of adaptation and risk mitigation (see Rabett 2012), and will help build understanding about non-linear changes in coastal environments and human responses to them.   9. Highlight the importance of the longue dur&#xE9;e as revealed archaeologically, particularly with respect to economic and climate change research models (e.g. IAMs), through knowledge-transfer efforts with international organisations and policy-advisory bodies (see Pathways to Impact).</narrative>
