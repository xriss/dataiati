   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Prevention of Neural Tube Defects by Inositol and Vitamin B12 (PONTib) - Development Trial</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Neural tube defects (NTDs) are life-threatening birth defects, of which spina bifida is best known. It causes paralysis of the lower body, incontinence of urine and faeces, hydrocephalus (&apos;water on the brain&apos;) and other serious health problems. NTDs are common defects, affecting 1 in every 500-2000 pregnancies and with higher frequencies in many low and middle income countries. Supplements containing folic acid (FA), when taken before conception and for the first 3 months of pregnancy, can reduce the risk of a fetus being affected by NTD. However, many women still have babies with NTDs despite taking FA supplements. This experience has shown that 30-50% of NTDs are &apos;FA-resistant&apos;, and for this reason a different supplement is needed to prevent them effectively. Our previous research in mice and humans identified inositol (vitamin B8) as a possible new way to prevent NTDs that do not respond to FA. Other research suggests that vitamin B12 may be an effective additional supplement. Before either inositol or B12 supplementation can be implemented in practice, it is essential to confirm their effectiveness in a clinical trial.  This research proposes a pilot clinical trial of inositol in China where there is a high rate of NTDs. This relatively small study will &apos;pave the way&apos; towards a large-scale, statistically robust clinical trial that will tell us whether inositol, vitamin B12 or both should be used in clinical practice. China is an ideal location for the work as it has an excellent infrastructure for locating women with previous NTD-affected pregnancies, and a very large population to enable sufficient women subjects to be recruited. The study participants will be women with a previous NTD-affected pregnancy who wish to become pregnant again. Those who consent to participate will be randomly assigned to take either inositol, B12, inositol + B12, or neither. In line with the standard care for women at high risk of NTDs, all women subjects will receive 5 mg FA daily. Supplementation will begin before conception and continue until the 12th week of pregnancy. The work will be a collaboration between scientists at University College London - including experts in NTDs and clinical trials - and scientists at Peking University in Beijing. The Chinese investigators have many years&apos; experience of conducting studies during pregnancy in their local populations, for example having recruited over 100,000 women for a study of nutrients in pregnancy in recent years.  This pilot study will test whether robust and reliable processes are in place to identify, recruit, randomise and follow up the pregnancies of the women subjects. Then, we plan to progress on to the large-scale trial, where a positive outcome would indicate that inositol and/or vitamin B12 should be taken together with FA in a combined supplement for women planning a pregnancy. The use of inositol or B12 could be rapidly implemented in China, as women already receive free FA tablets when planning a pregnancy. A combined tablet containing inositol/B12 and FA could be provided at a low additional cost. Thereafter, other countries are likely to introduce similar combined supplements to improve NTD prevention. This will not only benefit individuals and families by avoiding the impact of an NTD-affected pregnancy, but will also benefit health care systems economically: the life-time medical and social care costs of a person with spina bifida are more than $0.5M. When the preventive effect of FA was discovered in 1991, this was based on a very similar clinical trial to the one we propose. FA usage has spread to most countries in the world, and we anticipate a similar beneficial effect of our currently proposed research on the future health of children worldwide.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Neural tube defects (NTDs) are major congenital malformations of the brain and spinal cord that cause death or severe disability in early life. Some NTDs can be prevented by folic acid (FA), but a proportion are FA-resistant (e.g. 30% in the 1991 MRC FA trial). An additional preventive therapy is needed to further reduce the worldwide burden of NTDs. This Trial Development Grant will support a pilot study to determine the feasibility of conducting a randomised clinical trial of inositol (vitamin B8) and vitamin B12 for prevention of NTDs, to a level beyond  that achieved by FA alone. Participants will be women in China at high risk of NTD recurrence, due to a previous NTD-affected pregnancy. We aim to determine:  1. Whether birth defects surveillance mechanisms across Shanxi Province in North China can identify and contact women with a recent history of NTD-affected pregnancy.  2. The proportion of women identified to be at risk of a further NTD pregnancy who: - are eligible to enter the study and plan a subsequent pregnancy; - consent to be randomised to take inositol and/or vitamin B12, plus FA supplements; - show compliance with the study protocol; - proceed to an informative pregnancy outcome.  Hence, we aim to stress-test all of the requirements for a large-scale, fully powered randomised clinical trial of inositol and/or vitamin B12, alongside FA in China. Specific objectives are to:  - Identify women at high risk of NTD pregnancy in 10 counties of Shanxi Province (30,000 births per year). The aim is to locate women who experienced an NTD-affected pregnancy in the previous 5 years (pre-trial ascertainment) or during the first year of the Trial Development study (during-trial ascertainment). Potential study subjects will be identified using the Birth Defects Monitoring Program which records all cases of NTDs and other birth defects, under .  - Recruit women into the trial from this ascertainment cohort using the established integrated maternal and child health care system in which staff at province and city levels link with staff in the 3-Tier (county/township/village) networks for contacting, enrolling and consenting women.   - Randomise women to four intervention arms: (i) inositol, (ii) vitamin B12, (iii) inositol + vitamin B12, (iv) no treatment. Women in all trial arms will additionally receive FA (5 mg/day). A 2x2 factorial design will address the effectiveness of both agents separately (main effects) and any effect modification through simultaneous use (interactions). Only non-pregnant women will be recruited, and supplement usage will begin pre-conception and continue until week 12 of pregnancy.  - Collect pilot data on NTD recurrence rate: women subjects will be followed prospectively to determine whether/when pregnancy occurs, whether the fetus/child has a NTD, and to document any adverse events (maternal or fetal) during the pre-pregnancy or pregnancy periods. Data will be input to a regulatory compliant web-based data collection system, with a central server managed by the PKU team and with oversight and validation by the UCL Clinical Trials Unit. Data collection will be supplemented by a participant-accessible application on the Wechat social media platform. Odds ratio and exact 95% confidence intervals will be calculated for the difference in NTD pregnancies between the randomised conditions.  This study is a step towards a full-scale phase III PONTib efficacy stuy whose design will parallel that of the 1991 MRC Vitamin Study that demonstrated the preventive effect of FA on NTD recurrence. Based on the MRC trial result, FA usage has spread to most countries in the world and is now recommended for all women, not just those at high NTD risk. We envisage that the PONTib study will similarly enable a &apos;gold-standard&apos; evidence base for inositol and/or B12 usage, and will contribute significantly to the improvement of children&apos;s health worldwide.</narrative>
