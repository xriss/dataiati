   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Caribbean Cyclone Cartography: Mapping histories, narratives and futures of hurricane &apos;resilience&apos; in a changing climate.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Caribbean Cyclone Cartography (CCC) Project will collaboratively research and map survivor-led hurricane recoveries past and present, with the goals of:  (a) developing informed ecological citizenship, and  (b) building an inclusive, publicly accessible knowledge base to guide future cyclone preparedness, responses and reconstruction in Dominica and the greater Caribbean.  CCC will develop citizen and academic research capacities, cultivate equitable partnerships and build interdisciplinary knowledge exchange platforms to enhance Caribbean strategic responses to the &apos;existential threat&apos; of climate change-intensified cyclones.   Herein, we address three key global agendas:  1. The UN Sustainable Development Goals: 4. Inclusive Education/Lifelong Learning; 13. Climate Action. 2. Sendai Priorities: 2. Understanding disaster risk; 4. Enhancing disaster preparedness &amp; &quot;Building Back Better&quot;. 3. &apos;The Humanitarian Grand Bargain&apos;: 6.Participation revolution: include those receiving aid in decision making.  By enabling public access to cyclone research (for citizens/researchers/learners) and developing an integrated framework for equitable dialogue, CCC aims to enhance Caribbean resilience to hurricanes and related environmental hazards. The core output for the project will be a digital, multi-disciplinary map of Dominica, populated by historic, contemporary ethnographic and geoinformatic data to offer a holistic analysis of Caribbean social and place-based cyclone &apos;resilience&apos; (a much contested concept across development studies). This inclusive and publicly accessible model (2/3 Dominicans are internet users) provides a resource to help citizens and disaster officials better prepare for, navigate and recover from future storms; whilst offering an open-source prototype that fellow SIDS can adapt to their own climatic predicaments - thus promoting regional and global wellbeing, safety and sustainable livelihoods (economic development).   Shortly after category-5 Hurricane Maria devastated Dominica (Eastern Caribbean) on 18th September 2017, the government boldly vowed to go beyond simply &apos;building back better&apos;, to become the &apos;first climate resilient nation on earth&apos;, drawing US$400M support from international agencies. The inter-ministerial Climate Resilience Execution Agency of Dominica (CREAD) established to meet this challenge.  Aims: Grounded in the global agendas, principles and CREAD vision outlined above, The CCC Project will map Dominican hurricane resilience &apos;from below&apos; - through the social histories, lived realities and place-based knowledge of the island&apos;s inhabitants. Our aim is to investigate and visually map the potential of &apos;vernacular&apos; or community resiliencies, as:   (1) a basis for locating, understanding and mitigating hurricane-related risks; (2) a set of capabilities that can be enhanced to inform inclusive disaster management/humanitarian responses and policies; (3) a resource to help guide sustainable post-disaster reconstruction; and (4) a foundation upon which to build public environmental knowledge (scientific and &apos;traditional&apos;), towards informed ecological citizenship and improved preparedness.    Guided by a, international consortium of academic and civil society partners, the Project will: a) Develop innovative and inclusive survivor-led research methodologies and interventions that invite marginalised communities into climate change adaptation dialogue. b) Cultivate a cadre of project partners &amp; stakeholders who will collectively champion cyclone hazard awareness. c) Build the adaptive capacity of Caribbean civil society, disaster management and humanitarianism partners. d) Promote public &apos;resilience consciousness&apos; and informed and responsible ecological citizenship (regionally and globally).  e) Engage a creative, critical and complementary dialogue with the policies and practices of the inter-ministerial Climate Resilience Execution Agency for Dominica (CREAD)</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">When category-5 Hurricane Maria made landfall in Dominica (Eastern Caribbean, population 71,293) on 18th September 2017 - killing 31 people, disappearing 37 people, damaging 90% of buildings and costing an estimated US$ 1.3 billion/226% of GDP - this environmentally and economically vulnerable Small Island Developing State was left in chaos, without national planning measures to ensure a clear course to recovery. Thus, besides limited humanitarian aid, Dominicans survived Maria by improvising meals from stockpiled food, assembling work crews to clear debris, telling cathartic stories to ease stress and using remittances to rebuild homes. They survived, through social modes of resilience.  Months later, the government vowed to make Dominica -the most mountainous island in the region with perhaps the greatest number of environmental hazards per square mile - the &apos;first climate resilient nation on earth&apos;, launching the Climate Resilience Execution Agency of Dominica (CREAD) and a &apos;National Resilience Development Strategy&apos; (aligned to the UN 2030 Sustainable Development and Sendai agendas) to &apos;climate proof&apos; the island&apos;s housing, infrastructure, energy and tourism sectors. Yet, despite this macroscale &apos;resilience turn&apos;, very little is known about the micro - individual, household and community level - adaptations that enabled Dominicans to survive Maria, Erika (2015) and earlier storms. Nor is there a critical high-level conversation what this ubiquitous term, &apos;resilience&apos;, means to everyday Dominicans - notably marginalized groups (Dominican youth, female farmers, indigenous people and displaced communities).  Towards creating a more inclusive understanding of cyclone preparation, response and recovery, the CCC project will develop collaborative methodologies that explore lived understandings of what &apos;building back better&apos; might mean in local terms. This multi-disciplinary approach to such &apos;vernacular resiliencies&apos; is intended to complement and critically enhance the CREAD agenda, holistically mapping survivor-led recoveries - past, present and future. But why mapping? We believe maps do not simply represent the world; they guide our experience of it.   We will investigate and visually map cyclone resilience &apos;from below&apos; by using the following research methods:  - Oral, archival and architectural enquiry into hurricane histories. - Contemporary community-led digital storytelling and ethnography of life and livelihoods after Maria (with an emphasis on marginalized experiences). - Citizen-led GIS survey and cartographies of hazards, shelters and response agencies across the island.  The research will produce the following outputs:  An online hurricane &apos;resilience&apos; map of Dominica - documenting historic and recent storm recoveries; and plotting hazard sites, shelters and support agencies to reduce future risks to wellbeing. A map that is publicly accessible, informative and easy to navigate - for citizen, policy maker and scholar alike.  A series of multi-stakeholder symposia, research enskillment workshops and practice-based interventions - to build research capacities, share models of best practice (both indigenous and scientific) across scales, specialisms and sectors. A cluster of public project film screenings, a visual arts exhibition and Caribbean Climate Conversations podcast/radio show - to showcase key outputs to Dominican, British, Jamaican and international publics (promoting informed ecological citizenship).  An online digital hub - an archive of research outputs to stand as a public cyclone resilience resource; and a blog space to offer a home for the pre-existing (but at present piecemeal) public conversation on disaster resilience that is ongoing in the Caribbean.  A series of project investigator publications - academic articles, publicly disseminated info-zines and an edited book featuring research outcomes</narrative>
