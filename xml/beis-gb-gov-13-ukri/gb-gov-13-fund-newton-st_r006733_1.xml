   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Shock-Boundary Layer Interaction Control in Hypersonic Flow using Hybrid Micro-Vortex Generators</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Shock-wave turbulent boundary layer interaction (SWTBLI) interaction is a complex phenomenon that adversely affects the performance of supersonic flight vehicles. This phenomenon is caused when shock waves interact with the flow boundary layer resulting in boundary layer separation and unsteady flow caused due to adverse pressure gradients and high heat transfer rates. The impact of SWTBLI can range from sub-optimal performance to system failure of the vehicle depending on the severity. This is relevant for applications ranging from supersonic military and re-entry vehicles to rocket nozzles and turbine blades in jet engines. Therefore it is essential to apply flow control mechanisms to prevent the flow boundary layer separation and minimise the adverse effects of SWTBLI.   The micro-ramp is a recently developed novel passive flow control device that is a part of the micro-vortex generator (MVG) family. Micro-ramps have heights smaller than the boundary layer thickness and are therefore submerged inside the boundary layer. Although MVGs have shown potential in minimising the adverse effects of SWTBLI to a certain extent, previous studies indicate great scope for further improvement. Therefore, in this investigation, the use of micro-ramps (passive flow control) will be paired with jet blowing (an active flow control mechanism) which is proposed to be placed at the region in between the micro-ramps. The combination of passive and active flow control is termed hybrid MVG. Previous studies on hybrid MVG configurations are limited and focused on supersonic flow conditions only. Hence in this study, the aim is to carry out a more complete investigation on the potential of hybrid MVGs in controlling SWTBLI under hypersonic flow conditions.  SWTBLI involves complex physics and is challenging for investigation using experimental techniques and numerical simulations. In this project, we propose to study hybrid MVG&apos;s as the flow control device both experimentally and numerically. The hybrid MVGs will be investigated experimentally using the hypersonic wind tunnel facility at the University of Manchester, with the aid of novel flow diagnostics such as pressure sensitive paints and particle image velocimetry. The experimental setup will be also investigated numerically using large eddy simulation (LES) by STFC to obtain a better understanding of the flow physics. Simulations can result in optimised designs and configurations of the hybrid MVGs, the information of which will be useful for the design of real world hypersonic flight vehicles. Additionally this project can create new experimental and numerical benchmark data that other researchers can benchmark against.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The primary objective of this project is to investigate novel ways of hypersonic flow control with the aid of hybrid micro vortex generators (MVG). This project will enable us to investigate the flow separation phenomenon caused by shock-wave turbulent boundary layer interaction (SWTBLI) that typically occurs in hypersonic vehicles. We aim to carry out both experimental and numerical studies of the hypersonic flow control set up and propose mitigation strategies to minimise the adverse effects associated with SWTBLI. While design and fabrication activities of the device for the experimental setup will be carried out by Universiti Pertahanan Nasional Malaysia, the hypersonic wind tunnel facility at University of Manchester will be employed to carry out the experiments and flow diagnostics. Large scale parallel computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulations of the experimental setup will be carried out by STFC to validate the numerical codes for SWTBLI and also optimise the design of the hybrid MVG configuration.   We aim to achieve the following main objectives through this STFC-Malaysia Newton fund call:  1) Carry out experiments with state of the art flow diagnostics and large-scale numerical simulations to study hypersonic flow control with the aid of hybrid MVG. 2) Extend the current understanding of the SWTBLI-flow separation phenomena and associated flow physics and also propose optimised designs for hypersonic flow control. 3) Create new experimental and numerical benchmark data that other global researchers (particularly in the high speed aerodynamic community) can validate against. 4) Enable the transfer of high-level STEM skills from the UK institutions to Malaysia such as wind tunnel testing &amp; flow diagnostics from the University of Manchester and high-performance computing and modelling skills from STFC.</narrative>
