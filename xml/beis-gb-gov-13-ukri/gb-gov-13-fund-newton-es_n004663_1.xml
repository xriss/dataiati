  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Explore intersections between water and energy supply in planning for sustainable urban development in Brazil.  Extend and facilitate links between established clusters of Brazilian and UK academics researching water/energy, including the exchange of existing, published research.  Share methodological tools to build capacity amongst Brazilian researchers, particularly focussed upon innovative qualitative, participatory and app-mediated research to enhance large-scale water and energy systems in developing contexts.  Identify priorities and strategies for future research, with particular reference to the role of energy and water engineering solutions in sustaining the rapid developmental transformations taking place in Brazil&apos;s cities, across all sectors of society.  Identify opportunities for impactful research whose findings will be applicable to policy-makers, professional practitioners, scientists, NGOs, community groups and private-sector organisations working to address the water/energy nexus in developing contexts.  Through the above objectives, undertaking small-scale pilot observational visits in preparation for larger collaborative funding applications around water/energy.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This proposed partnership addresses key challenges in planning for sustainable urban environments. The themes of water and energy are of strategic relevance to development goals in Brazil. The proposed partnership activities will build on an established collaborative knowledge base, bringing together social scientists and engineers with substantial track records in relation to sustainable urban development. In Brazil, the water/energy nexus is a research theme of major importance, due to water scarcity, and since &gt;70% of Brazilian electricity comes from hydroelectricity. Evidence suggests that interventions at different spatio-temporal scales are required to reduce significant impacts-for-development resulting from mismanagement of water/energy resources. The inter-disciplinary project team and proposed activities shall afford innovative forms of dissemination and knowledge exchange between diverse academics, professionals and publics. Planned activities will include publicly-available research summaries, an online research network, the development of an existing app for the Brazilian context, a summer school and theory/practice workshops, and collaborative skills development/sharing. These activities will ensure that the project has extensive impact in Brazil, with potential to deliver long-term benefits in areas of strategic relevance to this call (water/energy), for the welfare of society in diverse developing contexts. Specifically, building upon the project team&apos;s existing links, the project will produce impacts in collaboration with NGOs focused upon sustainable development in Latin America and national/regional partners directly involved in the Brazilian water/energy nexus. Finally, the project will support the research team as it develops larger, related collaborative research projects on the crucial theme of water/energy in sustainable urban development.</narrative>
