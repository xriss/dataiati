   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Fragile heritage ecologies: vernacular cultures and the at-risk landscapes of the Hindu-Kush-Himalaya mountain region</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Currently the focus of most conservation efforts in the Hindu-Kush-Himalaya ranges is on the stunning natural heritage and, what addresses cultural heritage, focuses on elite monumental landscapes. Local cultural heritages have been under threat in Northern Pakistan from both the forces of social change and natural hazards, the latter growing with climate change. Previous work exploring at-risk heritage landscapes in Northern Pakistan through the Laajverd Visiting Schools (since 2014) has demonstrated the need to recognise local heritages and the value they offer to building resilience of local communities. In depth engagement with local communities shows their interest in &apos;hanging on to&apos; and &apos;adapting&apos; their practices, knowledge and folklores amidst disasters, displacement and changing landscape. Enhancing the values of local cultural heritage, and eco-cultural practices and material forms is a step to empowering communities disadvantaged by political marginalisation and physical remoteness. Moreover there is a need to explore how communities experience the loss of heritage in multiple ways; the material loss of vernacular buildings, significant places within the landscape and the immaterial loss of practices of everyday life and engagement with the landscape. Natural disaster is no stranger to these communities, and its marks and effects are also part of their heritage, and its memory part of their resilience.  This project proposes to develop a Fragile Heritage Framework (hereafter FHF) that is participatory and inclusive, where local/host communities co-lead the process of understanding risk and loss, document the practice-based and oral heritages, and the vernacular spatial patterns (pattern language and architecture) in their landscape. The project asks,   1) In what ways does the community conceptualise heritage in changing times? How does their identity relate to their cultural landscape? 2) How are the various senses of loss experienced and articulated by the local communities and how do these relate to &apos;official heritage&apos;? What mechanisms of preparedness and adaptation are being explored by local groups? 3) What creative methodologies can allow local heritage to be revisited and re-imagined?  This project uses visual story-telling as a method of narrating the &apos;great glacial melt&apos; currently occurring due to global warming in order to engage the public and policy makers and instigate action on climate change within Pakistan.  This project will use visual ethnography, oral history mapping and storytelling, to overlay scientific data, such as geological strata and terrain, with cultural, socio-economic practices of inhabitants to create a &apos;deep map&apos; of the the relationship to heritage and its loss by mountain communities. It focuses on how heritage is conceptualised by the community and their response to the changing cultural landscape. Outputs include audio-visual stories produced by local communities that will be digitised in addition to  a participatory framework for at-risk heritage documentation to better inform regional policy on sustainable development within the region. Building on the success of Laajverd&apos;s work for UNESCO with the &apos;KALASHA KALEIDOSCOPE Cultural Asset Archive&apos; that recorded traditional forms, it will offer a digital archive and celebration of the types of heritage that are meaningful to the communities. It seeks to inspire action for heritage stewardship on local, regional and national level in the face of climate change impacts on remote mountain communities, and through training local participants provide the tools for sustained improvement.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Hindu-Kush-Himalayas (HKH) mountains stretch along northern Pakistan and are home to unique societies in terms of culture, heritage, biodiversity, environment and diverse terrain that is continuously transforming with the changing climate. They also hold the largest ice-cap outside the polar regions with &gt;7000 glaciers mapped. These glaciers provide water for the entire country and serve as a lifeline for mountain communities providing irrigation water where rainfall in the valley floors can be as little as 200mm a year. They are also a major threat as Global Warming leads to their melting, not always in a steady retreat but creating lakes of meltwater dammed behind deposits the glaciers leave; dams that can suddenly give way leading to Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (GLOF) which have been estimated to pose a threat to up to 7 million people as they pour down the valleys, even affecting centres of population in the south of the country. This configuration is one reason why Pakistan ranks 8th in the Global Climate Risk Index for 2019 but the alarmingly 4th most vulnerable for future climate change impacts.   The peoples of the Northern mountains have long adapted to the harshness and fragility of their environment. The area open to agriculture, already comprising small oases sustained by traditional irrigation canals fed from meltwater is now under multiple threats. The retreat of glaciers can reduce the water for irrigation, flash floods threaten infrastructure and more violent seasonal flows erode the cultivable land. The cultural heritage of the mountain communities is often ignored in favour of attention on the remarkable natural landscape and flora and fauna. With a different cultural heritage from most Pakistanis, with links across the mountains to those in other countries, they are marginalised. This project looks to record their vernacular heritage and the agro-ecological practices that it embodies.   This project uses visual story-telling as a method of narrating the &apos;great glacial melt&apos; in order to engage the public and policy makers and instigate action on climate change within Pakistan and South Asia.  Through visual ethnography, oral history mapping and storytelling, this project will couple scientific data (such as geological data and terrain modelling) with cultural, socio-economic practices of inhabitants to map the adaptation processes employed by mountain communities. It focuses on how heritage is conceptualised by the community - how do they explain its role in the changing landscape and how they engage and employ cultural heritage practices as means to prepare for and respond to disasters. Outputs include audio-visual stories produced by local communities that will be digitised in addition to a participatory framework for at-risk heritage documentation to better inform regional policy on sustainable development within the region. It will train local heritage practitioners to engage with communities and how they might learn from themto enhance heritage stewardship on local, regional and national level in the face of climate change impacts on remote mountain communities.</narrative>
