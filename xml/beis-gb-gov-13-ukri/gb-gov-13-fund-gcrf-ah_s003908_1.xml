   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The role of higher education in conflict is an under-researched field, as is its potential to address the legacies of conflict and contribute to conflict recovery.  While there are pockets of good practice in different parts of the world there has been no systematic exploration of ways in which university teaching, research or engagement can positively impact on aspects of conflict and peacebuilding. This networking grant will begin to address this gap by focusing particularly on the arts and humanities and sharing areas of innovation and creativity in higher education teaching between different conflict affected countries. It will employ an action research approach, working directly with students to collect images, texts and music that celebrate shared cultural memory, and examine the unifying and divisive way in which such images can be deployed. By building partnerships with local civil society organisations, higher education institutions will encourage direct student involvement in community facing issues, addressing questions of inequality, ethnicity and difference and exploring the value of experiential learning in personal and social development.    The project will work closely with researchers from Los Andes University in Bogota, Columbia; Sarajevo University in Bosnia and Herzegovina and The University of Rwanda in Kigali, Rwanda, each of whom are already involved in peace building initiatives within their own areas. The team will meet in three regionally based 5 day workshops and focus on sharing and developing approaches already used in their home institutions. Together they will look at possibilities for adapting these for use in other areas and build the images and texts created into a bank of module outlines and teaching resources. They will support each other to connect with community members in each location to form locally based partnerships working on issues of inequality, discrimination and citizenship, some of the drivers of conflict in each region.  Through intensive but practice facing discussions the team will develop a theoretical understanding of the role a university might play in conflict and peacebuilding. Each of the three workshops will include a one day seminar for other members of the institution to identify how these materials and approaches might be relevant to other discipline areas and encourage senior management to take seriously their strategies for local engagement.   In addition, online discussions and webinars scheduled between the workshops will share developments with other colleagues in the region, building on existing networks to form a series of regional hubs, in the Balkans (Bosnia and Herzegovina), Latin America (Columbia) and The Horn of Africa (Rwanda).  The project will establish a critical reference group formed from academics and civil society stakeholders working in this field who will contribute to these online discussions and critique materials and approaches developed during this project. It will also enable us to share resources beyond the three participating institutions.   It will use the opportunity of the Bosnia workshop to connect with the Why Remember Festival, (ww.warmfoundation.org); an international network of artists, photographers and journalists committed to recording histories of violence with excellence and integrity This will provide the opportunity to present to a wider audience in the field of history, violence and memory and further establish this as a viable research field and further set the agenda for future research in this area.  Images and short clips taken by students recording artefacts and incidents from the different areas will be edited into a short film to be shown at the 2019 festival. The project will also  explore opportunities for moving the festival to Rwanda in 2020 which will provide further opportunities for dissemination of project outputs.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="The primary objective of this proposal is to share experience and build capacity in addressing the legacy of conflict among higher education institutions in Columbia, Bosnia and Rwanda, as conflict affected areas in different parts of the world. Working with colleagues from Los Andes University in Bogota, Columbia, Sarajevo University in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Kigali University in Rwanda, we will use creative and community engaged approaches to develop innovative curriculum models. The approaches, emerging from the arts and humanities, but designed to work in a cross and interdisciplinary context, will be shared with colleagues across  each institution in a series of country based workshops. Co-Is will use creative and arts based methodologies to track and evaluate the success of the workshops and the models adopted in order to develop a shared understanding of potential pedagogies for peace.   The secondary objective is to develop a network of experienced and committed university lecturers working in the field of peace building willing to share best practice examples and to support each other in developing these for each context. Each of the Co-Is associated with this bid are already working within their own environments and are keen to understand the significance of their work in a global conflict context. By aligning itself with existing global networks of socially committed universities (Talloires, Tufts University, GUNI: Global University Network for Innovation) this new network will form a series of regional hubs, each with the capacity to sustain itself beyond the period of the grant and impact the practice of other institutions located in conflict affected areas in their region.   The third objective, emerging from this is to identify opportunities for the university, in collaboration with community and civil society organizations to engage in peace building activities that learn from and impact on broader community attitudes and enable the university to be an effective actor in regional and national relationships. The field of university social engagement is a growing one, as is the field of education and conflict, this network will be operative in bringing the two areas together. By strengthening university community relationships in each of the partner institutions and their areas, and supporting those within the region to consider benefits and strategies for this, the project will open up a new areas of practice around higher education, community engagement and conflict.   The fourth, related objective is to develop a broader theoretical understanding of the role of higher education institutions in addressing conflict and to set clear parameters for future research. Despite a growing literature in education and conflict studies, till now higher education has been largely absent from the debate. However the capacity for universities to engage in civil society, to influence the attitudes and behaviours of young people, to deepen understanding of students, academics, policy makers and community members in dealing with the memories of violence and appropriate ways of addressing these, is significant. Forming a network of higher education practitioners and piloting new creative approaches will establish universities as an important part of the education and conflict field and outline the agenda for a larger more in-depth piece of work."></capital-spend>
