   <narrative xml:lang="EN">A mathematical modeling framework for tuberculosis burden estimation and economic evaluation of pharmaceutical interventions</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The aim of this fellowship is to develop an integrated dynamic modelling framework for estimating all aspects of the global burden of TB using all available data. This will be extended to quantify the patterns, trends and drivers of the epidemic of drug-resistant TB, and be used to evaluate the impact and cost-effectiveness of pharmaceutical interventions against TB, accounting for transmission and uncertainty. By undertaking this work, I will consolidate skills in infectious disease model development and estimation; gain experience with hierarchical modelling and understanding of the epidemiology of drug-resistant TB; and learn rigorous economic evaluation in the context of infectious diseases. (The objectives below are listed under main aims in priority order rather than reflecting dependency.) A) Develop an integrated dynamic modelling and inference framework for estimating the global and country burden of TB (including incidence, prevalence, mortality and infection). 1) Use this model to output estimates of TB burden. 2) Assess the relative information gained from different data sources used for TB burden estimation. 3) Formally compare different choices of model and combinations of model in terms of predictive validity and goodness-of-fit. 4) Investigate potential biases in detection and reporting of TB by age, gender, and locale.  5) Expand the child sector of the model and produce estimates of childhood TB burden calibrated to data from surveys of latent tuberculosis infection. 6) Develop a hierarchical estimation framework for calibrating the dynamic model. 7) Systematically review the literature to identify surveys of latent infection that could inform model-based estimates of TB burden. B) Understand the patterns, trends and drivers of the drug-resistant TB pandemic, considering all types of resistance. 1) Identify patterns, trends and determinants of the full spectrum of drug-resistant TB accounting for sample uncertainty, using Bayesian hierarchical multinomial regression techniques. 2) Incorporate the full spectrum of drug-resistant TB into the dynamic transmission model in order to allow causal analysis and assessment of intervention impact. 3) Investigate the computational parallelism of GPUs and use of emulators to accelerate this model. C) Evaluate the budget and health impacts, and cost-effectiveness of pharmaceutical interventions for TB.  1) Apply the calibrated multi-country transmission model of TB by drug-resistance type to evaluate pharmaceutical interventions against TB. 2) Fully Bayesian calibrated approach to uncertainty for dynamic/economic models 3) Develop a hybrid modelling framework and apply to evaluations for TB 4) Identify parameters that most contribute to uncertainty in burden estimates or intervention cost-effectiveness, and locations for maximally informative data collection. 5) Analyse cost data with Bayesian hierarchical models in order to establish correlates of costs and predict costs where data are lacking. 6) Analyse intervention impact by subgroup and consider equity implications. D) Develop my skills, profile and career potential as an independent researcher. 1) Develop skills in health economic evaluation (including systematic review) both by undertaking analyses, and attending relevant short courses. 2) Reinforce and extend my professional and academic networks, leveraging them as a route to dissemination and impact. 3) Develop leadership and management skills through planning and delivering this project, and specific training courses at the University of Sheffield. 4) Develop a framework that can be adapted to answer other scientific and policy question and thus serve as a springboard to further work. 5) Develop skills in hierarchical modelling applied to global health questions with sparse data, both by undertaking analyses and attending relevant short courses 6) Develop strength in the epidemiology and modelling of drug-resistant TB</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Tuberculosis (TB) is a major cause of disease and death globally. In 2015, WHO estimated there were 9.6 million TB cases and 1.5 TB deaths. Nearly 500,000 of these cases were resistant to two or more of the main drugs used to treat TB. New drugs, and combinations of drugs, are being developed to treat tuberculosis, as are new vaccines that may protect against disease in adults. Quantifying the burden of TB is fundamental to understanding its global epidemiology and for making appropriate resource allocation decisions. Most estimates of new TB case numbers each year rely strongly on the number of cases reported by countries in that year to WHO. Unfortunately, one in three TB cases are thought to go either undetected or unreported, so the number of cases reported underestimates the number of new cases. While one can correct for this, it is hard to know exactly how much to adjust the reported numbers. Some countries have good systems for recording causes of deaths, which can be used to estimate the number of deaths caused by TB. Increasingly, large and expensive prevalence surveys are being used to estimate the number of people with active disease in a population. These estimates are less subject to bias, but measure a different quantity. Little work has explored the best way of combining these three data sources. A major goal of this work is to use mathematical transmission models for burden estimation and provide a unified framework for all data. These models yield the number of new cases, deaths, and also the prevalence of disease. They explicitly represent disease transmission and so introduce a dependence between the number of new cases in different years. These models involve parameters evidenced from previous epidemiological work, but must be calibrated to learn from data on TB reports, deaths and prevalence. Calibration means adjusting imperfectly known model parameters in order to match observed model outputs to the data. This process provides a model that may be used to make predictions about burden, but may also teach us something about the underlying processes. Many of the parameters concerning the epidemiology and disease course of TB are quite uncertain, and this uncertainty is rarely represented fully in models needing calibration, but will be done in this project using statistical techniques that also allow comparison of different models&apos; performance.  TB burden estimation and calibration of transmission models are almost always carried out on a country-by-country basis. Many parameters describing disease progression are likely to be similar in different countries, even if their exact values differ for unknown reasons. Hierarchical modelling techniques allow such parameters to be correlated between countries. This can improve precision, particularly for countries with little data, as estimates can be informed by data from neighbouring countries. I will explore these techniques for the transmission model, and also in statistical modelling aiming to account for the observed patterns of drug-resistance. The transmission model will ultimately be extended to include different types of drug resistance. As new treatments and vaccines emerge, those with responsibility for public health will want to understand the potential impact these new technologies can have in terms of gains in health, and changes in spending. Producing cost-effectiveness and budget impact evidence requires a model that includes transmission, in order to account for indirect benefits accrued by avoiding secondary cases. We will use our model to provide guidance to decision-makers seeking to maximise health gain with limited resources. We will also analyse sources of uncertainty in the model to identify future research that would have most value in increasing the precision of burden estimates and in reducing decision uncertainty around the introduction of new interventions.</narrative>
