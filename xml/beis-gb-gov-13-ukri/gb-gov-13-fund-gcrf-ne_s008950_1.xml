   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Over 70% of the earth&apos;s surface is ocean. As a global population, we are entirely reliant upon a healthy ocean: it contributes to the renewal of freshwater; it absorbs over a quarter of global carbon dioxide, and it produces half the oxygen we breathe. The ocean has the potential to make significant contributions to sustainable development. Many developing countries already depend on their ocean resources for food, work and livelihoods. Yet we are reaching an ocean health crisis: cumulative pressures such as over-exploitation of its resources, ocean plastics and pollution and climate change, all compounded by multiple competing uses, are pushing the ocean ecosystem to a tipping point.  There is an urgent need for more integrated ocean governance, to ensure greater balance between ocean conservation and sustainable use (Sustainable Development Goal 14) and realise the ocean&apos;s potential to contribute to poverty reduction, human health, healthy ecosystems on land, climate change mitigation and adaptation, equitable economic growth and decent employment. &quot;We are the sea...we must wake up to this ancient truth...It is time to create things for ourselves, to create established standards of excellence that match those of our ancestors.&quot; It is with this spirit that the ONE OCEAN Hub will transform our response to the urgent challenges facing our ocean. The Hub will weave learning from the ocean, and traditional knowledge of the peoples who rely upon it, with scientific excellence, innovative legal approaches and artistic methods. Our aim is to bridge the disconnections in law, science and policy across all levels from the local to the international. We aim to empower vulnerable communities, woman and youth in the blue economy and catalyse the inclusive and integrated governance approaches required to ensure a healthy ocean and flourishing communities and economies.  The Hub will specifically address the challenges of South Africa, Namibia, Ghana, Fiji and Solomon Islands in realising the economic, socio-cultural and environmental benefits from the ocean. It aims to support these countries&apos; efforts towards developing a sustainable and fair blue economy by providing new scientific data and tools to engage different sectors and groups within society, particularly vulnerable communities, woman and youth, in identifying opportunities, risks and trade-offs to: i) prevent and mitigate negative development impacts connected to the ocean, ii) participate in traditional and emerging ocean activities, and iii) predict the socioeconomic benefits of ocean conservation.  The Hub pioneers integrating law and arts, policy, informatics, education, history, anthropology,  and philosophy to provide targeted advice on coherent and flexible, pro-poor and gender- sensitive, climate-proofed and transparent laws and policies across the areas of environmental, human rights, science and technology, trade and investment. The Hub will further integrate biology, physics, chemistry, oceanography, ecology, mathematics, socio-environmental sciences and law to advance understanding of sustainable fisheries in the face of climate change impacts, as well as socio-economic and cultural considerations. The Hub will also increase understanding of conservation and extraction options for deep-sea mineral, biological and freshwater resources, integrating biology, ecology, geology, socio-environmental sciences and law. Through innovative use of arts the hub will transcend traditional boundaries in policy, law, and between ocean stakeholders from local communties to international organisatons, to respectfully and effectively include local communities&apos; traditional knowledge in decision-making at the national and local level on the blue economy. The Hub will develop the integrated governance frameworks and strengthen the capacity within commnities to drive innovative approaches to a fair and sustainable blue economy for South Africa, Namibia, Ghana, Fiji and Solomon Islands</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="The One Ocean Hub will carry out innovative research and integrated knowledge translation towards its vision to enable integrated ocean governance for equitable and inclusive sustainability. This will be delivered through 5 research programmes: Global law and governance for integrated ocean management; Emotionally connecting with the ocean; Sustainable and equitable fisheries in an ecosystem context for human wellbeing; The role and potential of (non-fisheries) offshore marine resources to support a sustainable blue economy; and Transformative governance for an inclusive, innovative and responsible blue society.   New evidence base and innovative methodologies aim to support transformative governance for a healthy ocean and an equitable, circular blue economy, primarily in West Africa and South Pacific, by:   Connecting norms across sectors at all levels, to enhance the implementation of international law in an inclusive manner, thereby empowering communities, women and youth to shape ocean governance and strengthening LMICs&apos; voice in international fora;  Integrating knowledge across sectors and scales, to design and implement ocean management approaches to predict, prevent and manage negative environmental, economic and socio-cultural impacts on the ocean and maximize positive impacts in data- and technology-constrained contexts, by supporting multiple knowledge holders to collaboratively advance ocean norms, science and governance;  Enabling dialogue across sectors and communities, on the basis of improved understanding of visible and invisible trade-offs across competing sectors and of different values and (world)views of the ocean, by emotionally (re)engaging diverse actors in tackling challenges and opportunities related to ocean health; and;  Empower sustainable collaborative partnerships, so that decisions regarding the conservation of the ocean and the use of its resources are informed by multiple values and support fair and equitable sharing of benefits for healthy and resilient communities in South Africa, Namibia, Ghana, Fiji and Solomon Islands.  This is needed to ensure greater balance between the conservation and sustainable use of the ocean (SDG 14) and to avoid negative socio-cultural impacts (poverty reduction, food security, human health and healthy terrestrial ecosystems, ecosystem-based climate change mitigation and adaptation, cultural heritage, and equitable economic growth and decent employment: SDGs 1-8 &amp; 10-17). In particular, the ONE OCEAN Hub thus seeks to support vulnerable groups in Africa and Small Island Developing States who face the greatest challenges to: I) prevent and mitigate negative development impacts connected to the ocean, ii) participate in traditional and emerging ocean activities, and iii) predict the socioeconomic benefits of ocean conservation"></capital-spend>
