   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Narratives of Conflict, Climate, and Development: Re-envisioning Sustainability from Post-War Northern Uganda</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">1) Propose highly innovative recommendations for climate change adaptation policies that do justice to legacies of conflict and provide a foundation for sustainable development. These recommendations can provide guidance for northern Uganda specifically but also for other post-conflict contexts that are facing a severe threat from climate change. Developing such recommendations is essential today, given the rapidity with which climate change adaptation and mitigation policies are being developed for and imposed upon the continent of Africa, including post-conflict contexts.  2) Formulate these policy recommendations by developing a novel interdisciplinary approach that combines the insights of political ecology with the community&apos;s own vision of peace and development, ascertained through cultural and literary studies. The creative juxtaposition of social science approaches, guided by political scientists and development economists, with arts and humanities approaches, guided by historians and literary scholars, will allow an original set of policy recommendations to emerge.  3) Contribute to peacebuilding and reconstruction in northern Uganda. This will be achieved through several routes. First, at the grassroots level, the project partner, Human Rights Focus, will host community dialogues in which the ideas and proposals developed through the research are presented and discussed. Second, at the local and regional government level, the concluding international conference will enable a critical discussion of these themes among key political actors and policy makers. Third, at the international level, the publications, working papers, and website, together with the project team&apos;s engagement with policy makers will help shape the debate on the climate, peace, and development in northern Uganda.  4) Assemble and sustain a multidisciplinary, international network of researchers who can continue working in the future on climate, peace, and development in northern Uganda and more widely. This network will bring together early career researchers with more established senior faculty, as well as scholars in Uganda, the UK, the USA, and Lebanon so as to ensure truly international perspectives. They will come from a variety of disciplines, enabling creative conversations and debates among the different approaches. The investigators will seek to sustain this network into the future through further grants and collaborative opportunities.  5) Develop a research capacity in Northern Uganda by building the research capacity at Human Rights Focus, the project partner, and training young researchers as part of the research team and as part of the advisory group. There is no such research institution or network working in northern Uganda at present on these issues, in particular spanning the disciplines in this way, so the project&apos;s network and project partner will be able to have a strong voice in ongoing and future debates. The Ugandan researchers will be supported in future pursuit of graduate degrees, building local research capacity in northern Uganda around these issues.   6) Produce and publish a significant body of work on the research findings and policy implications. First, we will produce three peer-reviewed journal articles from the project written by the PI and/or Co-I and submitted for publication by the end of the project. Second, by the end of the project, at least two working papers will be prepared for dissemination and discussion at the Concluding Conference. Third, a book for both academic and policy audiences will be planned, to be completed after the end of the project. The PI and Co-I will also make presentations at minimum two academic conferences, such as the 2017 African Studies Association conference and the 2018 International Studies Association conference. In addition to these, the investigators are frequently invited to give talks at universities and conferences around the world.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">What is the relation between conflict, development, and climate change? This question has taken center stage in policymaking in Africa, as climate change is considered the greatest threat to development as well as a major risk for future conflict. Massive donor funding is being mobilized towards climate change adaptation in the name of averting environmental crisis and promoting development and peace. In this mainstream framework, climate change is to be dealt with through technical fixes to enable African communities to adapt to climatic hazards. These top-down policies are just beginning to be implemented in much of Africa, including in northern Uganda, a highly vulnerable region and the site of this proposed research.  But this mainstream, technical approach has not gone unchallenged. For, as many scholars have pointed out, without a history of economic and political deprivation and marginalization that renders certain African communities vulnerable to climate change, it would not present the dramatic threat it does. The implication is that, since climate change adaptation policies seek to help existing social structures adapt to future climatic changes, if those structures are characterized by injustice, inequality, and violence, adaptation policies may be building locking in the very structural inequalities that make African communities vulnerable to climate change in the first place.  In northern Uganda, like many post-conflict situations, today&apos;s injustice, deprivation, and inequality is largely a legacy of war, which has left the region far behind the rest of the country in all development indicators. The conflict saw the mass forced displacement of over a million rural people into internment camps by the government, leading to environmental devastation and a legacy that continues today in forceful land dispossession, massive deforestation, pollution from expanding oil extraction, and displacement by infrastructure, all enforced by the Ugandan military. This has led to large inequalities in land access, loss of livelihoods, and a growing, precarious semi-urban population as the resources needed for sustainable development are being stripped away. In the midst of this ongoing environmental devastation, expansive climate change adaptation policies are being inaugurated - but, if they ignore the ongoing violent legacy of conflict and focus on technical fixes, they risk worsening that legacy, setting the stage for future conflict, and foreclosing inclusive and sustainable development.  This leads to the project&apos;s primary question: how can climate change policy for post-conflict northern Uganda - and, by extension, for other post-conflict contexts - be re-envisioned so that it enables peace and development? The project will explore how two different disciplinary frameworks understand the relation between conflict, development, and environmental crisis and how they can be put them into conversation with each other in order to produce highly innovative results both academically and for climate change policy. First, we will employ a political ecology framework to look at the post-conflict situation in northern Uganda. Political ecology understands the relation between conflict, development, and environmental crisis as largely representing struggles over resources between state and capital on one side and the community on the other. Second, we will employ history and literary and cultural studies to explore the community of northern Uganda&apos;s own understanding of conflict, development, and climate change, representing very different bases for dealing with the threat it poses. The community&apos;s visions are accessible only through intensive knowledge of language and culture and through extended engagement with the northern Ugandan community. It is the creative dialogue between these disciplinary paradigms as they are employed in research in northern Uganda that will produce our innovative answers.</narrative>
