   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project will bring together rural craft producers, fair trade businesses and design researchers in Indonesia to explore opportunities, to develop new networks, build long term partnerships and support innovation. The UN has a Sustainable Development Goal to &quot;Promote inclusive and sustainable economic growth, employment and decent work for all&quot;. To achieve this, the UN has set targets to: &quot;Promote development-oriented policies that support productive activities, decent job creation, entrepreneurship, creativity and innovation, and encourage the formalization and growth of micro-, small- and medium-sized enterprises ...&quot;, and to &quot;... devise and implement policies to promote sustainable tourism that creates jobs and promotes local culture and products&quot;Creating new connections between Indonesian design researchers, international fair trade organisations and rural craft producers, will stimulate innovation in products, services and marketing (both for export and for local sustainable tourism). These initiatives will improve employment opportunities in rural areas, encourage pride in local culture, improve rural incomes and reduce pressures of migration towards cities.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project will build and strengthen creative networks and collaborations between rural craft producers, particularly engaging marginalised producers, in Indonesia (Bali &amp; East Java), fair trade organisations (in the UK and Indonesia), and academic design researchers (in the UK &amp; Indonesia).  The primary aim of the project is to improve the livelihoods and conditions of these craft producers.  The work will build on findings and learning in the Create Connect &amp; Sustain project that was funded by the AHRC led &apos;Connected Communities&apos; programme and which brought together a diverse network of UK social businesses who are focused on creative practice. Learning will also be applied drawing on the EPSRC funded &apos;Fair Tracing&apos; project which examined creative applications of digital technologies to support fair trade. The primary objectives of the project are: * To develop and strengthen linkages amongst Indonesian craft producers, and between producers and design researchers in Indonesia, and between producers and potential customers; * To enable organisations in the Indonesian fair trade craft sector to uncover and communicate evidence of the social value that they are generating; * To assist these new networks to develop their innovation and marketing capacities so as to identify and capture maximum benefits from both export trade and from opportunities in their local markets, such as supplying products to urban centres and to the tourism industry.</narrative>
