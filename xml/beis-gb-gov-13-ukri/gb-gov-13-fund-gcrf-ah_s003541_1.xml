   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Georgia has suffered a series of crises since the end of communism in 1991, suffering a civil war, the loss of Abkhazia and, since 2008 Tskhinvali/South Ossetia has been occupied by the Russian army. This means that there are up to 232,700 IDPs in Georgia (http://www.internal-displacement.org/europe-the-caucasus-and-central-asia/georgia/figures-analysis) out of a population of 3.9 million (http://worldpopulationreview.com/countries/georgia-population/) which equates to almost 17% of the overall population of the country. 20% of the country&apos;s territory is occupied by Russia (https://www.georgianjournal.ge/politics/34274-10-years-after-putins-invasion-russia-still-occupies-parts-of-georgia-daily-signal.html) and these factors have placed a significant social, political and economic strain on society. Added to this the population of Tbilisi is now officially 1,225,000 (http://tbilisiguide.ge/w/about_georgia.php) although it is believed the real total is higher, and this movement from the villages to the capital has precipitated a crisis in life opportunities for many young people. Educational needs To place this initiative in a wider context, it must be understood that there is such chronic underfunding of the Georgian schools system that children attend in two shifts - 10.00-14.00 and 14.00-18.00 meaning that no child studies for a full day as is normal in most other European countries. In addition the extremely long holidays and many National Bank Holidays further curtail the school year, as does the widespread practice of children being withdrawn for the last 2 weeks of term each academic year and sent off to relatives in the provinces. In the villages, school buildings are often almost derelict Soviet era constructions that are dangerously unstable and teachers earn in the region of 300 Lari (less than &#xA3;90) a month, meaning that many have to take on second jobs or run smallholdings to cover their living costs. Given this chronically under-funded education system there is an urgent need to offer advanced skills training and resource packs to teachers in order to raise the level of morale and also to encourage teachers to talk to children about wider aspirations beyond their rural communities and consider the possibilities offered by tertiary education. Educational Capacity Building This strategy envisages a more unified approach that builds on Ministry of Education objectives, to implement further training for curatorial staff and teachers so that they have the skills necessary to develop classes in a museum or other heritage context. For some time Prof. Dr. David Lordkipanidze, Director of the GNM, has been searching for partners to help the GMN work with teachers and children from IDP backgrounds or living in the most remote parts of the country. His vision has been to inspire children from places such as the High Caucasus or the Azeri and Armenian minorities in the south to aspire to a career in the Humanities or the Natural Sciences with a view to them ultimately working as academics or curators. His methodology has been to organise summer camps and activity days for children, which is in line with the Ministry of Culture&apos;s Heritage 2025 strategy, that calls upon institutions like the GNM to take a leading role in offering skills development to teachers and engage with the most economically marginalised members of society.  This research proposes to utilise the approach favoured by the Director of the GNM and institute a training network involving GNM junior curators and educational staff interacting with regional schoolteachers to promote museums and cultural heritage sites as inviting spaces for classes in which to teach children about the value of not only cultural heritage, but also the Humanities in general.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This research will network with the Georgian National Museum (GNM) in a series of research-led educational opportunities to explore the archaeological heritage of a post-Communist country in a frozen conflict situation.  Capacity building amongst junior curatorial staff at the GNM will support schools-based education and learning by offering additional skills training to under-resourced schoolteachers.  This will then trickle down to a schools environment and improve education in a range of Humanities subjects. The objectives of the proposed research are as follows: 1. To support and improve the work of the Department of Education at the GNM. As mentioned elsewhere, the department has had difficulty interacting with senior curatorial staff and therefore members of staff in the department are often fairly ill-equipped to take tours around the museum collections. It is hoped that by engaging in this project and making use of the educational material generated from the 2017 pilot project onwards, the staff of the GNM Education Department will gain the confidence to lead tours of the GNM collections themselves, rather than feeling that only curators possess the specialist skills necessary. 2. To provide training to junior curatorial staff of the GNM so that they are equipped with the skills necessary to communicate their research and scholarship &apos;outside the academy&apos;, in particular so that they gain the skills necessary to engage with children, teenagers, Internally Displaced People (IDPs), the disabled and ethnic minorities - all groups that have been identified as not being very active in Cultural Heritage education in Georgia and that would benefit from widening participation/inclusivity and diversity initiatives. 3. To provide skills training and additional teaching resources to teachers working with these children and young adults in order to improve their own pedagogical techniques (a prerequisite necessary for promotion laid down by the Georgian Ministry of Education). 4. To widen access to museums and archaeological sites for the poorest and most marginalised members of Georgian society. This project will concentrate particularly on primary age children and younger teenagers and we wish to prioritise those from religious and ethnic minorities (such as the Armenians, Azeris, Kurds and Yazidis), children from IDP families (those displaced from Abkhazia and Tskhinvali/South Ossetia) and finally those from remote agricultural communities who are geographically and economically isolated. 5. To generate a body of literature, both in hard copy and in digital format available for free download from the GNM website, that can be used by teachers, museum professionals and the interested general public to learn about the museum collections of the GNM and selected national monuments in a relatively simple, but accurate and informed way. It is hoped that this will begin to pave the way towards the production of guidebooks for the GNM as a useful tool for visitors as well as a much-needed source of income. 6. For the PI to continue her research on how interacting with Cultural Heritage resources can strengthen a sense of belonging in ethnic minority and religious minority groups. In this case the PI is particularly interested in seeing if the Armenian community engage with this project and it increases their feeling of belonging in wider Georgian society.</narrative>
