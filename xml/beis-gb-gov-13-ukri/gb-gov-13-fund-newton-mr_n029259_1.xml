   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Interventions to improve maternal metabolic profile in obese pregnancy and prevent cardio-metabolic and behavioural deficits in future generations</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">General Hypothesis  Fetal and neonatal exposure to the adverse maternal metabolic milieu of obesity in pregnancy during what is a vulnerable, plastic period of development for multiple offspring organs can lead to childhood and adult cardiovascular metabolic and behavioural abnormalities. Our general hypothesis is that targeted interventions, before and during pregnancy and lactation, of maternal dietary supplementation with resveratrol and polydextrose will ameliorate offspring cardiovascular, metabolic and behavioural deficits.  We further hypothesise sex-of-offspring-specific outcomes. Both investigators will employ their established rat models of maternal obesity [1-3].  Specific Hypotheses  More specifically, we hypothesis that the long term adverse consequences of maternal obesity on maternal and offspring cardiovascular, metabolic and behavioural phenotype are mediated via one or more of the following mechanisms which may be modifiable risk factors amenable to maternal intervention with dietary resveratrol and polydextrose supplementation: Hypothesis 1. Maternal metabolic profile e.g. glucose and lipids Hypothesis 2. Maternal obesity-related oxidative stress Hypothesis 3. Maternal endocrinology e.g. corticosterone, leptin, insulin  Aims &amp; Objectives  We will establish the safety and efficacy of resveratrol and polydextrose intervention in preventing adverse: 1. Offspring metabolic, cardiovascular and behavioural phenotype  2. Obesity-related oxidative stress mechanisms  3. Offspring endocrinological changes.  Experimental approach  Our approach will be to employ our well-established rat models to deliver resveratrol at two doses to extend our preliminary findings [4-8] and establish efficacy and address concerns over unwanted effects produced in studies with high or undetermined doses. We will also administer 5% polydextrose in drinking water which we have shown to have beneficial effect on offspring body composition and energy balance [9]. We will address our aims by assessing the effect of intervention on the following end-points: 1. Metabolic profiles in both mother and offspring using oral GTT, circulating plasma metabolites, body composition and appetitive behaviour.  2. Maternal and offspring cardiovascular function employing implantable blood-pressure radio-telemetry [1] to monitor blood pressure, heart rate variability, locomotor activity and cardiovascular reactivity to stress.  3. Maternal and offspring markers of oxidative stress [4, 10] employing RNA Seq, ROS activity assays, nitrotyrosine immunohistochemistry, malondialdehyde and anti-oxidant glutathione peroxidase activity, in blood and liver tissues. 4. Markers of maternal and offspring endocrine function including selective leptin responsiveness and altered hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis function and the gut microbiome [6, 9, 11]. 5. Offspring neurocognitive and behavioural performance employing a battery of established behavioural tasks [12].  6. Epigenetic changes and biomarkers for long term health [5]. We will determine changes in genes that affect methylation, histone function and ribosomal proteins in juvenile and adult offspring liver transcriptome with RNA Seq. 7. Studies will be conducted in mothers at day 19 of gestation and at weaning and in offspring at 30 and 110 days postnatal [3].  With all of these approaches we will employ both the &apos;discovery approach&apos; (RNA seq and micro RNA seq) and candidate gene approach to elucidate the physiological signals, critical periods and molecular mechanisms underlying neonatal programming of offspring cardiovascular, metabolic and behavioural phenotype secondary to maternal obesity.   Our findings will readily inform and translate to clinical studies in obese pregnant women in Mexico and the UK partners will transfer extensive &apos;know-how&apos; and experience of conducting large scale clinical trials in pregnant women.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The prevalence of obesity in Mexico is one of the highest in the world, and the highest for childhood obesity. Maternal obesity is now the single biggest obstetric risk factor, and it is now widely recognised that maternal obesity is not only a risk factor for pregnancy outcomes (e.g. pre-eclampsia,  gestational diabetes and fetal macrosomia) but also for the long term health of the child, with increased risk of obesity and related comorbidities.  A recent landmark paper reported maternal obesity in pregnancy was associated with an increase in all-cause mortality in adult offspring and specifically increased mortality from cardiovascular events (Reynolds et al., 2013). It is therefore, now more important than ever before that we understand the consequences of the obesity epidemic for pregnant women, not just in terms of pregnancy outcome, but also in terms of the potential impact on the cardiovascular health of the next generation. Diet and nutrition in pregnancy are modifiable risk factors for offspring metabolic health and offer the opportunity for intervention to stem the growing tide of childhood obesity and impact on the cardiovascular and mental health of the next generation.   The &apos;developmental programming of health and disease hypothesis&apos; has highlighted numerous environmental exposures in early life that can modify an individuals health over a lifetime. Human population studies demonstrate influences of maternal diet and hormonal environment in pregnancy and early post-natal life on disease risk in adulthood and are extensively supported by animal studies which have been invaluable in providing mechanistic insight and proof of principle into the phenomenon of developmental programming and its role in offspring long-term health and disease.  Dr Zambrano&apos;s team in Mexico and Dr Taylor&apos;s group at King&apos;s College London have worked in the field of developmental programming for many years and have a shared interest in diet and lifestyle interventions to improve maternal metabolic profile in obese pregnancy and prevent cardio-metabolic and behavioural deficits in the offspring. The teams have identified two candidate compounds, resveratrol and polydextrose which they intend to test for safety and efficacy (therapeutic potential) in a rat model of obesity in pregnancy. Resveratrol is a polyphenolic compound and one of a diverse group of naturally occurring plant compounds with numerous biological activities and anti-oxidant properties. Polydextrose on the other hand, is a soluble fibre with low glycaemic index and pro-biotic properties. In preliminary studies the teams have shown beneficial effects of both these compounds on adverse metabolic and hormonal profiles in an animal model of obesity in pregnancy.  The collaboration will employ complementary rodent models to advance understanding of the efficacy and safety of these compounds in improving maternal metabolic profiles in obese pregnancy and their disease-preventive potential for cardiovascular (high blood pressure) metabolic (obesity and diabetes) and behavioural deficits (cognitive function and ADHD) in future generations. Interventions with these two promising compounds, conceivably acting through divergent pathways, will also provide insight and mechanistic understanding of how obesity in pregnancy can beget obesity and related disorders in childhood and beyond.   This proposal will readily translate to clinical studies in obese pregnant women particularly in Mexico and the Women&apos;s Health Academic Centre at King&apos;s has extensive experience of conducting large scale clinical trials in pregnant women. This exciting Newton fund proposal therefore seeks to exploit common research interests, to forge stronger collaboration between our groups. It will bring added value to our research efforts, provide technology and knowledge transfer, whilst providing vital capacity building for our Mexican partners and clinical translation within a five year time-frame.</narrative>
