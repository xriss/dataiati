   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Both the UK and China face great demands for offshore renewable energy (ORE) yet high risks have impeded faster development. While the cost of generated energy has just been reduced to &#xA3;100/MWhr for offshore wind in the UK (4 years ahead of government schedule) deployment further offshore will increase both the capital and operational &amp; maintenance (O&amp;M) costs. in China, onshore wind power is severely curtailed due to crowded transmission corridors. Exploitation of offshore wind would better match the population distribution in China, and so hence there is a strong motivation to exploit this ORE. In order accelerate this development, new technologies are desperately needed to improve the performance in terms of cost, efficiency and reliability (availability). In addition to offshore wind, other forms of marine renewable energy will also play indispensable roles in the future renewable energy mix. Because these technologies are less mature, this development involves even higher risks. As yet none of the wave energy generation companies have shown to be commercially viable without economic support mechanisms.   Recognising the high risks involved and the development work that is urgently needed in the industry, this project aims to carry out fundamental modelling and validating work that will lead to the capability of virtual prototyping. Such a capability will significantly accelerate and de-risk the development work in industry. Complementary expertise in the two countries are combined to address the requirements of overall system performance from ORE devices (wind and wave) to grid, and focuses on the critical technical aspects that will dictate the design decisions. This will be achieved through multiple scale (dimensional and time-wise) and multiple resolution modelling, taking into account the specifications and utilisation of materials and components in the designed systems subject to optimal control. The modelling will cover the manufacturability of the designs and will consider environmental constraints including impact on sea life in different locations. These will be important as ORE development is scaled up in the future. The outcome of research will be demonstrated through a series of case studies including both systems for large wind farms and wave arrays, and also small scale devices supplying energy to off-grid islands.  The project members have long track records in modelling and design of components in wind and marine renewable systems. The project allows the researchers to interact and carry out studies cutting across the borders of different engineering disciplines, enabling hi-fidelity modelling and virtual prototyping.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="The primary objective of the project is to enable the virtual prototyping of the powertrains and power takeoff (PTO) mechanisms of future offshore wind and wave energy devices which can then be optimised in terms cost, efficiency and reliability (availability) from the view point of the overall system from the device to the grid. It will also allow the marine environmental constraints to be taken into account at the early stage of design. The virtual prototyping capability aims to promote and de-risk the development of offshore renewable energy technologies. The project has the following specific objectives:  1) To model the hardware and control of PTO systems in order to achieve high overall system resource-to-wire efficiency in a computationally efficient manner, allowing effective optimisation and design. 2) To model the hardware and control of PTO systems in order to achieve high overall system availability in an efficient manner, allowing effective optimisation and design. 3) To model the hardware and control of PTO systems in order to achieve low manufacturing cost and scaling, allowing effective optimisation and design. 4) To model the hardware and control of PTO systems in order to mitigate and tailor acoustic environmental impact, allowing effective optimisation and design. 5) To integrate models of devices and their power conversion systems enabling PTO design and control to be optimised for various objective functions, especially cost of energy. 6) To provide documentation of the developed tools, research data and model management and produce outputs suitable for journal and conference publications and develop pathways for impact."></capital-spend>
