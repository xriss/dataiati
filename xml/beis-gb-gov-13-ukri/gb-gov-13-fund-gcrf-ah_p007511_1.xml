   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The aim of this pilot project is to support specific marginalised communities in Brazil, India and South Africa to challenge the way these nations present themselves to the world via &apos;nation branding&apos; and other &apos;soft power&apos; initiatives. In so doing, the project seeks to raise awareness nationally and internationally of these communities&apos; precarious place in society and to support them in campaigning to effect change in their lives.   The particular focus of the project will be on the privileged place historical dramas made for the large and small screen frequently have in &apos;nation-branding&apos; exercises. From the instrumentalisation of Downton Abbey within public diplomacy initiatives in the UK to the role played by the Bollywood historical epic Jodhaa Akbar (Ashutosh Gowariker, 2008) in campaigns to attract investment from non-resident Indians, historical dramas are frequently considered to be excellent vehicles for the international projection of the nation, allowing elites to communicate effectively the key messages in the &apos;national strategic narrative&apos; that are considered to be central to the leverage of soft power. Our project will look at the role such dramas play in three ODA recipient countries that are considered by many commentators to be central to the broader development of the &apos;global South&apos;. Although all are members of the BRICS grouping, all are at very different stages in their development. All have complex relationships to their colonial pasts and, in each case, this past plays a distinctive role in the present-day construction of the nation.  The project will begin with an investigation of how all three nations use their history as an important asset within their &apos;soft power&apos; strategies, focussing in particular on the instrumentalisation of film in each country.  The project will then work with international development agencies to explore how these national narratives are experienced by some of the most marginalised groups within these societies. In South Africa, we will work with the Bishop Simeon Trust to support groups of &apos;undocumented children&apos; to challenge the national story of &apos;transition&apos;. In India we will work with Budhan Theatre/Nomad Films and with the &apos;Denotified Tribes Rights Action Group&apos; (DNT RAG) to explore the historical predicament of these ex-&apos;Criminal Tribe&apos; communities in the cities of western India. In Brazil, we will work with Plan International and young people from Cod&#xF3; (Maranh&#xE3;o), one of Brazil&apos;s surviving quilombos or &apos;maroon communities&apos;.   Through a process of co-production we will make a series of video responses by these groups to the way their nations&apos; histories are presented to the world. The purpose of the videos will be to support these groups to reflect upon their place in society, allowing them to contextualize their struggles globally by learning from the experience of our other case studies, and to develop awareness-raising campaigns.    In the process, this project responds to several strands in this call, supporting marginalized communities to voice &apos;hidden histories&apos; that &apos;have been absent from the representation of local and national stories&apos;. It will also explore &apos;the potential of creative practice as a tool for international development and intercultural communication&apos;. However, most significantly it will engage &apos;with questions of silence, voicelessness and amnesia&apos;, in order to challenge &apos;voice poverty&apos; within, and the &apos;social exclusion&apos; of, the three communities with which we will be working. In the process the project will also contribute to the development of both Translating Cultures and Care for the Future, providing opportunities for &apos;reflection on the vehicles of translation&apos; (narratives, performances and other cultural artefacts) and intercultural exchange. In addition, it will work with our external partners to explore the way historical narratives can be used to effect change in the lives of vulnerable communities.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="1. The primary objective of this pilot project is to work in partnership with international development agencies to support three marginalised communities in Brazil, South Africa and India, three nations that are seen as key to the development of the &apos;global south&apos;.  The aim of this work is to raise awareness of these communities vulnerable position within society at home and abroad. The project wishes to help them to gain a global perspective on their local situation in order to effect change in their lives.  2. In order to achieve this we will explore the gap between the way the &apos;national strategic narrative&apos; is presented in &apos;nation-branding&apos; and other initiatives designed to maximise the nations&apos; &apos;soft power&apos; and how these narratives are experienced on the ground by these three communities. Our point of comparison will be the role of historical dramas within such initiatives. Be it Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom (2013) in South Africa, Jodhaa Akbar (2008) in India or Lula, o Filho do Brasil (2009) in Brazil, high-profile historical dramas frequently hold a privileged place in nation-branding campaigns, the approach to the nation&apos;s past in such films - or at least the way it is presented in such campaigns - revealing particularly clearly the preferred version of the &apos;national story&apos;. Invariable history is presented in these campaigns in such a way as to suggest a now unified, cosmopolitan nation, ready to play a major role in the global economy.   3. During two project workshops, this research will be scrutinised by an international, interdisciplinary group of scholars working on nation branding, soft power and representation, film studies and international development, as well as representatives from our international partner organisations. Our final results will be published as an edited volume (initial discussions have been had with Routledge, who are interested in publishing the volume as part of its &apos;Remapping World Cinemas&apos; series).  4. This research will then be used as the basis for a series of knowledge-exchange workshops with our international partners and community groups. Through a careful process of co-production, we will make a series of videos in which these groups will offer a  response to the way history is presented in the &apos;national strategic narrative&apos; of their country.   5. These films will be used as the basis of an advocacy campaign in each country, managed by our international development partners, in order to raise awareness of the position of these communities, allowing them to speak for themselves, thereby &apos;giving voice&apos; to their largely hidden histories.  6. The project will create a website where all project materials will be published. A blog will be maintained and a briefing paper published, summarising the project&apos;s key findings. This website will be advertised widely through the project team&apos;s networks on a variety of social-media platforms, as well as at all project-related events.  7. The project will also generate an interdisciplinary international network via its two workshops. This group will be engaged in order to evaluate the lessons that can be learnt from this pilot on the role of history and cultural production in nation-branding exercises, a dimension that has largely been ignored in the literature which is driven by the social sciences and overwhelmingly by scholars of destination marketing and tourism. It will also provide evidence of how participatory arts, and particularly filmmaking, can be used as a tool for international development.  8. This experience will subsequently be used to develop a further, larger scale project with our international network in order to maximise the global impact of the pilot.   9. The project will also provide an opportunity for an early-career researcher to gain experience in using arts and humanities research within an international-development context, building the capacity of the profession to undertake such work in the future."></capital-spend>
