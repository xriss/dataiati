   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project aims to bring together and produce cutting edge research to provide pest and disease monitoring and forecast information, integrating multi-source (Earth Observation (EO), meteorological and vertical looking radar) to support decision making in the sustainable management of insect pests and diseases. The project will explore the integration and fusion of new data sources from recently launched satellites with existing data products. This will overcome spatial and temporal differences to produce new data solutions and algorithms which are suitable for pest and disease monitoring and prediction, intervention efficacy forecasting and estimation of yield losses. The new data products and algorithms will be tested using two candidate systems: a fungal disease of wheat (stripe rust) and a serious insect pest (migratory locust). The corresponding efficacy of a biopesticide used to control the locust will also be explored, with the aim to investigate whether the same data inputs produced during this project can be utilised under a wide range of systems, leading to a greater impact of data assimilation in the future. Models will be validated in the laboratory and in the field to give a measure of certainty of predictions. Additionally, risk and loss estimation will be investigated using cutting edge EO techniques, and monitoring of locusts will be explored using Vertical Looking Radar, a technology which is capable of identifying the size and species of insect flying through a radar beam. In addition to building monitoring and forecasting systems with data assimilated during this project, routes to extend this information to appropriate end users will be explored to ensure maximum impact of technologies developed during the project. The project consortium will work closely with NATESC in China to ensure the system is built in a way that is compatible with existing methods of information dissemination. The project consortium is a strong multidisciplinary team with expertise in EO, vertical-looking radar technology and agricultural research and extension.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="This project aims to bring together cutting edge research to provide pest and disease monitoring and forecast information, integrating multi-source information (Earth Observation (EO), meteorological and vertical-looking radar) to support decision making in the sustainable management of insect pests and diseases. The main objective of this project is to improve the utilisation of EO data for monitoring pests and diseases through development of new algorithms and the fusion of new and existing data products using multi-source EO data to produce full cover, high spatial, high temporal land surface information. Approaches for the better estimation of high resolution surface temperature statistics, diurnal surface temperature patterns, Surface Soil Moisture (SSM) and vegetation dynamics will be investigated. In addition, the consortium will validate and prove the relevance of these data products through their application to existing pest and disease development models: a plant pathogen (wheat stripe rust) and an insect pest, the migratory locust, and its associated biopesticide. These pathogen models aim to estimate the rate of disease progression using the EO data products developed during the project to give outputs such as speed of kill of the locust when a biopesticide is applied, speed of locust development, and how fast the wheat pathogen is developing in the field, under given conditions. The team will also validate and prove the relevance of these models and data products through field experiments. The use of Vertical Looking Radar will be explored as a tool for monitoring locusts and assessing the efficacy of interventions through tracking abundance and composition of aerial insect fauna.  Subsequently, the team will explore their application to existing wheat rust and locust biopesticide models to produce an estimation of risk or potential yield losses. To ensure the project outcomes will have the greatest impact, an investigation into the best practice for routes of dissemination of these information products will be conducted during the project, in association with the Ministry of Agriculture&apos;s National Agro-Tech Extension and Service Centre (NATESC) in China. The project aims to continue a successful collaboration building on previous experience from the first stage of Newton STFC funding and continue to strengthen the relationship between project partners in UK and China. The consortium also aims to extend the impact of the project work through publication in high impact factor open access publications and attending international conferences."></capital-spend>
