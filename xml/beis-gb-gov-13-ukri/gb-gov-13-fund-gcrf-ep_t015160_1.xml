   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The strategic aim of this project is to bridge the gap between the theory and practice of a humanitarian shelter approach that supports families and communities in their self-recovery pathways, to develop practical approaches and build capacity. There is one over-arching objective to: 1. Co-develop best-practice guidance for the support of the self-recovery process that allows families to exercise the primacy of their own agency and choice in the pursuance of their own self-recovery pathway.  This is supported by five practical objectives that will result in demonstrable outputs and impact:  I. Develop. Develop tools and guidance for the implementation of disaster responses that support self-recovery; further refine existing protocol and adapt for preparedness and disaster risk reduction. II. Test. Further test the &apos;Informing Choice for Better Shelter&apos; protocol that supports the rapid development of contextualised technical information for families and local builders (originally piloted in Mozambique after Cyclone Idai 2019); trial and test methodological approaches to community-led context analysis, and monitoring, evaluation and learning (MEL) specifically adapted to self-recovery. III. Adapt and learn. In recognition that a self-recovery approach to shelter after disasters is a relatively new modality, continue research activities to enhance our understanding and experience; in particular this will be in the form of &apos;action research&apos; or &apos;real time research&apos;, directly supporting aid agency country offices and the country-level Shelter Clusters in the development of response strategies that support families&apos; self-recovery efforts; continue the development of &apos;country profiles&apos; in at least two more countries that describe the local building cultures and social contexts within which recovery occurs (led by CRAterre, a French research organisation recognised as global experts in vernacular construction). IV. Train. In partnership with the International Federation of the Red Cross (IFRC), co-leads with UNHCR of the humanitarian coordination Global Shelter Cluster, hold regional training seminars on the theory and practice of self-recovery. V. Disseminate. Disseminate the findings and outputs of the project through a number of different channels. A key vehicle for dissemination and peer-review is the Supporting Self-recovery Working Group, an integrated part of the Global Shelter Cluster. This ensures peer acceptance and scrutiny of our work and an immediate channel to the wider shelter community. Other dissemination outlets will be through self-publication, blogs, articles, conference papers and more. All outputs will be open access.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project builds directly upon two previous GCRF awards:  1 NERC Resilience Foundation Award: Promoting Safer Building - Using science, technology, communication and humanitarian practice to support family and community self-recovery.  2 British Academy Cities and Infrastructure: Safer self-recovery: promoting resilient urban reconstruction after disasters.  The key findings of both these projects are described in the Business Case. For more on the findings of previous GCRF awards see: https://www.odi.org/publications/10963-self-recovery-disasters-interdisciplinary-perspective  Earthquakes, storms, floods, and conflict cause untold damage to infrastructure, services, agriculture and livelihoods. The destruction of housing is often most visible, and the most devastating to the families, with often hundreds of thousands of homes destroyed. Householders themselves are invariably the first to respond; they are never passive, and signs of shelter recovery are very apparent from the first days after a disaster. The majority - as many as 80 or 90% - receive little or no assistance from the international community and are the main drivers of their own recovery process. This process has been termed &apos;self-recovery&apos;.   The previous GCRF awards supported interdisciplinary teams led by ODI in collaboration with CARE International UK, BGS, UCL and Loughborough University. They developed the understanding of the self-recovery process and advanced the theoretical basis for humanitarian assistance to the process of supporting self-recovery in practice . In large part as a result of this work, self-recovery is now a strategic element of the humanitarian shelter sector discourse with many disaster responses purporting to support this inevitable process.   In recognition of the value of a people-centred approach that moves away from the convention product-based modalities, the CARE Philippines post-cyclone self-recovery project won the 2018 World Habitat Award  in acknowledgment of its self-recovery focus. Sixteen thousand houses were built, each one unique and reflecting the priorities and means of each family. https://www.world-habitat.org/world-habitat-awards/winners-and-finalists/post-haiyan-self-recovery-housing-programme/  The self-recovery approach that respects the primacy of agency and choice aligns well with current humanitarian and development concerns such as the &apos;humanitarian development nexus&apos;, the Grand Bargain&apos;s emphasis on localisation, participation and cash-based responses, the Sendai Framework on Disaster Risk Reduction, the Sustainable Development Goals and the Global Shelter Cluster strategy. This is further explained in the Business Case.   However, very little has been done to develop guidance for practice. With the exception of the protocol &apos;Informing Choice for Better Shelter&apos; that delivers a guide for the development of technical educational material, there are no published tools nor guidelines that provide an implementation framework for self-recovery in shelter projects.  This project addresses this gap. The protocol will be adapted to become a preparedness tool. A methodology for &apos;context analysis&apos; will be designed to incorporate the adaptability and diversity essential to a self-recovery approach. Monitoring and evaluation tools will be developed that focus on survivor-led indicators and that include a broad definition of good shelter programming that includes health, livelihoods, sanitation, protection and gender-based violence as well as the conventional focus on structural safety and construction quality.  The methodology will include field-work and case studies as well as action research, or real time research, that will directly support rapid-onset disaster responses contributing directly to development of strategies in the immediate aftermath of a disaster. All outputs will be thoroughly scrutinised by the humanitarian sector and incorporated directly into practice.</narrative>
