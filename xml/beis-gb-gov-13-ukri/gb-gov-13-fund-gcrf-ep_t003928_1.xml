   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Risk prediction for Women&apos;s Health and Rights in Tanzania: novel statistical methodology to target effective interventions</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The objectives of this programme are mathematically focused on the &apos;wicked problems&apos; that lie behind &quot;Call Scope 1: Modelling Society: Rights of girls and women&quot;. A new mathematical framework will directly address core problems of the hidden, noisy and disparate nature of datasets that underlie so many women&apos;s rights abuses; and which are preventing statistical analyses from supporting real-world solutions. Specific project goals are as follows:  1. To establish, through methodological developments in statistics, a new mathematical framework to help attack underlying data issues behind women&apos;s rights problems in LDCs, such as i. perinatal mortality and ii. vulnerability to  FGM and Forced Marriage.   2. To develop methods for &quot;probabilistic data assembly&quot;: a novel model generalising Multiple Systems Estimation to incorporate individual heterogeneity and data on the time and location of detection; generalisation of the Bradley-Terry model to incorporate spatial structure and associated statistical methods; and methodology to extract distributional uncertainty. These methods in combination target the core problem of hidden, unreliable and obfuscated datasets.   3. To develop novel methodology in Object Oriented Data Analysis for analysing complex, noisy and disparate data. In particular, methods for completion for partially observed manifold and network data; topological data analysis; and Bayesian matrix factorization and dimension reduction. Together these methods target the temporally unregistered and disparate/multi-view nature of data available.  4. To demonstrate and evaluate resulting models in two real world cases: a. to address infant mortality, providing new risk-models and tailored information to community health visitors dealing with perinatal deaths in Zanzibar (d-tree); and b. to seed elimination of FGM/Forced Marriage, through targeted educational interventions based on risk models of vulnerability in northern Tanzania (onebillion/Tanzania Development Trust).   5. To establish a wider community that will adopt probabilistic data assembly processes, integrate assembled inputs through Object Oriented Data Analysis, and develop predictive models that can help model all SDG5 (Gender Equality and Rights) challenges . This community includes the full engagement and development of a network of African mathematicians to take ownership of work beyond the project&apos;s lifetime.  6. To demonstrate the cost-viability of new methods enabled, and hence the business case for modelling key women&apos;s rights abuses in the region. Through direct government support, this programme aims to leave a continued legacy with our partner NGOs and data providers to continue sustainable change; and to expand to a broader region (Kenya, Ethiopia, Malawi, Uganda) to inform policy, global business/NGO investment beyond the scope of the initial project.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This programme will extend novel advances in mathematical sciences to identify, measure and rectify previously intractable humanitarian abuses related to Rights of Women (SDG5, 3.1, 5.3). The innovations established will feed directly into government supported health and education interventions in Tanzania, East Africa - a country where women continue to suffer from pernicious inequality, leading to horrendous and sustained humanitarian abuses: widespread Female Genital Mutilation (FGM), Forced Marriage and continued unacceptable rates of Perinatal Mortality.   To address these issues a new mathematical framework is required, motivated by a single key issue underpinning SDG5, and distinct from most others. Dreadful as they are, the challenges facing other SDGs, whether they be floods, disease or even extreme poverty, are visible: they can be observed, modelled, monitored. The challenge of Women&apos;s Rights abuses stand in contrast: here data is obscured, censored and hidden from sight, often intentionally so. What data does exist is partial, unrepresentative and multi-viewed, arriving piecemeal from disparate sources.  As a consequence, solutions based on mathematical modelling are often passed over wholesale. Only aggregate, region level figures tend to be known. Vulnerability and risk across individuals are left unmodelled; interventions fail and abuses are perpetuated.    This destructive pathway is symptomatic of many rights issues of girls and women, and calls for a statistical approach designed specifically to handle the highly sparse, noisy and unbalanced data common to problems of this nature. Technical work to address this issue will be undertaken in three phases. First, a methodology for probabilistic data assembly will be developed to address hidden and obfuscated data challenges. This is followed by key extensions to Object Oriented and Topological Data Analysis that handle multi-view and temporally unaligned datasets. A final stage sees integration of developments into full predictive models, and the completion of the framework.  Through partnership with in-country academics, government, private-sector partners and  NGOS, and application of novel data sources (digital health data; drone/earth observation imagery; mobile-money; cell network data; crowd-sourced event reporting), resulting models will be used in two key intervention streams during project lifetime: 1. Perinatal mortality modelling with partners d-tree and the Ministry of Health (SDG 3.1); 2. FGM/Forced Marriage modelling (SDG 5.3) for target educational interventions with partners onebillion, Hope for Girls and Women and the Tanzania Development Trust. While these interventions provide initial focus for mathematical sciences developments, we expect the framework generated to have application beyond this geographical extent, and to a wide range of Sustainable Development Goals.</narrative>
