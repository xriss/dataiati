   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project aims to address learning issues, challenges and opportunities with Malaysian children of remote rural areas, and to investigate their acceptance to and engagement with learning using the CreativeCulture model. Upon successful implementation and testing in the proposed participatory studies, the outcome of the research will inform Malaysia on means for effectively infusing the CreativeCulture model to assist and accelerate learning for children in remote rural locations.  To develop the CreativeCulture model, the project will explore, exploit and experiment the impact of arts, design and culture in enhancing creative thinking, problem solving and development in education through game design and computational thinking. The project is aligned with the inclusion of Arts in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics education (STEAM), realising the potential of these subjects by enabling true innovation and new thinking through creativity. Art and culture boost creativity and creativity leads to innovation, new thinking and moving beyond existing skills; all together are triggers and needed in the social and economical transformation. There is also a need for fun, playful, hands-on, socially and culturally grounded explorations of topics during primary and secondary school to foster contextualised and deeper learning. Hence, creating games as a cooperative activity on the edge of the diverse fields of Art, Design, Culture, Science, and Engineering can be a fertile ground to cultivate these mind-sets and practices.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="The CreativeCulture project will deliver research, development and practice that will provide new insights and means for stimulating creative thinking to tackle real world problems and enhance transcultural values in Malaysia towards contributing to its economic and welfare development. The main aim of the project is to address issues, challenges and opportunities associated to sustaining the engagement of Malaysian children of remote and rural areas with learning, and to investigate their acceptance to creative approaches using the CreativeCulture model. Upon successful implementation and testing, the outcome of the research will inform and provide Malaysia with means for effectively infusing the CreativeCulture model to assist and accelerate learning for children in remote and rural locations.  Aligning with the theme of Creative Economy and Cultural Heritage, the main objectives include:  (i) To collaboratively develop a game design and computational thinking programme (CreativeCulture Lab) that will make game design and development accessible to teachers and students, promoting transcultural and transdisciplinary &apos;learning by designing&apos;: The programme will create a creative culture, where disciplinary and cultural barriers will be removed to allow learners and teachers to experiment on new techniques in problem solving. Open resources (online CreativeCulture hub) and workshops will be organised to support a community of game design thinkers. CreativeCulture ambassadors from the participants (teachers as coaches, students as designers, developers, managers, etc.) and the local facilitators (mentoring) will be created and trained to run the CreativeCulture Labs independently. Key deliverables: Adaptable/adoptable CreativeCulture Lab blueprint and toolkits to be developed and validated, ambassadors/champions from the pilot locations to be identified and trained and an online Hub that will host the CreativeCulture resources (tools, vase studies, game-based outcomes from the community) to be developed.  (ii) To design and implement participatory studies, involving the local, rural and indigenous communities in Malaysian Borneo (learners and teachers): The CreativeCulture Lab blueprint will be implemented in two stages. The first is to mock up a lab that will involve a small number of participants, which will inform the final pilot participatory study in the different sites in Sarawak, Malaysia involving larger number of stakeholders and participants. Key deliverables: CreativeCulture Lab to be carried out as an extra-curricular at the telecentres, feasibility studies carried out to inform the larger scale deployment in stage 2.  (iii) To facilitate, capture and evaluate experience, learning outcomes and transferability of the creative approach towards refining the adaptable CreativeCulture blueprints: The pilot will capture the experience and evaluate the transferability of knowledge and skills and experience gained by the participants. The project&apos;s research questions include: (i) How do learners and communities of remote rural locations in Malaysia perceive Games Design in learning? (ii) How effective is CreativeCulture in engaging learners of remote rural locations to creative thinking and problem solving? (iii) What is the acceptance level of CreativeCulture in enhancing cultural understanding and integration among learners of remote rural locations in Malaysia? Key deliverables will include: Analysis of lessons learnt and finalised CreativeCulture Lab blueprint(s) for adoption and adaptation.  The longer-term objective is to establish sustainable collaborations between the UK and Malaysian researchers."></capital-spend>
