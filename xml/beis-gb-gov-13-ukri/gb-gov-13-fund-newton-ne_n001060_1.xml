   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Plant domestication and the development of agriculture began shortly after 10,000 years ago in the Americas and several other primary centres around the world, and was one of humankind&apos;s most pivotal achievements. Recent advances in palaeobotany and molecular genetics have opened new avenues for understanding when, where, how, and why this crucial change first came about. For example, phylogenetic and phylogeographic studies of extant populations can often identify the wild ancestral population and thus the geographic cradle of origin for each domesticate, pointing the archaeologists to a limited area for survey and excavation. A growing body of genetic, biogeographical, and archaeobotanical data has now established Amazonia as one of the most important centres of plant domestication in the world. Recent genetic and biogeographic studies show that the transitional fringe of seasonal forests and savannahs in SW Amazonia, which encompass the upper Madeira River Basin, were probably the cradle of the domestication of several major American crops, including manioc (Manihot esculenta), peanuts (Arachis hypogaea), peach palm (Bactris gasipaes), coca (Erythroxylum coca), chilli peppers (Capsicum baccattum), annatto (Bixa orellana), and tobacco (Nicotina tabacco) (Clement et al. 2010; Piperno and Pearsall 1998). Despite being the most important centre of domestication in lowland South America, until now no interdisciplinary projects have documented the domestication of these important crops in their cradle of origin.  To address this issue, we proposed to organise two workshops and conduct preliminary research activities to plan, write and submit a 3-5 yr international interdisciplinary project integrating molecular genetics, plant biogeography, archaeology, archaeobotany and paleoecology. The main objectives of the project will be to: i) investigate the history of major Amazonian crops including manioc, peach palm, chilli peppers and annatto; ii) reconstruct the context of early agriculture; and iii) investigate the timing and nature of human impact on the environment in the upper Madeira River, SW Amazonia. These objectives build on two previously separate lines of research coordinated by Iriarte and Clement: paleoecology and archaebotany of landscape transformations of the Araucaria forests of southern Brazil (AHRC-Fapesp) and the Purus-Madeira interfluve (ERC), and the origin, dispersal and phylogeography of native Amazonian crops (Fapeam, Fapeam-AIRD, CNPq, Fapesp), respectively.  The project is well-timed to combine state-of-the-art techniques to address the complexity of plant domestication and the development of agriculture.  Research on crop origins are benefiting from the refinement of microfossil botanical techniques, in particular starch granules retrieved from the residues of stone tools used to process plants, which are allowing archaeobotanists to document root crops in tropical regions exhibiting poor preservation of macrobotanical remains (visible remains of seeds and fruits) (Piperno 2011). Palaeoecological techniques will help reconstruct the Late Pleistocene through Holocene vegetation history of the upper Madeira River and, in particular, the natural environment and plant associations in which the first crops were domesticated. Particular emphasis will be given to how and when humans began to alter their environments, using fire history to reconstruct the relation between natural- and human-caused processes. Genetic analysis can identify the wild populations from which the first selections were derived to start the domestication of our modern crops, as well as to trace dispersals out of these centres of domestication.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="Amazonia is a major centre of plant domestication, where manioc (Manihot esculenta), cocoa (Theobroma cacao), pineapple (Ananas comosus) and at least 50 other crops originated (Clement et al. 2010), yet little research about domestication has been done to date. Within Amazonia, the upper Madeira River basin, which includes parts of Brazil, Bolivia, Peru and Argentina, is of special interest because of the importance of crops domesticated there. In order to plan a large research grant integrating molecular genetics, archaeobotany, archaeology, and palaeoecology to study plant domestication in the upper Madeira River, the proposed pilot project will carry out the following activities which are crucial for the success of the grant, including: i) Organise a &apos;kick off&apos; workshop (Jan 2015) at the start of the project to coordinate the field and laboratory activities listed below. ii) Gather and synthesise all genetic, archaeological, linguistic, and palaeoecological data of crop domestication in this region and the Neotropics in general. iii) Create archaeobotanical (seeds, fruits, phytoliths, starch grains, pollen) reference collections, including the domesticated plants and their wild ancestors, from field collections and the INPA herbarium.  iv) Select archaeological sites in partnership with Brazilian archaeologists Eduardo Neves (USP) and Denise Schaan (UFPR) as well as Bolivian archaeologist Marcos Michel (Bolivian Cultural Heritage) to be targeted for preliminary testing and archaeobotanical analysis. Preliminary work is promising. For example, salvage archaeology along the Jamari River by Miller (1992) revealed a long sequence of human occupation dating back to the early Holocene (Preceramic Itapipoca phase 8230-6070 BP) and has documented what are currently the oldest Terra Pretas (anthropic black earth soils) in Amazonia dating to around 4800 BP (Preceramic Massangana phase 4780-2640 BP). These early archaeological contexts are also associated with a diversity of plant grinding tools and stone axes suggestive of an early and intensive use of plants. Recent research along the Guapor&#xE9; River both in Bolivia and Brazil has also revealed the presence of early Holocene shell-middens, which opens a new window to obtain archaeobotanical materials to document the domestication of crops.  v) Carry out pilot macrofossil (visible remains of seeds and fruits) and microfossil (phytoliths, starch grains, pollen) research on plant remains retrieved from the sediments, stone tools, and pottery from these selected sites. vi) Conduct preliminary palaeoecology surveys to identify appropriate-age lakes to core in order to obtain pollen and charcoal to reconstruct the vegetation and fire history of the region  vii) Carry out genetic analysis on a carefully identified new sample of wild relatives and locally available cultivated populations in the upper Madeira River and relate these with existing pan-Amazonian samples of manioc, annatto, peach palm and chilli pepper to allow confirmation of the region as a cradle of domestication and identify the routes of dispersal out of the region. viii) Create a GIS database that integrates information from all activities to help identify geographic patterns in the dataset. ix) Organise a second workshop (Dec 2015) at the end of the project to discuss preliminary results as well as devise and oversee their publication strategy. Write up a 3-5 year large NERC, ERC and-or Fapeam grant to carry on the activities initiated during this project. References Clement, C.R. et al. 2010. Diversity, 2(1): 72-106.  Piperno, D.R. 2011.
