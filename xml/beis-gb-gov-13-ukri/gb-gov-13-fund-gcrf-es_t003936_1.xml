   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Harnessing the power of global data to support young children&apos;s learning and development: Analyses, dissemination and implementation</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The 2017 Lancet Series, Advancing Early Childhood Development: From Science to Scale, estimated that 43% of children under 5 years in LMICs (250m children), were at risk of not reaching their potential because they had stunted linear growth or lived in extreme poverty. The proportion of children at risk increases appreciably when additional risk factors are considered, especially low maternal schooling and child maltreatment. Living in poor and unstimulating conditions affects young children&apos;s learning and development. Children exposed to poverty and adversity explore and learn less than children not exposed to these stresses; they learn less at school and achieve fewer school grades; earn less as adults; have more social problems, and poorer physical and mental health. We will study barriers and accelerators to learning in LMIC ECE programmes, at home and in communities, as well as associations between early learning and indicators of child development and  school performance. We will estimate their longer-term effects on education and earnings in adulthood. We will use descriptive and statistical analyses of secondary data collected through representative country surveys and research studies. As an established group of multi-disciplinary and multi-country experts and collaborators, we build on prior success in sourcing and analysing data from 91 LMICs by including early education and expanding to 137 countries. Global data, presented along the continuum of the early years, breaks down the false dichotomy between ECD and ECE, between care and education, and between learning at home and in formal programmes, and supports multi-sectoral actions along different stages of the life-course. We will expand our global analyses of threats to ECD by examining gender, location and wealth, services and family supports for young children, and policies that create facilitating environments for families and children. We will, for the first time, link indicators of the structural quality of ECE (eg teacher-child ratios) to contexts and child outcomes in LMICs. Process quality (eg teacher- and caregiver-child interactions), on which there is as yet no global data, will be studied through case studies in 5 countries, one in each of five regions of the world. We will source data on government, development assistance and household expenditures on pre-primary education; extract further country micro-data on contexts in which young children develop and learn; update nationally representative data on young children, services and policies to the most recent survey dates available, and develop new composite indicators of barriers and accelerators of young children&apos;s learning and development. Through partnerships with regional networks of ECD-ECE government and stakeholder teams, the project will help to build research capacity in ECD-ECE, and increase the use of data for decision-making, action and monitoring in 20 countries. We will use the results to provide evidence-based support to engage international human rights law, especially the right to education and the rights of the child, in advancing progress towards achieving the SDG goals of universal access by 2030. This research will address the gap in the evidence base for a unified approach to ECD and ECE. The findings will support the development of the right to education by providing a holistic approach to guide early development and educational interventions. It will demonstrate the strength of interdisciplinary work in cross-fertilizing data analysis and legal research in building strong foundations for translation into policy and regulatory change. Given the evidence on the critical roles of ECD-ECE on learning and wellbeing in the short, medium and longer term, the project has important implications for development and welfare in countries on the DAC list. This large-scale global approach iscritical to support and guide policy and investments.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">We will study barriers and accelerators to access of Early Childhood Education (ECE) and learning opportunities in formal (centre and programme) and informal (home and community) settings in LMICs for children before school entry. We will assemble available global data on young children, and examine the consequences of these factors for early childhood development and learning, as well as school performance. We will also estimate their longer-term effects on adult education and earnings. This large-scale global approach is critical to guide and support policy and investments. Specifically, we aim to: 1. Contribute to improved early learning and development of young children in 137 low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), through an unprecedented effort to assemble, analyse and disseminate data needed for policy, action and monitoring. We aim to contribute to progress worldwide on SDG 4.2, and help to advance the next generation indicators of global development goals. 2. Reinforce continuities between ECD and ECE from birth to primary school, breaking down the artificial distinction between care and education in this age group, and the importance of policies, programmes and interventions that begin early and persist through children&apos;s pre-primary years. 3. Identify and analyse country-comparable, conceptually-driven data on children&apos;s learning and development from birth to primary school from, among others, Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS), Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS), representative country surveys, and information collated by UNESCO&apos;s Institute for Statistics (UIS). The project will be undertaken by researchers with extensive expertise and experience in such analyses, working in teams, with support from global and regional organizations to facilitate partnerships and implementation. 4. Given the paucity of global data on ECE, we will analyse case studies in one LMIC in each of the major regions of the world. These case studies will examine diversity, quality and equity across ECE programmes. 5. Use the Nurturing Care Framework, articulated in the 2017 Lancet Series, to derive indices and organize available data in ways that are understandable to users and stakeholders, including the contexts in which young children learn and develop; risks to early learning; policies and services to support learning; financial outlays by governments, families and overseas development assistance; and how early learning affects schooling, adult income and, ultimately, countries&apos; economies. 6. Disaggregate data by age group in the pre-primary years, gender, country income, rural-urban location, household wealth, policy environment and financial investments to demonstrate gaps and inequities between and within countries. 7. Work with governments and regional organizations through UNICEF, WHO, UNESCO, the World Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank, the ECD Action Network, regional networks and other relevant agencies, to understand how best to represent, communicate and support the use of data to promote young children&apos;s learning and development. We will concentrate implementation efforts on 20 countries selected for their context and willingness to engage. 8. Elicit input and feedback from stakeholders through interactive partnerships and global, regional and country consultations to illustrate how data can be used to understand common and unique country challenges, drive policy change, programme adjustments and coordination, and to develop new interventions to improve young children&apos;s learning and development. 9. Develop evidence-based support for engaging international human rights law, particularly the right to education and the rights of the child, in advancing progress towards achieving the SDG goal of universal coverage by 2030. 10. Identify data gaps, including on quality of home, community and centre-based supports for children&apos;s learning and education, and make recommendations on how these gaps can be address</narrative>
