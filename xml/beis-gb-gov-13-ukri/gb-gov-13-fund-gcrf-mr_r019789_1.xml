   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Our research aims to improve survival, growth and development in babies with low birthweight (weighing less than 2500g)
in low-resource countries.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Worldwide, deaths in the first month of life already account for nearly half of all child deaths. This proportion is set to rise as survival in older children is improving faster than in newborns. More than 9 in 10 newborn deaths occur in Africa and Asia and more than 8 in 10 of these deaths are in babies with low birthweight. The greatest risk is in very small babies (birthweight less than 1500g) where as many as 700 of every 1000 die. Small babies who survive often have poor longer-term growth and development posing highly significant consequences for families and societies.  Being small at birth is due mainly to being born too early (preterm), not growing well in the womb or a combination of both. Unfortunately, we do not have effective interventions to prevent either of these problems. Therefore, these small babies are a growing challenge especially in poorer countries.  We know that nutrition and growth in early life are critically important for the development of the body organs, including the brain, and being able to fight-off the infections that cause many newborn deaths. Improved nutrition and optimal growth may also prevent diseases that are important in later life in poorer countries such as lung disease. However, achieving optimal nutrition in small babies remains a huge challenge especially as high quality, safe feeding through the veins, that bridges the gap between birth and full oral feeding, is rarely available in low-resource countries. In addition, the structure and function of the gut in preterm babies is immature  and advancing oral feeds too quickly may cause life-threatening gut damage. The immature gut not only struggles to cope with milk feeds but also allows gut bacteria to cross into the body and cause infection. Small babies often need nursing in neonatal units (NNUs) for 4-6 weeks or more and this is exactly where their gut can be colonized with dangerous bacteria that are resistant to the available antibiotics.   There has been little research to tell us how best to feed small babies in NNUs in poorer countries. Even basic principles such as when to introduce feeds and how quickly feeds can be increased safely remain unclear. In addition, there are several promising interventions being developed in richer countries that may well be relevant, feasible and affordable in low-resource settings. These include using nutritional supplements of probiotics (safe, &quot;healthy&quot; bacteria) and components in breast milk (&quot;lactoferrin&quot;) to prevent gut infections and boost the baby&apos;s immunity.  We will establish a core network of 6 NNUs (4 Nigeria/2 Kenya) linking African clinicians and researchers together and with international experts in newborn nutrition, gut health and longer-term lung and brain development. The network will build capacity in those NNUs with limited previous research experience and also engage researchers who are new to working in poorer countries.   Workshops in Nigeria and Kenya will allow the team to document current practices, share experience of practical feeding problems and review possible interventions for testing. Standard international criteria for the diagnosis of common problems (such as infection) will be adapted for use across the network and we will set-up a database to share essential clinical information. We will test novel methods to detect genes that make bacteria resistant to antibiotics and to measure key nutrients in small volume blood samples. We will also store samples for later research. We will ensure that we develop processes that are achievable even with low-resources so that they can be rolled-out to other NNUs to expand the network.   Our goal is to improve survival, growth and development in low birthweight babies through better nutrition. The network and processes that we will establish will enable us to design and implement the large-scale clinical trials that will be needed to advance care in these most vulnerable infants.</narrative>
