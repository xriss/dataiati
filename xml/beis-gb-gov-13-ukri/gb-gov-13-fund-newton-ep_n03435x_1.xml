   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Vision - In Shaking Tunnel Vision we want to develop novel disaster management strategies for tunnels under repeated seismic loading through innovative monitoring and analysis of a new World Class Case Study.  Summary Tunnels are one of cities&apos; and nations&apos; critical lifelines in the modern World, transporting people, water, electricity, minerals and energy. They are an essential part of the infrastructure that serves people and therefore, are critical to their wealth and well-being. The impacts of global urbanisation and Climate Change are forcing nations to look towards underground space for their future infrastructure. Internationally, tunnel construction is increasing and Chile is no exception. Multiple tunnelling projects are in the country&apos;s pipeline or being currently designed and / or built (e.g. the Andean tunnel to connect Argentina and Chile, multiple underground mine tunnels, like the 1,000 km projected in the Chuquicamata mine and Hydraulic power plants, to name but a few). Their behaviour under repeated seismic loading is not precisely understood and therefore, current designs and disaster risk management strategies could be greatly improved. This is, partly, due to the lack of performance data from real tunnels. Accidents are rare but they do occur, and when they do, have significant consequences (e.g. the Pedro Galleguillos tunnel in Tocopilla, 2007).  The purpose of this project is to design and install a monitoring system in ttwo tunnels (La Polvora, Valparaiso, and Metro Santiago) with the intention of: (1) fundamentally (re-)defining our understanding of the behaviour of tunnels under repeated seismic loading; (2) developing an engineering-risk-based disaster management  approach for tunnels in seismic areas; (3) creating a case study that will become an internationally recognised reference and will be used widely  in years to come for the validation of future improved numerical and analytical design approaches.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="The Aim of the project is to develop a disaster management engineering-risk-based assessment of tunnels under repeated seismic loading for the benefit of tunnel operators and society more widely as end-users. In order to achieve the above aim we have developed five objectives that are novel and internationally relevant in their own merit: 1) Develop and test a novel long term and remotely operated monitoring system for the seismic monitoring of tunnels. 2) Understand tunnel behaviour under repeated seismic loading in the transversal and longitudinal directions. 3) Develop the most appropriate combination of numerical and / or analytical techniques for the quantification of repeated seismic loading in tunnels. 4) Develop a disaster management engineering-risk-based assessment of the behaviour of tunnels under repeated seismic loading based on results. 5) Create an internationally relevant case study for further research into the long term behaviour of tunnels under seismic loading."></capital-spend>
