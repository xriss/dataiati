   <narrative xml:lang="EN">There is an urgent need for new research to inform the design response to overlapping refugee crises and the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic in countries across Sub Saharan Africa, including Burkina Faso. Burkina Faso is currently experiencing an unexpected escalation of conflicts, human rights abuses, threats to human security and peace building, coupled with unanticipated large scale forced population displacement, and an unprecedented public health emergency. Global disruption to supply chains for electrical and electronic technologies and components as a result of restrictions to transportation and shipping is restricting the distribution of essential humanitarian energy technologies. Against this backdrop the repair and repurposing of old technologies and systems, as well as the continued maintenance of existing humanitarian technologies is an urgent and essential humanitarian task; one that requires the mobilisation of locally situated repair cultures (skills, knowledge and practices) as well as the local sourcing of spare parts and components. In partnership with the UNHCR&apos;s Innovation Service and Chatham House this research project sets out to address a significant knowledge gap about the extent, significance and potential role of repair in meeting people&apos;s basic needs.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="The project aims to ensure the continued provision and access to basic energy needs for refugees/displaced people in Burkina Faso and across Sub Saharan Africa by:   1) Collecting new data on the local design, repair and repurposing of humanitarian technologies in the context of Covid-19.  2) Building the evidence base for incorporating &apos;cultures of repair&apos;, and &apos;design for repairability and repurposing in policy and programmatic responses by international agencies and organisation in Burkina Faso and beyond. 3) Exhibiting exemplars of repair and repurposing in humanitarian design through a digital archive, including found designs and photographs sourced from humanitarian practitioners, and professional design concepts produced specifically for the project.  4) Amplifying research findings through the UNHCR and the Chatham House led Moving Energy Initiative to partners across the international humanitarian and development sector 5) Changing international development policy and practice, by adding a focus on repair to design innovations in off grid humanitarian technology; to UNHCR skills and training programmes, as well as procurement protocols; and by adding humanitarian contexts to policy interventions that support Africa&apos;s circular economy. 6) Establishing &apos;repair&apos; as a critical theme in academic approaches to design, innovation and technology in humanitarian and resource poor contexts."></capital-spend>
