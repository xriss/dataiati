  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This proposal is to support research activities that will directly develop the shortlisted award Edu-Peace: Supporting Educators in Conflict-affected Settings. Specific objectives include: Collaboration across all partners to develop the conceptual anchoring of the project: Edu-peace, in response to panel feedback; LMIC capacity development, specifically around the theoretical and methodological underpinnings of co-produced research methods; The co-drafting of a public engagement strategy (for use by community activists, development practitioners and academics interested in research in the different contexts); A shared conceptualisation of Edu-Peace (point 1) and co-produced research (point 2), and by extension a research agenda; Agreement on a collaborative process across all partners of literature review and engagement with existing data, research and documentation; The identification of wider potential academic and non-academic partners, negotiating access and developing mechanisms of inclusion and participation in the different regions; The identification of context specific pathways to impact and channels of dissemination within each region through consultation with policy-makers and other actors, in response to panel feedback regarding the project&apos;s dissemination processes; Support and engagement of all partners in every aspect of the above in synergy with the co-productive ethic of the proposed project. This will lay a foundation of co-productive methodologies and ethics for future working, including information-sharing procedures and the development of methods for working across languages.   These objectives will be targeted through a series of 2 workshops with partners from across all of the institutions and contexts represented in the larger bid. In keeping with the ethos of the project and the call these meetings will be held in LMICs reflecting the geographical reach of the proposed shortlisted award: Kenya and Bangladesh. This will also help to ensure the core advisory group is balanced towards LMICs. Additional activity between meetings in developing outputs and planning for the next meeting will be managed on-line through shared drives and Skype to facilitate inclusion of all parties. These specific objectives and activities will provide insights to develop a rigorous co-designed proposal. As detailed in the call the activities directly responds to specific reviewer feedback and will enable: the development of clearer theoretical work on Edu-Peace; greater detail on dissemination; the strengthening of partnerships and a rebalancing towards LMIC; clearer mechanisms of co-production; clarity on costings and logistics. In addition it responds to the call&apos;s emphasis on the network plus approach by enabling: parity of engagement with non-academic partners; co-production of research agendas; capacity building in LMICs; the identification of locally embedded theories of change and dissemination strategies. Furthermore, in addition to the proposal development these activities support outcomes in their own right. The capacity building in LMIC and established networks between partners developed through these activities will outlive the proposed timetable here and contribute to a longer-term legacy. The public engagement strategy will also extend impact as a guide and tool to facilitate the connection and production of academic-practitioner co-constructed research, whether-or-not the full award is successful. Meeting these objectives are necessary for the further development of the shortlisted proposal and for the authentic persistence of its co-production ethos. The activities that will facilitate these provide for the mutual and reciprocal relations between academics and communities necessary for genuinely co-produced research and the time needed to build these (Castleden et al 2012; Koster et al 2012; Brown and Gaventa 2008).</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This proposed award will support the development of the Edu-Peace Network (that will form the basis of our larger bid) through bringing academic and non-academic research partners from across the country contexts together in a series of workshops to strengthen and further develop our shared understandings and priorities for the network, to co-construct our contextualised research methodologies and to define the scope of our proposed activities. Through these dialogues, as a project team and with broader partners and advisors, we lay the foundations both for a coherent and cohesive research Network and for future collaborations.   The proposed global Network for Edu-Peace is grounded in the assumption that educators in settings affected by conflict and crisis are already, to varying extents, working towards peace.  The network aims to have a positive impact on the welfare of children and young people in settings affected by conflict and crisis through a focus on their education, and in particular through a focus on peace-building.   Central to the Network is peer-to-peer learning and collaboration with academic, government, NGO and community partners through the identification of case studies in three regions affected by conflict: South-South East Asia (Bangladesh &amp; Myanmar); the Horn of Africa (Somaliland &amp; South Sudan); and the Middle East (Lebanon). Building on existing research, and connections with partners in these regions we aim to: deepen understandings of key challenges in emergency contexts; identify innovative and successful education and peacebuilding practice, particularly through case-studies of non-traditional education programmes or projects; highlight and develop conflict-sensitive and gender-sensitive provision; facilitate peer-to-peer learning and knowledge exchange; generate capacity and new pathways to locally-responsive impact; generate new interdisciplinary knowledge that will advance the fields of Education, Law, Politics, Gender Studies and History.   The locations for our joint meetings have been chosen to maximise opportunities for co-production of the research agenda and methodologies and to allow for further stakeholder and community engagement which will strengthen the local relevance of the Network and support South-South collaboration and learning. This also provides us with an opportunity to test the ease of travel, including visa applications, for team members in order to develop a sound plan for future collaboration and Network activities. Three main workshops are planned in: Nairobi, Kenya - hosted by the Kenya office of Rift Valley Institute: Dhaka, Bangladesh - hosted by the Liberation War Museum;  Cambridge, UK - hosted by the Faculty of Education, University of Cambridge;  The third smaller meeting is planned to take advantage of visits to the UK by the LMIC CIs and partners for the Network Plus grant interview in December. Additionally, Network advisor and potential project partner, Dr Maha Shuayb, Director of the Centre for Lebanese Studies at the Lebanese American University will be in Cambridge as a Visiting Scholar during this period, so a small meeting provides the opportunity for partners from South Sudan and Bangladesh to consolidate research connections with further Lebanese collaborators.</narrative>
