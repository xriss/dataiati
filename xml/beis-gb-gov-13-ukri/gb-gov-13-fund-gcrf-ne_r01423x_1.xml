  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Humanitarian agencies are able to use weather (and other) forecasts to act in anticipation of humanitarian crises.  For example, when a heatwave or hurricane is forecast, supplies can be moved into position early and emergency supplies positioned or pre-distributed.  This reduces the overall impact and the cost of responding to the disaster.  However, financing in advance of a disaster requires a high level of confidence in the forecast, to avoid the possibility of misallocated or wasted resources.  Many forecasts are currently available but not all are accompanied by an assessment of the forecast quality.  For example, it may be that the forecast is over-confident, predicting an event more times than it is actually observed, or it could be under confident, failing to predict events which do then occur. We propose to develop and demonstrate a general method of measuring and displaying the information content of forecasts, using a novel idea which is based on existing research and freely available data.  This will allow humanitarian agencies to act confidently in anticipation of humanitarian crises when there is sufficient information in the forecast, and to implement forecast-based financing schemes such as insurance or anticipatory funding allocation only when there is known to be confidence that the scheme will be effective.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The main objectives of the proposed research are as follows: 1. Working with stakeholder colleagues, to improve the decision-making processes of the Start Fund (and other anticipatory humanitarian disaster risk financing schemes) by co-developing a system to analyse and display forecast skill, along with the forecast itself; 2. Working with stakeholder colleagues, to produce a detailed account of how analysis of forecast skill can benefit decision-making in four case studies for different natural hazards in developing countries; 3.  With respect to a case study of drought in southern Africa, to describe the impact that imperfect model skill may have on the practical implementation of disaster financing schemes such as the Africa Risk Capacity, Start&apos;s own Drought Financing Facility, and the World Food Programme&apos;s FOODSECURE scheme, and for this to contribute useful information to the decision of the Government of Botswana whether to join any such scheme. 4.  To hold a one-day meeting in London for insurance stakeholders to discuss progress in forecast-based insurance schemes, and the degree to which these are constrained by the skill or quality of model-based forecasts. 5.  To feed back to forecast providers (e.g. national met services) suggestions of how to improve the relevance and practical use of operational forecasts for the humanitarian sector. 6.  To write and submit a journal article describing the above research and the impact on humanitarian decision-making processes.</narrative>
