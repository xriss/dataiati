   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Ethiopia is an African country ranked 104/119 in the most recent Global Hunger Index, with 28.8% of the population undernourished from 2014-16. The annual costs of malnutrition have been estimated at $4.7 billion, equivalent to 16.5% of Ethiopia&apos;s economy, with significant long-term socio-economic consequences. Whilst Ethiopia has historically been the world&apos;s largest recipient of targeted food aid, little food-insecurity has been reported for the southern Ethiopian highlands even during the devastating famines of the 1980s.   Agriculture in Southern Ethiopian highlands is dominated by enset, the regional starch staple. which possesses unique attributes that enhance the food security of the communities that grow it. However due to isolated and remote nature of the region, and the perception that enset is &apos;poor persons food&apos; research on enset has historically been neglected in favour of cereals. Enset is an unusual crop/plant, closely related to banana - the world&apos;s most important fruit. However enset differs in that the mature plant does not produce edible fruit (as these are filled with numerous large and hard seeds). Instead the plant is grown for 3-12 years, before the petioles, pseudostem and corm are harvested and collectively processed into starchy food products. Enset serves as a staple food for about 20% of the Ethiopian population, over 20 million people, mainly in the south and south-west of the country. Under appropriate conditions it is estimated that 60 mature plants can provide enough food for a family of five to six people.  Our network of UK and Ethiopian Universities and agricultural organisations have been studying the genetic diversity and distribution of enset in Ethiopia. Our aim has been to identify and characterise enset varieties with useful traits, such as enhanced pest or drought tolerance, as well as better understanding its environmental requirements and reproductive biology.   Here, we propose a series of impact development activies - together with our Ethiopian partners - to help translate and embed our research findings into practical outcomes and applications for rural farmers. We have three main themes:  1. To support progression of the Enset Center of Excellence, a regional enset research initiative. We will do this primarily through interchange of project staff, encouraging the development of new skills, new perspectives, and fostering new collaborations. Our key goal is to encourage traditionally distinct and relatively isolated partner organisations to work more closely together for the benefit of Ethiopia.  2. Developmen of a basic mobile app to advise farmers on optimum local genotypes, disease identification and best agronomic practice. From our experience, this is the best way of rapidly delivering location specific, accurate and practical advice directly to farmers. We will use smart phone location capabilities to consult a pre-loaded mode of enset performance to recommend optimum landraces to farmers. We will also translate the disease diagnostic ID sheets we have developed to be mobile friendly, and available in the five most spoken languages, to help farmers identify enset pests and pathogens.  3. To install and develop three local enset nurseries, to grow and distribute selected enset landraces. Based on the findings of our existing research, we will select 10 genotypes that perform well (high yield, disease tolerant) across a range of agroecological conditions. Rapid clonal propagation of these genotypes using local ethnobotanic knowledge, will enable multiplication of plantlets to generate thousands of individuals that can be sold to farmers (for a small standard market price) to support the long-term sustainability of the nursery.  As the second most populous African country, the population of Ethiopia predicted to reach 172 million by 2050. Thus we believe there is an urgent need to develop underutilised crop plants, to rise to this food security challenge.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This proposal builds on a successful two-year collaboration between our UK-Ethiopian network of Universities, research institutes, agricultural organisations and regional government to develop and enhance enset agriculture in Ethiopia and support the rural livelihoods which depend on this unique starch staple. Our research to date has shown that around 20 million rural Ethiopians depend on Enset, demonstrating the scale and breadth of impact that improved enset agriculture will have in one of the poorest and most food insecure ODA countries. We propose the following objectives to deliver enhanced impact in Ethiopia:  1. To support progression of the Enset Center of Excellence, lead by the Southern Nations Nationalities and Peoples Region Government, with bi-directional interchange of project staff.  This will seek to: a. Develop new skills, including an enhanced understanding of UK research outputs on enset in Ethiopia. b. Embed new perspectives in interchanging individuals by working within different environments. c. Enhance current and future collaborations by working with enset researchers from other organisations i.e. Agriculture Bureau, local government, universities.  2. To integrate data arising from our existing Enset GCRF project into a basic mobile app to advise farmers on optimum local genotypes, disease identification and best agronomic practice. a. This will use smart phone location capabilities to consult a preloaded model of enset genotype performance, and disease resistance to suggest optimum high performing genotypes (including their local vernacular names, and identifying features) for that locality. b. We will translate the disease diagnostic ID sheets we have developed to be mobile friendly, and available in the five most spoken languages, to help farmers identify enset pests and pathogens. Crucially, this will enable them to take appropriate action, as well as facilitating local agricultural extension agents in identifying trends or newly emerging pests and pathogens. c. Finally, this application provides an ideal tool to deliver more widely, best agricultural practice for enset cultivation - much of which is currently distributed via word of mouth with significant heterogeneity in impact.  3. To install and develop three local enset nurseries, using existing infrastructure, to enhance availability of optimum genotypes. a. Based on the findings of our existing research, we will select 10 genotypes that perform well (high yield, disease tolerant) across a range of agroecological conditions. Rapid clonal propagation of these genotypes using local ethnobotanic knowledge, will enable multiplication of plantlets to generate thousands of individuals that can be sold to farmers (for a small standard market price) to support the long-term sustainability of the nursery. b. The distribution of identical genotypes in the local area will provide an ideal system in which to subsequently monitor and evaluate the success and yield outcomes of this intervention.</narrative>
