  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Overview The overall goal of this interdisciplinary project &quot;Cross-Cultural Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning for Student Capacity Building in Multifaceted Competences through Astronomy Online Labs&quot; (C3AOL) is to support capacity building of young adults for their Big Data analysis skills and key 21st century competences - communication, collaboration, creativity, and critical thinking - through their participation in cross-cultural computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL) activities enabled by technologically and pedagogically sound online laboratories in Astronomy.  The goal will be achieved through three phases of scientific activities involving different stakeholders from the UK and Malaysia, including Astronomy experts, technology-enhanced learning (TEL) experts, university students, academic staff, school teachers and pupils, and science centre staff.    As a multifaceted discipline addressing science, technology and culture - the three core areas whose maturity and richness defining the development status of a nation - Astronomy is a unique and powerful means to engage and inspire people of all ages, who are fascinated by the infinity of the Universe and stark visual appeal of celestial events.  For learners at their late teen identifying a pathway to their future careers in STEM, exploring Astronomy is of particular relevance as they can be equipped with new competences:  - a good understanding of advanced developments in electronics, optics and IT;  - knowledge and skills in applying sound scientific methods for Big Data handling and analysis;  - ability to collaborate with international teams and to communicate complex results in accessible ways to general audience, especially school children As the main outcome of this project, the participating students will acquire these competences, which are not only deployable in Astronomy, but, more important, also transferable to different disciplines such as other STEM, management, finance and economics, contributing to growth and prosperity of their country.   Four objectives of the project C3AOL are as follows: 1. To enable Astronomy experts from both countries to exchange knowledge and practical experience in Big Data analysis and technology development, identifying specific foci for research collaboration and, in collaboration with TEL experts, enhancing approaches to educating students in STEM; 2. To inspire and enthuse students, through interacting with Astronomy experts and selected Astronomy Online Labs (AOL), to gain a deep understanding of knowledge and skills for handling Big Data; 3. To enhance students&apos; transferable competences in communicating and collaborating with peers in local and cross-cultural contexts; 4. To support students to create new quality AOLs and disseminate them through outreach activities, consolidating their knowledge, creativity, and identity of STEM ambassadors;  Overall, the mission of the project is to promote national research and teaching programmes in Astronomy in Malaysia.  Currently, there are only a handful of universities in Malaysia offering astronomy courses. This project aims to stimulate the growth of astronomy degree programmes in Malaysia through our research visits in different academic institutions in Malaysia, sharing the related practical experiences in running astronomy and other STEM degree programmes in the UK.  Indeed, the UK in general and Leicester in particular has internationally recognised leading expertise in Astronomy in areas such as Big Data handling and analysis, as exemplified by the established Space Research Centre and newly launched Leicester Institute of Space and Earth Observation. The UK has demonstrated the successful use of Astronomy in STEM education programmes from primary to tertiary level. The transfer of Astronomy knowledge and skills from the UK to Malaysia via this project will have strong impact on enabling young adults to create a high-technology economy.</narrative>

As a multifaceted discipline addressing science, technology and culture - the three core areas whose maturity and richness defining the development status of a nation - Astronomy is a unique and powerful means to engage and inspire people of all ages, who are fascinated by the infinity of the Universe and stark visual appeal of celestial events.  For young learners at their late teen identifying a pathway to their future careers in STEM, exploring Astronomy is of particular relevance as they can be equipped with multidimensional competences:  - a good understanding of advanced developments in electronics, optics and IT;  - knowledge and skills in applying sound scientific methods for Big Data handling and analysis;  - ability to collaborate with international teams and to communicate complex results in accessible ways to general audience These competences are not only deployable in Astronomy, but, more important, also transferable to different disciplines such as other STEM subjects, informatics, business management, finance and economics.    Four objectives are:  1. To enable Astronomy experts from both countries to exchange knowledge and experience in Big Data and technology development, identifying specific focus for future research collaboration, and developing in collaboration with TEL experts and Astronomy educators, stronger approaches to educating students; 2. To inspire and enthuse students, through interacting with Astronomy experts and selected Astronomy Online Labs (AOL), to gain a deep understanding of knowledge and skills for handling Big Data analysis; 3. To enhance students&apos; transferable competences in communicating and collaborating with peers in local and cross-cultural contexts; 4. To support students to create new quality AOL and disseminate them in outreach venues, thereby consolidating knowledge, fostering creativity, and assuming the role of STEM ambassadors;  Four methodological approaches are:   *Dialogical inquiry:  Expert-student interactions involve a mix of authoritative talks and dialogic discourses with the former being more appropriate for experts to introduce new ideas to students and the latter being more suitable for students to share and discuss their views with experts.   *Participatory design: The basic principle of participatory design (PD) is to enable users to voice their needs, which are taken into account when designing a system/service .  Scientific activities of C3AOL will be co-designed with all stakeholders, especially students, through ongoing communications to identify viable means to address different preferences and constraints. This will strengthen student engagement. *Collaborative work: The positive effect of social interactions in enhancing learning, be it face-to-face or online, is firmly grounded in theoretical frameworks and empirical studies .  Experts from STEM, Technology-enhanced Learning (TEL), Human-computer Interaction (HCI), language and cultural studies will collaboratively design CSCL activities together with students. *Multidimensional experience: Through the project&apos;s activities, students will be exposed to new social (cross-cultural interactions), intellectual (astrophysics concepts), and technological (Astronomy online labs) challenges. Students will gain learning experiences at cognitive and emotional level.</narrative>
