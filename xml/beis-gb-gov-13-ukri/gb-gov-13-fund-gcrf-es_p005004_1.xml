   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Architectures of Displacement: The Experiences and Consequences of Emergency Shelter</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Architectures of Displacement has four cumulative aims, each relating to a different project strand: 1. Typology. To record and categorise the different types of emergency accommodation in situations of forced migration 2. Portraits. To produce ten detailed case studies or &apos;portraits&apos; of emergency shelter 3. Implications. To assess and analyse the social, political and legal implications of emergency shelters 4. Policy. To inform the design of successful policies on shelter and displacement by humanitarian agencies To achieve these aims, the project will engage in multi-sited research to examine the full range of emergency accommodation generated by the Syrian refugee crisis. Fieldwork will take place six countries: Jordan, Lebanon, Greece, Italy, Germany and France. In each of these locations the project will address the following objectives, each relating to a different project aim: 1. Typology. The project team will interview humanitarian practitioners to locate a creative and diverse range of emergency shelters across all six fieldwork sites. The team will visit these locations and document (through drawn, still photographic, film and written records) how these emergency shelters are constructed, designed, adapted and maintained. The team will keep a record of all plans for new emergency shelters as proposed by architects and international organisations.   2. Portraits. The team will identify ten examples of emergency shelter for in-depth qualitative study. The team will document the architecture and design of these spaces through photographs, architectural drawings, material culture and film, examining the lived experience of the inhabitants through participant observation, semi-structured interviews, and participatory workshops with refugees. In each case, the material culture and history of each of these spaces will be documented through archaeological methods of photography, drawing, collecting, desk-based research, and written field records. 3. Implications. The team will organise two academic seminars in partnership with legal scholars, architects and humanitarian practitioners. These workshops will consider the advantages, disadvantages, effects and longer-term implications of different shelter forms. The team will review the literature on encampment, architecture, and forced migration to draw comparisons between the fieldwork locations and similar environments elsewhere. In the context of this review process, the workshops will employ a unique cross-disciplinary collaboration, studying the social implications of shelter. 4. Policy. Throughout the research, the project will embed collaboration with aid agencies, such as CARE International, M&#xE9;decins Sans Fronti&#xE8;res, Oxfam, and UNHCR. These agencies will be engaged through the project steering committee and a programme of events at the Refugee Studies Centre. They will assist in developing the research and participate in seven practitioner workshops discussing research findings and drawing out lessons for humanitarian practice. These activities for each of the four project themes outlined above will lead to the following project outcomes: 1. Typology. The project will develop and publish a Typology of Temporary Shelter and an &apos;Inventory of Possibilities&apos; on the project website.  2. Portraits. The team will curate a public exhibition at the Pitt Rivers Museum, produce a feature-length documentary film, and publish a monograph containing the ten accommodation &apos;portraits&apos;  3. Implications. The team will publish four scholarly journal articles addressing the social, political and legal implications of different emergency shelters 4. Policy. The team will produce seven short workshop reports and publish two policy briefings through RSC channels. They will speak to migration practitioners at public events such as the humanitarian Shelter Forum and the Humanitarian Policy Group of the Overseas Development Institute.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The experience of forced displacement is profoundly shaped by where people find shelter. The most urgent concern for migrants is how to find safe and stable spaces in which to live, rest and sleep, both during their journey and when they arrive at their destination. Tents and camps dominate media images of forced displacement, but forced migrants find shelter in many other ways. They may make use of abandoned buildings, stay on the floors of friends and relatives, find rest in self-built shelters, or sleep under trees in the natural environment. Some may find themselves placed in reception centres and immigration detention facilities against their will. Others may be housed in specially created spaces, such as &apos;villages&apos; made from shipping containers or IKEA-designed prefabricated shelters. Still others may find accommodation through private rentals, supported by cash transfers from aid agencies or forms of welfare from governmental bodies. These types of emergency shelter form a vital infrastructure that result from human improvisation and contingency as much as design or planning. At present this infrastructure is very poorly understood.  Architectures of Displacement begins with the observation that material forms of shelter offer unique insights into migration and refugees. By developing a new interdisciplinary approach to the physical dimension of the refugee experience, this research will provide unique perspectives upon the processes of human adaptation to new circumstances through displacement. The project will explore the impact of different shelter on the fate of refugees, as well as the political and legal consequences of forced migration and its entanglement with the exigencies of shelter. Given the scale of global displacement and the number of people living in &apos;non-traditional&apos; spaces in large urban areas, there is a particularly urgent need to understand the variety of forms that shelter takes and the experiences and consequences of living in its various forms.  The project draws together three disciplines with distinct but complementary approaches to the study of material forms: Anthropology, Architecture and Archaeology. It will develop a new approach to recording and understanding the variety of temporary architectural forms and material ephemera that are so central to the experience of forced migration. It will document and categorise, for the first time, the diversity and consequences of emergency shelter. And by focusing on the connections between material environments and human experiences, the data gathered by the project will assist policymakers in making informed choices about how to manage the arrival of refugees.  The cross-disciplinary approach of this project builds on three main bodies of research and practice.  1) Architecture brings a focus on the significance of the built environment for human life. It provides a way to consider how forms of shelter are constructed and used, a method for categorising different forms of shelter, and a technique for examining how spaces function.  2) Archaeology brings an awareness of time, duration, and loss to the study. It enables the project to explore the connections between abandonment and shelter, the material circumstances of the repurposing of existing structures, the ephemeral interventions and adaptations made in the natural environment in order to shelter in it, and the traces left by refugees through sheltering practices.  3) Anthropology offers a technique for studying how people react to displacement. It enables the project to study everyday life in different forms of accommodation, exploring how beneficiary populations understand, alter, reimagine, and accept or resist the shelters they are provided with; examining the processes, motivations and practicalities through which they find places to shelter for themselves; and exploring the ways inwhich sheltering practices lead to adaptations in social life.</narrative>
