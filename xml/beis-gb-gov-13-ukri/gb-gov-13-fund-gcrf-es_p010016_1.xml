   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Navigating Bangladesh&apos;s political settlement: microfinance, civil society and possibilities for development</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Bangladesh has been lauded internationally as a development success story: a county with strong economic growth, a source of innovation copied the world around, and human development figures that put its neighbour India to shame. This reputation is all the more significant given that only a few decades ago it was seen as the world&apos;s basket case, known for shocking poverty, famines and floods. One major source of this success is seen as the country&apos;s vibrant civil society, dominated by large NGOs. Among these NGOs (and banks), much work is focused around a development activity that did not even exist fifty years ago: microfinance. Indeed, the greatest development success stories to come from Bangladesh - and one of the main catalysts for Bangladesh&apos;s new international image - is the microfinance revolution, spearheaded by Muhammad Yunus, who later won a Noble Peace Prize along with the Grameen Bank. The microfinance industry makes a simple claim: tiny loans to rural women can enable them to start small businesses through which they can move themselves out of poverty. From the 1990s this narrative began to have enormous traction with donors, who moved away from funding radical NGOs concerned with collective aims such as land redistribution or human rights. Donors offered significant funds to help these MFIs (Microfinance Institutions) as they became known, and more generally NGOs in Bangladesh continue to rely heavily on donor funds to maintain their operations (Bangladesh is the 5th largest recipient of bilateral aid from the UK).  My research set out to examine the question, what is the social performance of microfinance institutions in rural Bangladesh? In other words, was this success story true? Did they have the impact on poor rural households that they claimed? At the time of my research most studies had examined microfinance in Bangladesh through quantitative tools. I used mixed methods, with an emphasis on spending time ethnographically in both villages and with MFIs, their staff and in their branches (I have a strong level of Bengali having previously lived in a slum in Chittagong). As my research progressed I began to understand that the realities of microfinance were very different from how they had been portrayed. Accounts from rural families told of malpractices such as abusive loan officers, extreme pressures to repay loans, forced selling of loans and illegal repossession of belongings when borrowers could not repay. I traced these practices to particular institutions (in the villages studies ten MFIs were in operation) and understood that the way they were structured commercially translated into the malpractices observed. The commercialization of these MFIs put pressures on loan officers, which led to abusive practices in the field. The result was often negative and sometimes devastating for these families - over-indebtedness was common, people sold assets and it led to serious psychological problems. The type of development possible through MFIs was far from what was portrayed.  My research pointed to the need to understand the nature of MFIs and the change they bring in relation to the socio-political contexts in which they operate. At the village level this can mean the power relationships between poor clients and MFI loan officers, and at an institutional level the place of MFIs in the broader political environment, which determines how they operate. To further understand this, an appreciation of Bangladesh&apos;s politics and the role of the state is essential (in current academic terminology the &apos;political settlement&apos;). Indeed, during and following my field work Bangladesh&apos;s political dynamics have changed significantly, with the state showing increasing signs of authoritarianism which further threatens the autonomy of civil society actors such as NGOs, journalists and campaigners. My research therefore opens upa broader question: what type of development is possible in Bangladesh?</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This proposal aims to build on an agenda started during my doctoral fieldwork, concerning the state and dynamics of civil society, and the possibilities for poverty reduction and development in Bangladesh. My doctoral research aimed to fill a gap in the literature concerning microfinance, where qualitative work is rarely conducted (Copestake 2004) and the processes by which change happens often ignored (Hulme 2000). My research seriously questioned the potential for microfinance institutions to confront rural extreme poverty, and opened up questions concerning the capacity of civil society in Bangladesh to promote development. In this postdoctoral fellowship I wish to continue this agenda, and more specifically my objectives are:    1.Disseminating my doctoral research to wide audiences   2.Continuing to build a research agenda around the place of civil society in Bangladesh   3.Acquiring new skills to better pursue an academic career 1. Disseminating my doctoral research Findings from my doctoral research are a serious challenge to the commercialized microfinance industry, both in Bangladesh and around the world. I am yet to have the time and resources to fully publish from my thesis and have a number of publications I wish to develop for an academic audience. To maximize impact I need to reach wider audiences including social investors and practitioners. Sub-objectives to this are:    a. To publish three high quality articles in well ranking peer-reviewed academic journals   b.Reach and impact a wider audience including social investors, policy makers and practitioners through outreach activities including newspaper articles and digital media  2. Continuing to build a research agenda around the place of civil society in Bangladesh My thesis examines how the commercialization of the microfinance industry has emerged in Bangladesh and raises significant questions about the capacity for this and other forms of civil society to bring about pro-poor change. This question is made all the more important given recent authoritarian shifts in the country. To continue this agenda sub-objectives are:   a.To continue to build relationships and networks in Bangladesh and internationally   b.To conduct a short piece of research on the state of microfinance and civil society in relation to Bangladesh&apos;s current political settlement   c.To apply for research grants to continue this research after the GCRF postdoctoral fellowship 3. Acquiring new skills to better pursue an academic career I wish to pursue a career in academia and in order to do will use this time to further develop the skills required to succeed in this sector. Sub-objectives are:   a. To learn the necessary skills for communication through social media in order to reach a wider audience and improve the impact of my research   b. To attend a number of internal courses through Manchester University and the ESRC related to writing, leadership, improving citations and proposal writing    c. To improve my Bengali with advanced language training</narrative>
