   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The desired impact of this multidisciplinary NFIS project is to enhance livelihood and business opportunities by adding value to plant based waste produced by palm oil mills in Malaysia. We will use microbes to convert oil palm residues into a cost-effective and environmentally sustainable safe source of feed for production of Black Soldier Fly larvae (BSFL), which can be used as fish feed by aquaculture businesses, and will assess its scalability as a novel income stream.  We have demonstrated as part of our previous Newton project that microbial processes developed for the biorefining of oil palm residues can also be used to release nutrients from crop residues to provide feed for BSFL. The NFIS will allow us to capitalise on this discovery and broaden the impact of our research. We will optimise biomass treatment on a large scale to demonstrate that BSFL production can be achieved in an industrial setting. The translation of this commercial opportunity will be carried out in collaboration with Fera Science Ltd and an SME Entofoods in Malaysia. Our longer-term vision is to extend the technology into lower income DAC countries in Asia and beyond.   Clear, comprehensive stakeholder engagement is vital to ensure the technology is taken up and translated into impacts that improve people&apos;s lives, generate economic growth and deliver change. Engagement of stakeholders from the oil palm industry, fish farms, commercial influencers and policymakers will take place throughout the project. The initiative is in line with 11th Malaysia Plan where one of the new priorities is enhancing environmental sustainability through green growth, and Malaysia&apos;s National Policy on Science, Technology &amp; Innovation: Strategic thrust 1: Advancing scientific and social research, development &amp; commercialisation to address national priorities, challenges and new opportunities.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="We aim to convert oil palm residues, which present a major waste challenge in Malaysia, into a cost-effective and environmentally sustainable high quality insect feed for use in aquaculture. In doing so we will bring new economic and livelihood opportunities.  To achieve our overall aim and desired impact, we will: 1. Optimise the conditions for solid state biodegradation of oil palm residues by microbes to produce feed for Black Soldier Fly larvae (BSFL) in an industrial setting (a significant proportion of this work will be in kind effortat Fera Science Ltd and the UY) 2. Build capacity and capability for biomass processing, including an assessment of the economic feasibility of up-scaling 3. Determine the optimal diet for the mass rearing of BSFL on degraded crop residues 4. Employ innovative mechanisms to engage stakeholders, build capacity,share knowledge and inform policy change.   BSFL feed: We will develop a solid state biomass treatment process that can be run at scale for BSFL production. Engagement and dialogue events: We will run two workshops in Malaysia with key stakeholders to unravel relationships between stakeholder groups. This will help identify common ground and potential conflicts, and assess the influence of different groups in supporting us to deliver impact.  Demonstration: We will create demonstration activity at Entofoods, translating new methodologies and good practices.  Publications and conferences: We will publish results in appropriate journals and ensure that IP is captured and exploited. We will also disseminate our results through presentations at conferences.  Outreach: A multi-stakeholder platform will be developed with information provided on a dedicated website. The website and social media feeds will present research findings in way that the lay public can learn about. We will target local media in Malaysia and the UK."></capital-spend>
