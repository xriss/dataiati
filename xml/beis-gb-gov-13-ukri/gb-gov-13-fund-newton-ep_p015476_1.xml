   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Newton Fund (Invitation Only)  Disaster Resilient Cities: Forecasting local climate extremes and physical hazards for Kuala Lumpur</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Recent natural disasters in Malaysia, such as the wide-spread floods in 2014/15 and the flash flooding of Kuala Lumpur in 2007, have revealed that improvements are required in the prediction of damaging natural hazards and in the capacity to manage the associated risks and consequences.    Appropriate to the theme of &apos;future cities&apos;, the focus of this project is the prediction and management of physical risks relevant to Kuala Lumpur, which is the Malaysian capital and the most populated city in Malaysia with around 8 million inhabitants. The particular hazards to be targetted in this project, that are common in Kuala Lumpur,  are floods, landslides, sink holes, strong winds, urban heat and air pollution.  A consortium of 16 research and business partners from the UK and Malaysia has been assembled for this project. The basic strategy is to adapt and combine existing technologies to enhance hazard forecasting ability, and the main objective is to develop a prototype multi-hazard information platform suitable for communicating risks. The primary beneficiaries will be risk managers and decision-makers in Malaysian local government and the insurance sector.  The project objectives relate to the Malaysian Science to Action initiative, which has an aim of mobilising science for societal well-being.   The University of Cambridge (UoC) is the lead UK partner in the project, and its main role is in the meteorological forecasting package. As the UoC Principal Invesigator has particular expertise in urban hazard modelling and has had a leading role in assembling the consortium, UoC will also have a prominent role in the overall management of the whole project.  Within the meteorological workplans, the main task of UoC will be to assess long-range forecast capability for Malaysia and develop data-processing models with specific objectives for hazard risk outlooks. This is timely because the global long-range forecast systems developed by leading weather and climate centres now have demonstrable predictive skill on seasonal timescales, and have spatial resolution sufficient to represent important tropical meteorological processes relevant to the Malaysian sector. UoC will also contribute to the mesoscale weather modelling workpackage led by the Malaysian Meteorological Department.  Benefits of the project will include:  Improved information regarding the risks of occurrence of natural hazards will enable Malaysian local authorities to make better contingency plans to mitigate the effects of such hazards. This will in turn provide economic benefits and improve the quality of life for Malaysian citizens. Improved information about geophysical hazards will also aid the development of insurance services.  The hazard information system developed for Kuala Lumpur will have relevance to cities elsewhere in Malaysia and in the ASEAN region. There is scope for broadening commercial development of such systems, with benefit both to the commercial sector and to the future urban management of cities.  With regard to the UoC long-range meteorology component, the results of the skill investigation will be relevant to the wider seasonal prediction research community, both through the methodology used and as an example of the potential for beneficial application in the Asian region.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The goal of the project as a whole is the development of a prototype geophysical multi-hazard forecast system for the Malaysian region, in particular for the largest city, Kuala Lumpur. The system will improve contingency planning and risk management, and reduce the economic and societal impacts of the hazards. The main focus is on short-range (hours to days) and high-resolution (city-scale) capability, regarding hazards such as flash-floods, landslides, heat waves, air pollution. There is also a long-range (weeks to seasons) component of the meteorological package, aimed at providing early warning regarding the activity of various meteorological events.   The main objectives of the University of Cambridge (UoC) component of the project workplan are:  1.  assess the skill of long-range retrospective forecasts with regard to rainfall, near-surface temperature and wind, using data available from the Met Office dynamical long-range prediction system. Although individual weather events are not predictable at long range, estimates can be made of the levels of activity within a season.   2. assess the additional skill that might be obtained by applying statistical calibration methods to counteract systematic biases in the dynamical systematic  3. where skill is sufficiently high, develop a prototype system that could be applied to long-range forecast data to provide outlooks specific to Malaysian risk management requirements.  Work toward these objectives will be carried out in collaboration with the Malaysian Meteorological Department (MMD), which is a partner in the consortium. UoC will also contribute to the mesoscale meteorological component led by MMD.  The project consortium contains 16 Malaysian and UK academic and commercial participants. The UoC principal investigator is the leader of the UK contribution.</narrative>
