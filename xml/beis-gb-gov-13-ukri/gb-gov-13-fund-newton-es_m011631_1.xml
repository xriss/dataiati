   <narrative xml:lang="EN">ADEPT: developing the ecosystem approach to drive positive urban transformations in the context of intersecting vulnerabilities</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The UN Convention on Biological Diversity promotes using an ecosystems approach (EA) to support the delivery of ecosystem services and benefits (ESB) as a dynamic conceptualisation of environmental quality. It is promoted as enabling an easier integration of environmental goods and services into economic processes and policies. However, many researchers suggest that an EA is &apos;science in the making&apos; and emerging policy initiatives overlook complexities that stem from both uncertain scientific underpinnings and socio-economic divisions. These include gender divisions and inequalities, yet these topics are largely absent from ESB discussions. While feminist writers (and others) suggest caution with adopting an EA, ADEPT seeks to explore if and how the approach could be useful for promoting wellbeing for women and men. While environmental justice scholars have long suggested that socio-economic hardship and the distribution of environmental goods and bads are correlated, recent applications of intersectional theory suggest that practical experiences of exclusion from opportunity always intermesh with other divisions such as those based on race, social class, disability status, sexuality, age and geographical location. There is then a need to address environmental and socio-economic vulnerability in an integrated manner. To do so an EA needs to first address a binary exclusion; firstly, there is a need to highlight ways in which ESB frame environmental quality, often affording stronger representation to expert interpretation of how environmental quality is experienced. Secondly, there is need to understand how intersecting vulnerabilities influence access to a range of ESB (with a focus on those linked to urban blue-green space e.g. clean water, flood mitigation and recreational opportunities). The focus of the current research will be a major urban zoning project in Belo Horizonte (BH), which covers a range of land-use types from dense low-income urban districts to rich gated neighbourhoods, protected areas, commercial and industrial districts. This provides an ideal case study area in which to trial and extend understandings of gendered vulnerability to environmental change within local urban contexts. Research to be undertaken will involve identifying socio-economic and environmental vulnerabilities and zones of interaction, exploration of differential experiences of urban ESB and scoping the potential of these as a means to support poverty alleviation in urban transformations. Results from BH will also be discussed within a Sao Paulo (SP) context, through the involvement of field researchers from SP currently involved in a local community engagement project involving the redevelopment of urban water management policies.  The research collaboration is organised around a series of four international research workshops. An online research community will support the combination and interrogation of both new and existing data sets and development of new evidence of the processes which underpin urban vulnerability, forming the context within which any resilience solutions would need to be derived.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The main objective of this project is employing expertise on gendered vulnerability, lay data collection methods and ecosystem services to better identify and engage with differential experiences of urban ecosystem services and benefits (ESB), supporting transformation of vulnerable urban communities. This will be acieved by:  - Establishment of an online community of Brazilian and UK academics, policy, planning and community stakeholders to share and validate research findings; - Identification of areas of coinciding environmental and socio-economic vulnerabilities in Belo Horizonte; - Employing a smart phone app enabling communities to generate data regarding ESB in target areas; - Development of profiles of intersecting vulnerabilities, key drivers and linkages between poverty, gender, housing etc. and access to ESB; - Analysis of the potential role of expanded gender sensitive framings of ESB in informing ongoing urban transformations; - Identification of good practice in policy/projects that directly or indirectly engage and/or improve ESBs; - Development of guidance for recognising and addressing bias in delivering ESB to address the needs of disadvantaged urban communities.</narrative>
