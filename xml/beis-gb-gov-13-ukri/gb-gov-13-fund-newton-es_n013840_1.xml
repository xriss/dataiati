  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Social entrepreneurship and social innovation are increasingly promoted by South African policy makers, non-governmental organisations, civil groups, businesses and public sector bodies as a way to address complex and intractable poverty and sustainable development issues as part of a quest for inclusive growth, especially for the marginalized and disenfranchised. Across South Africa non-profits and for-profit socially orientated small businesses are emerging to tackle a wealth of social, environmental and economic issues across townships, in poor rural areas and as part of a sustainable and equitable transformation of South Africa. Larger South African multinationals are also working with social enterprises as part of their corporate social responsibility and economic empowerment initiatives. There has been a corresponding rise in interest in academia in South Africa and across the world. This includes increased social entrepreneurship/innovation research activity at the Centre for Entrepreneurship at Wits and the Network for Social Entrepreneurs at GIBS University of Pretoria, amongst others. South African scholars in these fields, especially those at the start of their career undertaking PhDs or just starting in academia, can often be isolated in the global research environment. There is a need to offer opportunities to reach out to others in similar research areas across South Africa and the rest of the world. Sharing their own insights and learning from others is critical to developing excellent, rigorous and useful research that has the potential to improve the quality and impact of the research being undertaken on social entrepreneurship and innovation in South Africa. Developing research capacity across South Africa through exposure to cutting edge methodological techniques offers the opportunity to strengthen the collection and analysis of data to produce empirically rigorous work.  Publishing in high quality outlets with an international reach is also important in showcasing the excellent research occurring in these areas in South Africa to the global research and practitioner communities. Through this NRF ESRC funded &quot;South African PhD Partnering Network for Inclusive Growth through Social Innovation and Entrepreneurship (SASIE)&quot; we will deliver the SASIE programme and form a SASIE network of global scholars to exchange knowledge, network and collaborate. Its themes will focus on the broad role of enterprise-based development models and in particular all aspects associated with social innovation, social entrepreneurship and enterprise based inclusive growth initiatives. It is delivered through a partnership between the two lead institutions of the University of Witwatersrand in South Africa (Wits) and the University of Essex in the UK with its Doctoral Training Centre in Social Sciences, and a consortium of South African universities. Ten South African PhD placements students will be drawn from across this consortium of Wits, Pretoria and Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University, with some places available for eligible PhD students from across any South African university. A further 10 PhD placement students will come from across various Schools at the University of Essex . A series of activities are planned over the three year programme that will facilitate sustainable links between partners, improve research capacity and training, and build a research community in South Africa and internationally linked to the SASIE research themes. In brief these comprise of: - A publicly available and searchable database hosted on the project website available to researchers around the work; - Advanced Research Methods Training Workshops available to PhD students and researchers in South Africa; - PhD workshops and Colloquiums; - PhD placements; - Supervisor visits; - A public seminar series showcasing SASIE research; and - Conference attendance bursaries</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The objectives of the South African PhD Partnering Network for Inclusive Growth through Social Innovation and Entrepreneurship (SASIE) programme and associated network are:  - to facilitate inclusive growth, poverty alleviation and sustainable development in South Africa (SA)  through the activities of the SASIE programme and network, with a focus on the key themes of social innovation, social entrepreneurship and associated aspects of inclusive growth discourses; - to build a global database of researchers interested in SASIE topics to facilitate networking, dissemination of research and capacity building; - to build long term strategic links in the areas covered by the SASIE themes in SA and globally, at a personal  and institutional level amongst placement students, supervisors and the wider SASIE network; - to meet the training needs of South African PhD students and faculty through the provision of advanced training courses in qualitative and quantitative methods to those registered in the SASIE database in SA, and those on placement attending the Essex summer school; - to develop a cohort of early career South African /UK researchers with skills, networks and formative experiences to equip them in a global research environment by providing research methods training, PhD colloquiums, external seminars and placements in SA/UK; - to provide opportunities for this cohort to build long-term partnerships with each other and others in the SASIE network by meeting on a regular basis; - to provide opportunities for UK students to experience the SA research context and work with SA researchers through a 3-5 month placement in their 2nd year; - to provide opportunities for SA PhD students to experience the UK research environment, gain new skills and build partnerships with UK researchers at Essex and more widely in the UK at the start or mid-point of their PhD through up to two placements of up 20 weeks in total in the UK; - to provide opportunities for SA supervisors to experience the UK research environment, and build partnerships with UK researchers at Essex and more widely in the UK through mobility visits to the UK; - to provide a bursary to SASIE  PhD Fellows to attend either the British Academy of Management or International Social Innovation Research Conferences to present their research to an international academic audience; - to strengthen research and innovation in the areas of social innovation, entrepreneurship and inclusive growth through entrepreneurial activity more generally via knowledge exchange, dissemination of research and outreach though the project website and impact events; and - to support the development of research capacity generally in SA through access to the PhD colloquium and advanced research training methods workshops to those outside the core SA consortium.</narrative>
