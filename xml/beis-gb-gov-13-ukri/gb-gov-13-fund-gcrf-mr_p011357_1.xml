   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Determining the persister populations in sputum during tuberculosis therapy. A supplementary study to the RIFASHORT trial.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Nearly ten million people developed TB in 2014 and 1.5 million died. Although drug resistance is a serious problem, the vast majority of infections are treatable with standard antibiotics effective against the TB bacterium, known as Mtb, which causes this devastating disease.  Treatment of TB currently requires patients to take antibiotics for 6 months. Even after this the disease returns in up to 5% of individuals, usually within a year after stopping therapy. Developing treatments with shorter duration and lower disease return (or relapse) rates is a major goal of global TB control efforts. Testing new treatments is very expensive, requires hundreds of patients and takes many years. Our project aims to reduce these barriers to testing and enable shortened treatment.  The need for prolonged therapy and the frequency of relapse are thought to be due to significant numbers of Mtb bacteria in an altered state that survive exposure to antibiotics; the altered bacteria are known as persisters. While growing cells of Mtb are rapidly killed in conventional lab tests, cells in the non-growing persister state are not.  Our team has been studying the persister phenomenon in TB for many years. In the past decade we discovered features of Mtb in the sputum (coughed up phlegm) of newly diagnosed patients that, surprisingly, indicated the presence of non-growing persisters amongst the bacteria that clinical labs normally isolate. These features are recognised in 3 ways, microscopy to detect fatty droplets inside the Mtb cells, lab culture in the presence of a growth stimulator known as Rpf and a genetic test to show which genes the bug is expressing (known as the transcriptome). Because all three indicate the present of non-growing Mtb in sputum and because the levels present varied from patient to patient we wondered whether these &quot;Fat and Lazy&quot; bacteria were related to the persisters. If this is so, then the numbers of Mtb with these properties in different patients might tell us how quickly they will respond to treatment and, once on therapy, how rapidly the persisters were being eliminated. In preliminary studies we looked at the frequency of fatty Mtb cells in TB patients and related these to how patients responded to treatment. Although numbers were small, we found that patients with higher numbers of fatty Mtb responded more slowly. Then, with colleagues in Liverpool and Malawi, we asked whether counting fatty Mtb cells in sputum samples could tell us which patients were going to fail TB treatment in spite of being infected with an antibiotic sensitive bug. When we compared the levels of fatty Mtb between 9 treatment failures and 29 cured patients we found that the failures had, on average, double the frequency of these &quot;persister-like&quot; cells. Here we aim to add value to a clinical trial testing a shortened treatment of TB by studying the ability of our tests to predict treatment failure. The RIFASHORT TB treatment trial provides an exceptional opportunity for us to test sufficient sputum samples for these properties to achieve 3 objectives: 1) re-testing the predictive capacity of counting fatty Mtb cells at one month; 2) determining the interrelationships between the fatty, Rpf and transcriptome features in sputum samples; and 3) determining of which test, applied within the first 2 months of treatment, is most strongly linked to treatment failure. The results of this study will have clear potential to, 1) enable rapid assessment of new anti-TB treatments including new drugs effective against resistant Mtb, and 2) determine which patients might safely stop treatment after periods as short as 3 months. If we can reliably compare new treatments in 2 rather than 18 months, we will be able to test more alternatives and select the best with far less resource than currently required. If we can shorten TB treatment, many lives will be saved and much suffering alleviated.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Persisters are a subpopulation of bacteria that remain viable after the initial killing action of antibiotics. In tuberculosis (TB), as distinct from antimicrobial drug resistance, persister populations of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) are widely believed to be responsible for relapses following chemotherapy, slow response to therapy and treatment failure. High Mtb persister populations at the onset or developing during chemotherapy may explain why some patients are not cured. Here we test two sputum assays of Mtb phenotypes linked to persisters for their utility in predicting responses to TB chemotherapy. The work will enhance and add value to a funded clinical trial and offers great potential to accelerate evaluation of new drugs and treatment regimens in TB. The primary aim of this work is to investigate the predictive value for cure of quantifying specific bacterial sub-populations in patients&apos; sputum during the early phase of treatment for TB. The work builds on the MRC/DFID/WT Global Health Trials funded RIFASHORT trial, a randomized trial to evaluate the toxicity and efficacy of 1200mg and 1800mg rifampicin daily for 4 months in the treatment of pulmonary TB. The targeted Mtb populations are recognised by their dependency on Resuscitation Promoting Factors (Rpfs) to grow in liquid medium and by the presence of bacterial intracellular lipid bodies (LBs). These phenotypes are the subject of well-established research programmes in, and have been linked both phenotypically and mechanistically to, antibiotic tolerance and the persister phenomenon. The analytical readouts relating to Rpf and LB assays are respectively referred to as Rpf-dependent (Rpf-D) counts and percentage of LB positive (%LB+) cells. The value of these analyses will be further enhanced by determining the Mtb transcriptomes associated with selected samples. This work is incentivised by a case-control study demonstrating that %LB+ analyses at 21-28 days into therapy clearly distinguish between unsatisfactory and 18 month relapse-free treatment outcomes and by development of a procedure for storage of sputum samples allowing deferred analysis of Rpf-D counts. The central hypotheses are: A. That the abundance of Rpf-D and %LB+ Mtb cells in sputum reflect the size of the persister population in that individual and their risk of treatment failure or relapse. B. That absolute levels of and/or changes in the abundances of these target populations during early chemotherapy or combinations thereof provide a predictive index for relapse or treatment failure. C. That Rpf-D and %LB+  populations are correlated D. That Mtb transcriptional signatures in sputum can be correlated with the subpopulation determinations. The specific objectives are: 1. To prepare and analyse smears of sputum samples taken 1 month into treatment for %LB+ counts. (n= 300) 2. To store serial (T=0, 2, 4, 8 week) sputum samples from 150 subjects enrolled in the RIFASHORT trial (50 each from 2 study arms and 1 control arm)  3. To prospectively analyse selected samples (t=0, 3, 14, 28 days) for Rpf-D and %LB+ counts and the associated Mtb transcriptome (n=60). 4. To determine relationships between Rpf-D, %LB+ and Mtb transcripts. 5. To use the stored samples to conduct a case-control study to compare the Rpf and LB indices and their dynamic changes between successfully treated subjects and those in whom relapse or treatment failure occurs.  6. To determine the single or combination of assays most strongly associated with failed therapy.  Achievement of these objectives will enable completion of three studies. (i) Prospective analyses of %LB+ counts at ~1 month as a predictor of unsatisfactory outcome. (VALIDATION STUDY) (ii) Prospective determination of the correlation between sputum indices. (CORRELATION STUDY) (iii) A case-control study matching early sputum analyses from subjects with unsatisfactory outcomes with those obtained from cured individuals. (CASE-CONTROL STUDY)</narrative>
