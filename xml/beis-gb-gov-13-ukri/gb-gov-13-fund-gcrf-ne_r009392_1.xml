   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Agriculture is a major sector in Sub Saharan Africa (SSA) and provides employment to many people. It is not only a source of livelihood but also their way of life. Many of them are subsistence farmers and need to ensure that the crop productivity is as optimum as possible. One factor that influences crop productivity is the use of suitable amount of fertilisers. This is not a guarantee as many other factors influence crop productivity such as irrigation, climate, pest/disease/weeds, soil organic matter and crop varieties. However if all other factors are optimum then fertiliser applications can play a major role in influencing crop productivity. A challenge in SSA is that chemical fertiliser prices are expensive which results in low application to the farm. The available options to supplement the low application of chemical fertilisers are to use organic amendments such as crop residue, livestock manure, biosolids and compost. Biosolids that is used in the developed country comes from a treatment plant and treated to an acceptable standard that is safe. However this is not the case in most parts of the SSA. An available option in SSA is faecal derived material from dry toilets in settlements. This faecal matter when treated to safe standards through processes such as composting can be utilised as a valuable fertilisers needed for crop production. Whilst there is general understandings that faecal matter derived fertilisers (FDF) are beneficial for crop productivity, there are perception issues that curbs its full potential. In addition there could be variation between different batches of FDF depending on the feedstock being utilised. This also reduces the reliance on its use as fertilisers in addition to the earlier perception issues due to unpleasant odour and nature of faecal matter.   This project is timely as it offers technological solutions that tackle the challenges explained above and can potentially increase the use of FDF and instil confidence amongst farmers. The aim of the proposed project is to demonstrate the feasibility of deploying technology based solutions in SSA to test and evaluate FDF to overcome barriers in using it in agriculture. The proposed technology will be supported by translational and knowledge exchange so that its implementation can be effective at ground level and be widely accepted in order to tackle existing barriers in implementing its use in agriculture. The proposed technology is a simple paper based method that can be used to determine nutrient content (particularly nitrate and ammonium) in FDF. This project will also explore the option of a mobile phone App that is being developed as part of another project for the ease of end-users such as farmers. Whilst this method is simple and can be effective, steps will be taken as part of this project to ensure that the precision and accuracy of this tool does not compromise any information gathered on the nutrient status of such fertilisers. This project will also engage closely with end-users such as farmers and agronomists through workshops and seminars so that any doubts can be clarified through effective communication.   This project will also provide a tool which end-users can use to determine landbank that is suitable to receive FDF. In this way the land can be used efficiently and coupled with the mobile phone App which can inform on how suitable the fertiliser that is being applied. This can be a win-win situation which can not only provide a solution for sanitation (through safe disposal and treatment of faecal matter into fertilisers) but also tackle food security through potential improvement in soil fertility and crop production. There will be close engagement with end-users to ensure that willingness to accept the use of such technologies. The outcome of this project will be very valuable in improving the socio-economic status of farmers and rely more on renewable sources of fertilisers to practice sustainable agriculture.</narrative>
