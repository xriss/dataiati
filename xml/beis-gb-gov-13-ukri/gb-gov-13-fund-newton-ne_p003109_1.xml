   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Uncertainties in regional exchanges of air pollution can fundamentally undermine confidence in, and the potential effectiveness of, air pollution policies within cities themselves. This project will address key science capability gaps associated with assessing and reducing pollution impacts in Delhi and the wider National Capital Region. This will be achieved through a collaborative UK-India development of new science tools for predicting air pollution at the surface and measuring air pollution emissions and exposure in India.  These ambitious goals will be achieved through an intensive six month coordinated modelling and experimental effort from NCAS in the UK and IITM and IIT in India. The project will accelerate the creation of advanced new science capability in the UK and India, and enhance further the links between the UK and India for the development of airborne measurement technologies.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="Uncertainties in regional exchanges of air pollution can fundamentally undermine confidence in, and the potential effectiveness of, air pollution policies within cities themselves. This project will address key science capability gaps associated with assessing and reducing pollution impacts in Delhi and the wider National Capital Region. This will be achieved through a collaborative UK-India development of new science tools for modelling air pollution at the surface and measuring air pollution emissions and exposure in India. The capabilities to be developed are targeted at Delhi, but have full transferability to other developing countries. The objectives are: (i) To provide the underpinning science for new Indian air pollution prediction systems, and specifically the development of high resolution modelling tools for assessing the sources and scale of air pollutant transport across the Delhi National Capital Region,  (ii) To develop an improved set of observational tools for measuring air pollution at the city to regional scale from research aircraft, including the development of new sensing technologies for the top-down quantification of emissions from New Delhi, in support of Indian policy and public health planning.  These ambitious goals will be achieved through an intensive six month coordinated modelling and experimental effort from eight NCAS staff members, in conjunction with staff at IITM and IIT, Delhi. The project will build on NCAS&apos;s existing National Capability investments, accelerate the creation of advanced new science capability in the UK and India, and enhance further the links between the UK and India for the development of airborne measurement technologies."></capital-spend>
