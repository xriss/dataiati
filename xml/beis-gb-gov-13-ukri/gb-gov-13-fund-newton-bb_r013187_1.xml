   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project aims to develop a strategic approach to identify and combat porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) outbreaks and other porcine viral diseases in the Philippines. The Philippines are the world&apos;s 8th largest producer of pork producing over 1,700 mega tons of pork meat per year. However, the pork production still relies largely on backyard farms, which, in 2016, were reported to house 64% of the roughly 12.5 million animals in the country. This divergence in farming practises between backyard and commercial farms requires a robust strategic approach to prevent pathogen spread across farms and systems. The backyard farms often use crossbred commercial western/indigenous breed pigs, with few biosafety measures in place, rarely rely on veterinary consultation, lack diagnostics, and allow fairly liberal and unsupervised access to antibiotics. In contrast, the commercial farms rely on commercial highly bred western pig breeds, mostly Landrace/Large White/Duroc crosses brought in from leading breeding companies, such as PIC and Topigs Norsvim, amongst others. The commercial farms, despite little usage of diagnostics to support clinical diagnoses, are employing extensive vaccination schemes; however, currently this isn&apos;t always effective in preventing disease. Improved diagnostics, monitoring, surveillance and reviewing of current biosafety and vaccination strategies are essential to employ a targeted approach to disease control.   Therefore, this project aims to assess the current health situation in commercial and backyard farms, to identify current vaccination strategies, and to identify circulating strains and subtypes of PRRSV and PEDV. We will use traditional Sanger and next generation sequencing of field samples to conduct phylodynamic and phylogeographic analysis, which will help to inform the spread and source of PRRSV and PEDV outbreaks, and which will further aid disease prevention strategies. The outcomes will give us an overview of the current health and biosafety situation in the Filipino pig industry and will allow us to develop specific, easy-to-use diagnostic tools that will enable farmers to specifically identify diseases present in their stock and advise targeted vaccination and biosafety measures. We aim to develop differential diagnostic tools based on reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) or reverse transcription recombinase polymerase amplification (RT-RPA) for systemic viral diseases including PRRSV, CSFV, PCV2, and IAV-S, and for enteric viral diseases including PEDV, TGEV, and rotaviruses. We will employ easy-to-use flow strip detection methods to develop multiplex tests that allow differentiation between viruses and/or subtypes. From our results, we aim to generate targeted advice for both commercial and backyard farms in order to prevent and combat viral diseases in pigs.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="Viral diseases are a major burden to the Philippine pig industry. Despite extensive vaccination especially porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) infections are causing major economic losses. Vaccines against these two viruses in particular are not or only partially protective against infection with heterologous subtypes and sublineages. Therefore accurate diagnostics recognising and differentiating circulating strains are essential for effective treatment.  However, at the moment only very little disease surveillance is performed in the Philippines and currently only three PRRSV sequences available in public databases dating back to 2008. Therefore, we aim to get an understanding of the pig health and biosafety situation in the Philippines. We will focus primarily on PRRSV for the assessment of the situation and the spread of disease using phylodynamic and phylogeographic analysis. The sample collection and assessment will also allow us to collect samples for analysing the presence of PEDV and other viral diseases. The sequence data from the sample collection, and known sequences from more conserved viral diseases will be used to develop differential diagnostic tools using PCR, RT-LAMP or RT-RPA analysis methods for enteric/systemic viral diseases, including PRRSV, CSFV, PCV2, and IAV-S, and enteric viral diseases, including PEDV, TGEV, and rotaviruses. We will employ easy-to-use flow strip detection methods to develop multiplex tests that allow differentiation between viruses and/or subtypes.  The project objectives are: 1) To assess the health and biosafety situation of pig farms within the Philippines (focussing on the Luzon area) and to collect samples for further analysis. 2) To identify the circulating PRRSV strains on affected farms by Nanopore MinION sequencing and to perform phylodynamic and phylogeographic analysis 3) To develop diagnostic tools to identify and differentiate viral pig diseases present in the Philippines by RT-LAMP and, where possible, flow cell detection methods. 4) To develop and advise on biosecurity and potentially eradication strategies for current and future outbreaks."></capital-spend>
