   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In recent years there have been significant advances made internationally to raise awareness about gender inequalities. International organisations including the United Nations have also sought to ensure that the creation of more equitable futures for women and men are at the heart of global change and sustainable development.  Despite those advances, gender inequalities persist in myriad forms and negatively affect the health and wellbeing of people the world over in a variety of ways, from constraining access to opportunities and resources to fostering gender based violence.  We recognise the importance of both international bodies and national states and governments in agenda setting, enacting progressive legislation and adopting gender positive policies, as well as the work of those political activists who are at the forefront of pressing for these changes.  However, this project is focused on the way that cultures of equality are being built and created from the ground up.  We do so by investigating the creative ways that people and organisations in developing countries respond to and seek to address existing inequalities and enhance the wellbeing of people marginalised as a result of those.  Our aim is disclose the ways that those everyday responses not only address harms, but also become opportunities for broader societal impact through creating new and alternative cultures of equality.   How and in what ways does the proposed research use art, curation, literature and performance to address these challenges? Our answer, following the novelist Jeanette Winterson, is that, &apos;Everything starts as a story we tell ourselves about ourselves&apos;. By that Winterson means that so long as we remain capable of telling different stories about our own and other lives, there is the possibility of creating more equitable and sustainable futures for all of us.  That is our understanding of what cultures of equality are about: working with and alongside people both to disclose the situations of inequality and the bodily and mental impacts of that on them and the people they care for, and to begin to tell different stories about what their lives ought and could be.  As scholars working across the humanities and social sciences we think there are considerable advantages to using different arts based practice including creative writing, dance, exhibitions, music, theatre, performance or social media in this process.  These different multisensory methods enable people to share things about their lives that may be too sensitive and threatening to talk about directly. They also create opportunities not just to tell different stories but also to tell them in new and different sorts of ways.  Our project draws together and creates new partnerships between people and organisations from across the world in and beyond the academy. In so doing we will share expertise and learn from each other about how we can best use these arts based research practices, both to enable us to better hear and understand the stories people tell, and to find better ways of using those stories to create the conditions that underpin and will enhance the economic development and welfare of all people.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The GCRF GlobalGRACE (Global Gender and Cultures of Equality) project employs artistic interventions, curatorial research practice and public exhibitions to investigate and enable gender positive approaches to wellbeing internationally. We will build research capacity, cultivate new partnerships and develop platforms for creating sustainable futures by working together to produce cultures of equality in the present.  In doing so we address two key UN global Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs):  5. Gender Equality and 3. Health and Wellbeing.  Demonstrable links exist between intersecting inequalities and diminished wellbeing, from constraining access to opportunities and resources to fostering gender based violence. We investigate people&apos;s everyday embodied experience of those processes and their effects and the innovative cultural practices developed by people and third sector organisations in different parts of the world to a) raise public awareness about persistent forms of intersecting inequalities; b) enhance the health and wellbeing of people marginalised by gender, sexuality, age, disability, ethnicity and class and c) produce new cultures of equality from within and out of these positions of marginality. Our aim is to enhance the capability of the arts and art based researchers to generate social impact internationally through creating and cultivating the conditions necessary to sustain economic development and the welfare of people in developing countries.   The GlobalGRACE project builds on and extends internationally into developing contexts the current EU funded Gender and Cultures of Equality in Europe (GRACE - http://graceproject.eu/). Working with a consortium of researchers and NGOs in and beyond the UK, Bangladesh, Brazil, Mexico, Philippines and South Africa (the latter all DAC listed), the GlobalGRACE project will:  1. Disclose through community arts based research practices the different ways that intersecting inequalities impact on people&apos;s lives and wellbeing. 2. Identify the variety of ways that third sector organisations internationally collaborate with artists and deploy curatorial and arts based research practice to reduce harms and enhance the wellbeing of marginalised people. 3. Explore whether, and if so how, those arts based practices are used more broadly to raise public awareness about and intervene in debates about intersecting forms of gendered inequalities. 4. Curate and exhibit the art discovered and produced as part of the research as means both to reflect on and assess those practices and in turn to become a key site for the production of cultures of equality internationally.   Key outcomes from meeting these objectives will be:  1) The stimulation of new ways of deploying arts and curation to intervene in the production of cultures of equality and enhance gender positive approaches to health and wellbeing internationally. 2) The creation of a virtual hub to facilitate the establishment of South - South and South - North networks and research partnerships between academics, artists, third sector organisations and policy makers.  3) The development of new comparative cross country and transnational arts based methodological approaches. 4) The production of a virtual and material travelling Global Museum of Equalities that will be a primary engagement device for both publics and policy makers internationally.   5) The production of an on-line open access Global Gender and Cultures of Equality course that will be a key part of our impact activities.   6) Produce a range of other arts based and academic outputs including a GlobalGRACE digital repository of visual images and other material arising from the GlobalGRACE work packages together with a multi-volume GlobalGRACE book collection that will build on and extend the current EU focused GRACE book collection being developed with Routledge.</narrative>
