  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">There are three main objectives of the proposed programme relating to (1) Knowledge, (2) Capacity, and (3) Relationships. Progress towards achieving these objectives will be tracked in order to assess programme effectiveness.  (1) Enhanced understanding of the impacts, risks and trade-offs within and between social, economic and environmental dimensions of different agricultural development pathways that relate to SDGs 2, 10 and 15. Novel scientific research will be co-produced by UK and African researchers in Ethiopia, Ghana and Zambia, countries struggling with different challenges related to food insecurity, social inequalities and environmental degradation. The research priorities will be further refined at the end of year one based on results of a comprehensive situation and context analysis and a scenario-building process engaging key stakeholders in each country, including key decision makers. The research outputs will enable key decision-makers in government agencies to make more informed policy and investment choices, and NGOs and other civil society actors to better advocate for necessary policy change and hold government accountable for effective policy implementation, with particular attention to the interests of poor and vulnerable men and women.  (2) Enhanced capacity of UK and African researchers to co-develop excellent and relevant interdisciplinary research on the impacts, risks and trade-offs within and between social, economic and environmental dimensions of different agricultural development pathways that relate to SDGs 2, 10 and 15. The programme will enable all research partners to increase the relevance of research to key information needs of decision-makers and other key actors, to enhance research quality, and ensure that the research findings can be readily applied both during the time frame of the programme and on an on-going basis. However, individual researcher capacity is not enough - previous research capacity development frameworks have shown the importance of organisational systems, processes and relationships to ensure that research is relevant, makes the best use of existing knowledge, and that researchers are well connected, motivated and rewarded. The programme will use collaborative research / learning, interactive training and mentoring of junior staff, and direct engagement with senior university managers in the UK and in Africa to identify and address capacity constraints. Capacity building will be embedded throughout the programme as an integral part of the research agenda, building on frameworks of research capacity development developed as part of DFID&apos;s research strategy. Beyond the three target countries, our partnership with the regional network RUFORUM will contribute to strengthening capacity of RUFORUM members both to conduct relevant research at the agricultural/environment nexus and to strengthen their teaching in this respect.  (3) Enhanced relationships between UK research organisations and partners in Africa to address challenges around the agriculture-environment nexus, supported by a nurturing organisational environment and culture that fosters responsiveness to and engagement with stakeholders. The programme will create and strengthen research partnerships between UK and Africa that will enhance the capacity of all partners to identify and conduct research on major challenges at the agriculture/environment nexus in Africa. It will also facilitate stronger linkages between researchers and research users in each country to enhance relevance and sense of ownership, and across disciplinary and sectoral boundaries. It will do so by working with existing as well as recently emerging networks / platforms of actors in the three countries. By so doing, the programme seeks to engage research users throughout the research process thus heightening the likelihood of the enhanced knowledge brought about by the research being taken up by civil society actors and decision-makers.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This proposal addresses the challenge of achieving Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 2 (zero hunger), SDG 10 (reduced inequalities), and SDG 15 (ecosystem conservation) in Sub-Saharan Africa. Conflicts and trade-offs between these goals are rapidly intensifying because of ongoing population growth and economic development, while decision makers in government and the private sector continue to base their actions on an insufficient understanding of possible socio-economic and environmental impacts of different agricultural development pathways. The proposed programme aims to enhance the capacity of UK and African organisations to investigate these impacts and trade-offs through a participatory process that combines state-of-the-art research with effective engagement with research users. Its vision is for key government and private sector actors to adjust their policies, strategies and investments to take more account of the impacts, risks and trade-offs within and between socio-economic and environmental dimensions of different agricultural development pathways, and for civil society organisations to have a greater role in shaping the national discourse on agricultural development.  The research process will involve a context analysis of each country as a whole, followed by analyses to determine: (i) drivers of current agricultural landscapes, (ii) impacts of different agricultural development pathways on socio-economic factors, biodiversity and the capacity of ecosystems to provide services to people over the long term, (iii) the role of institutions and policies in shaping agricultural systems; and (iv) the political and economic barriers to more joined-up policy and planning. This will inform the building, with key stakeholders, of scenarios for agriculture and land use change, taking into account climate change, predicted rates of human population growth and urbanization, and ultimately leading to an improved understanding of the impacts, risks and trade-offs of different agricultural developmental scenarios. The programme will support stakeholders in &apos;making sense&apos; of, and using, the refined scenarios to inform policies, investments and advocacy at sub-national and national level.   Our interdisciplinary research process will be accompanied by activities to assess and develop both the technical and &apos;process oriented&apos; capacities of participating researchers and stakeholders (policy-makers, investors, civil society actors / NGOs), with the aim of strengthening their ability to co-develop relevant research and to assess and use the outcomes for decision making and advocacy. New partnerships will be developed between researchers in Africa and the UK, between different disciplines, and between different stakeholder groups in the three countries via National Learning Alliances.  The ultimate beneficiaries of this process will be poor rural and urban households who would benefit from more coherent policies supporting the long-term sustainability and resilience of farming systems and local ecosystems. These make up a large proportion of the human population in sub-Saharan Africa and include (a) the poor in rural areas whose food security is based on subsistence agriculture and using income from agricultural labour and cash crops to purchase food to cover gaps, and (b) poor rural and urban populations who produce little or no food themselves, but who are highly dependent on food purchase and thus exposed to food price risk resulting from failure to balance food supply and demand.</narrative>
