   <narrative xml:lang="EN">1. To build on research and collaboration from the AHRC-PACCS &apos;Art and Reconciliation Project: Conflict, Culture and Community&apos; project, specifically building on the original objectives: (a) To investigate the history and potential of artistic and creative cultural practices and objects in processes and outcomes of post-conflict reconciliation, forgetting, remembering and forgiving; and (b) to developing creative artistic practices and artefacts in relation to, and in collaboration with, particular communities. 2. To develop further an innovative and creative conceptual change in which the museum &apos;opened its doors&apos; for the first time and gained a &apos;new life&apos;, an unanticipated yet highly successful result of the AHRC-PACCS project collaboration. 3. To design jointly and implement a scheme of research and practice with the History Museum of Bosnia and Hercegovina into a &apos;living museum&apos;, bringing a research-led fresh perspective. 4. To initiate a series of open calls with commissions, open studios, artist workshops and participatory-community engagement activities and events in partnership. 5. To invite artists to innovate and create to bring new interpretations to the museum&apos;s role and collection in relation to the history of the country, potentially to be added to the museum&apos;s collection (not, to be clear, merely new curatorial interpretations of the museum&apos;s role and collection) 6. To offer artists and the museum the opportunity and inspiration to make creative interventions. 7. To enhance the cultural landscape of post-conflict Sarajevo and Bosnia and Hercegovina, fostering engagement with art and memory. 8. To benefit and contribute to the development and welfare of the Historical Museum of Bosnia and Hercegovina, museum audiences and visitors, artists (individually and collectively). and communities in post-conflict Sarajevo and Bosnia and Hercegovina.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project builds on research and collaboration from the AHRC-PACCS &apos;Art and Reconciliation Project: Conflict, Culture and Community&apos; project, specifically building on the original objectives: (a) to investigate the history and potential of artistic and creative cultural practices and objects in processes and outcomes of post-conflict reconciliation, forgetting, remembering and forgiving; and (b) to developing creative artistic practices and artifacts in relation to, and in collaboration with, particular communities. In particular, it will develop an innovative and creative partnership between Historical Museum of Bosnia and Hercegovina in Sarajevo and the project investigators. This occurred when the museum co-commissioned artist projects as part of the project&apos;s research agenda. In doing so, the Museum opened its doors for the first time to artistic intervention, inviting artists to respond creatively to the Museum&apos;s role and collection, and in doing so, bringing new interpretations and works into the Museum&apos;s collection (a contrast to merely curatorial interpretations of the existing collection). This has given a new strand of life to the Museum&apos;s mission to preserve and protect the contemporary and late twentieth century history of the country, including the war of the 1990s and its aftermath. The proposed project will significantly enhance and embed this new aspect of the Museum&apos;s role and life, sustaining employment, developing cultural life and fostering post-conflict peace and security. In doing so, it will address all three of the Additional Requirements for the AHRC for the Impact and Engagement GCRF Highlight Call, as follows: i) it will deliver significant cultural impact and research-led innovation, in line with UN Sustainable Development Goals&apos; (SDG) targets (SDG 4 on culture&apos;s contribution to sustainable development ; SDG 8 on job creation and also creativity and innovation; and SDG 11 on protecting and safeguarding cultural heritage; it might also contingently address SDG 12 on sustainable tourism, creating jobs and promoting local culture); (ii) (ii) it will produce outcomes of significant value to the Museum of Bosnia and Hercegovina, allowing it to  develop its new &apos;living museum&apos; role, fostering the innovative and creative experience of making an open call round of commissions, facilitating further open call commissions and exhibitions, and also a range of complementary initiatives (open studios, participatory and community engagement activities) that will not only benefit the Museum, but also artists, museum audiences and visitors, artists (individually and collectively). and communities in post-conflict Sarajevo and Bosnia and Hercegovina; (iii) the project has been co-designed with Elma Hasimbegovic, Director of the Museum of Bosnia and Hercegovina, a heritage and creative organisation in an ODA LMIC country, which has no public funding because of its status as a national museum.  The Museum and the investigators will jointly implement a scheme of research and practice bringing a research-led fresh perspective. We will initiate a series of open calls with commissions and exhibitions, open studios, artist workshops and participatory-community engagement activities and events in partnership, inviting artists&apos; to innovate and create to bring new interpretations to the museum&apos;s role and collection in relation to the history of the country, potentially to be added to the museum&apos;s collection. This will offer artists and the museum the opportunity and inspiration to make creative interventions, and to enhance the cultural landscape of post-conflict Sarajevo and Bosnia and Hercegovina, fostering engagement with art and memory. The joint project will also permit further research and development of evaluation methods and approaches inherent in the original project, which will also benefit a range of funders, including UNDP, which also advised on project design.</narrative>
