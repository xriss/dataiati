   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Sexual violence is an enduring human rights violation, and its effects are major obstacles to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), particularly SDG5, which concerns gender equality and the empowerment of women. Survivors struggle to access post rape care services and prosecutions are extremely rare, particularly in Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs). The lack of data, and weak statistical and technical capacity, pose major obstacles to sustainable development in LMICs. The proposed secondary data analysis will inform policy makers about barriers to service access and case attrition. The dataset provides urgently needed information about the experiences of adult and child survivors in Nairobi who attempted to access post rape care services from 2016 to present day. The results will enable rape survivors in Kenya to use the insights from the research to advocate for policy change while providing generalisable insights for other LMICs. Our vision is to show, via this project, how secondary data analysis can be creatively used to help Kenya and other countries address the global issue of sexual violence. Our ESRC GCRF IAA grant has prepared us to undertake this research and it culminated in a series of co-developed research objectives and questions. Our objectives are to conduct the secondary data analysis to deliver high-quality impactful data research on the nature of sexual violence, post rape care service gaps, and case attrition patterns, and to study sexual violence health and well-being impacts. Our research questions focus on understanding the nature of sexual violence, the barriers survivors face in accessing post rape care services (medical, police, legal), and the reasons why so few cases are prosecuted. We will also build the capacity of the WKF to update their results as new data are collected. The findings of the secondary data analysis will be discussed with policy makers and other stakeholders. Further, the secondary data analysis project will develop a capacity building research agenda that improves the ability of the Survivors&apos; Network to research and document sexual violence cases. The project will engage and partner with rape survivors&apos; networks in other LMICs to share results and demonstrate the value of secondary data analysis in delivering important insights to effectively prevent and respond to sexual violence, helping to achieve SDG5.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="We propose to undertake a secondary analysis of data held by the Wangu Kanja Foundation (WKF), a 15-year old registered non-profit NGO in Kenya that assists survivors in accessing post rape care services. The dataset provides systematic and high-quality information about victims&apos; experiences in accessing post rape care services (medical, legal, judicial), the nature of sexual violence (victim, offence, perpetrator characteristics, evidence), as well as case attrition. The research we propose may provide generalisable insights about the effective delivery of post rape care services and rape prosecutions in Kenya, and possibly other LMICs.   1. Conduct secondary data analysis to deliver high-quality impactful data research on the nature of sexual violence, victims&apos; access to post rape care services, and case attrition patterns;  2. Analyse pilot data from MobApp (an innovative tool the WKF is implementing to research sexual violence in all 47 counties in Kenya) to study sexual violence health and well-being impacts; 3. Establish an automated system to allow the WKF to update results as new data are collected; 4. Disseminate and discuss the findings with policy makers and other stakeholders; 5. Develop a capacity building research agenda that improves the ability of the Rape Survivors&apos; Network in Kenya to use MobApp to interview sexual violence survivors and document cases across Kenya;  6. Engage and partner with rape survivors&apos; networks in other LMICs to share results and demonstrate the value of secondary data analysis in delivering important insights for tackling Sustainable Development Goal 5 (Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women)."></capital-spend>
