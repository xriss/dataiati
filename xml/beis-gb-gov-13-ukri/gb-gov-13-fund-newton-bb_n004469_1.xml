  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Dr Anyela Camargo, will add her expertise in computer vision, systems biology, statistics and bionformatics to the project. She has been interested in the topic of plant disease monitoring since his time at Corpoica where she developed a tool for monitoring cotton crops. At Liverpool University she developed a system for the early detection of plant disorders. Later she was involved in the modelling of the gene network describing stress responses in Arabidopsis. Now, she is using the Brachypodium distachon plant model to identify genes associated to the resistance to blast rice.  Prof. John Doonan is the director of the National Plant Phenomics Centre, he will add his expertise in genetics and molecular biology to help characterise, from the molecular point of view, the resistance to wheat to tan spot project.  Dr Narcis Fernandez-Fuentes has over 10 years of experience in different aspects of Bioinformatics and has developed a number of databases and web-servers widely used by the scientific community. Dr Fernandez-Fuentes is currently leading the Bioinformatics research within IBERS&apos; C3G ISPG grant program, part of which relates to the discovery of genes linked to a range of traits of interest by combining a range of &apos;omics datasets and developing integrative approaches.  Professor John Draper has worked extensively at the interface between plant biology, analytical spectroscopy and computer science. Internationally he has been a pioneer in the use of metabolomics and machine learning to investigate the early stages of pathogen invasion in non-symptomatic host tissue. He has a long publication record in metabolomics, Brachypodium biology and plant defence.   IBERS, at Aberystwyth University, is a major centre for public sector plant breeding for ryegrasses, forage and oats. IBERS has an in-house high performance computer (HPC) facility, Next Generation Sequencing labs and the UK&apos;s unique National Plant Phenomics Centre. The NPPC is based around automated non-destructive image analysis system running in a purpose-built glasshouse complex. The system is designed to cope with a range of plants, including small and large plants such as oats, wheat, barley, maize and Miscanthus. The NPPC provides a focus for trans-disciplinary research to facilitate the discovery of the genetic and environmental basis for variation in complex traits that underpin the major global. Also within IBERS, the Genome Diversity and Plant Breeding group addresses the major challenge of the sustainable intensification of agriculture: enhancing production whilst reducing environmental impacts, particularly with respect to grassland dominated systems.  Dr Fl&#xE1;vio Santana is a plant pathologist at Embrapa Trigo since 2006. Since then he is working in characterization of tan spot disease isolates from Brazil. He also is responsible as coordinator of a fungicide control of Wheat Blast and Fusarium Head Blight in several States in Brazil. In this Project he will be committed with the phenotyping of a population of resistant and susceptible wheat cultivars to tan spot disease.  Dr Ricardo Lima de Castro has experience in agronomy with emphasis on plant breeding, working mainly in wheat breeding, biometrics and quantitative genetics. In Embrapa Wheat he has been working in wheat breeding. Dr. Lima will identify wheat cultivars resistant and susceptible to the fungus attack deliverable (preparation of a list of cultivars and their genetic background), carry out of the trials to test resistance and help in phenotyping of resistance.  Embrapa Wheat is a branch of the Nacional Agricultural Research Center (Embrapa) where several researchers are directly involved in all area of  agricultural science related to wheat, as plant pathology, entomology, weed control, plant physiology, soil nutrition, of which the main focus is wheat breeding. The facilities are well equipped with greenhouses, fields for trials and research labs.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Title: SRC Embrapa: Using novel computational methods to uncover the genetics of tan spot resistance in wheat  Objetives Tan spot disease, caused by the fungus Drechslera tritici-repentis, affects wheat crops worldwide and is one of them main diseases in Brazil. Under the most severe conditions, tan spot can reduce wheat yields by more than 80%. Currently, pathogen control involves use of agrochemicals which poses a serious threat to the environment and public health as well as increasing production costs. The characterization of the mechanistics pathogen - host interaction, in the context of Drechslera tritici-repentis - wheat, can provide Brazilian scientists and farmers with key information to implement pest management control plans to reduce disease impact. The implementation of early detection of diseases systems combine with the use of naturally resistant varieties and breeding resistant varieties is likely to be highly cost effective in the medium and long term.  Emerging technologies for plant phenotyping, genotyping and modelling can help scientists to accurately identify disease causal organism, estimate the severity of the disease, predict its effect on yield, and possible virulence mechanisms. This project will use these emerging technologies in collaboration with Brazilian scientists to characterise the resistance of wheat crops to Drechslera. AVC and Prof John Draper, Aberystwyth University, have used a computational method to characterise disease resistance in the context of a model, Brachypodium distachon and rice blast disease. The method uses computer vision (CV) to dynamically track and objectively score disease response. We have compared the method against visual disease severity assessment, and both methods coincide in the detection of the QTL associated with disease resistance but the CV method also provides dynamic traits that are difficult or impossible to acquire using subjective methods. Wang et al (2014) characterised the genomic diversity of a polyploid wheat using a high-density 90 000 single nucleotide polymorphism array. The developed array provides the opportunity to infer detailed haplotype structure in polyploid wheat and will serve as an invaluable resource for diversity studies and investigating the genetic basis of trait variation in wheat. Since this is a two stage project, the first part (the pump-primp) will be devoted to tailor a research framework that will be implemented in the second part of the project and whose main goal is to &apos;characterise the resistance of wheat to the pathogen Drechslera&apos;. Therefore, this first stage have the following goals: 1. Review of state-of-art of Tan Spot the Brazil case. Deliv: a short document stating the problem, what has been done and what is needed (Responsible: UK / Brazil) 2. Training 2 Brazilian scientists in CV based phenotyping. Deliv: two scientist fully training in CV phenotyping, they will be able to use their knowledge for the Brazil trial.  3. Run a trial to assess resistance and susceptibility of two selected cultivars (Onix and BRS 194 respectively) to fungal attack using CV phenotyping. Deliv: document reporting results. Data set of descriptors and images (Responsible: Brazil with UK support) 4. Identification of Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats in relation to technology and knowledge. Deliv: a document highlighting the shortcoming and opportunities. (Responsible: UK / Brazil) 5. Identification of key UK and Brazil partners based on point 4. Deliv: detailed list of UK and Brazilian partners, their skills and their involvement in the project. (Responsible: UK / Brazil) 6. Identification of Strengths and Weaknesses in relation to research facilities. Deliv: a document indicating what is available and what is needed. (Responsible: UK / Brazil)  7. Establishment and consolidation of UK / Brazil partnership. Writing of long term research grant based on 1 to 6. Deliverable: drafting and submission of full proposal.</narrative>
