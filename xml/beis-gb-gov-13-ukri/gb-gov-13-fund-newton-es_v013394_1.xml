   <narrative xml:lang="EN">1. General Aim This multidisciplinary project ((PPC-Colombia) aims to co-create a culturally informed conceptual mental health framework to provide sustainable therapeutic interventions grounded in state-level, communal, and individual resources on the basis of the current political and social context in Colombia.   2. Main Research Questions.  PPC-Colombia aims to achieve this aim by answering the following research questions: 1. What are the mental health needs among different groups within and between the local communities? 2. How do social networks and social interactions inform the lay concepts and frameworks related to mental health among the local communities? 3. How do civilians experience these mental health concepts and frameworks in their everyday lives and how do these processes interact with their search for mental health support? 4. How can we tap into communal and individual resources to reconcile local mental health needs with the publicly available resources in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic?   3. Research Framework and Impact Objectives. We plan to achieve the aim of co-creating a culturally informed conceptual mental health framework and to provide a sustainable therapeutic intervention we employ and integrate social psychological (Cakal and Lopez-Lopez), psychosocial (Rubio and Garcia-Padilla), socio-political (McGhee and Abitbol) approaches to understand the mental health challenges that local communities in the Montes de Maria region face. We built upon existing data (National Mental Health Survey NMHS; Colombian Reconciliation Barometer; CRB, Observatory of Memory and Conflict Database, OMCD; Database of Armed Conflict in Colombia, DACC) and create new quantitative (surveys) and qualitative (focus groups and interviews) data to inform and develop our intervention. We will work with the most vulnerable and affected groups, healthcare workers, and policy makers (Local Branch of National Centre for Historical Memory, Colombian Ministry of Health and Sciences). In doing so, we place the social (networks and identities), cultural (underlying norms and values that govern the interactions), and political (individual-state relations) context at the heart of our analysis and aim to deliver a range of social and academic impact to benefit the local communities and the academic community across three work packages.   Work Packages and Deliverables  In work package 1 (WP1 March 2021-February 2022. We identify the mental health needs grounded in the social and cultural context (social networks and interactions) by creating a new publicly available data set that integrates the existing databases (NMHS; CRB, OMCD, and DACC) and we identify the local knowledge and understandings related to the mental health and well-being. We also set up a network of stakeholders (local and indigenous `communities, victim groups, community leaders) and enhance the local capacity by providing training and involving the stakeholders in the research.  In work package 2 (March 2022-February 2023). We co-create, and co-evaluate, a mental health framework that incorporates the social context (social networks and social interactions) by   enhancing communal capacity and creating safe environments to discuss, and share past experiences, individual, and communal resources that facilitate positive coping mechanisms and by empowering the end-users by enhancing their access to information and mental health resources.  In work package 3 (WP3 (March 2023-February 2024) we co-produce and disseminate, with the stakeholders, a set of evidenced based tools (guidelines, posters, leaflets, documentaries) to promote social and political change towards sustainable and equitable access to mental health support. In doing so we also build capacity to enable new research and to replicate similar programmes, nationally and internationally</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Context: For over 50 years Colombia has suffered from one of the most impactful and long enduring violent armed conflicts worldwide. So far, around 8 million people have been displaced (the highest number of internally displaced people (IDP) worldwide. Direct exposure to violence and displacement coupled with inadequate and uneven provision of mental health services have had enormous consequences for mental health nationwide. One of the regions that is most affected by the armed conflict is Montes de Maria that forms part of Sucre and Bolivar administrative divisions. Between 1958-2018, and especially from 1996 till 2006, the regions suffered some of the highest number of mass killings, assassinations, disappearances, and sexual violence cases. During the same time 215,000 people have been displaced. Governmental attempts to improve mental health provisions for the affected populations are generally pharmaceutically based with little attention to the local realities and have recently been critically hampered by renewed armed violence, arrival of Venezuelan refugees, natural disasters, and most recently by COVID-19. As a result, millions of individuals in communities with vulnerable populations (i.e. females, indigenous peoples, rural communities, the displaced) face serious mental health challenges. Given the current conditions imposed by the pandemic there is an urgent need for evidence based approaches that employ the existing knowledge and tap into communal and individual resources to provide context relevant and sustainable mental health support. Project Aims: Thus, our multidisciplinary proposal aims to co-create a conceptual framework to provide sustainable therapeutic interventions grounded in communal and individual resources on the basis of the current political and social context in Colombia by comprehensively analysing existing databases of mental health (NMHS) and conflict (Colombian Reconciliation Barometer, Observatory of Memory and Conflict Database Database of Armed Conflict in Colombia); and integrating community based (socio-therapy)  and social psychological (social networks and social interactions) approaches. Main Objectives: a) establish interdisciplinary (researchers, community partners and state agencies) collaboration to identify the specific mental health needs of the local communities in the Montes de Maria Region in the wake of the current conditions, i.e. forced displacements, immigration, and the pandemic; b) co-create a conceptual framework based in the local processes and one that considers the social, political, and cultural context to support community based interventions; c) pilot a sustainable and context relevant psycho-social intervention to improve and promote mental-health, and social cohesion. Applications and Benefits: The most vulnerable (i.e. females, indigenous peoples, rural communities, the displaced) in the Montes de Maria regions will benefit most directly from this research as they will be involved in the conceptualization, design, and implementation of the proposed project. They will have access to social support sources, will gain valuable information on the specific aspects seeking and obtaining mental health support in the region. The facilitators will benefit from basic training that will enable them to continue to provide support. The local communities will broaden their capacity to support the IDPs in the region. Finally, the research assistants and early career researchers will also benefit as they will gain valuable experience in conceptualization and implementation of interdisciplinary research and extend their research network. The conceptual framework we will develop is likely to be adapted to address similar challenges that the vulnerable communities face elsewhere.</narrative>
