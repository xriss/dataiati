   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Ordos region has a population of about 80 million, of whom approximately half live within large cities, which have grown rapidly and recently around the nuclei of much smaller cities that are known to have been destroyed by earthquakes in the historical past. The remainder of the population is rural, and live in highly vulnerable buildings. The region has suffered three of the most deadly earthquakes in recorded history; the 1556 Huaxian earthquake was responsible for the deaths of over 800,000 people, and other historical earthquakes are known to have killed over 100,000 people. This project aims to make a significant improvement in the assessment of seismic hazard in the region, and is particularly timely because the study area covers the most populous part of the Chinese end of the Silk Road Economic Belt, a planned investment of hundreds of billions of dollars that will transform communications, transport and trade across Eurasia.   This population is particularly vulnerable because there are two fundamental gaps in earthquake-risk reduction in Mainland China First, there is a gap between scientific understanding of the risks and hazards, and the knowledge that communities need in order to design effective practices of governance. The second gap is between the top-down and bottom-up approaches to the governance of disaster risk reduction (DRR).   This project brings together teams from the China Earthquake Administration (CEA), the Overseas Development Institute (ODI), and the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge to carry out research and practical action to bridge these gaps. Our work will be rooted in the two-thousand-year historical record of earthquakes in the region, which allows us to investigate a suite of methods for bridging these gaps. In this work, we shall collaborate closely with researchers, policymakers and operational agencies at local, provincial, national and international level, and shall work with them to integrate local (bottom-up) and national (top-down) approaches to earthquake DRR.  We shall use tools of modern tectonic geology to estimate probable sizes of the historical earthquakes of the region. Then we shall calculate ground shaking if such an earthquake were to recur. We shall make loss estimates using both the CEA&apos;s database of vulnerability and that of the US Geological Survey&apos;s PAGER (Prompt Assessment of Global Earthquakes for Response) project. These estimates will form the basis of engagement between the scientist and policy makers at the county scale and upwards, where legislation and practice are top-down.  At the same time, working in partnership with local communities, village, town, and county officials, and staff of local NGOs, we shall explore the social roots of earthquake disaster risk by focussed studies on small sites within the region. We shall partner with Geohazards International (GHI) to produce a detailed scenario based on a historical earthquake. Such scenarios have been shown to stimulate communities to generate their own mitigation strategies for earthquake risk, and we shall use this technique as the basis for developing, testing, and evaluating participatory approaches to assessing earthquake vulnerability and risk from the bottom up in China. Finally, with the provincial and national partners we shall explore routes to link these with top-down laws regulations and procedures to establish improved, long-term, earthquake disaster risk reduction.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="(1) To use modern techniques of remote sensing, geomorphology, and seismology to update the historical record of earthquakes in Mainland China. (2) To use this information to carry out county-scale evaluation of the building-focused losses that would be incurred in the modern setting if historical earthquakes were to recur. This analysis will be complementary to the CEA&apos;s existing probabilistic analysis of seismic hazard, and will allow us to initiate discussions with the higher levels of DRR management in Mainland China. (3) To use our findings on the historical record to investigate, through a pan-participatory engagement with targeted communities within the region, how seismic vulnerabilities and disaster risks are shaped by history, culture, socio-economic contexts, and physical surroundings. (4) To create scenarios, using scientific and context-specific findings that show the expected impact of a hypothetical-but-probable earthquake on the targeted communities: harm to people, and damage to buildings, infrastructure, lifelines, and communications. Scenarios will be used to educate the public and policymakers about local earthquake disaster risk, to motivate action, and to engage stakeholders in DRR planning and policymaking.  (5) To develop and evaluate strategies for the integration of top-down with bottom-up policies for increasing society&apos;s overall resilience to earthquake disaster. (6) To provide a lasting legacy by developing guides to participatory assessment and integrated governance of seismic risks. We shall also feed our findings into provincial and national long-term earthquake DRR plans, laws and regulations.  The outcomes of this research will be co-published in the peer-reviewed literature. More importantly, we shall produce immediately practical/applicable products for use through both top-down and bottom-up routes. Examples include Multi-yearly Key Disaster-risk Area maps, materials/publications for area-specific disaster education, context-based disaster preparedness and emergency response plans, guides to participatory assessments of seismic vulnerability and disaster risks, etc."></capital-spend>
