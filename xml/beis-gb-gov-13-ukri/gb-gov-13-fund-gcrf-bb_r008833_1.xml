  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The aim of this project is to develop safe and effective vaccines against capripoxvirus disease.  The Capripoxvirus genus (CPPV) consists of three species of poxvirus - Lumpy skin disease virus (LSDV), Sheeppox virus (SPPV) and Goatpox virus (GTPV). All three viruses cause severe systemic disease in their ruminant host species and substantial economic loss to farmers and rural communities. The three CPPV species are steadily enlarging their geographic niches, especially LSDV which has recently spread from Africa into the Middle East, Europe, Russia and Asia. There is a need for improved CPPV vaccines in order to control the spread of these diseases. This proposal describes construction of novel molecularly engineered LSD vaccines which are safe and reliable.   Previously published work and preliminary data from Pirbright has enabled the investigators to identify four CPPV genes which are likely to influence the virulence of these viruses (&quot;virulence factors&quot;). These four genes will be targeted in this project.  Objectives:  1. Develop a CRISPR/Cas9-based genome modification technique for CPPV A central obstacle to progress in the CPPV field is the difficulty in manipulating the viral genome. Currently available methods are considerably more laborious for CPPV when compared to other poxvirus species such as Vaccinia virus. This objective will adapt CRISPR/Cas9 technology for genetic engineering of CPPV. The increased efficiency of recombination will make molecular engineering of CPPV species much quicker and easier. Output: Protocol for mutagenising CPPV using CRISPR/Cas methodology  2. Construct LSDV strains with targeted modifications in putative virulence genes. The CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis method will be used to delete four putative virulence factors from wildtype LSDV: LSDV136 a likely member of the Bcl-2-like poxvirus family; LSDV009 a suspected IRF3 inhibitor; LSDV013 the orthologue of the poxvirus soluble interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptor; LSDV008 the orthologue of the poxvirus-encoded IFN-gamma receptor. A &quot;repaired&quot; virus will be made for each mutant in order to control for spontaneous mutations. Output: Construction of LSDV strains with targeted deletion of suspected virulence factors, plus repaired control viruses  3. Characterise the function of putative virulence genes of LSDV in vitro Recombinant protein expression systems will be used to investigate the mechanism of function of the four targeted LSDV virulence factors. For example, the ability of protein LSDV008 to bind its predicted ligand, bovine IFN-gamma, will be determined using surface plasmon resonance. Output: Understanding of the function of four LSDV putative virulence factors  4. Characterise mutated LSDV strains in vitro The findings of objective 3 will be built upon by investigating the function of each virulence factor in the context of viral infection, using the four mutated LSDV strains produced in objective 2, each lacking a putative virulence factor. For example the expression of genes under IRF3-responsive promoters will be studied in cells infected with the LSDV009 mutant and compared to controls. Output: Characterisation of four mutant LSDV strains.  5. Determine the impact of single gene deletions on LSDV virulence and immune response Based on the outputs of objectives 3 and 4, selected mutated LSDV strains will be taken forward for assessment of virulence using an experimental bovine model of LSD. This work will take place in the Pirbright high containment animal facilities. Output: Assessment of the virulence of up to four mutated LSDV strains each lacking a suspected virulence factor  6. Assessment of mutated LSDV strains as novel live-attenuated LSD vaccines Novel rationally-designed live-attenuated LSDV strains will be examined for their ability to provide protection against subsequent challenge with LSDV.  Output: Assessment of the efficacy of two rationally-designed LSDV live attenuated vaccines</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The poxvirus genus Capripoxvirus (CPPV) contains three viral species which each cause high consequence, transboundary disease in ruminants. Research into CPPVs is very timely as the three species are spreading from their traditional geographic ranges into new regions. In particular LSDV has spread since 2011 throughout Eastern Mediterranean and Western Asian countries into Turkey (2013) and in August 2015 entered Europe (Greece) for the first time. It is now present throughout the Balkans, Caucasus and south-eastern Russia and threatens other European and Asian countries. Despite their importance there has been little progress in the last 30 years in improving CPPV vaccines. The newest types of poxvirus vaccines currently being developed in human medicine, such as NYVAC, are genetically engineered. In brief, comparative analyses of viral genomes are used to identify specific target regions of DNA for manipulation in order to produce a safe and effective &quot;live&quot; vaccine. In contrast all currently available CPPV vaccines are randomly mutated and some contain a mix of viruses of variable genotypes and virulence. There have been reports from the field of poor efficacy and safety of these randomly mutated vaccines, indicating the need for better CPPV vaccines. This project will follow the approach used in human medicine to develop safer and more reliable genetically engineered CPPV vaccines.   Full genome sequencing of wildtype and attenuated strains of CPPV by Pirbright researchers and others has enabled bioinformatic analysis of these strains to identify CPPV genes which associate with virulence. We have additionally identified orthologues of known virulence factors of other poxvirus genera and combined the datasets to single out four putative virulence factors of CPPV, genes most likely to encode proteins which contribute to CPPV virulence. Deletion of these genes is likely to result in attenuated CPPV strains.  The initial work (objective 1) will develop CRISPR/Cas9 technology to overcome difficulties in manipulating the CPPV genome. Following on from this, the four putative CPPV virulence factors will be mutated in a wildtype strain of LSDV. The function of the virulence factors will be assessed in isolation (objective 3) and in the context of a viral infection (objective 4). The data will then be assessed. Each mutant strain that (i) replicates to normal or near normal levels in cell culture, and (ii) is supported by evidence of a function consistent with a role as a virulence factor from the in vitro studies in objectives 3 and 4, will be taken forward into animal trials to experimentally measure the influence of the protein on viral virulence (objective 5). Cattle will be infected with a mutant, wildtype or repaired LSDV strain and physiological, behavioural, virological and immunological measurements taken over the following 28 days to assess the severity of the resultant disease. In the final study of the project (objective 6) the data from objectives 3, 4 and 5 will be used to design two mutated LSDV strains which will be assessed as live-attenuated vaccines in a challenge model of LSD. The hypothesis is that the targeted mutation/s will substantially reduce the ability of the virus to cause disease, while retaining strong poxviral immunogenicity.  The main outputs of this project will be (a) identification of virulence factors encoded by LSDV, (b) an improved method for genetically manipulating CPPVs, and (c) rationally designed, genetically engineered vaccines to prevent LSD.</narrative>
