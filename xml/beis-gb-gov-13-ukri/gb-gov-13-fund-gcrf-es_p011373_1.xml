   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The world is moving into an unprecedented era of dam-building with more than 3700 large dams currently planned or under construction, much of which are in DAC list countries. These projects have the potential to contribute significantly to the economic and social changes that underpin global Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). However, past experiences show that poorly designed and planned dam projects conversely may have large negative impacts on the poor, and exacerbate political instability and environmental degradation. This proposal seeks to create the knowledge base, capacity and capability for a &apos;Dams 2.0&apos;  future, in which dams built in DAC list countries are selected, designed and operated to support resilient and sustainable national, regional and global development in a 2.0 degC world. This will be achieved by understanding and assessing dams as interdependent human-nexus (water-energy-food-environment) system interventions and enabling stakeholders to negotiate economic, social, political and ecological impacts despite future uncertainty.  Our proposal will address this ambitious goal through unique cross- and inter-disciplinary research and capacity development partnerships between three sets of key actors. First, our project will stimulate collaboration between several UK centres of research excellence in development, water-energy engineering, economics, food security, climate change, finance and ecology (the universities of Manchester (UM), Cambridge, University College London (UCL), Surrey, Newcastle and Southampton, the International Institute for Environment and Development (IIED), and the International Water Management Institute (IWMI). Second, we will consolidate links with a carefully selected network of researchers and policy-makers in 4 countries/regions (The Centre for Science and Industrial (CSIR) - Water in Ghana, Technological University of Yangon in Myanmar, Jordanian Institute of Science and Technology in the Middle East region, Institute of Economic Growth in Delhi, India). Thirdly, we will seek to work collaboratively with some of the world&apos;s most influential development organisations such as The World Bank (WB), International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN), the International Finance Corporation (IFC), The Nature Conservancy (TNC), the International Hydropower Association (IHA), and the Climate Bond Initiative (CBI).  Dams 2.0 is led by a team with a proven track record in successfully managing large consortium grants across multiple countries and disciplines that focus on applied development and policy impact challenges. Our work will provide tailored guidance and build capacity for water-energy-food systems management in each of our case studies regions. In addition, our project will create a framework and accompanying software toolkit for dam system design and training worldwide. This online software will link several open access water, energy, food, and ecological simulation models to state-of-the-art decision-making under uncertainty approaches. This software will be made accessible via an associated suite of online training materials (games &amp; modules we plan to develop with IWMI and the World Bank) for use by dam selection/design/operation teams globally in a range of settings.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="Our aim is of a world in which all DAC list countries make rapid progress to the achievement of the SDGs and the delivery of emissions reductions necessary for the Paris Climate Change Agreement by selecting, designing, financing, and managing dams to meet local, national and regional development needs and preferences.   To fulfil this aim we set the following objective: to transform how new dams and systems of new and existing dams are assessed, selected, designed, and operated to provide water, food, and energy security for all. This goal will be achieved through both research (the creation of new knowledge) and capacity development (raised capacities of partner and non-partner organisations), underpinned by development of shared interdisciplinary tools that integrate engineering (on system modelling, dam selection, design and operation), social sciences (on economic, social and political and processes and impacts), physical sciences (climate, hydrology, ecology) and agricultural sciences (crop production systems).  Our specific objectives are: 1 To deepen understanding of how nexus system interventions (new dams, or systems of dams, and their operation) cascade through socio-economic, engineered, ecological and political systems, and use this knowledge to help stakeholders develop and negotiate solutions that are economically, socially and environmentally beneficial. Specifically, we will replace the current approach of designing dams in isolation with a whole systems-based approach that combines conceptual and numerical models of socio-economic/natural/engineered systems with novel decision-analysis techniques. 2 To enhance the technical and institutional capacity of partner and non-partner researchers and policy-makers to ensure that dam decision-making leads to economically, socially, and environmentally desirable outcomes. Specifically, we seek to move from &apos;cut and paste&apos; &apos;Terms of Reference&apos; documents (ToRs) when dam-building projects are put out to tender to ToRs crafted to achieve development outcomes that are sustainable and equitable. 3 To create a cross-disciplinary network of researchers and policy-influencers and inter-disciplinary tools for dam decision-making globally, which will continue to operate after programme completion and that can transfer learning to the &apos;next generation&apos; of nexus system planners world-wide.  Reaching those specific objectives will be done so as to be able to satisfactorily respond to the following urgent questions which are the heart of our Nexus system research agenda on dams: 1 What&apos;s happening now? Who is selecting, designing, and financing dams and systems of dams today;  what approaches and tools do they use; and, what shapes and incentivises decisions about dam selection and operation? 2 What should be improved? What technical and political knowledge is required so that new dams can be selected and designed to maximise and appropriately allocate benefits, promote resilient and sustainable development, and minimise conflict and socio-ecological loss; what decision processes need improving; and, should a wider set of stakeholders be invited into the decision process? 3 How? What skills, approaches, processes, tools and academic/professional networks would help create a new generation of engineers, applied social scientists and policy analysts in the UK, in cases study countries and in other countries to achieve our mission?"></capital-spend>
