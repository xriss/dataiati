   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Developing low-cost cognitive tools for dementia assessment in low-to-middle income countries (LMICs)</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Digital technology means it is now possible to develop and validate low-cost, highly sensitive cognitive tools able to be used on- and off-line (e.g., web, tablet &amp; smartphone) for dementia assessment.  These new tools are likely to be particularly available in low-to-middle income countries (LMICs) where access to more sophisticated diagnostic research infrastructure is limited. Working in partnership with researchers from Ireland, the US, Cuba and China, under the framework of the recently launched Global Brain Health Institute, the proposed Foundation Award will support expansion of our user-friendly, cognitive assessment platform (Cardiff Web Tools for Cognitive Health, CWTCH), comparison with other cognitive platforms (e.g., TabCAT, from University of California, San Francisco) and piloting of new dementia-sensitive tablet-enabled tasks in two geographically-distinct LMICs (Cuba/China). The project focuses on three objectives, aligned to distinct research phases: 1. Transferring lab-based cognitive paradigms sensitive to different dementias into digital applications able to be used via web, tablet and mobile devices (whilst building understanding of LMICs demographics, technical capability and patient base to help refine technology development). [0-9 months] 2. Testing task use and sensitivity in controls and well-phenotyped patients from HICs, enabling cross-validation and generation of algorithms indicative of dementia type. [9-15 months] 3. Applying the tool in healthy older and cognitively-impaired LMIC participants to study sensitivity to dementia, and develop subsequent research/impact needs to sustain this approach in LMICs in the longer-term  [15-24 months] This project will establish a unique global consortium working to enhance cognitive assessment tools sensitive to dementia. It will enable pilot data collection in LMICs aligned to a significant public health need, providing feasibility data for further funding focused on development of a common assessment platform able to be used across countries, cultures and languages.  Research training and knowledge exchange will be enabled by funding of positions in LMICs aligned to this project, as well as support of linked activities via Global Brain Health Institute (which aims to implement new public health interventions to reduce dementia burden in LMICs).</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In 2013, there were 44.4 million people with dementia worldwide. By 2030, this number will likely increase to 75.6 million, and by 2050 to 135.5 million. A new case of dementia is diagnosed somewhere in the world every 4 seconds. Not surprisingly, the costs of this public health challenge are substantial (US$604 billion in 2010, 1% of total global GDP).  Notably, 58% of individuals experiencing dementia are thought to live in low-to-middle-income countries (LMICs), underlining the high impact of dementia in those regions, where - relative to high income countries (HICs) - understanding of dementia is low, health and social care less well developed, and social exclusion high. By 2050, it is estimated that 71% of individuals with dementia worldwide will be living in LMICs; the social and financial burden of dementia, therefore, is increasingly being felt in countries with limited health infrastructure and support for affected individuals. Compounding this problem, less than 10% of individuals in LMICs receive a dementia diagnosis, or tailored medical guidance to help them and their families understand how the particular form of dementia they are experiencing may impact on their daily living.  These issues additionally limit involvement of LMICs in global clinical trials where new drug therapies may be subsidized, and supportive care provided. Rapid action is needed if these problems are to be addressed. In particular, there is an urgent need for effective, low-cost cognitive assessment approaches which can aid diagnosis and be used in geographically- and culturally-diverse areas of the world.  When complemented by provision of information about different forms of dementia, this can help families and healthcare professionals implement appropriate and tailored care for patients, and identify individuals who can be included in global clinical trials.  To address this problem, the Foundation Award focuses on the development of new digital cognitive testing platforms, able to be provided in LMICs via tablets and smartphones.  We will work with collaborators from other HIC and LMICs across the globe also interested in advancing cognitive assessment in LMICs, ensuring a bidirectional partnership with the needs of LMICs foremost. The development and pilot work to be undertaken as part of this project will underpin further grant applications focused on development of a common cognitive assessment platform able to be applied to enhance assessment and interventional approaches focused on reducing the significant worldwide burden of dementia.</narrative>
