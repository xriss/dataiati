   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Strengthening health system delivery and quality: Mechanisms and Effects of Performance Based Financing in the Sub-Saharan context</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Health care providers can be paid in a variety of ways. They can be given an annual budget for agreeing to provide a service or be paid on the basis of the size of the population covered. Payment according to achievement of specific standards or patient outcomes has been widely applied in the health sector.  Such schemes are called Performance Based Financing. These schemes aim to focus health workers and their managers on specific outcomes and to change the way they behave to improve the quality of health care services and population health. Over 40 low and middle-income countries are currently implementing performance based financing schemes in the health sector. However, to date the focus of researchers and practitioners has been mainly on assessing the short term impact of performance based financing schemes on the performance targets. We understand little about how performance based financing affects health workers and the organisations they work in and how this translates into improvements in service delivery and health outcomes. We also do not know if the effects are sustained over time. The design of performance based financing schemes also varies from place to place and we have limited understanding of the factors that influence this variation nor how this affects the way performance based financing is implemented and its subsequent results. Most evaluations collect data specifically for each project, which limits the range of health outcomes that are considered and makes it difficult to compare across studies.  This research project will engage stakeholders involved in running performance based financing schemes and evaluating them in two countries: Mozambique and Zimbabwe. We will work together to clarify how performance based financing has been conceptualised and implemented in each setting. We will also identify how performance based financing is expected to affect health workers and their work environment to bring about better care, and what elements of performance based financing are most critical.  We will use national level data on health system inputs to examine the effects of performance based financing on the health system over time. We will use data from household Demographic and Health Surveys to examine the effects on health outcomes and on the delivery of services that were not targeted by performance based financing. Finally we will seek to understand how performance based financing brings about changes to service delivery by identifying how and which changes in health system inputs are related to improvements in care delivery. We will also examine how the effects of performance based financing vary according to population and health facility characteristics. Performance based financing is sometimes accompanied by separate efforts to increase access to care and we will examine if this matters. Finally, we will look across the two countries to examine if the way in which the performance based financing scheme is designed affects the results.  The project will support knowledge sharing and learning across institutions in the United Kingdom, Mozambique, Zimbabwe and the wider Sub-Saharan African region.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project aims to understand to what extent incentive payments to health care providers, known as performance based financing (PBF), contribute to improved service delivery and health outcomes through health system strengthening in Sub-Saharan settings. Specific attention will be given to understanding how PBF works in low and middle income countries (LMICs) over time, by extending evaluations of PBF schemes in Mozambique and Zimbabwe, and exploring the contextual factors that shape this.  The research has six specific objectives. First, we will develop a theory of change in each country. This will identify the potential pathways through which PBF achieves improvements in targeted service delivery through health system level change along with potential unintended consequences.   We will also explore how PBF scheme design and implementation was influenced by the country context.  Second, we will evaluate the impact of PBF on health system inputs (governance, health workforce, medical commodities, financing) in each of the countries. Third, we will evaluate the impact of PBF on service delivery and health outcomes, differentiating between short and longer term effects where possible. Fourth, we will identify the specific causal pathway through which PBF results in eventual service delivery and health outcome effects, by determining the critical changes in health system inputs, and the extent to which these mediate PBF outcomes. Fifth, we will evaluate whether PBF effects on health system inputs, service delivery and health outcomes differ according to:  - Performance based financing scheme design variation within and across countries; - Country specific health systems characteristics and reforms  - Facility performance at baseline and service readiness - Population  characteristics  - Population exposure to concurrent demand-side interventions to increase access to services. - Concurrent or complementary interventions to extend and improve service delivery  Sixth, we will develop an analytical framework to make stronger conceptual links between PBF design, its effects on health system inputs and service delivery and health outcomes for country level use and for use in other low and middle income countries.  This research project will inform methodological debates on how to evaluate complex health systems interventions, and support better evaluations of performance based financing and health systems reforms in other countries. The project will also support knowledge exchange across institutions, establish the foundation for ongoing collaboration and strengthen national capacity for health system research.</narrative>
