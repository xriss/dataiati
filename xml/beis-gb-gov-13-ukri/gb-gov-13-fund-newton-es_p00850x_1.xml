   <narrative xml:lang="EN">NewtonRCUK-CONACYT Co-constructing Security Provision in Mexico: A Methodology and Action Plan from Communities to the State</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This research project aims to: 1. Build  a new approach to security provision in Mexico as an &apos;effective and equitable public good&apos; through a methodology of co-construction of security agendas/action plans from the &apos;ground up&apos;. 2. Co-construct new thinking through research and action methodologies which bring together community and civil society actors with state actors in four case study localities, selected for a range of variations in violence, criminality as well as socio economic context and political responses to insecurity in contemporary Mexico. 3.Contribute to the welfare of Mexico and Mexicans by showing new pathways to security thinking and practice but also by exploring the extent to which the security crisis in Mexico is also a development crisis, of human and  economic development. Most of the communities where we will work have high levels of poverty, social exclusion and unemployment. In the course of the research, the relative weight of these factors will be analysed with participants alongside the role of drug trafficking and other illegal economic activities, political corruption and social histories of violence. The research will generate debate on why security cannot be treated as separated from wider social and economic issues and how new approaches to security might benefit all Mexicans. 4.Improve diagnostic capacity of the problem of insecurity with key actors affected by it, from direct victims to civil society actors and organisations attempting to address the problem, to state actors increasingly preoccupied by the loss of trust amongst citizens in the responses they offer. 5.Build practical and feasible strategies for addressing insecurity and violence, what we call &apos;Local Security Agendas&apos;. The aim is not to aggregate these local security agendas co-constructed in each of the four case study locations, but to use them to argue that it is possible to build a new kind of local security &apos;consciousness&apos; in Mexico. This can both offer an improved understanding of the effects of violence but also positive agendas for how security might be offered as a public good which is equitably available to all citizens, effectively implemented and subject to their informed monitoring. In this way, the project will also ensure that chronic violence and insecurity does not undermine democracy and the rule of law. 6.Promote and support through the UK academic collaboration, a greater commitment to the study of security and violence in Mexican academic institutions. 7. Foster academic and policy debates around security in the global South based on this project&apos;s findings  and show how co-constructing security agendas from the ground up might improve public security provision for all citizens, in particular the most vulnerable populations who often live in areas most affected by chronic violence and insecurity.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">With more than 175, 000 lives lost between 2006 and 2014, 26,000 people disappeared, and the proliferation of ever more visible and brutal expressions of violence, Mexico&apos;s security has experienced a dramatic deterioration over the last decade. Violence and security are key dimensions of economic development and social welfare. An emerging economy with strong global potential, Mexico&apos;s current security crisis has exposed the weaknesses of state security responses with serious implications for investment, employment and poverty reduction. Trust in the state&apos;s security provision is very low, and this encourages vigilante justice, dependence on private security amongst those with resources to pay for it and also generates the impunity which further fuels violence and criminality.  Local economies have succumbed to criminal actors, and a range of drug trafficking organisations have expanded and mutated their illegal activities. Extortion as well as threats of violence blight the lives of thousands of citizens. Many Mexican community, civil and state actors are searching for new options to reduce violence and criminality. This research and action project will develop and test methodologies for co- constructing security provision with these actors in four carefully selected case studies locations: Tijuana, Apatzingan, Acapulco and Guadalupe. It will work with community, civil society and state actors to both better diagnose the security threats they face but most importantly to build shared understandings of security as an effective and equitable public good in their localities. It will encourage understanding of the differential impacts of violence, insecurity and security provision according to income, gender, ethnicity and other social factors. It will use &apos;local security agendas&apos; constructed from the ground up, to influence the national security approaches in Mexico and beyond. Finally, It will use the research to contribute to wider debates in the global South around security, violence and development.</narrative>
