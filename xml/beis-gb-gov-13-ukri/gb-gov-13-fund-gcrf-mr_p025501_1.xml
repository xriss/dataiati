   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Since the year 2000, controlling mosquitoes with insecticide-based interventions has led to a 37% reduction in malaria mortality globally. Nevertheless, malaria still caused 438 000 deaths in 2015, and further progress is being threatened by increasing levels of insecticide resistance in mosquito vectors. The global malaria community urgently needs new tools to monitor mosquito vector populations. Several aspects of mosquito demography and physiology are particularly crucial for planning and assessing vector control strategies.  Prime amongst these are determination of mosquito vector species and age structure.  Accurate species identification is required to confirm what vectors are responsible for transmission.  Mosquito age is a critical determinant of their transmission potential.  This is because the malaria parasite undergo a period of development within the vector before they become transmissible.  Additionally, measurement of insecticide resistance status is essential to assess how effectively vectors could be targeted by current frontline control methods such as Insecticide Treated Nets (ITNs) and spraying. Unfortunately, no methods are currently available  for rapid, large-scale and simultaneous measurement of these crucial mosquito vector demographic and physiological traits. This proposal aims to fill that gap by developing and validating a novel technology for high throughput, high precision surveillance of malaria vector populations in LMICs.   This project aims to develop such a tool for malaria vectors on the basis on strong existing partnerships with leading African malaria researchers, and world-class physical chemists and vector biologists in the UK.   Specifically, the technology is based on the measurement of molecular signature of the mosquito cuticle, which is the outer part of the insects, to predict key traits (species, age and insecticide resistance). Indeed, the composition and structure of the mosquito cuticle, similar to the mammalian skin, changes when the organism ages, it is different in different species, and it is altered in mosquitoes that are resistant to insecticides. Here, we propose to characterize the cuticular changes associated with the traits mentioned above to then make predictions on individual mosquitoes of unknown conditions. The proposed technology is rapid and cost effective as it is based on the measurement of the light absorbed by mosquitoes, a procedure that do not require any sample preparation nor chemical reagents, and it is readily performed in few seconds by a spectrophotometer. The spectra - corresponding to the light absorbed by individual mosquitoes - will be analysed by powerful computational analysis which will enable to estimate the mosquito traits.  We will follow a two-stage process starting with laboratory evaluation of mosquitoes at the University of Glasgow to build on our compelling pilot work on the use of Mid Infrared Spectroscopy (MIRS) coupled with artificial neural network (ANN).  After further optimization and methods development, we will transfer this technology to two of Africa&apos;s leading malaria vector research and control institutes where it will undergo further evaluation and application within a diverse range of mosquito vector populations.  We envision this will form the first steps of a pathway along which this technology can be transferred to LMICs for integration into a range of mosquito surveillance applications including programmes to eliminate malaria, and control of other mosquito-borne pathogens such as Zika and Dengue where effective solutions are desperately needed.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="The main goal of this proposal is to develop a quick, easy-to-use and cost effective tool based on mid-infrared spectroscopy analysis to simultaneously determine species, age, and insecticide resistance status of malaria mosquitoes to facilitate large scale surveillance of mosquito vector populations and their disease transmission potential.  To achieve this, we will first develop this tool using mosquitoes under laboratory conditions and further optimize and evaluate the technology in the field in collaboration with two of Africa&apos;s leading centers of excellence for mosquito control research.  In combination, this programme will allow evaluation of the potential of this tool to be used for:  1 - Determination of the species and age of the three major African malaria vector species  - to be completed in Year 1 2 - Assessment of the insecticide resistance status of major Africa malaria vectors (Aim 2) - to be completed in Year 2  This tool would be transformative for entomological surveys, enabling critically important insights to assist the control of malaria vectors and the fight against this disease.  Furthermore, the project will enable knowledge exchange and capacity building in LMICs by facilitating technology transfer and training at the Ifakara Health Institute in Tanzania,  and the Institut de Recherche en Sciences de la Sant&#xE9; in Burkina Faso.  These institutes are at the forefront of new mosquito control development and implementation in Africa.  The partnership created through this project will enable us to transfer a highly promising mosquito surveillance tool directly into the hands of those who will be leading malaria elimination programmes both within and beyond Africa."></capital-spend>
