   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project involves Rothamsted Research, University of Nottingham, and Embrapa Trigo. Between them the teams have expertise in the genetic control of abiotic stress tolerance, developmental genetics of flower formation, and metabolic signalling systems. They bring a range of complementary techniques, from systems biology and bioinformatics through genetics and physiology to wheat transformation. All three institutions are well-equipped, with facilities for all aspects of the study in place. The aim is to study the response of UK and Brazilian wheat to temperature stress between booting and flowering using molecular, whole-plant and transgenic approaches.  UK team: Prof. Nigel Halford, RRes: Expertise in the genetics of metabolic regulation in crop plants and how metabolism is affected by abiotic stress, using techniques ranging from mathematical modelling of metabolic networks through molecular and biochemical analyses of signalling factors to RNAseq and GC-MS analyses. Visited Embrapa Trigo in 2013. Dr Matthew Paul, RRes: Expertise in trehalose 6-phosphate signalling, the role of sugar signalling in responses to abiotic stresses, and manipulation to improve yield under stress conditions. Uses a range of molecular and physiological techniques, as well as innovative chemistry.   Prof Huw Jones, RRes: Leads wheat transformation at RRes, exploiting gene up-regulation, RNAi silencing and genome editing and validating 30 different gene promoters. Participated in the BBSRC/Embrapa workshop on wheat improvement in 2011 and will deliver a plenary lecture in the XV Brazilian Congress of Plant Physiology in 2015. Has experience of GMO risk assessment and GM field management. Professor Zoe Wilson, University of Nottingham: Expertise in plant developmental genetics, specifically the regulation of pollen and anther development. Current research involves the translation of pollen gene networks from models to wheat and barley, and temperature stress during pollen development in Arabidopsis, wheat and crops such as Bambara Ground Nut, which show tolerance to extreme temperatures. Prof John Foulkes, University of Nottingham: Expertise in the traits determining stress tolerance in wheat. Current research includes the development of high-throughput remote sensing phenotyping, the physiological and genetic basis of ear fertility and the identification of novel genes controlling tillering, spikelet primordia number and floret fertility. Visited Embrapa Trigo in 2013.  Brazil team:  Dr Edina Moresco. Embrapa Trigo: Expertise in wheat breeding, specifically quantitative genetics, classical breeding techniques, G x E and plant/pathogen interactions, with a focus on evaluation and selection of plants for abiotic stress tolerance.  Dr Antonio Nhani Jr, Embrapa Trigo: Expertise in bioinformatics applied to the identification of molecular markers and the analysis of wheat transcriptome data related to biotic and abiotic stresses. Dr Elene Yamazaki Lau: Expertise in molecular biology and biotechnology; currently developing A. tumefaciens-mediated genetic transformation protocols for wheat in order to generate lines with increased tolerance to abiotic stresses, including heat.  Dr Jorge Fernando Pereira: Expertise in the molecular basis of abiotic stress responses in wheat and barley; also has interests in developing wheat and barley transformation techniques.  Dr Luciano Consoli: Expertise in molecular genetics and wheat pre-breeding; investigating abiotic stress responses and pre-harvest sprouting using association genetics and QTL studies. Dr Mauro Cesar Celaro Teixeira: Expertise in the mechanisms underpinning stress tolerance and yield potential of wheat cultivars in harsh environments. Dr Osmar Rodrigues: Expertise in plant physiology; currently studying the physiological bases for yield formation and grain set on wheat during the winter growing season in the Southern part of Brazil.

  <capital-spend percentage="Wheat is particularly sensitive to environmental stress during booting and at anthesis, and extreme temperatures at these times may cause dramatic reductions in grain set.  This project will address the holistic effects of temperature stress on wheat and provide tools and germplasm to overcome its damaging effects. It is a collaboration between teams at Rothamsted Research, the University of Nottingham, and Embrapa Trigo (Embrapa wheat) in Passo Fundo, Southern Brazil.  Between them the teams have expertise in the genetic control of abiotic stress tolerance, the developmental genetics of flower formation, and the signalling systems responsible for metabolic regulation. They also bring a range of complementary techniques, from systems biology and bioinformatics through to molecular and classical genetics and plant physiology, and wheat transformation.  The aim of the pump-priming exercise is to enable the consortium to meet to discuss and refine the following objectives for a full application:  1. Screen Brazilian wheat genotypes for frost tolerance (southern Brazil-adapted genotypes) and heat tolerance (central Brazil-adapted genotypes).  2. Measure effects of frost and heat on floret fertility, grain set and grain-filling in temperature stress-tolerant and -sensitive genotypes. Relate sensitivity and tolerance to whole-plant characteristics such as ear morphology and rooting characteristics.    3. Analyse ABA and metabolic signalling networks in wheat between booting and anthesis, using publicly available transcriptomic (RNAseq) and metabolomic data.   4. Design genetic interventions to improve resilience to extreme temperature, exploiting the broad expertise and knowledge within the consortium to the full.  Produce new genotypes by genetic modification or genome editing.   5. Compare and contrast the responses to extreme heat and cold between booting and anthesis in genotypes adapted to the UK and Brazil, and in the genetically improved lines, using a range of molecular, biochemical and analytical techniques, in both glasshouse and field conditions, in order to improve our knowledge of the mechanisms involved and the key factors that determine resilience to extreme temperature stress.    Project deliverables:  Identification of frost- and heat-tolerant tolerant genotypes for inclusion in breeding programmes (Objective 1)  Association of temperature stress tolerance with whole-plant characteristics (Objective 2)  Definition of the role of ABA and metabolic signalling factors in the onset of male sterility in temperature-stressed wheat (Objective 3)  Production of novel genotypes with improved temperature stress tolerance (Objective 4)  Improved knowledge of the mechanisms and key factors that determine resilience to extreme temperature stress (Objective 5)  Background and hypotheses for the project are given in the Case for Support"></capital-spend>
