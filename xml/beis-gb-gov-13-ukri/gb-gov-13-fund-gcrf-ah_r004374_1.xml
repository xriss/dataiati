  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">1. To organise a series of three events (in Bahia, Brasilia, and Manchester successively) to bring together the PI, the Co-I, the NGO Nucleo de Cultura Indigena (Nucleus for Indigenous Cultures) and various indigenous leaders, artists, and representatives of indigenous communities to discuss the rise of racism against native populations in Brazil and ways to contain it and reverse it.  2. To strengthen ties and collaborations between the PI and the academic (Co-I) and non-academic partners in Brazil. 3. To facilitate the encounter between indigenous leaders, artists and representatives of indigenous communities with leaders from Afro-descendants and maroon communities in Bahia, to discuss strategies to recognise and contain racism.  4. To investigate the role of cultural production (literature, cinema, visual arts, and music) in raising awareness about racism against indigenous populations in Brazil and in finding ways to fight it and contain it. 5. To deliver a document written and signed by the PI, the Co-I, the non-academic partner institution (NCI), indigenous leaders, and artists to representatives of the Brazilian government, summarising the conclusions from the first two meetings and proposing a series of measures to be taken by the government in order to contain and reverse racism against indigenous populations and improve the welfare of indigenous communities. 6. To discuss the conclusions and suggestions from the two meetings in Brazil (Bahia and Brasilia) with scholars specialising on racism, race, and indigenous cultures in the UK and Europe. This meeting will take place in Manchester.  7. To reach a better understanding of the nuances of racism in Brazil and the reasons for openly racist discourse against native indians having become more mainstream in the last decade, and therefore contribute to the advancement of knowledge about racism and race relations in both the Humanities and Social Sciences. 8. To contribute to a more sustainable and inclusive development agenda in Brazil, that is, a sustainable development agenda which does not depend on the destruction and alienation of indigenous cultures and peoples.  9. To create and maintain a website that will include texts and live speeches and discussions from all three meetings. The website will serve as a reference for scholars, community leaders, artists, and activists  on the topic of racism against indigenous peoples. 10. To edit a book that will include essays, speeches, and debates from all three meetings. The book will target both academic and non-academic audiences.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The original inhabitants of Brazil are facing one of the most dangerous moments in their recent history. Cattle-ranching, large-scale agriculture, logging, and land speculation are destroying the Amazon forest and leading to the invasion of indigenous reservations and the violent displacement of their inhabitants. FUNAI (Bureau for the protection of indigenous peoples) has been seriously de-funded, and its existence is now being threatened altogether. Assassinations of native indians have increased by over 200% in the last ten years, and cases of openly racism against them, such as refusal to offer medical services, exclusion from public transport, verbal and physical attacks as well as disparaging remarks in the press or social media have become a routine. At the same time, indigenous activism is stronger than it has ever been, with Amerindian groups organising themselves in unions and associations, and using traditional and new media to discuss and counter the violence against them. For the first time, indigenous authors are publishing their own books, and there has been a well documented surge of indigenous cinema production, as well as an increasing number of visual artists and musicians who are making use of Western media and venues to express themselves and, in their own words, educate the non-indigenous population about their own ways of life.   The purpose of this Research Network is to organise three events that will bring together indigenous leaders, artists and intellectuals with academics from the Humanities and Social Sciences with a view to discuss the current rise in racism and violence against indigenous peoples in Brazil, as well as strategies to resist it and contain it. Guided by recent theoretical debates on racism in the Humanities and Social Sciences, as well as by the natives&apos; own experiences as discussed in loco and expressed in political and artistic works, the participants will attempt to answer such questions as: Why is racism against native populations growing so dramatically in Brazil in contradiction with politics of social-economic inclusion? How do cultural and environmental racism relate to racism more broadly? How is racism against native peoples propagated in the media and creative arts? How can the media and creative arts help to contain and revert the current increase in racism against native peoples? In which ways do the current economic and ecological pressures on the Amazon and other natural environments fuel (and are fuelled by) racism? How are indigenous leaders and their communities seeing the current rise in prejudice against them and how are they resisting it? What tools can traditional native knowledge bring to the debate about racism and the environment? What tools can current theories about race and ethnicity/indigeneity in Latin America bring to discussions about racism and prejudice against native peoples in Brazil?  Can changes to the education system and school curricula help contain or revert the current rise in racism against native peoples? How does racism against native people relate to racism against Black rural communities and maroon communities? What practical and policy measures can be taken to contain and reverse racism?  The Network will bring together scholars from the University of Manchester, Universidade Federal do Reconcavo Baiano, and Nucleo de Cultura Indigena. The two events in Brazil will culminate with the delivery of a document to government officials summarising the discussions and proposing a series of measures to be taken by the Government in order to contain and reverse racism against indigenous populations and improve the welfare of indigenous communities whilst promoting sustainable development. The meeting in Manchester will bring the conclusions from the events in Brazil onto a broader theoretical forum, and thus advance knowledge about racism and race relations in both the Humanities and Social Sciences.</narrative>
