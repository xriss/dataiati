   <narrative xml:lang="EN">A key concern for tidal farm developers and investors is resource quantification. The ultimate aim of this project is to develop a tidal farm design tool that produces trustworthy results while requiring a level of computing power that is appropriate to industrial design. Once developed, the model can be extended towards analysis of sediment transport and thus can be used to understand the effect of large farms on the marine environment, which will be a key area of concern to stakeholders in the future.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="Accurate calculation of both the viscous (wake) and inviscid (blockage) effects at the device scale are vital for modelling to be useful in estimating the total performance of a farm. However undertaking a full 3-D Navier-Stokes calculation of a large farm is not practical. The overall objective of this work is to understand the trade-offs between computational size and accuracy of predictions and to investigate the possibility of coupling multiple scale models to create and accurate but manageable size tidal farm design tool.  A coupled code is attractive in that it enables the development of a design tool that is physically accurate but also compatible with industrial timescales and computing power.  The key objectives to be addressed in this project are: 1. Compare the accuracy of 2-D and 3-D models of tidal farms and understand which physical features must be captured for farm design. 2. Devise a coupled code (Navier-Stokes at device scale, shallow water equations at large scale) 3. Compare predictions from the coupled code to existing predictions in UK waters (Pentland Firth), as well as a full 3D Navier-Stokes solution. 4. Suggest the best approach for large-scale design."></capital-spend>
