   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This proposal aims to do a comprehensive evaluation of air pollution health impacts on cardiopulmonary health through integration of exposure, epidemiology, and toxicology/toxicogenomic studies.  We will do detailed assessments of people&apos;s exposure to air pollution, estimating exposures for long- and short-term epidemiological analyses, and linking these to epidemiological analyses of long term health impacts based on a cohort study, short-term effects (i.e. biomarkers, blood pressure, heart rhythm, peak flow) based on a panel study, and early life effects based on a birth cohort. Additionally, we test the effect of reducing exposure to fine particles, but not gases, by designing an intervention study where volunteers will wear a face mask and examining the exposure-response relationship for the same short-term effects we evaluate in the panel study. The short-term physiological measurements we conduct in the epidemiological studies will provide insight into the mechanisms by which air pollutions affects cardiopulmonary health. To complement the human based studies into mechanisms of action, our project will also conduct extensive in vivo analyses of mechanistic effects, and early life toxicogenomics/metabonomics. Finally, we will provide practical advice to stakeholders based on our study findings, by assessing the potential value of selected strategies for control of exposure to outdoor health protection in a health risk assessment.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="We propose to investigate the impact of air pollution on cardiopulmonary disease using a multi-disciplinary approach, involving exposure science, epidemiology, and toxicology. We will investigate the impacts of air pollution exposure in a panel study and a cohort study. These epidemiological analyses will be complemented by in vivo models of the toxic mechanisms of pollutants, along with analyses of early life effects using toxicogenomics and metabolomics. Finally, we integrate these aspects of our study to determine interventions which could reduce the health impact of air pollution via reduced exposure.  The aim of this study is to examine the means by which air pollution in Beijing impacts cardiopulmonary health both on a population level and on a mechanistic level, while accounting for the means by which people are exposed to outdoor air pollutants.  Specific Objectives: 1. Determine the contribution of specific activities, environments and pollution sources to the personal exposure of the Beijing population to air pollutants derived from outdoor sources. 2. Examine the association between within-person temporal variation in pollutant exposures and short-term variations in lung and heart function and determine if these associations vary with disease status. 3. Examine the associations between variations in personal air pollution exposures and biochemical markers of response and to determine if these vary with disease status. 4. Carry out toxicogenomics and exposure genomics research, analyse genomics, epigenetics and metabolomics changes, and examine screening biomarkers of exposure and effect. 5. Examine the relationship between long-term average exposure to outdoor air pollution and the onset of coronary artery disease and cerebrovascular disease in a community based cohort study. 6. Analyse, in a birth cohort, the impact of air pollution exposure on the development and effects of neonatal cardiorespiratory function. 7. Explore the health implications of the study findings for potential means of controlling the personal exposure of sensitive subpopulations, including the use of a facemask, which will be tested in this study."></capital-spend>
