   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Structural biology of immune receptors in disease-carrying mosquitoes</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Mosquitoes are among the deadliest insects as they are reservoirs of pathogenic organisms that cause life-threatening diseases including malaria, yellow and dengue fever among others. These diseases are transmitted from host to host by the mosquito during their blood meal. It has been reported that an infectious mosquito has an increased appetite, which boosts the transmission efficiency of the germs.  It is currently not clear how the mosquito deals with the infection and how the germs bypass the mosquito&apos;s immune system. What is known so far comes mostly from the study of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster that serves as a model organism for insects. Considerable insight has been gained from this system and led to the discovery of key signalling pathways in innate immunity conserved throughout the animal kingdom. The TOLL pathway is of particular interest to me as it combines functions during development and adult life, in the immune and nervous systems. This makes the TOLL pathway a multifaceted target for intervention. My main objective is to characterize the mechanism of TOLL activation and signalling in mosquitoes.   Members of the TOLL family are membrane proteins with an extracellular region responsible for ligand recognition, a single-spanning transmembrane region and an intracellular domain able to transmit the signal inside the cell. The cell, in turn, produces antimicrobial peptides and coordinates different cellular processes in order to mount the appropriate immune reaction against the infection. My first aim is to characterize the three-dimensional structures of mosquito TOLL receptors providing size, shape and charge information. The second aim is to characterize the complex formed with their ligand to reveal their mechanism of activation.  Both aims will be tackled using computational approaches of protein modelling, based on their common ancestry with Drosophila TOLL1, whose structure is known in the absence and presence of its ligand Spatzle 1 (SPZ1). SPZ1 is a signalling molecule that belongs to the same family of proteins as mammalians neurotrophins (NTs), which have recently been involved in physiological mechanisms regulating food intake, as well as vertebrate innate immunity. The recognition mechanism of Drosophila SPZ by TOLL is governed by shape and electrostatic complementary, as well as spatial restriction due to &quot;sugar-coating&quot; at the surface of the receptor. Predictive docking of mosquito complexes relies on coevolution at protein interfaces. These predictions will be verified experimentally using biophysical techniques, X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy for atomic structure determination and cell-based functional studies, such as mutagenesis, reporter gene assays and fluorescence microscopy. Cellular signalling assays will be based on transiently transfected cells stimulated by SPZ and NT isoforms or microbial signature molecules, as appropriate, in order to trigger cellular responses in the form of bioluminescence. In turn fluorescence microscopy will localise fluorescence-tagged molecules inside the cells and colocalise two differently-labeled molecules.      While there is a lot of data on fruit fly TOLL1 and human TOLL-like receptors, there is currently no structural information on mosquito TOLL receptors and SPZ/NT ligands, which have diverged and undergone gene duplication under the influence of parasitic pressure, possibly to acquire new functions. I expect therefore to identify potential novel mechanisms of ligand binding and signalling.  This information will be useful to understand the mechanism of TOLL signalling in mosquitoes in general and establish a link between immune and nervous systems in particular, which might play a dual role in controlling the physiology and the behaviour of infectious mosquitoes. Harnessing information on TOLL-mediated crosstalk has the potential to guide the development of new strategies for pest control.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Vector-borne diseases are the source of over a billion infections and a million deaths annually according to World Health Organization. Innate immunity plays a key role in the complex relationship between pathogen, vector and the vertebrate host. Pathogens have evolved to survive in the different environments presented by arthropods and vertebrates and this has resulted in divergence of immune system response. Consequently, the study of the interactions between vectors and pathogens is essential for future development of novel control strategies against vector-borne diseases.  Mosquitoes are the best-known disease-vectors. They transmit a number of diseases such as malaria and dengue fever. While the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster has been a model system for the characterization of the innate immune system not only in insects, but also in vertebrates, studies on vector immunity has lagged.   My objective is to contribute to the characterization of the structure and function of mosquito immune receptors that could help fight human disease-causing germs and prevent them from spreading at the next blood meal.  So far four major signalling pathways have been implicated in mosquito pathogen recognition. These include the TOLL, IMD and JAK/STAT pathways and RNA interference. Pathogen elimination mechanisms include cell lysis, phagocytosis and melanotic encapsulation. Because malaria-disease causing Plasmodium and Dengue virus both trigger the TOLL pathway, my first objective is to perform a bioinformatic analysis on mosquito TOLLs and their ligands SPATZLE (SPZ). There are eleven TOLLs, three SPZ1 and five SPZ2-6 isoforms in mosquitoes. Comparative genomic analysis has found that gene duplication occurred for the prototypical TOLL1 and 5, with established immune functions, and in TOLL9, an orphan receptor. Two additional receptors TOLL10 and 11 were identified that have no reciprocal orthologues in Drosophila. This suggests possible neofunctionalization in mosquito TOLLs. Conserved TOLL7 is also of interest as it is a neurotrophic and viral glycoprotein receptor, although the latter is debated.  By generating 3D-models to study protein structure of mosquito TOLLs I will be able to access size, shape and surface features to compare evolutionary aspects of ligand binding based on the structural data available for DmTOLL1 and its ligand SPATZLE 1 (SPZ1), as well as mammalian TLRs, that recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns directly.  I will then undertake biochemical characterisation and structure-function analysis on mosquito TOLLs with immune functions. These include vector of tropical fever Aedes aegypti TOLL5A, viral recognition receptor TOLL7, and malaria vector Anopheles gambia TOLL11.   Some of the questions to be addressed are: - How do TOLL and SPZ paralogues interact? Is there cross-reactivity? - What is the molecular basis of TOLL signalling in mosquitoes? - Does gene duplication in TOLL receptors lead to neofunctionalization? - Can mosquito TOLL signal at the plasma membrane? Do they undergo endocytosis upon activation similarly to drosophila TOLL?  My specific aims are therefore 1) to pair up mosquito TOLL paralogues with their potential ligands using a combinatorial docking approach; 2) to structurally characterize the mechanism of activation of TOLL1/5 and SPZ1 isoforms in mosquitoes; 3) to determine the structure of orphan TOLL9 and TOLL11 in mosquitoes and identify their potential ligands. 4) to understand the structure of neurotrophin TOLL7 receptor and its ligand-binding mode; 5) to study the cellular localization of activated TOLL receptors in mosquito cells; and 6) to characterize the structure-function relationships in mosquito TOLL using cell-based reporter assays.  An important corollary of my project is to better understand the interconnectivity of the signalling pathways in arthropod and vertebrate nervous and immune systems to suggest potential application in pest control.</narrative>
