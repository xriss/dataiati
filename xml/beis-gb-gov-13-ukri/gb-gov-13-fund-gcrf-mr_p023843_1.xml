   <narrative xml:lang="EN">So far, smallpox is the only infectious disease of humans that has been completely eradicated; but a number of so-called Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs), which cause a huge burden of disease among poor rural communities in low income countries, are targeted for global eradication, or at least for elimination from large parts of the world.  Great progress has been made in reducing the number of cases of NTDs in some parts of the world but it has become clear that, for most of them, further research is needed to develop new tools and elimination strategies.  Global eradication of malaria, which was attempted unsuccessfully in the 1960s, is back on the agenda, and malaria was eliminated from Sri Lanka in 2016, but it is clear that malaria will not be eliminated from Africa using the old methods.   We have been working on the elimination of blinding trachoma, one of the NTDs targeted for global elimination, in The Gambia since 1984, and showed that it could be cured with a single dose of the antibiotic azithromycin, given by mouth. 500 million doses of azithromycin have been donated to trachoma programmes by the manufacturer since then, and The Gambia has recently met the World Health Organization&apos;s elimination targets, but trachoma remains the leading infectious cause of blindness worldwide.    For the past 6 years we have been studying trachoma in the remote Bijagos Islands of Guinea Bissau where it remains an important cause of blindness, and have made considerable progress in understanding where it is being transmitted and how it might be controlled.  Our aim in the next two years is to set up a trachoma elimination programme on the islands, using mass treatment with azithromycin and health education to reduce transmission, and a surveillance programme to make sure it is not re-introduced.  We also plan to study the transmission of malaria on the islands, with a view to identifying the most promising strategies for malaria elimination in this setting, and to map the distribution of other NTDs.  The programme will be led by Anna Last, a clinical lecturer in infectious diseases, who has recently completed a PhD on trachoma in the Bijagos Islands, and is fluent in the local language.    In two years time we will have established a laboratory and insectary on the islands, trained staff in how to do field surveys, how to diagnose malaria and NTDs and how to control mosquito populations, worked out where and how trachoma and malaria are being transmitted, and found out which other NTDs are present on the islands, we will be in a strong position to try out new interventions for eliminating these diseases. The islands are a particularly good place to evaluate the impact new tools and strategies for disease elimination, since they are relatively isolated, and can be randomly allocated to one strategy or another.</narrative>

To conduct baseline population-based surveys to map the epidemiology of infectious diseases targeted for elimination (malaria, trachoma, schistosomiasis, soil transmitted helminths (STH), lymphatic filariasis (LF) and skin diseases (scabies and yaws) in the Bijagos Archipelago of Guinea Bissau  2. To study the socio-behavioural determinants of these diseases. 3. To build laboratory capacity to conduct basic field diagnostics (microscopy and rapid diagnostic/point of care tests). 4.     To identify the species of Anopheles mosquito which transmit malaria on the islands and their biting habits 5.     To establish an insectary on the islands to study insecticide resistance in malaria vectors"></capital-spend>
