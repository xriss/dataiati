   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The imperative of transformation in African agriculture and food systems has been brought into sharp focus through the UNFCCC commitments under the Paris agreement, the UN Sustainable Development Goals, and the recent IPCC reports on climate impacts in a 1.5C world, amongst other high profile global initiatives. The importance and difficulty of ensuring that such transformation takes place in a way that is socially and environmentally inclusive and equitable, makes just transformation a global grand challenge. The GCRF- African Food Systems Transformation and Justice Challenge Cluster will contribute to new ways of thinking about transformative change, such that justice and equity are brought to the forefront of how donor-led projects, private investments, and agriculture and food policy is designed. It will offer approaches and guidelines for how to achieve, monitor and evaluate justice and equity in such interventions.  The GCRF-African Food Systems Transformation and Justice Challenge Cluster brings together African and international, GCRF-funded scholars, representing 8 GCRF projects, operating across 8 African countries. Through the involvement the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research&apos;s Climate Change Agriculture and Food Security (CGIAR-CCAFS) Initiative, and CARE International the consortium covers a pan-African geographic scope and multiple pathways to stakeholder engagement, influence and impact.  The Cluster team will undertake a synthesis review of evidence emerging from across the portfolio of GCRF- and non-GCRF-funded activity that they represent. This review will be developed into a conceptual framework for understanding and analysing justice in agriculture and food systems transformations in Africa. Case study profiles of existing and ongoing transformative actions in African agriculture and food systems will also be developed and presented as part of regional workshop in Nairobi. Funded places for early career African scholars at this workshop, will expand the breadth of the Cluster and build capacities, both in terms of providing opportunities to play a leading role in developing follow on research proposals and helping to embed food systems and justice thinking within the teaching and educational curricular at participant&apos;s institutions.  The ambition of the Cluster is to inform actions by policy makers, research institutions, the private sector, and civil society that contribute towards: (1) outlining actions taken to assess and address justice issues associated with transformation initiatives, investments, and programmes; (2) establishing appropriate baselines for monitoring and measuring social and environmental justice; (3) strengthening governance systems for the inclusive and sustainable management of agriculture and food system transformation; (4) regulating markets and investments such that they reflect the social and environmental justice implications of such investments or goods.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="The African Food Systems Transformation and Justice Challenge Cluster has three objectives, which draw on the expertise and insights of the GCRF projects represented, and the wider activities of the Cluster team, to:  1) Develop an overarching concept of just transformations that can inform comprehensive empirical evaluations of justice within policies, donor investments, and programmes that target transformation in African agriculture and food systems  2) Profile diverse case study food and agriculture systems in which transformation is occurring or is particularly imperative, on the basis of projected timescales of risks and drivers of change (e.g. climates, markets) and acute social inequalities and/or environmental injustices  3) Establish the groundwork and build networks and cross-institutional capacities for the development of a larger collaborative research proposal to apply the just transformation concept to empirical case studies of transformation of agriculture and food systems"></capital-spend>
