  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">General objective The general objective of this project is to understand and document the subjectivities of former guerilleros: how these subjectivities were constructed during the ex-combatants&apos; life trajectories as active members of armed groups in Colombia, how they are narrated in the DDR process, and whether and how they are incorporated into local relational networks and other areas of life in the Colombian municipalities under study: Dabeiba, Segovia, Ituango (Antioquia) and Montelibano (Cordoba). This general aim of the project will be achieved through the following specific objectives:  Specific objectives 1. Describe what hegemonic subjectivities are at play in narratives of the life trajectories of former members of armed groups in Colombia and of their involvement in the process of disarmament, demobilization and reintegration, from the perspective of these persons and of other members of the local and regional society. 2. Describe what alternate, preferred and/or silenced subjectivities are at play in narratives of the life trajectories of former members of armed groups in Colombia and of their involvement in the process of disarmament, demobilization and reintegration, from the perspective of these persons and of other members of the local and regional society. 3. Analyze the effects of these subjectivities on social relations and coexistence at the family, local and regional levels. 4. Develop participatory methodologies for reflection about difference and otherness in the context of post-agreement processes of reconciliation in Colombia. 5. Evaluate and develop the method of combining oral narratives with textile narratives for use in other contexts in Colombia and beyond. 6. Reconnect the empirical and methodological conclusions of the project with the theoretical literature to advance knowledge about post-conflict reconciliation and peacebuilding.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project explores the subjectivities constructed by ex-combatants in the process of disarmament, demobilization and reintegration (DDR) in Colombia and how these ex-combatants are, in turn, perceived by other groups in society and specifically in the communities where they now settle. In order to study the transformation of both ex-combatants&apos; self-understandings and outsider perceptions of these, the project employs a qualitative approach that combines narrative biographical interviews with textile narratives. This innovative method consists in the running of  textile workshops during which first ex-combatants and then civilian community representatives, individually or collectively, create sewn wall-hangings to express their memories, self-understandings, and hopes for the future. In this approach, oral and textile narratives are not merely data to inform the analysis of ex-combatants&apos; role in the process of reconciliation and social integration in Colombia, but, as a methodological intervention strategy, are intended to actively contribute to this process. A further key component of this methodological strategy are its diverse means for the dissemination of research results. Findings are disseminated not only through the textile workshops, but also through exhibitions at the local, national, and international level and through a digital platform. As a repository and dissemination tool, this platform is planned to be expanded to collect oral and textile narratives of the Colombian conflict produced in other sites in the future.</narrative>
