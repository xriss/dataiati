  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In thirty years&apos; time there will be half a billion adolescents in Africa. Like youth everywhere, they possess huge potential to thrive. But more than half are trapped in cycles of poor nutrition, poverty, low education, violence and unemployment. They also have the world&apos;s highest rates of early fertility, with adverse long-term outcomes for adolescent parents and their children. Such inter-generational disadvantage creates risks not only in the region but also to global stability. The SDGs and African Union&apos;s Agenda 2063 challenge us to take a radical new approach. The UK&apos;s Global Challenges Research Fund provides a unique opportunity to do this. The Accelerating Advantage Hub will find the combinations of services with the greatest positive impacts for Africa&apos;s adolescents and their children. We need to move beyond services focused on single outcomes, towards &apos;super-accelerator&apos; impacts across multiple SDGs of health, education, violence prevention, gender equality and economic stability. With our government partners we will test combination services - for example of cash transfers, malaria prophylaxis, parenting programs, business skills and violence prevention - to identify the leanest and most effective policy packages. The Hub has been planned with African governments and international agencies including the UN Development Program, African Union, UNICEF and the World Health Organisation. They have told us that &apos;evidence as usual&apos; is not enough. When we make a personal investment, like buying a computer, we want to know not only whether it is the most efficient, but also whether it is good value for money and whether we will like to use it. Governments need the same information about services: their effectiveness, their cost-effectiveness, whether they can be delivered through existing health, education and welfare systems, and whether they will be accepted by service providers and by adolescents. The Hub will conduct large-scale studies and use existing data in Angola, Cote D&apos;Ivoire, DRC, Ethiopia, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Kenya, Lesotho, Liberia, Malawi, Mali, Mozambique, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone, South Africa, Somalia, South Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia &amp; Zimbabwe. All projects will include cost-effectiveness to assist budget decisions. In short, we will provide African policy-makers with the evidence they need and want to do the best for adolescents. The Hub will also train and support frontline workers to improve services for adolescents across Africa. We will turn evidence into training modules, freely accessible manuals and support materials. We will deliver practitioner training in 34 African countries by working with NGO partners selected for wide regional coverage, for example Paediatric Adolescent Treatment for Africa, the International Rescue Committee, Clowns without Borders and the International AIDS Alliance. Skills-building for young researchers in Africa and the UK is built into the Hub&apos;s work. We will support 45 promising young academics and dedicated African policymakers to focus their careers on improving the lives of adolescents and their children. The Hub&apos;s work is planned with adolescents themselves. Too many services have failed because they do not appeal to teenagers&apos; aspirations and immediate goals. The Hub will work directly with adolescent advisory groups in Eastern, Western and Southern Africa to co-develop approaches that are not only effective, but also meaningful and fun for those who will use them. We aim to reach 20 million adolescents and their children with effective combinations of services to meet their needs. Between our direct countries of research and our NGO partners, the Hub will actively engage with policymakers, practitioners and adolescents across East, West, Southern and Central Africa and including fragile and war-torn states. We have a common goal: to transform the potential of Africa&apos;s adolescents into a thriving future for the continent.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">OBJECTIVE 1: DISRUPT INTERGENERATIONAL CYCLES OF DISADVANTAGE FOR 20 MILLION ADOLESCENTS AND THEIR CHILDREN IN 34 AFRICAN COUNTRIES. The Hub&apos;s driving goal is to identify and support &apos;super-accelerator&apos; combinations of services that promote adolescent wellbeing across multiple SDGs. We will use randomised trials, pilot trials and quasi-experimental analyses across East, West, Central and Southern Africa, testing combinations selected in partnership with national governments and adolescents themselves. We will place researchers within the UNDP and African Union with the explicit mutual objective of evidence input into national government planning processes. We will support ongoing and new initiatives with major donors and agencies including Gates Foundation, Global Fund and UNICEF, and we will work with NGO partners to provide open-access training and materials to practitioners across the region. OBJECTIVE 2: GIVE SENIOR AFRICAN POLICY-MAKERS THE EVIDENCE THEY WANT: COST-EFFECTIVENESS, ACCEPTABILITY AND SCALEABILITY WITHIN EXISTING SERVICE DELIVERY PLATFORMS. Our policy partners want research evidence that reflects the real-world of scaling up programs in Africa. They want to know cost-effectiveness and allocative efficiency for budget provisions. They want to know whether services are acceptable to adolescents, and the barriers and facilitators of scale-up within existing state and NGO platforms. For each super-accelerator finding, we will provide them with this evidence in accessible formats. We aim to kick-start global evidence-building of combination interventions for an integrated SDG response. OBJECTIVE 3: PROVIDE FREE, EFFECTIVE PROGRAMS AND TRAINING FOR PRACTITIONERS ACROSS THE AFRICAN REGION. All manuals of effective interventions, support materials, toolkits and training modules, all policy briefs, research tools and datasets will be made publicly available for non-profit use (web-based and print versions). We will work closely with implementation partner NGOs including Paediatric Adolescent Treatment for Africa, International Rescue Committee, Clowns without Borders and the International AIDS Alliance to provide training and materials for healthcare, education, social service and lay community workers in the 34 African countries where they work. OBJECTIVE 4: PARTNER WITH AFRICAN ADOLESCENTS TO CREATE SERVICES THAT ADDRESS THEIR PRIORITIES. Too many effective interventions have low adolescent buy in, acceptability, uptake and retention. The Hub will work closely with our adolescent advisory groups in Kenya, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, South Africa, Tanzania and Uganda to design interventions with high acceptability, and delivery mechanisms that address their barriers and motivations. OBJECTIVE 5: CAPACITY-SHARING IN INTERDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH. The Hub includes active capacity-building of 35 early-career academics in Africa and 10 in the UK, including 8 co-funded doctoral students and 5 master&apos;s students per year working on Hub-associated projects. Learning posts, training support and workshops will promote mutual capacity-sharing and skill-sharing across disciplines and regions. Civil servants will be invited to engage in training on cost-effectiveness modelling and receive mentoring for research skills. Our goal is to build a next generation of mutually-supportive African research leaders and policy-makers, who are committed to reaching the SDGs for adolescents and their children. OBJECTIVE 6: LEVERAGE ADDITIONAL EXTERNAL FUNDING TO MAXIMISE IMPACT FOR AFRICA. If awarded, the Hub  already raised additional external co-funding of &#xA3;12,968,213, as well as partner contributions of &#xA3;2,526,889. Through these and more, we will maximise the Hub&apos;s impact during and beyond the GCRF&apos;s investment, and provide exceptional value for ODA money.</narrative>
