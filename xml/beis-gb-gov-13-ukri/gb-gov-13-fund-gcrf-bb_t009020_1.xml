   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Urban food systems for healthy diets in South Africa: Addressing the double burden of malnutrition through a coherent systems approach</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In every country in the world, especially poor countries, people experience ill-health because of what they eat. Not eating enough nutritious foods, and eating too many unhealthy foods means young children do not grow properly, women do not get enough vitamins and minerals, and many more people are affected by overweight and diseases like diabetes. This is often called &quot;malnutrition&quot; and is especially serious for young children, including babies, many of whom are not properly breastfed or receive inadequate nutrients when they are under the age of five.  One country with a major malnutrition problem is South Africa. Most people in South Africa live in cities, where life is difficult for poor people. These people have long travel times to work and live in tiny houses. This makes it really difficult for them to store and prepare nutritious foods at home. As a result, they often rely on food that they can eat straight away or does not spoil, like fatty fried food and sugary snacks and drinks. Because they have so little money and time, they often feed babies watery, starchy foods without enough nutrients. Where they live and work, this food is readily available and cheap. In fact, the whole system of things that bring food into their neighbourhoods makes it easier and cheaper to create an environment around them that&apos;s full of the wrong types of food. This system is known as a &quot;food system.&quot; This all means, too, that the many efforts the government has made in South Africa to help people eat better have not really reached their potential, efforts such as the extra money they give to poor families for their children, or programmes designed to help them feed their toddlers better. While South Africa has its own specific context, this is also the case in many other countries around the world.  In our project, we want to change this. We want to see a whole system of actions that will actually work for people who live in cities. This means ensuring that existing actions to help them are better aligned with and supported by that food system, as well as designing new actions within the system that recognise the challenges in peoples&apos; lives.  We are going to provide evidence to know what this system of actions would look like. We will do this in a way that is not done very much: to actually start by listening to the people in urban settings who experience the problems we are talking about. We will talk to families who have children under the age of 5, as this is the group the evidence says needs most support, along with their mothers and other women who might have babies quite soon. We will walk with them around their neighbourhoods and find out what influences the foods they eat, and what could change that. We will talk to them about the ways the government already tries to help them and whether they know about them, or are able to respond to them. And together with them, we will design a system of actions that would actually work for them and their children. We will also talk to the government about what they can do, especially about changes further back into the entire food system, as well as in urban planning. And we will bring into a broader conversation all the people who have influenced what these people eat. Together we will work to design a system that supports children and their mothers eating foods that support their health and development.  We will do this in two communities in the fourth largest province in South Africa: the Western Cape. We have chosen that place because the local government is already committed to improving food systems to address poor nutrition in their communities, and have asked us to help them identify what could effect real change. Although we will conduct this study in South Africa, it will be relevant to the region and the whole world. So we will produce reports and other materials that help other people in other cities create a more effective response to poor diets in their communities.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Our aim is to define and communicate what a systems approach to improving the quality of diets among children under 5 and women of childbearing age would look like in urban settings to address the double burden of malnutrition.  To do so, the study has the following objectives and specific objectives:   1) Understand how existing systems that influence nutrition (food systems, urban systems, system of existing interventions) combine to influence diet quality in children under 5 and their mothers in the Western Cape, South Africa. Specifically, to: (a) understand how low-income mothers engage with their food systems in the context of their urban realities (b) understand how these food systems and urban realities combine to effect diets and capacity to respond to existing interventions (c) understand the initial implications for the actions needed to create greater coherence across systems  2) Develop a systems approach to optimise interactions and coherence between these systems to improve diets, Specifically to: (a) identifying the complimentary, transformative actions needed to make different systems work coherently and maximise intervention effectiveness (b) creating action plans to initiate implementation    3) Maximise the benefits of the findings in the study setting, and reap the benefits for other jurisdictions regionally and globally. Specifically to: (a) synthesise the knowledge gained to define what a systems approach to improving the quality of diets among children under 5 and their mothers looks like in the urban Western Cape and elsewhere (b) identify findings suitable for national, regional and/or global audiences (c) prepare reports and communications materials (d) disseminate them</narrative>
