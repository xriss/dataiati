   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Optimising forest benefits whilst minimising impacts of emerging zoonotic diseases: co-developing an interdisciplinary tool for forests in India</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The majority of poor communities in Low and Middle Income Countries (LMICs) depend on healthy ecosystems for livelihoods and food security. In India, for example, around 300 million people live in, and depend on, forest ecosystems, which are often badly degraded. Forest habitats in these countries are a significant source of food, fuel, livestock fodder and other non-timber forest products but also of emerging infections. Forests support complex ecological communities, including diverse wildlife hosts and vectors that are sensitive to forest structure and change. Upsurges in zoonotic diseases have been linked to deforestation or re-afforestation in LMICs and to forest usage but the interacting ecological and social mechanisms underpinning these changes are unknown, hampering mitigation. Forest communities are rendered even more vulnerable by poor access to healthcare.   Our overall research objective is to reduce health, welfare and livelihood impacts of zoonotic diseases on people that depend on forest ecosystems in LMICs by developing, a novel interdisciplinary framework. This framework will indicate how forests can be used to maximise livelihood benefits whilst minimising exposure to zoonotic disease. Zoonotic diseases are naturally transmitted between vertebrates and humans (often wild and domestic vertebrates). These disease systems are thus impacted by, and have impacts upon, stakeholders in three key policy sectors - the public health, animal health and forestry sectors. In light of this, the overall project objective is achieved through six linked objectives, from mapping of stakeholders across sectors, their knowledge, sensitivity to disease impacts and needs for decision-support tools, through to scientific investigation of the social and ecological processes that underpin disease risk in fragmented forest landscapes and regions. The framework will be developed initially for the tick-borne Kyasanur Forest Disease (KFD), a debilitating and fatal haemorrhagic disease affecting forest communities in India that has increased significantly in geographical incidence (~5-fold) in the last decade. The specific objectives of the project are to: 1. Establish an inter-disciplinary network of ecologists, epidemiologists, public and animal health experts, and government departments to identify knowledge gaps, and the value of decision support tools for optimising forest use and disease mitigation. 2. Map the key stakeholders, actors and beneficiaries involved in governance of land use, human and animal health in forests at different geographical scales (from village to state).  3. Understand how human behaviour and priorities that drive human exposure to zoonotic disease, alter with forest structure for different stakeholder groups within focal landscapes at different stages of disease emergence.   4. Quantify impacts of forest structure, climate and social factors on (i) exposure of people and cattle to tick vectors, including infected nymphs; (ii) the distribution and infection rates of wildlife hosts; and (iii) disease incidence for focal landscapes and regions. 5. Co-produce a decision support tool for KFD, integrating spatial and seasonal variability in human exposure and environmental hazard, to map disease risk for focal landscapes to improve targeting of risk communication, vaccination and protective measures under alternative scenarios. 6. Scope out generalisation of the inter-disciplinary tool to other emerging zoonotic diseases in India and worldwide (e.g. Chikungunya, malaria, Leishmaniases) and to combined animal and human disease burdens arising from forest ecosystems. The project platform will advance the global One Health initiative and global scientific understanding of threats from emerging zoonotic diseases, providing novel inter-disciplinary, cross-sectoral, multi-scale methodology and capacity. It will generate a breadth of baseline social and natural science data to underpin future research.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Vast numbers of poor people in Low and Middle Income Countries (LMICs) depend on healthy ecosystems for their livelihoods and food security. In India, around 300 million people depend on forests that are badly degraded by human settlement, agricultural expansion, and over-grazing. When they access food, fuel, fodder and other products from degraded forests, these people risk exposure to harmful pathogens that circulate naturally in wildlife. The ecological balance between diverse wildlife and arthropod vector communities can be altered by forest degradation, but these ecological changes interact with the priorities and behaviour of people in the landscape to determine when and where exposure occurs. Upsurges in human cases of zoonotic diseases (diseases that circulate between animals and humans) in LMICs, like malaria and Leishmaniases, have been linked to deforestation, reforestation or particular forest activities. Knowledge gaps on the role of ecology and sociology in underpinning these changes prevents development of intelligent disease control strategies that allow people to benefit from forests but minimise exposure to disease. Such strategies require cooperation of policy-makers and forest users from across the animal health, human health and forestry sectors, from national and international decision-makers down to village communities, that all interact with the disease system. By bringing such stakeholders together in a network, along with experts in public and animal health, ecology, epidemiology and social science, this project aims to develop a new inter-disciplinary framework and decision-support tool to reduce health, welfare and livelihood impacts of zoonotic diseases on people that depend on forests in LMICs. It will be developed initially for Kyasanur Forest Disease (KFD), a fatal haemorrhagic disease of forest populations in India that cycles naturally amongst ticks, rodents and primates.  The research underpinning the tool will include: 1. Mapping of key stakeholders in each sector, their knowledge, needs for decision-support tools and how they are impacted by or impact upon the disease system. 2. Intensive field observation of (i) how the priorities, behaviour and perceptions of disease risk of different forest groups, like traditional hunter-gatherer tribes and farmers, change; (ii) how the numbers and species of wildlife hosts and tick vectors, and the consequent hazard of KFD changes along forest landscape gradients from closed through fragmented to open forest. 3. Matching of historical geographical patterns in human cases of KFD with environmental patterns within models to disentangle social, climate and forest landscape drivers across the affected region in India.  A geographical decision support tool, integrating this knowledge, will map how disease risk varies across forest landscapes, from which activities and by which forest user groups, with other constraints on disease management, availability and access to health care and medicines.   The project will reduce impacts of KFD on health, welfare and livelihoods by increasing awareness of disease risk in forest users, especially tribal groups that harvest non-timber forest products and farmers that graze livestock. These groups will further benefit from specific guidance on (i) the key forest locations and habitats, seasons and activities, and (ii) why and how to access medicine and other protective measures. The decision-support tool will help disease managers to better target vaccination and risk communication efforts towards the forest communities that are most at risk and will inform planning of land use in forests.  The project platform and approach of co-developing research and decision support tools on zoonotic diseases with stakeholders across sectors, accounting for their needs and underlying ecological and social processes, will build significant capacity in science, policy and practitioners to respond to emerging global threats.</narrative>
