   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Under-nutrition and infection remain major public health problems in African countries, but are being added to by non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease and cancer, conditions that have previously been seen more frequently in developed countries. These conditions are expected to become the most common cause of death in Africa by 2030. Diabetes is rising in frequency in many countries around the world, but the rate of increase in Africa is estimated to be the fastest anywhere and more than 40 million Africans are predicted to have the disease by 2035. The main drivers of this rise in NCDs in Africa, in common with other countries around the world, are changes in dietary and physical activity behaviour and the development of obesity at different stages of life. However, the factors that are driving these changes in behavior are different between countries. These go beyond individuals&apos; attitudes and choices to factors that determine the food supply, its cost and availability, the nature of work and the structure of built environment. The development of understanding of these wider factors is a necessary part of the process of identifying possible solutions to these public health challenges.  This International PhD partnering scheme builds on existing institutional links between the University of Cambridge and the University of Witwatersrand, Johannesburg. The two lead departments both aim to improve public health by researching and developing interventions to reduce the risk of chronic disease at critical developmental periods across the lifespan. The programme will specifically aim to develop work aimed at population-level solutions to the epidemic of non-communicable diseases by linking South African researchers to the United Kingdom Centre of Diet and Activity Research (CEDAR); a multi-disciplinary centre of public health research excellence aiming to develop understanding about the population determinants of diet and activity behaviour and to evaluate population interventions.</narrative>
