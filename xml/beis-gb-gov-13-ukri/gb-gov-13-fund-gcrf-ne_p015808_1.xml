   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Building resilience and inclusion in Sub-Saharan Africa through social learning around climate risks</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Sub-Saharan Africa is particularly vulnerable to droughts, floods and other climate-related stressors and shocks. Some of the most vulnerable in the region are rural communities in arid and semi-arid areas, dependent on agriculture and livestock rearing. The processes of inequality that drives their vulnerability and risk to climatic variability and change is now recognized as important in pursuing the sustainable development goals. This research aims to contribute to greater understanding of the underlying drivers of risk, while also identifying pathways to improve the impact that climatic information may have on building resilience through bridging the &apos;usability gap&apos;.   The focus of the research is on understanding the learning processes that build resilience and support livelihoods, which are responding to multiple pressures and opportunities across timescales in contexts that are complex and highly uncertain. Knowledge that feeds in to managing uncertainty is derived from a range of traditional, indigenous, local and scientific sources.  In such contexts, linear models of knowledge generation from data collection to information generation to knowledge production around one specific stressor in one timescale are insufficient. Consequently, the processes of social learning, as iterative reflection that occurs when experiences, ideas and environments are shared with others, are central to building resilience. The research aims to improve our understanding of social learning in vulnerable communities across temporal scales and in complex historically, socially, economically and politically mediated contexts. The interdisciplinary endeavor will pay particular attention to environmental history and the dynamics of power, politics and gender within them, and explore how they link to ongoing work on delivering improved scientific climate information.  This research will build on the interdisciplinary track record of the University of Sussex and the Institute of Development Studies in climate science, climatic information exchange, adaptation, environmental history and processes of power and politics within social learning in Sub-Saharan Africa. The collaboration will use in depth case studies with participatory action research building on an established partnership with a broad consortium of research and development partners in Kenya - the Ada consortium. The case studies will provide learning and evidence from a continuum of communities focused on agricultural to pastoral livelihoods in arid and semi-arid regions of the country.   The learning from the case studies on social learning and local resilience building will be shared through engagement with key stakeholders and networks working in climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction in the region. A facilitated dialogue with key stakeholders will inquire in to potential avenues for improving the links between climate information exchange and disaster risk reduction strategies to build resilience in vulnerable communities. The project will facilitate planning of future work, building on the ongoing work of partners&apos; in NERC/DFID funded projects and others, and identifying opportunities for further fundraising through the GCRF or other vehicles.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The overall purpose of the proposed inter-disciplinary collaboration between UoS, IDS, international NGOs and Kenyan partners is to inform improved resilience building programming and practice in Sub Saharan Africa. We will do so through addressing an overarching research question:  How can social learning processes at the local level include marginalized groups, and how do they interact with exchange of climate information to build resilience? Better understanding of local processes of social learning, paying particular attention to the dynamics of power, politics and gender within them, and exploring how they link to ongoing work on delivering improved scientific climate information will be pursued through two specific objectives:  (i) To better understand local processes of learning and inclusion of agricultural and pastoral communities through collaborative case studies in Kitui and Isiolo counties, Kenya (ii) To reflect on policy and practice change for climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction through engagement with networks using scientific climate information</narrative>
