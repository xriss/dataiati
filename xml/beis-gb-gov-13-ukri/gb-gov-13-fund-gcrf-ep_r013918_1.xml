   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Detecting and Monitoring Stroke in China Using a Low-Cost, Portable Microwave Scanner (DeMoStroke)</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The impact of stroke incidents is immense: five million people die and another five million are permanently disabled every year due to stroke incidents, and stroke is placed third among reasons for acute death and first among reasons for neurological dysfunction in the western world. Its impact and consequences, however, are even more devastating in developing countries, where according to WHO estimates, death from stroke accounted for 85.5% of stroke deaths worldwide in 2001, and the number of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), i.e. years of life lost and years lived with disability, was almost seven times higher than in high-income countries.  In China, in particular, stroke is the leading cause of death, and it strikes earlier in life than it does in the western world. Its treatment relies to a great extent on the information provided by diagnostic methodologies, which are necessary to guide medical experts in choosing a treatment strategy and to assess its efficiency. This project will build on existing expertise by the project partners in the UK and China towards the development of a portable and low-cost system which can detect the occurrence, and monitor the evolution of stroke and its treatment using microwave technology. The proposed system will use low-power, non-ionizing radio waves (microwaves) to image the occurrence and evolution of stroke in an accurate manner, thereby removing the need for expensive imaging systems (such as CT scans) which would result in significant delays in treatment decisions. This approach can address several clinical needs. For example, the system can be used inside an ambulance to determine the type of stroke much earlier than CT scanners inside a hospital. This is particularly important for ischemic stroke patients (which account for over 80% of total cases), for which early detection is crucial for thrombolytic treatment (i.e. blood thinners that can dissolve clots in blood vessels due to ischemic stroke but would worsen the condition of a blood vessel rupture occurring in hemorrhagic stroke). Moreover, by serving as a point of care diagnostic tool for patients at their homes, the proposed approach can lead to more efficient management of stroke in the post-acute stage, which can improve the potential recovery of the patient. The scanner can therefore revolutionise stroke therapy and recovery in communities where CT or MRI equipment is scarce or not available, such as underdeveloped or rural areas in China and other ODA countries. The project will develop the microwave device relying on academic and industrial UK expertise in microwave imaging algorithms and instrumentation. In addition to offering academic expertise in microwave medical imaging, the project&apos;s ODA partners will accelerate the proposed device&apos;s pathway to clinical use through a network of hospitals and medical centres and cooperation with over 35 hospitals across 30 cities in China in the planning of clinical trials. Although delivered in China, the project can make a difference in many developing countries where stroke is emerging as a health threat also for younger populations (e.g. South Asian countries), as the targeted device will be affordable and simple enough to use.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project will make significant advances in three key research and development areas in medical microwave imaging by: delivering a prototype of an innovative, low-cost, portable microwave imaging device that uses custom-made electronics for data acquisition; developing novel microwave imaging algorithms with increased robustness and resolution that are fitted to the prototype; and, validating experimentally the feasibility of detecting and monitoring stroke by testing the developed prototype in a series of experiments with realistic physical brain phantoms based on 3D printed technology and brain tissue mimicking materials. To achieve these ambitious goals, the project will target the following objectives:  - Adopt our unique microwave imaging techniques (which combine non-linear inverse scattering techniques with sparsity recovery algorithms) into a novel brain imaging prototype developed within this project. To this end, we will rely initially on accurate numerical simulations of the interaction of the developed system with realistic numerical brain models. These simulations can produce data that can assess the performance of our system and algorithms, and will also serve as testbeds for their optimisation. - Produce state-of-the experimental head phantoms by introducing accurate tissue mimicking materials to anatomically realistic head phantoms. These phantoms will be the primary experimental testbeds for our assessing the performance of our methods. To this end, the project will benefit from complementary relevant research at KCL&apos;s Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences (via two BBSRC CASE awards), which will produce accurate tissue mimicking materials that will be introduced to anatomically realistic 3D printed brain phantoms. - Modify our existing microwave imaging prototype first into a lab prototype for imaging brain phantoms, and finally into a prototype that can be used for human trials. The first stage will require optimising the antenna array and topology, choosing the optimal frequencies and coupling medium based on hardware and software considerations, and ensuring a mechanically stable and ergonomic design. The second stage will refine this prototype into a device that will be easy to use and attractive to patients and clinicians. - Develop compact, custom-made, RF hardware (multi-port transceiver system) which will ensure our microwave scanner to be a portable, low-cost device.We will use our ODA partners&apos; expertise in RF hardware and prototyping to develop a version of our existing prototype with superior performance at a fraction of the cost. The prototype will be complemented by implementations of our imaging algorithms based on field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), which can guarantee imaging in real-time and without the use of a PC.       - Demonstrate the potential and maximise the impact of our device in stroke treatment by developing a clear exploitation plan (including a clinical trial upon project completion) together with our partners in China that will introduce our technological solution to the Chinese health sector by means of actively engaging with doctors, hospitals, and patients.</narrative>
