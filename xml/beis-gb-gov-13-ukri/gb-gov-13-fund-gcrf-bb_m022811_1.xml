   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Variant antigen profiling: a novel genomic tool for diagnosis and surveillance of animal African trypanosomiasis.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">1. To sequence the genomes of 40 T. congolense strains (Savannah-type). These strains have been selected from the AZIZI repository of historical blood stabilates and were originally sampled from diverse locations across Africa and at various times over a 50-year period. I will purify trypanosome cells from the blood stabilates and then prepare genomic DNA for sequencing on the Illumina Hiseq platform.   2. To quantify population variation in VSG repertoire and conduct variant antigen profiling on each strain. I previously established the phylogenetic diversity of VSG in the IL3000 reference strain. Several VSG lineages in IL3000 appeared to pre-date the origin of T. congolense indicating that they would be present in all other strains, except in cases of loss. This offers the opportunity to characterize any T. congolense strain based on the profile of VSG phylotypes present in its genome. I will test the hypothesis that VSG clades in IL3000 are universal by extracting VSG repertoires from all 40 strain genome sequences and estimating a revised global VSG phylogeny. The hypothesis will be confirmed by mapping VSG phylotypes on to the phylogeny of T. congolense strains and observing a widespread distribution. I will then produce a &apos;variant antigen profile&apos; (VAP) for each strain describing the proportion of total VSG belonging to each universal phylotype.  3. To confirm that T. congolense sequences homologous to VSG are functional variant antigens. It is not known which VSG phylotypes in T. congolense among those I established encode functional variant antigens. I will capture telomeric sequences from IL3000 and nine other strains using conserved non-coding sequences that I have identified previously. These will be cloned into yeast and sequenced to produce a survey of T. congolense telomeric sequences large enough to test the hypothesis that conserved non-coding regions delineate a canonical VSG expression site, as in T. brucei. The active VSG sequence will be confirmed through proteomic analysis of each strain. Phylogenetic mapping of the telomeric VSG will confirm which clades include likely variant antigens. Low abundance VSG that are not associated with expression sites and which are invariant across strains will also be identified where they occur. These conserved phylotypes are of particular interest because they may be good candidates for vaccine development.    4. To determine the spatial and temporal correlates of the VAP. I will relate each VAP to the geographical origin of its corresponding T. congolense strain and use multinomial logistic regression to identify gradients in phylotype frequency in space and time that are statistically significant. VAPs will also be related to information on parasitaemia and virulence available for each strain. This will identify trends in VSG diversity that characterize parasite phenotypes (e.g. virulence) populations and therefore disease epidemiology.   5. To implement variant antigen profiling with freely-accessible online tools. It is clearly vital to make this approach accessible to African researchers if I am to achieve my principal aim of translating trypanosome genomics into the natural disease setting and thereby improving the diagnosis and surveillance of AAT. All sequence data will be integrated with the AZIZI biorepository at ILRI. Together, we will create an online interface for fast and simple analysis of the VSG repertoire in raw T. congolense sequence data, based on the structural models developed with the 40 strains in this study. The website will be hosted by the existing AZIZI website at ILRI and mirrored in Liverpool and at the Sanger Institute.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Animal African trypanosomiasis (AAT) is a livestock disease with frequent and devastating effects on animal health and on the development of sub-Saharan nations. This neglected tropical disease is caused by the parasite Trypanosoma congolense, which is spread by biting flies and infects the blood causing chronic anaemia, wastage and ultimately death if untreated. Unlike Human African trypanosomiasis (&apos;sleeping sickness&apos;), which is caused by a related parasite T. brucei, and is declining after successful intervention and much research, AAT remains very common and poorly known. Yet the annual costs of disease and treatment are estimated at ~$4.5 billion across 37 countries. The FAO considers AAT to &quot;lie at the heart of Africa&apos;s struggle against poverty&quot;, and central to its Millennium Goals. Most research on African trypanosomes is directed at the model organism T. brucei, but given the profound effects of AAT on animals and people, we need research dedicated to the veterinary parasites to determine how parasite variation affects the course and severity of disease.  All African trypanosomes use antigenic variation to avoid the immune response of their host. This involves the replacement of the protein coat covering the parasite surface each time the host produces antibodies to the protein. The protein is called the Variant Surface Glycoprotein (VSG) and is crucial to parasite survival and the severity of disease, determining the length of infection and resistance to innate host defences. The genomes of both T. brucei and T. congolense contain hundreds of VSG genes, of which just one is expressed at a time from a specific expression site. Together, this repertoire of alternative VSG genes is a ubiquitous, but highly variable, feature of trypanosome genomes that constantly changes in response to host immunity. We can use this repertoire to understand how parasites change through space and time, and what effect this has on disease. This project aims to measure variation in VSG repertoire across the T. congolense population, and then produce a novel tool for rapidly predicting the properties of a strain based on its VSG repertoire.  I will produce genome sequences for 40 isolates sampled from T. congolense infections of cows. Until now, analysis of VSG repertoires on a population scale has been avoided because their complexity makes it impossible to use standard tools. Previously, I discovered that T. congolense VSG are divided into distinct types, each defined by unique protein motifs. I will quantify the VSG repertoire in each T. congolense isolate by comparing its VSG to these protein motifs. The relative abundance of the VSG types will produce a &apos;variant antigen profile&apos; (VAP) for each isolate. To give the VAP some predictive power, I will identify which VSG are actually used in antigenic variation, (and those that might perform some other role), by identifying the active VSG gene present in the specific expression site and expressed on the parasite cell surface. I will also identify significant correlations of VAPs with geography, time, disease severity and parasite relatedness. A tool to generate and interpret a VAP will be accessible online, making it possible to predict the properties of any T. congolense isolate from genome sequence data using variant antigen profiling.  AAT represents an enormous challenge to animal health and economic development in Africa and yet we have no detailed knowledge of how T. congolense varies and how this relates to the kind of disease we see. Such information would improve diagnosis, the efficiency of drug therapy and control measures, lead to earlier and more appropriate treatment for sick animals, and perhaps even identify proteins that could serve as vaccine targets. The time is right to develop a fast and simple approach to making sense of VSG diversity that can unlock the potential of trypanosome genomics for understanding AAT, estimating its risk and mitigating its effects.</narrative>
