   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Ugandan Youth and Creative Writing: New Perspectives on Conflict and Development</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">1. To develop innovative interdisciplinary collaborations between academic and non-academic stakeholders in the UK and Uganda which bring together creative and literary studies with area and development studies in order to forge new methodologies for understanding the legacies of Ugandan conflict. These methods will centre on the use of creative writing among vulnerable youth populations in Uganda as a means of fostering inter-ethnic solidarity in order to protect against future conflict, uncover its hidden narratives and capture its indirect and cross-generational impact. In addition, these methods will re-centre youth experience in conflict and post-conflict zones, using creative writing as a tool for re-orienting academic understanding of post-conflict development needs, with the potential for wider application across other conflict and post-conflict zones.  2. To conduct an interdisciplinary study of conflict discourse as it pertains to Uganda, drawing on literary writing, development narratives and policy documents produced from the post-independence period to the present day, including extant scholarship on the narrativisation of conflict discourse (eg Abrahamsen, &apos;Disciplining Democracy: Development Discourse and Good Governance in Africa&apos;). This study will result in the production of a journal article which draws links between the language of Ugandan conflict across forms, genres and media and its material effects.  3. To hold a two-day workshop session for academic and non-academic partners in Bristol, during which time initial findings about conflict, narrative and development will be shared, best practices developed and interdisciplinary training provided under an ethos of co-production of knowledge. The workshop will enable the growth of research capacity for Ugandan partners, in particular.  4. To hold two creative writing workshops for young Ugandans (defined as under 25) which will empower participants to create their own fictional accounts of everyday life in post-conflict Uganda. Drawing on youth populations from a diverse set of ethnic backgrounds, these workshops will last for a period of four days (travel and accommodation provided for participants) and be followed  by a four-month period of mentorship. One workshop will be held in the south of the country and another in the north, and each will be led by an established Ugandan creative writer and administered by project partner Writivism (a literary initiative run by the Kampala-based Centre for African Cultural Excellence, a non-profit organisation that aims to foster responsible citizenship through the literary arts).  5. To draw on creative writing produced by workshop participants to develop a set of teaching materials intended for use in Uganda and abroad which focuses on the use of short fiction to develop inter-ethnic and cross-cultural solidarity and empathy.  6. To produce a journal article and short policy document which highlights the needs identified within the youth participants&apos; writing in order to re-focus development priorities and principles in the wake of conflict from the perspective of everyday, lived youth experience. The re-centring of young Ugandans as agents will likewise allow for recommendations to policy makers and aid workers on how best to redress the limitations of high-level development discourse (see for instance writing on the &apos;third world&apos;, Africa and development by Escobar; Ferguson).   7. To produce a website which will feature the creative writing produced by the workshop participants, the teaching materials and the policy document.  8. To engage in a series of schools visits in the Kampala area, using the creative writing produced by the workshop participants and teaching materials to educate young people around cross-ethnic solidarity and empathy in a post-conflict context.  9. To stage a reading, hosted by Writivism, in which the young workshop participants will be able to showcase their work.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Since its independence in 1962, Uganda has been beset with a series of conflicts. Ranging from cross-border &apos;spillover&apos; conflict from South Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo to the high-profile North/South conflict led by Kony&apos;s Lord&apos;s Resistance Army, these incidents of violence and terror have characterised Uganda&apos;s post-colonial history. Extant development studies suggest a link between deep-seated ethnic rivalries forged during the colonial era, uneven economic development, corruption in governance and the asymmetrical distribution of resources as key drivers of conflict in the country (Otunnu, &apos;Causes and Consequences of the War in Acholiland&apos;; ACCS, &apos;Northern Uganda Conflict Analysis&apos;). While the main brunt of conflict has been carried by the north, Uganda as a whole has been beset by its effects. Young people have been made particularly vulnerable, both in the high-profile cases of child recruitment in conflict, including the sexual trafficking of young women and girls, and in the overall effects of unemployment, instability and political conflict across the nation as a whole.  While a number of high-level studies, development analyses and policy recommendations exist in the Ugandan context, these by and large fail to escape the pitfalls associated with development discourse, particularly as it pertains to the African continent, with the result of disempowering local populations and de-centring the everyday experience of conflict and its afterlives. As James Ferguson (&apos;Global Shadows&apos;) argues, the rhetorical and discursive apparatus around development cannot be decoupled from its material effects and, more often than not, inefficacy in practice (see also Escobar, &apos;Encountering Development&apos;). These complaints have become commonplace in postcolonial approaches to African development, where the perceived distance between the lived experience of African populations and discursive theorisation about them has been blamed for the continuation of colonialist patterns of exploitation (eg Jolly, &apos;Global Development Goals: The United Nations Experience&apos;).   The proposed research is a pilot study which seeks to redress these pitfalls by developing interdisciplinary methods to enable new understandings of conflict, its legacies and its impact among youth populations, using creative writing as a tool for self-expression and empowerment. The proposed research seeks to enable the agency of Ugandan youth, whilst minimising the risks of trauma associated with testimonial narrative through the leveraging of imaginative forms. At the same time, creative fiction offers the possibility for imagining other lives and other minds, and thereby presents the best potential for the development of empathetic identification across communal groupings (Keen; Nussbaum).   This research exploits these characteristics, using youth-produced short fiction as the basis for teaching materials aimed at secondary-schools in Uganda which will use the empathetic potential of literary writing to develop cross-ethnic forms of solidarity and enable larger-scale dialogue around youth needs post-conflict. The research will also use these writings as critical discursive material which will enable a re-consideration of development needs in Uganda, uncovering the submerged narratives and impacts of conflict&apos;s legacy through the medium of expressive fiction. By re-centring young Ugandans as agents of knowledge production, this project foregrounds heretofore unheard voices and unseen development needs.  Partnering with Writivism, run by the Kampala-based Centre for African Cultural Excellence, and the Centre for African Studies at Uganda Martyrs University, the project will lead to significant local benefits including the development of: pedagogical material and educational practice; research capacity; co-produced knowledge exchange; increased networks of influence; new audiences; and vernacular interventions into high-level development policy.</narrative>
