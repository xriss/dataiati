   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project is the fruit of a new partnership between the University of Brighton and GPIAtlantic, which aims to demonstrate the usefulness and relevance of values-based approaches to evaluating cultural legacies of projects for asset-based community development. The project will transfer approaches developed in the &apos;Starting from Values: Evaluating Intangible Legacies&apos; Connected Communities project to an established programme.   The project will embed values-based approaches to identifying legacies within the Stories of Amazing Resilience (SOAR) and Gothkad (Happiness) Village projects led by GPIAtlantic and its local partner in Bhutan, the Youth Development Fund (YDF). These projects are part of the wider programme of developing Gross National Happiness pioneered in Bhutan.  In doing so, we will train Canadian and Bhutanese youth leaders who are involved in delivering action research projects for community wellbeing, and co-develop an approach to evaluating legacies of these projects in Bhutan.   The project also aims to use this practical example as a case for the usefulness of the approach in other regions, and to develop a deep, mutual partnership with GPIAtlantic, a global leader in indicators for development. Our community partner will also facilitate the transfer of this learning into an established global network of policy-makers, funders and assessors of genuine progress and wellbeing.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="1. To co-explore and co-develop with GPIAtlantic a contextualised use of our values-based approach from the AHRC Starting from Values project, to confirm its distinctive usefulness to assess legacies of asset-based community development projects by:  Identifying and representing cultural legacies of two flagship Gothkad (Happiness) Village projects led by GPIAtlantic and the Bhutanese Youth Development Fund (YDF), within four months.  2. To demonstrate the practical usefulness, scalability and transferability of the values-based approaches by co-training others in Bhutan to: Identify and represent cultural legacies of the national program of Young Volunteers in Action (Y-VIA) - led by the Bhutanese Youth Development Fund (YDF) and GPIAtlantic, within five months.  3. To embed learning about the values-based approaches into GPIAtlantic practices worldwide by co-training and accompanying learners in dedicated sessions within the annual extended international training event for their leaders and research directors in Feb/March 2016; to include co-development of training materials for roll-out in GPIAtlantic projects in the Mekong, Canada and India- within ten months.  4. To introduce the demonstrated effectiveness of our approaches to GPIAtlantic&apos;s wider networks, including the OECD, UNICEF and the UN, through briefing statements and brief reports, within twelve months."></capital-spend>
