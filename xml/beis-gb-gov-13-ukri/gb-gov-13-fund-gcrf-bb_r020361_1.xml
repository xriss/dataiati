   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Population growth and associated rising food demands places increasing pressure on global food production, and by 2050 the world will need 60% more food than is available today with pressure on limited land area to produce adequate food sustainably while reducing chemical inputs. Severe pest damage of crops is one of the major challenges to food and nutritional security and disproportionately affects poor farmers and low-input orphan crop grain legumes such as beans, pigeon pea, cowpea and lablab. Pest control is often overlooked on orphan crop legumes, but any management of the pests is dependent on high agrochemical inputs which have negative impacts from exposure of users and consumers and where pesticides severely impact non-target invertebrates that can be beneficial to food production through pollination or natural pest regulation. Agricultural systems are ecologically complex and must function with natural habitats rather than deplete them. More resilient agriculture and focussed investments for smallholder farmers can deliver transformative change and enhance prospects and livelihoods of the world&apos;s poorest while safeguarding against future risks.   In Tanzania, Kenya and Malawi, legumes are grown and consumed by millions of farmers and their families providing protein, micronutrients and vitamins so represent one of the most important means to enhance nutritional security. East African poverty reduction strategy papers highlight that food poverty exceeds 18% in these countries and agriculture is central to reducing this livelihood gap. Yields of key legumes such as beans and cowpea are presently very low (500-700 kg/ha) but potential yields are &gt;3000 kg/ha. Consequently, millions of farmers, particularly women (the primary growers of orphan legume crops in Kenya, Malawi and Tanzania), and their households have great potential to increase nutritional and food insecurity by improving production of legumes.    Biodiversity underpins agricultural ecosystem services and food security, livelihoods and economic development by provisioning natural enemies of crop pests. Natural enemies reduce populations of pest insects thereby reducing reliance on synthetic insecticide application. Through this saving their contribution in the US alone is reported to be $13.6 billion annually so the benefits of natural pest regulation can be measured in environmental and economic terms. Non-crop habitats such as field margins provide the environment with diverse food resources required to support arthropod predators and parasitoids. Management or manipulation of this non-crop habitat can help to support natural pest regulation and can even be augmented and sustained in better managed natural or manipulated agro-ecosystems. The occurrence, density and impacts of most beneficial insects in smallholder ecosystems, however, are poorly understood, particularly in Africa.   The research proposed here will take forward recent findings by our partnership and identify the key taxa that support and deliver natural pest regulation. We will develop approaches that support and augment natural pest regulation through improved agroecosystems management with reduced pesticide use. The proposed research will provide key evidence for benefits of natural pest regulation and establish how this can be optimised through better landscape management or manipulation and how natural pest regulation can function alongside other management practises including natural pest resistance, botanical insecticides and intercropping.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="The overarching objective is to understand the specific role of key plant and invertebrate taxa in natural pest regulation on orphan crop legumes and exploit this for the management of Aphis fabae (black bean aphid) and Maruca vitrata (legume pod borer), two major pests on East African orphan legume crops (including common beans, cowpea, pigeon pea and lablab), through ecological intensification. This work will directly address a main theme of the call: managing crop pests and diseases.   The key aims of the project will be: 1. Determine how integration with other pest management approaches including host plant resistance and plant based pesticides influences natural pest control in landscapes that are botanically diverse or depauperate.  2. Determine how intercropping of legumes with cereals - a common farming practice to maintain soil quality - influences the delivery of natural pest regulation.  3. Combine benefits of biodiversity/genetic variation within regionally important indigenous and &apos;orphan&apos; crops by cultivation within mixed and plant-diverse cropping systems, harnessing the full agronomic potential of beneficial organisms for enhancing crop productivity or countering pests.  By focussing on orphan legume crops that provide critically important nutrition through protein and micronutrients, our project will enhance sustainable production that supports food and nutritional security (and safe food). This will support the delivery of rigorous evidence to promote environmentally sustainable agriculture that is relevant both for local production traditions and practises but also focussing on women who are the primary growers of legumes. The specific objectives are as follows.  Objective 1. Evaluation of the pest management potential of natural enemies through ecological intensification of field margins. We will provide evidence to inform the design and development of new interventions that harness ecosystem services of natural pest regulation. In previous field activities we have established the diversity and nature of natural enemies of pests in legume cropping systems but it is still not known which species are the most important for natural pest regulation in orphan crop legumes and which plant species provide the most effective field margin support. This objective will address this by comparing different field margin types/managements for their capacity to support natural pest regulation and good yields. Objective 2: Develop environmentally benign ecological interventions that augment natural pest regulation in monocrop or intercropping (in parallel with Objective 1). We will design experiments that test whether populations of key natural enemies for orphan crop legumes can be augmented through specific planting of key field margin plants.   Objective 3. Integrating environmentally benign interventions to support natural pest regulation.  This objective will investigate integrating diverse environmentally benign pest management interventions to understand whether or how they can be implemented together.  Our recent work has shown that the impacts on natural enemies of pesticidal plants are less severe than impacts of synthetic pesticides. What we do not know is whether cropping systems that differ in the diversity of the field margin plants respond differently to the use of plant based or synthetic pesticides.   Objective 4. Promote wider understanding and uptake of the key findings via knowledge exchange and policy. Based on effectiveness of innovations and data from objective 2-3, we will assess the barriers to, and incentives for, the adoption of novel practices. We will identify existing knowledge exchange and extension opportunities and build on these to deliver new practices. We will quantify the agronomic (yield, quality, stability), economic (cost: benefit analysis, risk reduction) and social (acceptability) benefits of the agronomic innovations we develop."></capital-spend>
