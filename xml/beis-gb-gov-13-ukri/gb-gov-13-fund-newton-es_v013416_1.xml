  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Phase 1: Knowledge Dialogue (Months 1-8) A) Literature review - application of capability approach with indigenous populations;  B) Five stakeholder engagement workshops aimed at enhancing understanding about the mental health and quality of life of the Kankuamo people will be held. Sixty individuals (including traditional healers, community elders, health workers) will be purposively sampled from across the twelve Kankuamo communities. Data will be collected using Module One the Design, Implementation, Monitoring and Evaluation (DIME) approach. Module 1 of DIME elicits relevant qualitative information about: 1) Problems that adults in the community face; 2) The key function/tasks that adults are required to frequently undertake for themselves, their families, and their communities; 3) The advice that is currently provided by recognised community experts (i.e. key informants) to address the problems. Building on our work in Uganda and Rwanda as part of the ESRC funded COSTAR project (ES/S000976/1), this work will  include a focus on the Capability Approach (Sen, 1999) through the inclusion of an additional question that will ask community members to indicate: &apos;What does a good life mean to you?&apos;.  Phase II: Developing Assessment Instruments (Months 9-13) A) Development or adaptation of assessment instruments for: i) common mental disorders, ii) quality of life based on the qualitative findings from Phase I. This will be guided by Module two of the DIME approach and will utilise the data collected in Phase 1. B) Piloting of Assessment Instrument - the two assessment instruments developed in Phase IIA will be piloted according to Module Three of the DIME Approach. Data collection will take place via a survey of 380 households across the 12 Kankuamo and will be undertaken by the participants of phase I, accompanied by members from the research team. The survey will include the novel assessment instruments for common mental disorders and quality of life, as well as internationally recognised standardised measures of depressive symptoms (i.e. PHQ-9) and quality of life (WHOQoL-BREF). Following the completion of the survey, purposive sampling will be used to recruit a subsample of participants into focus groups discussions (1 FGD of 10 people for each of the 12 communities; total N = 120) to provide qualitative feedback about the assessment instruments (including the cultural acceptability).  C) Validation of the assessment instruments - Correlational analyses will be conducted on the data collected in Phase IIB to determine the construct validity of the new assessment instruments compared to PHQ9 and WHOQoL-BREF. Phase III: Guideline development (Months 13-20) Members from all 12 Kankuamo communities (N=120) will be invited to a combination of focus groups, workshops and interactive activities over a 2-day period to co-produce guidelines for the development and delivery of culturally sensitive primary care community mental health support. This will include consideration of ethical and legal obligations of stakeholders.  Phase IV: Development and evaluation of the training program (Months 20-30) This phase will involve the development, delivery and evaluation of a training program aimed at training Community Wellbeing Advocate (CWA) to identify people experiencing mental health difficulties within the Kankuamo community, and to signpost them to appropriate, locally available, forms of support.  A) Develop a short 3-day CWA training program based on the findings from Phase I, Phase II and Phase III.  B) Deliver a 3-day CWA training program to participants (N=60).  C) Evaluate: i) the acceptability of the CWA training program (two FGD of up to 8 CWA trainees 1-month post-training, ii) feedback from community members who have interacted with the CWA (2 FGD of up to 8 community members). D) Adjust the CWA training programme according to feedback received from the CWA trainees and community members in Phase IVC.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">There are over 1.9 million indigenous people in Colombia (Colombian Government, 2018). The United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP) (United Nations, 2007) states that Indigenous people must be active agents in their own development and that these efforts should be guided by the priorities that they value. Sen&apos;s (1983) Capability Approach (CA) argues that the process of development must be concerned with what people are able to do and to be, and the freedoms they have to live the life that they have reason to value. Studies applying the CA with indigenous communities highlight the importance of the participatory process of identifying and defining human capabilities (Gilger, 2005). In Colombia, large disparities exist in the access to, and quality of, healthcare between indigenous communities and the general population (MINSALUD, 2016). One of the suggested reasons for these disparities is the dominance of a biomedical model of health within the healthcare system (Caballero Pineda, 2019).   The current project focuses on the mental health and quality of life of the indigenous Kankuamo communities of the Sierra Nevada of Santa Marta region of Northern Colombia. The Kankuamo population is estimated to be 16,986 people. Over the last three decades, the mental health of the Kankuamo population has been affected by chronic situations of cultural and socioeconomic vulnerability, including the impact of the armed conflict and the presence of structural social violence in their territory.  Four specific objectives will be addressed: 1. To address the question of how mental health difficulties manifest amongst the Kankuamo people, we will engage in dialogue with stakeholders (including Kankuamo community members, traditional healers, formal healthcare providers in the Kankuamo communities) about: a) how emotional distress manifests in Kankuamo communities, b) how this impacts on their capabilities, c) the explanatory models that the communities use to understand emotional distress, and d) what forms of support are regarded by the communities as legitimate and effective. 2. To address the question of how mental health difficulties experienced by the Kankuamo people can be measured we will co-produce and/or adapt forms of assessment for measuring the levels of emotional distress and indicators of quality of life in Kankuamo people from an intercultural perspective. 3. To address the question of how the mental health needs of the Kankuamo people can be better supported we will co-produce guidelines that reflect the tensions and opportunities of the provision of conventional mental health care to the Kankuamo people and how the provision of support for reducing emotional distress and enhancing quality of life can be more culturally appropriate. 4. To address the question of how new systems can be implemented to better support the mental health needs of the Kankuamo we will co-produce and evaluate a training programme for identifying people experiencing mental health difficulties that will be delivered to Community Wellbeing Advocates (CWA), drawn from the Kankuamo community, who will liaise between community members and healthcare workers to facilitate the delivery of appropriate, locally available, forms of support via the Kankuamo health services.    The scope of the research speaks directly to Theme 1 (i.e. Mental health conditions, including; post-traumatic stress disorder and co-morbid conditions such as depression and anxiety) and Theme 4 of the current call (i.e. Mental health care systems and services). The project will provide an opportunity to support a new collaboration between academics based at the University of Liverpool and Universidad Externado de Colombia. The team members will bring together a range of disciplinary expertise including: social science, clinical psychology, psychiatry, epidemiology, research ethics, global mental health, and history.</narrative>
