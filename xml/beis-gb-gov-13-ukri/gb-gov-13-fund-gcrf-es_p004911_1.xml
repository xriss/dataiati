   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Northern Uganda experienced one of the world&apos;s most notorious instances of forced displacement during and immediately after the Lord&apos;s Resistance Army (LRA) insurgency, which started around 1986 and ended on Ugandan soil in 2006. Northern Ugandan displacement was notable for its duration - in some areas for well over a decade; and for the fact that it involved the entire rural populations of the affected areas from around 2002, including all of rural Acholiland - around one million people - with a further eight hundred thousand from neighbouring communities. For the first 16 years of the conflict there was virtually no humanitarian assistance to the affected population, which only began in earnest after 2003. However for the following ten years, while the population was displaced and later, from 2007, returning to and re-establishing their homes, large amounts of international funding were spent. Aid was deployed on physical infrastructure, support for state security, education and health services, disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration (DDR) programmes, peacebuilding and transitional justice initiatives, and agricultural and other livelihoods development.  Northern Uganda&apos;s was a model international intervention. There was a humanitarian phase during and immediately after the conflict, a transition phase during the return and resettlement phase, followed by development interventions to enable the war affected population to regain some of the lost ground caused by displacement and war, to help them attain the same level of development as the rest of the country. Compared to many conflict and post-conflict environments, northern Uganda&apos;s was straightforward. The security, political and logistical challenges were all manageable and the LRA conflict was of a sufficiently high public profile that funds provided by governments and international institutions were substantial. The intervention in northern Uganda was, it is reasonable to assume, done as well as these things can be done. However there has been little attempt to learn from the Ugandan experience. This research aims to correct this deficiency through understanding displacement and return through the perceptions and understandings of the people concerned.  The outcome will be a series of studies that together evaluate not so much specific interventions but the lived experience of cumulative interventions in different sectors. It will look at communities&apos; understandings of their own coping strategies and resilience; of the current state of their social capital and civil society as they interpret the notions and what has helped and hindered in the post-conflict recovery period; and of how ten years of international aid interventions, largely &apos;off the shelf&apos; but sometimes attempting something more targeted, have affected their lives. In this sense the project will address humanitarian-development impunity, which is fostered by neglect - perhaps active rejection - of learning opportunities, as has been seen so far in northern Uganda. We aim to create a model for community-centred post-intervention evaluation across sectors.   The research team are soon to conclude work on the Justice and Security Research Programme, which has been filling a massive knowledge gap on the experiences of ordinary people around security in Central Africa, and what are the public authorities - in practice very often not the state - which provide security services. The forced displacement programme will build on this model and this experience, seeking to understand displacement and return through the lived realities of affected people, in the process challenging the comfortable assumptions of the development industry. We predict that interventions in different sectors will emerge as positively and negatively experienced by populations in terms of their long-term outcomes, and that this learning will be disseminated in ways that can influence interventions in other post conflict settings.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="1. Produce high-quality evidence based research that informs national and international policies and practices to generate learning from northern Uganda&apos;s forced displacement and return dynamics and the model international humanitarian and development interventions deployed between 2003 and the present. The research will reframe understanding and policy making through exploring the hugely under-researched perspective of affected populations on &apos;return&apos; in conflict-affected places. Drawing upon historical and anthropological approaches, we will explore how formerly internally displaced people and former combatants negotiate and experience &apos;return&apos;, their understanding of their own coping strategies and resilience, and their perceptions of how external interventions contributed or detracted from these. We will examine relationships of returnees with each other, with the state and local elites, with aid agencies, and with other forms of &apos;public authority&apos;, from clan elders and religious leaders to civil society and vigilante groups. Now that things have moved on relatively peacefully, we will identify the processes of social repair that allow for coexistence and improved well-being. Where this is not the case we will find out why enmities and violence persist and become endemic. 2. Focus on under-researched areas, including the long-term dynamics of ex-combatant return, who in northern Uganda occupy an ambiguous victim-perpetrator status. While much attention is paid to &apos;Disarmament, Demobilisation and Reintegration&apos; (DDR) in peacebuilding literature and policy, these processes tend to be sporadic, short-lived and reliant on donor funding. We know even less about those &apos;self-demobilised&apos;, including the thousands of former Lord&apos;s Resistance Army fighters in northern Uganda who have undergone no formal return or resettlement processes but have returned to civilian life, sometimes securely and at other times inauspiciously. Research into how and why some former combatants are apparently still not reintegrated a decade after the end of the conflict on Uganda soil will tell us more about appropriate interventions. 3. Use local partnerships productively to provide fresh perspectives on how the &apos;local&apos; is produced and re-shaped by return dynamics. Through long-standing collaborations with local partners we will develop richer and more relevant analyses and prescriptions. We will develop our local partnerships to explore how processes of return produce the &apos;local&apos; by impacting on existing power structures and shaping and re-shaping public authority and collective consciousness.  4. Build local capacity through a) working with a small team of experienced research assistants to help them become researchers in their own right, through including them in all aspects of the research programme, not just data collection and processing. This process will involve dedicating a proportion of PI and Co-Is time on conducting processes including research design, data analysis, identifying conclusions and writing up as inclusive experiential training; b) working with the Medical Anthropology department of Gulu University to create opportunities for students to contribute to elements of the project. The PI and Co-Is will offer teaching sessions to allow them to follow and learn from the project&apos;s activities. 5. Seek means of dissemination that have the potential to influence policy and practice by international development actors, by identifying specific interventions and the ways in which they work and don&apos;t work in the eyes of &apos;beneficiaries&apos;. By challenging assumptions around the benefits of much current practice, especially in the areas of soft interventions seeking to impact culture, behaviour and social attitudes, we hope to have a profound impact on policy norms and create a model of how an international interventions may be held accountable for their failures and learn from their successes through evaluation of their long term impacts."></capital-spend>
