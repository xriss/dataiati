   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Legitimacy, accountability, victims&apos; participation and reparation in transitional justice settings - lessons from and for Colombia</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">It is widely accepted that Transitional Justice (TJ) contributes to building peace, preventing new conflict and promoting the rights of victims of conflict. It can also help to identify the root causes of inequality and marginalisation. It can therefore enhance development in various ways: through promoting the rule of law, strengthening institutions, increasing access to justice, reducing inequalities and promoting gender equality.  The currently predominant view is that a holistic approach to TJ needs to be adopted after periods of armed conflict in which massive human rights violations occurred, based on a coexistence of mechanisms of truth, justice, reparation and guarantees of non-recurrence. However, it is not yet clearly understood how to resolve the possible tensions between the different components of this approach and how to put it into practice successfully so that the legitimacy of a TJ process is enhanced rather than undermined. It is equally still an open question what would be necessary for TJ to have a positive effect on development. Colombia is the first country worldwide that designed a TJ process that aims to put into practice the theory of the holistic approach to TJ. This puts to the forefront novel questions of far-reaching significance for achieving peace, strengthening institutions, and improving the situation of victims of conflict who are often the most disempowered in a society. The legitimacy of the justice component of the Colombian TJ process, the Special Jurisdiction for Peace (SJP), has been highly contested from the outset. This has partly been due to the fact that, in implementing the holistic approach to TJ, it provides the perpetrators of mass atrocities with special sanctions (that do not include imprisonment) in exchange for truth, reparation and guarantees of non-recurrence. Among the supporters of the SJP, this approach is regarded as legitimate because of its &quot;victim-centred&quot; focus which is meant to ensure that procedures are designed and undertaken so that victims can participate effectively at every stage and have a say on how to best satisfy their rights to truth, justice and reparation throughout. Its opponents regard this as impunity. The SJP is only in its second year and this early stage of its operation provides a unique opportunity to analyse the potential and challenges of the implementation of some of the features of the holistic approach to TJ in practice. Such an analysis is of crucial importance at this particular point in time, as it will feed back into the Colombian peace-building process while it evolves, and it will also inform academic debate and the formulation of future TJ processes worldwide, which primarily take place in LMIC and therefore have an important link to development.  Through various research methods, in particular semi-structured interviews, focus groups and participant observation in public hearings, we will collect and process original data on how the implementation of the holistic approach to TJ in Colombia is perceived by victims and other key stakeholders, and in particular on what they perceive as the main issues that weaken or increase the legitimacy of the justice process as carried out by the SJP. We will add to the existing academic literature through our analysis of the novel Colombian approach to TJ and lessons to be learned from it. Our research also aims at informing TJ practice, both in Colombia and internationally. In Colombia through briefing papers specifically aimed at assisting the SJP in addressing pressing questions such as how to operationalise victim participation and the restorative component of the special sanctions in a way that maximises their legitimacy, and how to define key legal concepts such as the criteria according to which cases are selected for investigation.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The overarching goal of our research is to explore some of the main factors that are relevant for providing the justice component of a holistic approach to Transitional Justice (TJ) with legitimacy and what can be learned from this for the current Colombian TJ process, for future TJ processes and at a theoretical level. We thus aim to provide the wider international community with in-depth analysis of lessons learned from the Colombian experience and contribute to the discussion on the relation between TJ and development, in particular SDGs 10 and 16. Through our research we furthermore seek to facilitate future research within and across disciplines on this holistic approach to TJ and to contribute to the development of academic capabilities at the local level through the inclusion of Colombian researchers, project partners and transitional justice actors into the research design and the development of policy briefs which can be used and further refined throughout the duration of the transitional justice process, as well as by making our research findings available to relevant stakeholders. In particular, we will address four themes with the following objectives:  - Regarding the legitimacy of the SJP, we will identify the main challenges to the legitimacy of the work of the SJP. For this purpose, we will collect reliable data to create a factual knowledge base to understand the perception of various stakeholders regarding the legitimacy of the Special Jurisdiction for Peace (SJP) and to inform the analysis of this phenomenon from a normative legal, an anthropological and a political science perspective. We will also evaluate how the different topics addressed in this project (participation of victims, conduction of hearings, reparation, conceptualization of key legal concepts) impact the SJP&apos;s legitimacy.  - Regarding victim participation in the SJP, we will first provide a normative analysis of international standards of victim participation in TJ settings and make suggestions on how those could be applied in the case of the SJP. In particular, we will evaluate how victim participation currently works in practice at the SJP and how to ensure victim ownership at the different stages of the transitional justice processes so as to promote stability, reconciliation and development. In particular, we will focus on how the SJP engages with victims and their representatives and how it takes into account their contributions. Furthermore, we will assess how victims and their representatives perceive their opportunities for participation and ownership of proceedings as well as experiences or risk of re-victimization. - Regarding reparation we will evaluate what the role of the SJP in providing reparation to victims is or should be. Specifically, we will focus on the role that special (reduced and restorative) sanctions can play in relation to reparation. We will analyse what forms of reparation should be provided to victims by those that could benefit from the SJP and whether this should be the same for all actors, i.e. former guerrilla fighters, state officials or third-party actors. Finally, we will look at the interrelation between participation and reparation. We thus hope to contribute to the understanding of how to design effective legal and policy mechanisms for addressing the issue of reparations for gross human rights abuses in a transitional criminal justice setting as part of a holistic TJ process. - Regarding certainty with respect to key legal concepts we will seek to define key legal concepts for the work of the SJP, such as criteria for prioritisation and selection of cases on which depend what cases will be investigated and go trial, which has serious implications for equal treatment among victims. We will also test whether and how the definition and application of these concepts impact on stakeholder perception of thelegitimacy of the work of the SJP.</narrative>
