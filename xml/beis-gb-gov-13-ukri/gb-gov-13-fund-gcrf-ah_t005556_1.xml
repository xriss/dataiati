   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Debates about the past are negotiations about the future. At the centre of these the archive plays a unique role as a trace of a moment, a trend, a life, a culture, an atrocity. It bears witness to the past, situating communities in the present and shaping the future. This is why decisions over what is to be collected, recorded or preserved are crucial, as this affects what will have future presence. The archive exposes the connection between memory and the persistence or transformation of identity. It is about whose story will continue to be told and how, and whose will be silenced.   These issues become acute in moments of post-conflict, displacement and reconstruction. Our Network depends on linking expertise from regions where they are most urgent: the Middle East and Africa, specifically Lebanon and Tanzania. Our starting point is the early 20th century Maji Maji War in Tanzania, its landscape and memorialisation, accessible and in-accessible - in prisons and monasteries. It will act as the site of discourse for the team and, through sharing images and writings, bring in voices from Baddawi Camp in Lebanon. In re-imagining past or present places and lives from a distance, the analysis will trace surprising connections between (formerly/still) colonised, incarcerated, travelling and forcibly encamped people, exploring the ways that such an engagement can engender (real and imagined) lives and narratives beyond the confines of refugee encampment.  The Network provides an opportunity for convergence and co-creation of knowledge, from geo-political contexts that rarely get to share ideas and experiences directly, especially the creation of South to South connections. Each represents a different point in a future: the crisis in the Middle East, the long-term post-conflict reconciliation in Africa, and the colonising past of Europe. Within each of these moments the archive has a distinct power. We want to examine its role and articulate archiving practices that contribute to a future which promotes, not suppresses, just, peaceful and inclusive societies.   Acts of archiving that draw on local knowledges, self-archiving methods, joint decision-making in what is to be remembered or forgotten, with dialogues across generations, gender and class, have a unique authority. In contrast, stereotypes, gentrification, discrimination, and deprivation - all of which can create discord, tension and physical conflict - often result from insufficient knowledge and narrow understanding. They stem from a lack of appreciation for shared histories and of community&apos;s place in the global context. Imagining Futures will use the intrinsic power of the archive for its capacity to build confidence, to enhance understanding and reveal co-existing multiple narratives, and thus, to reduce conflict within and between groups, increasing the potential for sustainable peace.   Our aim is to facilitate the opening-up and sensitive use of existing archives, to create new methods and types of archives and to articulate jointly what a different more egalitarian archive would be. This will be achieved through two Labs in Tanzania and Lebanon (with a supporting technologies workshop), that will co-produce, through engaging with existing archives, special and non-traditional archives in-situ; creative open digital tools; and protocol recommendations. These activities will allow for articulating shared questions, scoping case studies, and piloting approaches that can be scaled up, tested and developed in a wider Network Plus project. Our goal is to create methodologies and tangible proposals for the best archiving practices building towards a policy-manifesto, with heritage preservation as an element. Our wider ambition, through exposing cultural practices as important sites of negotiation, is to advocate for culture to be officially recognised as a humanitarian need.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="Imagining Futures repurposes existing archives to use against the grain to benefit communities and explores the creation of egalitarian archives that promote access to information, transparency and social cohesion. The following objectives are interdependent: moving from grounded knowledge to its contribution to wider methodologies. The objectives concern activities to be conducted during the Development Phase which will also be used for scoping, piloting, data collection, capacity building, in preparation for the Network Plus grant.  1) To use the intrinsic potential of the archive for its capacity to build confidence, reveal co-existing narratives, enhance understanding, empathy, and thus reduce inter/intra-community conflict among diverse social, political, religious, economic, and regional groups, enhancing potential for sustainable peace (SDG 11/16). To pilot this with our team members in Tanzania and Lebanon.  2) Create an inclusive network of academics, archivists, historians, archaeologists, architects, artists, urban-planners, geographers, practitioners, authorities, NGOs, educators, and community stakeholders related to memory institutions and community development. 3) Create a network, committed to inclusive and meaningful dialogues with communities, to exist during and beyond the project, linking inter-disciplinary research and expertise that draw on distinct geo-political contexts where the need for new imaginaries is most urgent including Lebanon and Tanzania. In conjunction with this, critically review institutional policies to facilitate such dialogues, advocating a model approach for diversity and gender equality, ethics, safeguarding and risk-management protocols.  4) Activate archives as sites of discourse, with Maji Maji War sites in Tanzania as catalysts linking with Baddawi Camp in Lebanon, by providing access to the historically disenfranchised, to enhance and disseminate methodologies of reading archives against the grain, to subvert conventional epistemologies and challenge dominant or exclusionary narratives, by bringing out diverse voices and exposing archival formation as a result of multiple histories and intersecting lives. 5) Develop and facilitate the physical creation of diverse archives and approaches, as propositions for a methodology of their preservation, and related heritage (SDG 10/11.4), as a pathway to an egalitarian Archive for the Future.  6) Produce guidelines on site-sensitive practices, for activating existing archives and creating new ones, their engagement, storage, dissemination and accessibility. Advocating for culture&apos;s role in building just, peaceful, inclusive societies. 7) Build towards creating policy papers and ethical guidelines, for creation, use, and custodianship of archives, for application by international organizations such as OSCE, ICCROM, and UNESCO, to ensure archiving practices aren&apos;t further acts of intrusion, dis-empowerment and control. Using their platforms, to educate and re-frame thinking on value across supra-state organisations, NGOs and memory institutions. 8) Create agile solutions of different mediums and scales, technologies, to share archiving methods. The project&apos;s archiving &amp; tools will serve as experiment &amp; model. 9) Expose the impact of colonial, western, male gaze - historically pervasive, in the subject of the archived (e.g. monumental) and its form (visual/text-based) - in framing policies of preservation and reconstruction.  10) Increase mobility of people and ideas, through the Network, creating a bridge and partnerships between Middle East and Africa (SDG 17.14/17), emphasizing south to south connectivity, and across: 1) recovering communities in conflict zones and postcolonial contexts; 2) organisations, communities and enterprises within contexts of displacement; 3) researchers, across humanities and other fields, as architecture, design, urban-planning, those in memory institutions and practitioners; 4) supra/state bodies."></capital-spend>
