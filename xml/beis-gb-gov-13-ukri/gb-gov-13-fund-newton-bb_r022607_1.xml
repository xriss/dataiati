   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Burkholderia species in sugarcane: the relationship among antifungal production, intrinsic antimicrobial resistance, and pest biocontrol</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Burkholderiaceae comprises a family of environmental bacteria widespread around the planet, which reside in diverse environments and in association with plants, insects, animals, and humans and also display extraordinarily high multidrug, intrinsic antibiotic resistance (iAMR). Burkholderia are very useful microorganisms for bioremediation, plant growth promotion, and pest biocontrol, but these beneficial properties to mankind remain hindered because of fear of infection and iAMR. Indeed, some Burkholderia species are particularly dangerous to humans and domestic animals (e.g. melioidosis and glanders) and they are singled out as bioterrorism agents, while others (e.g. B. ceno-cepacia and B. multivorans) cause debilitating and often transmissible lung infections in cystic fibrosis patients.   Burkholderia spp. is a main component of the sugarcane cultivable bacterial community in Brazil, which can control fungal and bacterial infections by producing many different antifungal compounds. The relationship between iAMR and antifungal production is unclear, but our previous results showing that strains with high-level antimicrobial resistance and increased bacterial virulence in the Galleria mellonella infection model display higher capacity to inhibit sugarcane pathogenic fungi suggest these two properties are interrelated. Our proposal aims to exploit this notion to find new ways to maximise the beneficial properties of Burkholderia for use in the field (e.g. antifungal production) while reducing iAMR in the clinic. We will combine molecular microbiology, genomics, and infection models in plants and insects to assess the hypothesis that antifungal production drives iAMR by influencing the production of molecules that enhance bacterial cell envelope impermeability resulting in increased antibiotic resistance, which in turn increases bacterial virulence. We will also exploit these findings to develop novel ways to inhibit iAMR and enhance pest biocontrol.   Extensive preliminary data combined from our two groups underpin this research programme aiming to decode the relationship between antifungal production, intrinsic antimicrobial resistance, and pest biocontrol in the B. seminalis model system and exploit this information to underpin biotechnological applications. The following specific aims will be carried out:   1. To define the overall regulation of iAMR and antifungal production upon antibiotic stress using mRNASEQ anal-ysis 2. To directly test the importance of iAMR in antifungal production and vice versa by constructing deletion mu-tants in key genes of B. seminalis involved in iAMR, which include those involved in the synthesis of exopolysaccha-rides, hopanoids, and the polyamine putrescine.  3. To test the ability of B. seminalis to kill the sugarcane borer larvae of Diatraea saccharalis.  Aligned to the BBSRC roadmap, this innovative project rises to the challenges of finding novel means to exploit biotechnologically useful bacteria to improve sugarcane farming and also to control its pests. Also, at the same time, these studies will provide a link to understand how antifungal production and iAMR are interrelated and identify regula-tory pathways that can be targeted for developing innovative antimicrobial therapies. These studies will be developed in the next two years following this pump priming award.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Burkholderiaceae comprises a family of environmental bacteria widespread around the planet, which reside in diverse environments and in association with plants, insects, animals, and humans and also display extraordinarily high multidrug, intrinsic antibiotic resistance. Intrinsic resistance means that these bacteria can tolerate large concentrations of many different classes of antibiotics. Burkholderia are very useful microorganisms for mankind. They can serve as agents for bioremediation, plant growth promotion, and pest biocontrol, but these beneficial properties remain virtually unexploitable because of fear of infection and antibiotic resistance. Indeed, some Burkholderia species are particularly dangerous to humans and domestic animals (e.g. melioidosis and glanders) and they are singled out as bioterrorism agents, while others (e.g. B. cenocepacia and B. multivorans) cause debilitating and often transmissible lung infections in cystic fibrosis patients.   Burkholderia spp. is a main bacterium of the sugarcane cultivable bacterial community in Brazil, and can control fungal and infections by producing many different antifungal compounds. Research in our laboratories show that strains with high-level antimicrobial resistance and increased bacterial virulence in a widely used insect infection model (Galleria mellonella) display higher capacity to inhibit sugarcane pathogenic fungi. These observations suggest that antimicrobial resistance and antifungal production are interrelated.   We hypothesise that antimicrobial resistance and antifungal compound production are coordinated to allow Burkholderia survival in the presence of a polymicrobial flora in the plants and also to defend and complete for nutrients against other organisms in the rhizosphere. Our proposal aims to exploit this idea to find new ways to maximise the beneficial properties of Burkholderia for use in the field (e.g. antifungal production) while reducing antimicrobial resistance in the clinic. We will combine molecular microbiology, genomics, and infection models in plants and insects to assess the hypothesis that antifungal production drives antimicrobial resistance by influencing the production of molecules that enhance bacterial cell envelope impermeability resulting in increased antibiotic resistance, which in turn increases bacterial virulence. We will also exploit these findings to develop novel ways to inhibit antimicrobial resistance and enhance pest biocontrol.</narrative>
