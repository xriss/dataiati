   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The MAP Network Plus Development Award will enable us to strengthen collaborative and equitable partnerships across multi-linguistic countries including Kyrgyzstan (Kyrgyz, Russian, Uzbek), Rwanda (Kinyarwanda, English, French, Swahili), Indonesia (Bahasa Indonesia), and Nepal (Nepali). Although all Co-Investigators speak and write in English alongside their mother tongue, the MAP Network Plus project will aim to explore varied translation practices for PI/Co-Is and project partners alongside stakeholders and beneficiaries to communicate in the language most comfortable and accessible for them. This process will be trialled across three main activities including the development of a website, webinar, and scoping visit. Text United software will be embedded within Microsoft Office and Sharepoint sites alongside the MAP website that will be developed through the Development Award funding. The software will enable the translation of communications via documents added to the website alongside email communications across all of the specified languages. During the webinar and scoping visit, translation will be explored through the use of simultaneous translation services and the use of arts-based methods as a communication and translation tool.   These activities will contribute to the aims, objectives and research agenda for the overarching MAP Network Plus project specified in the outline proposal through the consideration of AHRC Panel outline feedback. In particular, to address the following points: a) to explain the rationale behind the four country contexts that have been chosen; b) to develop the literature review and secure strong academic outputs as well as non-academic outputs; c) to discuss further how the Network Plus will address different languages; d) to consider the potential risks around securing access from governments and of capacity to influence national authorities if the suggested change to national curricula does not materialise in practice; e) to further develop objectives and pathways to impact to give alternative routes to change; and f) to expand on the experience of the PI and Project Team in regards to managing large projects and the support network that will be available from the RO(s).  MAP Network Plus will address these points through the noted activities as follows: a) Comparative Approach: The four country contexts have been chosen due to their varied engagement with former MAP-related training and use of arts-based research methods. In particular, the four countries will focus on varied aspects of impact from a local, regional and national/international level. The Development Award will enable some of the successes and challenges to be identified and for the in-country partners to establish a strong structure for South-South and North-South mentoring and to establish proposed pathways to impact. b) Capacity Building: The webinar and symposium will engage strong academic and non-academic partners to develop the literature review and to explore possible co-produced outputs; alongside the development of a grant and publication support strategy to be developed across all partnering countries.  c) Translation: The Text United software will be trialed to provide communication across all languages. This provision has been set as a high priority; especially to reach the most marginalised communities. Arts-based approaches have been adopted to provide another form of communication to engage young people and policy makers. d) Stakeholders: The Advisory Board will consist of key stakeholders to consider the potential risks around securing access from governments and of capacity to influence national authorities. In this way, proposing varied spheres of influence.  e) Management: Meetings will be conducted across the RO(s) with the pre and post award teams to establish a support network and to ensure cohesive management of the project at all levels and across institutions.</narrative>
