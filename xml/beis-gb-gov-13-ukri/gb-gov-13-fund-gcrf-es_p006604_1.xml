  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This proposed ESRC research network will be guided by a range of important objectives. They will include the following:  --Create a multi-disciplinary international network, within the thematic framework of dynamics of inequality, focused on women&apos;s labour force participation in three world regions: the Middle East, North Africa and South Asia. --Investigate (a) the interplay of economic structures, policies and institutions as the determinants of women&apos;s access to employment, and (b) patterns of women&apos;s economic participation as a key driver of the &quot;vertical&quot; and &quot;horizontal&quot; inequalities that will also be identified by the network researchers for the sample countries.     --Generate synergies and innovative ideas for future research on social and gender inequality by including researchers with relevant backgrounds but some of whom have not been involved so far in international development research (e.g., labour economists with a research focus on gender inequality in Southern Europe).   --Help shape debates and set new agendas for research in this field and help set up an infrastructure that can serve to continue the research. --Build research capacities by engaging in close collaboration with developing-country networks and NGOs in seeking future funding for the innovative research ideas identified by this network. Specifically, the network will address the following four thematic and technical issues: Impediments to women&apos;s access to jobs:  --What are the existing approaches to female labour force participation in the three regions (North Africa, the Middle East and South Asia) and what are the economic and social preconditions for the persistence of patriarchal practices and norms? --How relevant is the absence of work-family reconciliation policies and how does this affect female employment under different labour market institutions in the three regions?   --What are the implications of trade policies and structural changes on female employment?  How do these interact with workplace discrimination, other legal impediments to Female Labour Force Participation and the physical and social infrastructure provided for working women?  Effects on household well-being of women&apos;s lack of employment and income:   --What is the relationship between female employment, poverty and inequality under the different social policy regimes of the three regions? --Is there a relationship between the persistence of one-bread-winner families in the three regions and the persistence of income and consumption subsidies?     --How are national policy-makers addressing these issues? To what extent is low female labour force participation a matter of public discourse? The relationship between gender inequality and social stratification, and the implications for income inequality  --How can we best conceptualize social stratification and labour market segmentation in our sample countries and how does gender inequality map onto (align with) broader social inequality?    --What are the implications of these findings for the dynamics of inequality within households and individuals and among women themselves?   --What are the key methodological issues in measuring inequality among women and how are these issues related to overall measures of inequality? --How do women&apos;s organizations and trade unions address social and gender inequality?  What are the data requirements for addressing the above list of questions, and what gaps need to be filled?   Can the MENA and South Asia regions learn from the experience of one another as well as from the related experience of more developed regions such as Southern Europe?</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Within the ESRC core area of the &apos;Dynamics of Inequalities&apos;, this proposed multidisciplinary GCRF Research Network will focus its efforts on women&apos;s labour force participation and gender inequality in eight countries in three world regions: Iran and Turkey in the Middle East; Egypt, Morocco and Tunisia in North Africa; and Bangladesh, India and Sri Lanka in South Asia. In doing so, it also plans to draw on the related experience and expertise of researchers who have examined the same topic in Greece, Italy and Spain in Southern Europe.  This Network will concentrate its efforts in two areas: 1) the interplay of economic structures, policies and institutions in determining women&apos;s access to employment and 2) the patterns of women&apos;s economic participation as key determinants of gender inequality and social inequality in general. Of central concern in the Middle East and North Africa (the MENA region) is the apparent contradiction that while the educational gaps between women and men have narrowed and women have experienced rapid declines in their fertility rates, female labour force participation (FLFP) rates remain the lowest of any region in the world. In the countries of South Asia, despite variations between countries, average rates are the third lowest in the world, after the Middle East and North Africa.  Hence, one of the central concerns of this Network will be to help develop a research agenda that could contribute to explaining why female labour force participation rates are relatively low in these three regions despite their structural differences, and to leverage this contribution to help account for income inequality across households as well as across women themselves. The Southern European countries, particularly the three countries of Greece, Italy and Spain, are very interesting because they have a history of similar problems of social and gender inequalities and there is a rich literature upon which the researchers in this proposed Network could draw to help explain the nature of the historical trends in MENA and South Asia.  The exploratory work of this proposed Network in the above eleven countries will concentrate on four major research-related questions. (1) What are the impediments to women&apos;s access to jobs? (2) What are the effects on the household-level well-being of women&apos;s lack of employment and income? (3) What is the relationship between gender inequality and labour-market segmentation and what is the effect of gender inequality on broader forms of social inequality and income inequality? (4) What are the data requirements for addressing such research issues and what information gaps need to be filled?  In pursuing this agenda, our proposed Network will include researchers from academic and non-academic institutions (including NGOs) with vital and extensive experience in our area of focus. Included in these efforts will be PhD students as well as early career researchers. The Network members will constitute a multidisciplinary group, spanning the areas of economics, development studies, sociology, anthropology, demography, statistics and law. These researchers will come together in three workshops, two in London and one in Cairo (the latter in collaboration with the ERF), in order to collectively and intensively discuss the relevant issues and explore potential areas of research on women&apos;s labour force participation and gender inequality. As a result of these discussions, the network researchers will be organised into thematic working groups whose members will maintain contact with one another between workshops and will contribute inputs into the Research Briefs and Final Report produced by the Network as a whole.  Additional activities of this network will include organising panels at various international conferences and the active dissemination of the network&apos;s outputs to other interested researchers, NGOs and international institutions such as the World Bank, ILO &amp; UN Women.</narrative>
