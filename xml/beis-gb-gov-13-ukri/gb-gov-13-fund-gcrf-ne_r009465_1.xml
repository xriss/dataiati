   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In this project, we will use a newly developed system to tackle the air pollution hazard in Nicaragua. Air pollution is the largest environmental root of ill-health and premature loss of life. Each year it causes over 4 million deaths, with 90% of these in developing countries. Air pollution stems both from anthropogenic activities as well as a variety of natural sources. In the developing countries air pollution is generally poorly understood due to lack of scientific research and routine monitoring. Furthermore, while public air quality (AQ) alerts and advisories are legally mandated in the UK and other high-income countries, they are almost non-existent in the poorest parts of the world. The World Health Organisation therefore recommends that monitoring of air pollution is improved in the developing countries to better understand the impact it has on health, and to assist local authorities in establishing plans for improving AQ.   In a previous research project, our team looked at a poorly understood source of air pollution from persistently active volcanoes, using Masaya volcano in Nicaragua as a case study. Volcanic air pollution (VAP) is a chronic natural hazard potentially present in over 30 countries on the Official Development Assistance list but absent from their mitigation strategies. Almost nothing is known about the interaction of VAP with anthropogenic air pollution and the resulting impacts on health and the environment. Our previous project developed and trialled a system for monitoring VAP and assessed ways of making the system suitable for operational use. This new system can be used for monitoring AQ both from volcanoes and other sources, including anthropogenic activities such as traffic. We will install a network of permanent AQ stations that will stream data in real-time to the Nicaraguan natural hazards observatory. We will also introduce techniques and tools for visualising and interpret the data. Nicaragua already has a well-developed system for monitoring and mitigating a number of other natural hazards, such as earthquakes, hurricanes and tsunami. The AQ network will be integrated with the pre-existing system and used alongside monitoring of other hazards. We will be collaborating with the Nicaraguan natural hazards observatory, the civil protection, and multiple other local and international end-users. The AQ data will be used to make forecasts and issue public advisories for unhealthy air pollution levels. Public advisories allow the decision makers and the public to take measures to protect the most vulnerable persons, such as people with respiratory and heart conditions, children and the elderly. AQ monitoring also increases the awareness of decision makers and the public on air pollution issues, and is therefore an important initial step towards improving AQ in the country. We will be working closely with the local communities to ensure that the public advisories are applicable, easily understandable, and useful for their lifestyle. At the end of the project, the local end-users, such as the natural hazards observatory, will have the necessary capability and knowledge to run the AQ network and expand it as needed.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">UNRESP-OPS focuses on tackling the hazard posed by air pollution in Nicaragua. We propose to install an operational system of monitoring, forecasting and public advisories that will be fully integrated with the pre-existing national hazard monitoring system. The air quality (AQ) system will be able to monitor both anthropogenic pollution, but also volcanic air pollution (VAP) which is currently overlooked by disaster risk management in developing countries in spite of its prevalence and damaging impacts. Our objectives (O1-O4) have been devised to address three key aims: 1. Detecting threats posed by adverse AQ events (O1) 2. Helping decision makers manage threats (O2 and O3) 3. Protecting the public from threats (O3 and O4) O1: Installation of a network of air quality and meteorological stations. The network will consist of 4 permanent stations which will monitor several important air pollutants (gases and aerosol) well as the meteorological conditions. The data will be streamed in real-time to the natural hazards observatory INETER. The meteorological observations will also be fed into the forecasting model for VAP (see O2).  O2: Building capacity for in-country forecasting of VAP. The UNRESP foundation phase devised and tested a computational model which allows forecasting of the dispersion and concentration of VAP from Masaya volcano. The expertise in using the model, including the initialisation, operational running, and visualisation processes, will be transferred to INETER. INETER will gain the knowledge and technical capability to autonomously set up the use of the forecasting model for other volcanoes in Nicaragua, and provide training to other end-users. Objective O3: Integrating the AQ monitoring &amp; forecasting with the existing hazard monitoring network. The data from the monitoring network (O1) and the forecasting model (O2) will be fully integrated with the pre-existing hazard monitoring and mitigation system operated by INETER and civil protection organisation SINAPRED. This will be achieved in several steps: (1) Set up automated streaming of data from the AQ stations to INETER. (2) Establish tools and protocols for data processing and visualization. (3) Establish protocols for decision making. O3 will be achieved in close collaboration between INETER who are the expert end-user on monitoring natural hazards in Nicaragua, and UNRESP research team who have expertise in dealing with VAP, and air pollution from other sources.  Objective O4: Establish communication pathways on AQ issues between authorities and the public. The procedures for communicating the AQ data and public advisories will be developed and implemented in close collaboration between UNRESP research team and the end-users. We will build on the pre-existing institutional and local community practices documented and analysed within UNRESP foundation phase. Implementation of the public advisories will include: (1) Outreach to inform the communities about the rationale and benefits of monitoring AQ, as well as &apos;best practices&apos; of mitigating air pollution. (2)  Establishing a two-way communication system for communities to inform the authorities when they experience high pollution levels. This will have the double benefit of improving the AQ monitoring system, and raise the awareness and involvement within the communities</narrative>
