   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Everyday gadgets contain an impressive range of technology; very high quality sensors, cameras, and microprocessors are now incredibly cheap - making it possible to build lab equipment very cheaply.  Doing this would make a big difference in developing countries, as it enables better screening for diseases like malaria or TB, and makes it possible to study science in the lab as well as in theory.  The biggest challenge with this approach is often mounting the different parts together: good quality mechanical mounts are very expensive.  We will measure and develop micro-mechanical properties of printed plastic parts, and understand how the structure of the prints affects their strength and flexibility.  This will allow us to improve the way parts are printed, and create stronger, better mechanisms using only low-cost plastic.  Together with readily available parts, we will then design, build and test a number of optical lab instruments, including microscopes, spectrometers, and sample preparation equipment.  The 3D printers that are now found all over the world work by extruding plastic through a hot nozzle, and drawing shapes by moving the nozzle over a print bed.  3D objects can be made by stacking multiple layers on top of each other.  This layer-by-layer approach means that the exact path taken by the nozzle as it prints the object strongly affects the mechanical properties of the part, and it is this effect that we particularly want to understand and control. Once we have fully understood the relationship between the path taken by the nozzle and the properties of the final part, we will be able to create much better toolpaths to make objects that are stronger, weaker, stiffer or more flexible - and to balance these properties as we need them in different parts of a design.    This new printing process will allow us to create parts that move very precisely, which is a crucial part of building precision instruments such as microscopes, spectrometers, and more.  These instruments can be produced anywhere with a printer - including in many of the least developed countries in the world.  Our partners in Tanzania will pilot this, and work with local clinics, universities and schools to explore how these better, cheaper instruments can help improve education and healthcare.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="Our main objectives are to develop, together with partners in Tanzania, the underlying science of high performance printed polymer micro-mechanisms, and to use this to implement a number of high quality optical instruments with both immediate uses in healthcare and sanitation and longer-term applications in scientific labs.  Building capacity for innovation in developing nations is the objective that motivates our proposed research. The underlying science we will develop removes the current constraints on manufacturing high quality measurement instruments, and empowers a new generation of engineers and technologists to improve their local quality of life in ODA Least Developed Countries.  To this end, STICLab in Tanzania is a key partner in this grant, and will be involved in all the work packages. We include exchange visits in the programme to promote learning and exchange of knowledge between the UK team and Tanzania.  A new way to manufacture high quality apparatus is the key engineering challenge. Our objectives here are first to understand the micro-mechanical functional properties of 3D printed objects, and second to use this understanding to print objects with tailored mechanical properties, and to design better components such as clips, translation stages, and optical assemblies.  Our third science objective is to validate the functional properties of recycled PET as a printing feedstock; this can be formed from recycled plastic bottles, reducing costs of expensive imports and increasing environmental sustainability.  The culmination of our work is the development and validation of a number of instruments that will be used in Tanzania and across the developing world, as well as in many situations in the UK.  We will develop a robust, versatile microscope suitable for quantifyable laboratory use, and a configurable spectrometer able to function as a simple colorimetric readout or a high-resolution detector.  We will document these to international standards, foster the incorporation of local development cycles, and road-test our assembly instructions in a variety of situations including maker labs in Africa, ensuring our instruments can be sustainably built, developed, and maintained there.  Our milestones are: Work Package 1: Material Properties &amp; Microstructure Milestone 1.1: Mechanical Characterisation Milestone 1.2: Recycled Filament Milestone 1.3: Mechanical Modelling Milestone 1.4: Temperature, Speed &amp; Flow  Work Package 2: Smart Printing Milestone 2.1: Designs with Functional Hints Milestone 2.2: Printing with Optimised Blocks Milestone 2.3: Optimally Microstructured Prints  Work Package 3: Lab Grade Microscopes &amp; Spectrometers Milestone 3.1: Lab Grade Microscopy Milestone 3.2: Spectrometers for Molecular Detection Milestone 3.3: Micromanipulation Milestone 3.4: Sample Preparation Milestone 3.5: Local Innovation Cycle"></capital-spend>
