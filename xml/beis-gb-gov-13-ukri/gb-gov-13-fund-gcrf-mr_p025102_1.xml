   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Violence against women is a violation of human rights and threatens the status, health and well-being of women. Overall, 35% of women worldwide have experienced either physical and/or sexual intimate partner violence or non-partner sexual violence, with a higher prevalence in most low and middle income countries (LMIC). Violence against women damages women&apos;s health. Women who have been have been physically and/or sexually abused by their partner are twice as likely to have an abortion, twice as likely to suffer from depression and in some regions 1.5 times more likely to acquire HIV compared to women who have not experienced such violence. They are also 16% more likely to deliver a low birth weight baby. In addition, children who are exposed to violence against their mothers are more likely to experience long term damage to their health and development. Therefore, prevention of violence against women and development of a health care response is a global priority.   This study aims to understand how primary healthcare systems in low and middle income countries can develop and evaluate interventions for violence against women that link with community services. The research will build on existing research collaborations with academics,  health care providers and violence against women services in  the Occupied Palestinian Territories and Brazil. The research aims to address the following:  1) Explore to what extent the primary health care system in Palestine and Brazil can identify women who are affected by violence and abuse and offer support and referrals to services that can help them.  2) Draw on a proven UK intervention and adapt it to the Palestinian and Brazilian context through discussions with local stakeholders.  3) Pilot test the agreed intervention.  The findings of the research will be of benefit to violence against women and health systems researchers worldwide. It will also be of benefit to health policy makers and health care practitioners who want to develop a health care response to violence against women.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="The proposed collaborative project aims to understand how primary healthcare systems in low and middle income (LMIC) countries can develop and evaluate interventions for violence against women (VAW) that link with community services, and ultimately ensure better health outcomes for women and their children. Building on existing research collaborations with academics,  health care providers and VAW services in two LMIC (Occupied Palestinian Territories and Brazil) we will conduct multidisciplinary research to:  1) Evaluate the readiness of the primary care system in Palestine and in Brazil to integrate identification of VAW, to  care for survivors and to offer referral to VAW services.  2) Adapt a UK evidence-based intervention, through engagement with stakeholders, and test its feasibility in primary health care (PHC) centres in Palestine and Brazil.  3) Develop a multi-disciplinary network of researchers and service providers who have demonstrated a commitment to implementing and testing VAW interventions in PHC settings to build research capacity and exchange knowledge.   4) Secure additional funding for a programme of research, including in DfID priority countries"></capital-spend>
