   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Over a three year period, the Academy for African Migration Research will undertake two key activities:   (1) Four &apos;institutes&apos; to provide capacity building for doctoral students and early-career researchers who are a maximum of 3-years post-PhD, to refine their research focus and promote professional development and scholarly contributions. (2) A series of research visits/exchanges for established academics and postdoctoral fellows to support building research capacity and strengthening the intellectual project for migration research in Africa.  The Academy currently includes seven institutions in 5 countries [TBC].  Applications for the institutes will be accepted from doctoral students and early-career researchers from any African institute.    1. University of Addis Ababa and/or OSSREA, Ethiopia 2. University of Ghana, Legon, Accra, Ghana 3. Makerere University, Kampala, Uganda 4. Eduardo Mondlane University, Maputo, Mozambique 5. University of the Western Cape, Cape Town, South Africa 6. University of Cape Town, South Africa 7. University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa  Institutes: A series of four &apos;institutes&apos; will be held at different locations across the ARUA network, each focusing on a different thematic area: migration and urbanization; migration, health and wellbeing; belonging, difference and diaspora; and, the knowledge politics of migration research in Africa.  These institutes will also incorporate professional development training, including the development of peer-support and mentorship mechanisms.  A final event will be held in the final/third year.  This will take the form of a conference for early career researchers and postgraduate students - including those who have participated in the institutes - working on migration and mobility in Africa.    The institutes will be designed to:   - Support African migration scholars to embrace theory building, engagement with migration/social theory, and the knowledge politics associated with migration research in Africa. Participants will benefit from rigorous theoretical and methodological foundations in inter-disciplinary migration studies in addition to disciplinary perspectives from resource persons.  - Offer practical professional advice/professional development including: academic publishing; project management; organising and managing data; consulting colleagues and others in the field; and the risks and benefits of interdisciplinary work in an academic universe still largely organised in disciplinary formations.  - Provide mentorship and peer support by facilitating engagements between doctoral students, early career researchers and established academics both virtually and in-person.  These structures will provide support for the required outputs associated with the institutes, including written work; presentation skills; and the development of professional CVs and online profiles.   Research visits/exchanges: The Academy will fund various activities for established and early career researchers.  Funds will be awarded on a competitive basis, and will be assessed by a review panel made up on their planned activities and outputs.  Preference will be given to proposals aiming to support research capacity building and strengthening of the intellectual project for migration research in Africa.  All proposals will need to demonstrate collaboration/partnership building as a central activity. - one-week visits for established researchers to travel to another institution to undertake teaching/supervision/research exchanges;  - one-month visiting postdoctoral fellowships; and  - symposiums and/or proposal development workshops to support the establishment of new research partnerships.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="The ARUA Centre of Excellence (CoE) on Migration and Mobility will support building capacity, partnerships and an Africa-led research agenda on migration and mobility amongst the next generation of African migration scholars. Through a &apos;hub and spoke&apos; model currently involving six institutions in four countries, the CoE will facilitate a series of activities to meet this aim, through establishing the Academy for African Migration Research (AAMR). The proposed Academy draws from a successful model -the Academy for African Urban Diversity-which is hosted at the African Centre for Migration &amp; Society (ACMS) at the University of the Witwatersrand.  The AAMR will bring together doctoral students and early career researchers (ECRs) -who are max 3-years post-PhD- who are based at African institutions to discuss and debate Africa&apos;s contemporary migration and mobility trends, and associated concerns. Dedicated to supporting the next generation of African migration scholars, the Academy will bring together emerging African scholars who approach the study of migration from various disciplinary perspectives, including political science, sociology, anthropology, public health and urban studies. Participants will consider how both established and emerging scholars are developing Africa-oriented migration research agendas, concepts and theories, in ways that are interdisciplinary, historicised and explicitly comparative across different African contexts. By building a transcontinental cohort of scholars concerned with migration in Africa, the Academy not only strengthens students&apos; and ECR&apos;s existing scholarship, but also forges the networks necessary for future comparative work and grant applications. The emphasis on emerging academics also enhances the various departments and faculties that these scholars are attached to and fills the knowledge training and production gap that has been identified by many universities on the continent. In addition to building research capacity, the Academy also aims to fill gaps in professional development that are often missing in African-based graduate training. This includes workshops on academic writing, developing funding proposals and job applications, and building teaching and supervision skills. Where possible, it will also expose students to innovative methodological approaches drawing on the social sciences and humanities. Although not a technical training facility, such exposure offers the grounding for further individual or collective exploration.  Established researchers will be involved as key resource people, providing opportunities for strengthening existing - and building new - research partnerships across the continent, between both ARUA and non-ARUA members. Institutions will draw on affiliated faculties and extensive local and international migration research networks to speak on the various theoretical and thematic focuses - and professional development priorities - that will guide the work of the Academy. The proposed programme of work is organised around a set of mutually reinforcing objectives under two key themes:    Building research capacity of the next generation of African migration scholars: - Foster more theoretically informed work on migration and mobility in Africa  - Incubate a network of emerging African scholars deeply connected to peers and colleagues across the continent, and with other global contexts - Increase the visibility of African scholars in the scholarly/theoretically informed literature on migration in Africa  Supporting professional development of the next generation of African migration scholars: - Build professional development skills, including in teaching, supervision, writing research proposals, project management, peer reviewing, building professional CVs and online profiles - Creating peer support and mentorship opportunities, including the pairing of doctoral students with ECRs and established academics - Develop online networking platform"></capital-spend>
