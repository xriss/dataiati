   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Community, Science and Education: An interdisciplinary perspective for facing ecological crises in Mexico and South America</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In Mexico and the South American region there is a need to share knowledge across educators, scientists, teachers, community leaders and policy makers in constructing ways to bring education close to the concerns and needs of marginalised communities. We will be working with communities facing pressures related to global challenges of poverty, health access, water supply and climate change. Our focus is on the strategic GCRF challenge of education and, specifically, sharing expertise in making primary and secondary education relevant to the socioscientific issues faced by communities in Mexico and South America.  Initially we will convene work in Mexico and focus on the educational responses required to support communities in preparing for and preventing crises related to environmental and health pressures brought about by water shortage and water contamination. In Mexico and South America such issues are complex and related to poverty and access to services. Our approach is to bring together interdisciplinary expertise with the aim of proposing an educational response relevant to the local and specific conditions of those communities and schools. Our principled belief is that a normative sharing of &quot;best practice&quot; or &quot;what works&quot; (perhaps still the predominant approach) will inevitably fail to meet the specific needs of communities facing different challenges in different contexts. Our Network will begin with particular issues in identified communities and grow in a modular manner, incorporating other groups and other challenges and sharing the diversity of approaches needed to bring education close to lived issues. The Network will act as a repository for skills and expertise in which we stay close to community concerns, learning with and through those academics and non-academics who have experience and connections in the communities involved. We will be documenting our on-going work via a website, established and maintained in Spanish and English.  We will concentrate initially on two areas: rural communities from the Tlaxcala state; and, urban communities from Mexico City. Members of our team have been working with rural communities from Tlaxcala state since 2005, engaging in ecological research aimed at determining the adverse effects of environmental pollution on the health of children and people living near to the Atoyac River, the third most polluted river in Mexico. The team also has existing links to communities in the Xochimilco and Iztapalapa areas of Mexico City, where inhabitants face severe environmental and water issues. Having established networks with two communities in each region, we will then build to work with six further communities in Mexico, again engaging in immersion meetings in those communities, collecting our new knowledge at plenary conferences and disseminating via workshops to teachers and via work with policy-makers.   We will move from the particular to the general, sharing knowledge about how to bring education close to community concerns. We will disseminate our learning internationally and exploit our international links in order to progressively include colleagues from Chile, Argentina, Brazil, and other South America countries in which marginalized communities face environmental crisis. We anticipate being able to share the stories and resources generated in each of the communities with whom we work, and also articulating our learning about the process of working in inter-disciplinary teams and effecting educational change. Both sets of learning will be significant in terms of putting the case to influence educational policy, to support schools in paying attention to community concerns, and in terms of bidding for funds to continue the life of the Network beyond this grant.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This proposal has six objectives, each one is elaborated below in turn.   1) Network across researchers (from Sciences and Education), policy makers, teachers and communities facing acute ecological issues. This networking will include connections with local and international organizations, including the Commission of Human Rights in Mexico, Latin American Water Tribune and UNESCO. We have named communities with whom we will be working in the first instance and with whom we have existing contacts. Networking will take place via three different kinds of meetings: network plenary meetings; immersion meetings; dissemination meetings. The plenary meetings will last of 2 to 3 days in Mexico City, for the whole network, including International collaborators. Immersion meetings will take place for 2 days, within our focus communities. There will generally be a group of seven network members attending these meetings and joining with a range of other community and school representatives and leaders. Dissemination meetings will take place largely in the form of workshops for teachers and events for policy makers.  2) Develop mathematics and science education responses which prepare marginalised communities for preventing and responding to environmental crises, particularly water crises. A key purpose of our networking activities is to generate a local and appropriate educational response, sensitive to the issues of concern within each community with whom we work. In other words, network meetings will have a practical and accountable aim, to lead to ideas and materials appropriate for classroom, or teacher education use.  3) Disseminate training (focusing on Mexican, South American and other international teams and organizations interested in related issues). After the phase of immersing ourselves within communities and then coming together to share experiences at plenary conferences, we will then prepare workshops for teachers, to support curriculum and classroom innovation. There will be two cycles of these activities, in year 1 focused on two rural and two urban communities and in year 2, expanding to six further communities in the same areas and engaging with international colleagues.  4) Construct recommendations for curricular policies, teacher training, professional development and teaching strategies. These recommendations will be at two levels; one linked to the particular communities and issues in focus (i.e., initially dealing with water and environmental problems at urban and rural communities in Mexico, but then broadening to other communities in Mexico and beyond); and a second, focused on the methodology of interdisciplinary, community approaches relevant for facing ecological problems in Mexico and South America more generally.  5) Engage with policy makers in Mexico and beyond. From the start of the life of the network, we will be alerting national policy makers in Mexico and inviting them to plenary events. There are specific dissemination activities planned for year 2 which will target policy makers, with the aim of recommending policy change that allows the kind of curriculum and classroom practice that emerges through the network&apos;s activities.  6) Build a sustainable Network across other countries in South America. Once we have experience of working within our two initial communities, we will begin the process of using what we have learnt to construct a funding bid to sustain the network beyond the life of this funding. There will be opportunities for adding a research element to the work, particularly if network meetings provide us with some evidence of impact. We have also identified the British Academy Newton Advanced Fellowship (UK) and National Council of Science and Technology (Mexico) as possible sources of funding we will pursue, which would allow a continued knowledge exchange across network members.</narrative>
