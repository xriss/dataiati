   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Communicating effectively, understanding and being understood, prioritizing essential information, or differentiating between reliable and fake news, require cognitive and social skills learnt through socialization and education. These skills are not equal across social sectors (Freire 1992:71), but are essential because we depend on accessing, analysing and categorizing information to make informed decisions. They are particularly important when living through the current pandemic.   In Brazil, an ODA country of 210 million people, a quarter of the population lives below the poverty line, experiencing not only the direct effects of the virus infection, but also the impact from the disorganization of underfunded health services and social insecurity. Additionally, local efforts to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 are hindered by fake news (Ricard &amp; Medeiros 2020). This phenomenon begs the questions of how fake news impacts vulnerable groups shaping their perception of the pandemic, and how communication is used by the pandemic-response networks to support mitigation strategies.   This interdisciplinary project falls within the remit of AHRC/GCRF by bringing Language, Culture, and Intercultural Communication together with Development Studies, Gamification and Healthcare. Grounded in Paolo Freire&apos;s philosophy of education and framed by theories from sociolinguistics, specifically in critical language awareness (Fairclough 1995), discourse and power (Van Dick 2003 &amp; 2009), access to education and information through family literacy practices (Rogers 2003), and access to healthcare (Angelelli 2004), this project focusses on vulnerable groups in deprived metropolitan areas and their access to information, communication and decision-making in relation to COVID-19.  Researchers and professionals from various disciplines (languages, culture, critical discourse, gamification, intercultural communication, communities and society, nursing and social care) work together to benefit vulnerable groups at higher risk, i.e. homeless, Favelas dwellers, and garbage pickers in cooperatives in Goi&#xE2;nia (state of Goi&#xE1;s). Given our team&apos;s previous experiences with these communities and the trust gained, we are in the unique position to access the sites where we can study this phenomenon and bring creative and innovative ways to empower the most vulnerable sectors of the population.   Conducting this research is imperative because the results will support and inform local efforts to control the pandemic, such as the plan of action of the social and technical-scientific network (FIOCRUZ) and CUFA (Central Unica de Favelas) to confront COVID-19 in slums. We believe the time has come to conduct this research and to implement our strategies before COVID-19 claims even more lives among these neglected and vulnerable groups.  References Angelelli, C.

  <capital-spend percentage="This project is guided by the following research question and subquestions:   How is fake news undermining local pandemic mitigating efforts among vulnerable groups in metropolitan areas in Brazil?  a. How does the proliferation of fake news among vulnerable groups undermine the local pandemic mitigating efforts?  b. How do members of vulnerable groups make decisions about prioritizing information?   c. What communitarian communicative strategies increase the effectiveness of current pandemic mitigation efforts?  d. How does developing socio-culturally appropriate critical thinking skills help vulnerable groups assess news?   To answer the questions above we have designed the following objectives   1. Identify what information on COVID 19 is available to vulnerable groups and how they select and access it. 2. Explore how participants assign trust to information.  3. Tailor and implement a socio-cultural appropriate model of critical thinking skills to assess information.  4. Explore new approaches (involving humans and technology) and capitalise on current local efforts to mitigate the negative impact of fake news. 5. Empower vulnerable groups by becoming more critical consumers of information. 6.     Establish networks of information within communities. 7.     Design a methodological framework to allow replicating similar studies and task-designs among vulnerable groups in other metropolitan contexts of the Global South."></capital-spend>
