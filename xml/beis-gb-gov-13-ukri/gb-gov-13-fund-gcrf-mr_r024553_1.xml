   <narrative xml:lang="EN">OBJECTIVES The objectives of the proposed project are:   1) to have created an equitable and productive interdisciplinary Partnership, as indicated by the quality and amount of work accomplished plus expressed interest in continuing the Partnership (in whatever form the members deem most suitable)   2) to have produced a guiding framework that supports building a collegial partnership (e.g., a Partnership Manifesto, a Monitoring &amp; Evaluation framework that uses locally generated participatory and traditional indicators of success, a Theory of Change and Action to guide our work, documented examples of how we built knowledge and research capacity for both UK and Vietnamese partners)   3) to develop yet-to-be-identified means of bringing creative and visual arts to the forefront of our work that will result in increased discussion about breast health in public forums, increase knowledge of the disease and how to minimise its impact through early diagnosis in our targeted community, and to ensure that local healthcare providers are equipped to meet (hopefully) increased demand for early-stage diagnosis through clinical breast exams  4) concrete evidence of having created opportunities for various stakeholders to contribute to the Partnership (e.g., to manage a website that has increasing number of viewers per month; to host a well-attended public event at the end of the Partnership where we not only share what we have done and learned, but also organise a townhall meeting or host round-table discussions to elicit ideas from women living with cancer/family members, health and social service providers, community leaders, policymakers and researchers)  5) evidence of having captured the experiences, voices, culture and context of people whose lives have been affected by breast cancer plus transformative products based on this evidence (e.g. recommendations for policymaker, concrete actions that local health centres can take to increase knowledge or ability to seek early diagnosis)   6) to produce two potentially life-saving arts- and narrative-based interventions for future testing regarding their effectiveness, acceptability, feasibility, and cost-effectiveness, ready for pilot and full testing in future funded grants  7) to close the Partnership with a 2-day workshop where we produce an early draft of one or more research protocol to be developed into grant applications for future funding by the end of our Partnership</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">SUMMARY  Non-communicable diseases (NCDs), including cancer, will cause nearly 70% of all deaths in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) by 2020. Globally breast cancer (BC) is the leading cancer in women, responsible for 571,000 deaths in 2015. Breast cancer is of particular concern in LMICs because death from this disease occurs much more frequently than in industrialized nations. Often this is because the disease is already advanced when a woman comes in for a diagnosis.   To address this problem the World Health Organisation consulted international experts and developed a set of guidelines for national governments. Countries with few resources should include, at the very least, culturally appropriate public education on breast health that explains why early detection through breast self-exam is important, along with quick diagnosis with clinical breast exams (CBE).    Studies show there are many social and cultural reasons behind this, such as fear, fatalism, a belief in a spiritual or supernatural case that cannot be cured with modern medicine, concern over disfigurement, or competing family and work duties. Research shows that straightforward messages about health do not address these underlying issues and so it is difficult to promote healthier behaviours in people.  Two different approaches seem to create more chances for healthy behaviour change. They both use narrative or storytelling but in very different ways. One method is to work with artists to create informatoin-edutainment (education + entertainment) material that draws people into a story where they can experience the situation or identify with the characters. Examples are soap operas on TV or the radio. Other examples are live arts performances that highlight dance or music, textiles that tell a story, or poetry and song. There is no prescription to identify what communication channel will work best, which is why research groups such as ours have targeted this as a useful focus for study.   Another approach is more research-based, starting with focus groups to talk with people who live with a particular health problem and identify very eloquent speakers in the group. Then they are individually videotaped telling their experiences, with a public health message at the end of their story. This approach was developed and used to control high blood pressure, which is a risk factor for heart disease, in the U.S. and Viet Nam. Those researchers showed some people these story-based DVDs and others saw just medical information. More of the people who saw the patient stories controlled their hypertension through better diet, more exercise or medication than the other group.  We don&apos;t know how this will work with a different health problem (breast cancer) and different target behaviour (get diagnosed early).    Our aims are to create an interdisciplinary collaborative group of people from Viet Nam and the UK to carry out the work, identify what is already known about breast cancer control in LMICs, gather new information on what experts and the Vietnamese mass media say about breast cancer, and study local beliefs and experiences on breast cancer prevention and diagnosis in Viet Nam. We will use that information to develop material for a locally tailored, arts- and narrative-led information-edutainment campaign plus for a culturally relevant patient storytelling approach. Our next step would be to test how well these approaches can reduce the amount of time it takes for women suspecting they have breast cancer to seek a diagnosis.    The potential applications and benefits of this Partnership are: to increase knowledge and research capacity, create opportunities for this group and others to learn how to create equitable research-to-action partnerships, and learn how the arts + humanities + health sciences work to develop material that can save lives,</narrative>
