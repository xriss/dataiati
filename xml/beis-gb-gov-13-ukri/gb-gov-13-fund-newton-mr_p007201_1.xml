   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Both in China and the UK methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) remain an important problem that can lead to life threatening infections. A type of MRSA called livestock-associated MRSA (LA-MRSA) has been found both in China and the UK. While many strains of S. aureus seem to be restricted to particular host species, LA-MRSA are characterised by the fact that they freely jump between farm animals and people. The reservoir of LA-MRSA found on farms represents a considerable threat to human health and accounts for a large proportion of human MRSA infections in countries such as Denmark and the Netherlands. Recent reports from China show that the dominant LA-MRSA strains in China are different to those in Europe and North America. This research will determine the prevalence of LA-MRSA in China. Using whole genome sequencing, LA-MRSA found in people and animals will be compared to determine if these bacteria are transmitted from farms to people and also to look for genes that may be associated with the ability of LA-MRSA to colonise both people and animals. Farms where LA-MRSA are found will be compared to farms free of LA-MRSA to investigate any risk factors that may be associated with the presence of LA-MRSA. Further investigations of the host specificity of LA-MRSA will be performed using a technique called transposon mutagenesis. A library of many thousands of mutants will be made in LA-MRSA strains and used to identify individual genes that may play a role in enabling LA-MRSA avoid the immune defences of host animals and people.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="The aim of the proposed research is to investigate livestock-associated lineages of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (LA-MRSA) in China and the UK.  The objectives for the proposed research are:  1. Determine the prevalence of LA-MRSA in farms in China, identify a cohort of farms where LA-MRSA is present, perform next generation sequencing of LA-MRSA isolates and determine the population structure and molecular epidemiology of LA-MRSA in China. This objective will also include a survey of human MRSA isolates from hospitals in the same region for LA-MRSA  2. Undertake a case control study to compare farms where LA-MRSA is present with those farms where it is absent in order to identify out-competing methicillin susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) lineages, husbandry and management factors that may be associated with the presence of LA-MRSA.  3. Make transposon mutant libraries of the major lineages of LA-MRSA (ST398 MRSA in the UK and ST9 in China, which have a broad host range) and host specific (porcine &amp; human) lineages, and use these to identify genes that may be associated with host colonisation using in vitro assays."></capital-spend>
