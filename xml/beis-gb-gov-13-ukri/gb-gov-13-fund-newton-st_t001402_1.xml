   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Universities of Glasgow/Birmingham/Strathclyde/UWS/Sheffield/Southampton/Cardiff in the UK and IUCAA/TIFR Hyderabad/IISER Pune/IIT Madras in India have been working on a Newton-Bhabha award running from 2017-2020. This project is in the field of gravitational wave detection and underpins the 3rd LIGO detector currently being constructed in India. The project has been extremely successful, running multiple staff/student exchanges both to the UK and India, providing Indian focussed entrepreneurial meetings, and developing local language leaflets/books, games and tabletop interferometers for distribution in India. This proposal aims to capitalise on that investment, building critical capacity and infrastructure in India, while enhancing entrepreneurial activity and STEM/Outreach activities. The objectives of this proposal, which aims to continue/grow the current project, are three-fold;  1. to foster the growth of the gravitational wave (GW) community in India and create strong ties with them by creating a training network to build capacity for interdisciplinary research. This training network will allow students and early career researchers from India to be trained by UK GW experts, taking this knowledge back to India to strengthen capability. The UK consortia has significant experience in developing technology and data analysis tools, whilst at the same time sharing these outputs across international collaborations. We propose a model where staff/postdoc/student exchanges to/from UK and India will be an effective method to share knowledge, experience and solve the technological challenges during the development of a new infrastructure in India. It is critical to build human capacity, as during the next 2-3 years the LIGO India collaboration is expanding rapidly in-country.  2. to encourage entrepreneurial activity. The very nature of our field, where we are pushing the boundary of technology and analysis tools, and observing the most extreme astrophysical events in the universe has a numbers of applications which can directly benefit the development of entrepreneurial activity. Specific examples in the UK include data analysis tools for line rejection, analysis of retinal images, development of MEMS-based accelerometers, low power gas sensors and stem cell differentiation through vibration. We will share best practice with our Indian colleagues by allowing them to engage with the academics and researchers who have been key in developing these spin-offs, and with Indian industry who will be key to building LIGO India. A recent highlight of our ongoing Newton-Bhabha project is support of a UK focussed delegation funded by the British Trade Embassy in Pune in April 2019.  3. implementation of a strong and vibrant outreach programme. The UK consortium also has a strong record of public engagement and enthusing the general public and school children about GW astronomy. Again this is an essential component to recruit the next generation of scientists. We propose to work closely with contacts in India to further develop outreach resources (suitable for both Indian/English speaking participants) and utilise the as a teaching tool to generate interest at early stages of schooling, ultimately with the aim of enhancing the provision and retention of STEM based students studying in high school and university. The programme allows the fabrication of outreach exhibits to take into Indian schools and science fairs, developing CPD for teachers by utilsiing cutting edge scientific themes such as Gravitational Waves. We also propose to engage within the Indian science outreach community including the India International Science Festivals and National Science Days.  For this proposal, we have introduced a new partner (IIT Bombay) and expanded the Indian Co-Is to 10. This shows a growing Indian community with high potential for sustainability.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">With the first direct observation of gravitational waves from coalescing black holes and neutron stars by the LIGO/VIRGO Scientific collaborations (2015) there has been great interest around the world in extending the reach of the future detector network, as gravitational wave astronomy opens a new window on the Universe. Indeed with the detection of a gravitational and electromagnetic signature from GW170817, a binary neutron start inspiral, the era of multi-messenger astronomy is truly here.   With the siting of the 3rd aLIGO detector in India, an Indian megaproject, there is an essential need for critically skilled students, postdocs and early career researchers to be trained at the highest level in gravitational wave astronomy, for construction of the infrastructure &amp; technology, development of high performance computing/machine learning algorithms and efficient data pipelines. In turn, the LIGO India project will help Indian scientific community to be a major player in the emerging research frontier of GW astronomy. There are further opportunities to captalise on the recently STFC funded A+ upgrade (STFC are supporting the $30million NSF aLIGO upgrade at 30%), allowing the LIGO India detector to integrate the most up-to-date technology when it is switched on in 2024.  Based on the model of the LIGO Scientific Collaboration, there is a huge potential for inclusive growth across many areas of industry, academia and society. The UK consortia also have a strong track record of outreach &amp; public engagement, which will be shared with our Indian collaborators; IUCAA Pune, IISER Pune, TIFR Hyderabad, Indian Institute Technology Madras and Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, who are tasked with growing the scientific community in India. We are also working to develop linkages with the Department of Atomic Energy organisations: Institute for Plasma Research (IPR), Gandhinagar and the Raja Ramanna Centre for Advanced Technology (RRCAT), Indore who will be leading the development of infrastructure (laser, vacuum system, suspensions and seismic isolation).  The main objectives of this proposal are to build up technical capacity and capability in India in a broad range of multidisciplinary fields associated with gravitational wave detection. This field is very wide in nature and the technologies required range from delicate mechanical instrumentation, through high and low power laser optics to signal processing and large data handling, and thus capacity built up from the work of this proposal will have wide application in other fields. We have already identified several UK-India company linkages in the areas of machine learning, sensors &amp; autonomous systems &amp; data algorithms, and we propose to share our experience of methods to spin-out high technology research into applied fields. A British Trade Embassy delegation to the UK in April 2019, funded by our current award, is a key indicator of the potential in this area.  The consortium behind this proposal in the UK - the Universities of the West of Scotland, Glasgow, Cardiff, Birmingham, Strathclyde, Southampton, and Sheffield - has a strong and extensive track record in detector development, data analysis and background theory and astrophysics for the gravitational wave field, as well as working with industry, in public outreach and school teacher CPD. Thus it is ideally suited to provide training for students, research assistants and early career researchers in the ODA country of India to build capacity and make these countries major contributors to the international community and to provide dedicated summer schools/workshops in the UK utilising the expansive UK training network, for training the incoming members from the ODA countries in the necessary data analysis and experimental hardware techniques. Further the consortium will arrange opportunities for researchers to travel to/from India and the UK to capacity build and perform on-site training of researchers</narrative>
