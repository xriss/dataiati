   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Zoonoses, have profound impacts on the health and wellbeing of people and animals in Tanzania and globally. Their range
of impacts and epidemiological complexity necessitates the adoption of interdisciplinary One Health approaches to
research, control strategies, and policy-making. The need to meet the challenges of zoonoses has been explicitly
recognized in Tanzania with the drafting of the Tanzanian One Health Strategy Document in 2015.
Our training programme has been designed to deliver tailored training to post-graduate students, postdocs and researchers
addressing these challenges in Tanzania. More broadly, our training programme aligns to multiple GCRF developing
country priorities including Secure and resilient food systems; Sustainable health and wellbeing; Sustainable livelihoods;
Sustainable production and consumption and Prevention of diseases in humans and farm animals.
To ensure sustainability, capacity-strengthening efforts must be led by local institutions and to enable this, it is critical that
multi-institutional and cross-sectoral partnerships are forged. Joint training is a powerful way to build these links. Our
training program will deliver a regionally unique combination of skills development and training opportunities. The overall
aim of this training programme is to equip a cadre of African research scientists with the skills and expertise to tackle the
threats of zoonoses, address priority One Health research questions and policy decisions and thus promote the economic
development and welfare of Tanzania.
Our team has a strong track record of collaborative research work and previous/current training activities. Through
discussions and collaborations with partners in Tanzania we have identified two specific skills gaps and training needs that
this training programme is designed to focus on:
1 - social science research skills training for disease intervention development and evaluation
2 - laboratory diagnostics for priority zoonoses in Tanzania
The training programme developed to meet these needs includes One Health summer schools at NM-AIST, Specialist
laboratory skills courses at KCRI and research experience placements. Specific programme objectives include:
1 - delivery of lecture based and practical training courses on One Health, zoonoses control, relevant elements of social
science, and intervention development to post-graduate students and researchers
2 - development of enhanced operational capacity to diagnose zoonotic pathogens that are identified priorities for control in
Tanzania
3 - provision of opportunities for students and researchers working in Tanzania to travel to the UK to undertake research
experience placements
4 - creation of networking and communication opportunities that foster responsive practices of training co-development and
delivery of One health training and skills development
5 - development of materials and contribute expertise that can inform the development of One Health curricula for
Tanzanian universities
This programme provides significant opportunities to add value to existing research and training platforms. Beneficiaries of
this programme will include: the individuals trained and the organisations they come from; the applicant institutions which
will benefit from the fostering of a self-sustaining interdisciplinary One-Health research hub; the users of human and
veterinary clinical diagnostic services available in Tanzania and consequent impacts on human and animal health. An
advisory group will be established for this programme to provide guidance on the development of learning resources,
appropriate delivery mechanisms and ensure maximal added value and alignment of training delivery to meet
national/regional needs.</narrative>
