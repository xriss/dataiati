   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Optimizing health systems to improve delivery of decentralized care for patients with drug resistant tuberculosis</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The aim of the project is to identify opportunities for feasible, short to medium term interventions to improve decentralization of services for patients with drug-resistant TB (DR-TB) in South Africa.  South Africa has a high DR-TB burden with more than 26,000 cases of rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis (RR-TB) reported in 2013. However, only 42% of these patients were reported to have initiated second-line treatment. South Africa moved towards a policy of decentralized treatment provision in 2011, recognizing that centralised care, with lengthy inpatient treatment for all diagnosed patients, would be unable to meet the demand for treatment.    There is considerable diversity in the extent and type of decentralization of care for DR-TB across health districts in South Africa - and substantial variation in the performance of the DR-TB program in relation to key measures of success such as linkage to appropriate care and treatment outcome. We hypothesize that the successful implementation of an appropriate model of decentralized care for DR-TB is associated with positive patient pathways to care (in terms of equity, access to and quality of care) and good patient outcomes. We therefore wish to  (i) characterise features of decentralized care that are associated with positive pathways and outcomes for patients and (ii) determine health systems constraints and enablers for the successful implementation of decentralized care for DR-TB patients in South Africa.   Objectives:  1. Characterise and clarify relevant health systems features pertaining to existing policy on decentralized care for DR-TB in South Africa. This would include aspects of: organizational structure, referral systems, integration with drug-susceptible and HIV services, financing mechanisms, human resources, infrastructure, accountability mechanisms and information systems.   2. Identify those features or types of decentralized care that are associated with (i) positive patient pathways to care, including measures of access (proportion of patients accessing care) and equity (profile of patients accessing care) and (ii) outcomes, including measures of quality of care (e.g., time to treatment and treatment success).  3. Understand the health systems context and mechanisms through which implementation of decentralized care enhances (or negatively impacts) patient pathways to care and outcomes.   4. Identify strategies, innovations and action areas to support health systems in health districts and facilities, in the short to medium term, in implementing optimal context-specific decentralized care for DR-TB.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Tuberculosis is a disease of the poor and remains a significant cause of disease and death globally. Our failure to effectively control the TB epidemic has resulted in the emergence of TB bacteria that have become resistant to the main drugs we use in treatment. These drug-resistant bacteria (DR-TB) can then be transmitted to others. In some settings DR-TB has now reached epidemic levels. While treatment is available, it&apos;s lengthy, complicated, expensive, and results in poor patient outcomes.  South Africa has a high burden of DR-TB, with more than 26,000 cases reported in 2013. Data suggest that a third of these patients do not have access to appropriate treatment, with only 40% cure for the rest. Fortunately, there are some recent advances that could assist in combatting the DR-TB epidemic. A rapid diagnostic test for DR-TB has been marketed and has now been rolled out across South Africa. This test (Xpert) has increased the number of patients identified and reduced the delay in receiving the diagnostic result. In addition, a new drug for treating DR-TB has just been registered in South Africa. Bedaquiline has the potential to dramatically improve the effectiveness of DR-TB treatment.  However, DR-TB diagnosis and treatment needs to be delivered in the context of the existing health system, the characteristics of which are likely to influence the impact of new interventions. In order to increase access to DR-TB treatment, South Africa moved to a policy of decentralized treatment provision in 2011, i.e., providing DR-TB treatment at lower levels of the health system, with less reliance on hospital treatment. This policy has been variably implemented across different provinces, health districts and settings (i.e., rural versus urban) in South Africa.   In order to maximize the benefit of new interventions, we aim to assess health system factors that enhance or undermine the delivery of treatment for DR-TB, specifically in regard to decentralization of care. We aim to determine what works and why it works, across different settings. Health system factors include such things as: the allocation of appropriate (number and training) human resources, financing at appropriate levels, organizational management, efficient communication and referral systems, sufficient inpatient capacity and access to other services needed for the care of DR-TB patients. These health system factors determine whether individuals with DR-TB disease access care, how long this takes, the quality of care they access, whether they transmit their infection to others and finally whether they have a successful treatment outcome or not. Ultimately, our findings will be used to identify feasible and effective strategies to improve decentralized care for patients with DR-TB in South Africa and other similar settings.</narrative>
