   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Supporting Vulnerable Children to become Youth Leaders in South Africa: Shaping the Future of the Isibindi Safe Park Model Nationally</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">1) We will develop an arts-based youth-leadership programme, designed to build the capacity of vulnerable young people to claim a greater voice within their communities, primarily using participatory filmmaking, but also supported by other arts-based practices. Our focus will be the generation of advocacy campaigns, supporting young people to engage in participatory democratic action designed to influence positive behaviour change amongst their peers, as well as inform the development of policy that affects them and their communities.  2) This youth-leadership programme will be used to establish and sustain a series of &apos;youth committees&apos; in 8 Isibindi Safe Parks (ISPs) across Ekurhuleni Municipality in South Africa. ISPs provide before and after-school care for vulnerable children and young people. Service users are provided with a warm meal and the opportunity to participate in a range of recreational and educational activities. This is particularly important in communities where up to 30% of young people do not have enough to eat each day, where 12% of young people have lost both parents, only 19% of children live with both parents and where 25% of young girls are subjected to frequent sexual abuse. ISPs provide young people with a stable, safe environment in which they can build their confidence.  3) While the National Association for Child Care Workers (NACCW) - the organisation that developed, and that has responsibility for monitoring, the national standards for ISPs - stipulates the existence of &apos;a functioning youth committee&apos; in its ISPs, it has yet to conceptualise the specific role of the youth committee in their governance, how they should be organised, or how they might be utilised to support the wider aims of ISPs to help support and enhance the wellbeing and skills development of their service users. Consequently, the NACCW has approached us to help them to produce the national guidelines for creating and making the most of youth committees in ISPs. 4) We will develop and deliver a national training programme, including a detailed &apos;tool kit&apos;, to support the national roll out of these guidelines. This training programme is to be launched at the NACCW&apos;s 22nd National Conference in Durban in 2019.  5) We will also develop a grassroots, youth-led campaign, using participatory arts to highlight the value of the ISPs, in order to enhance the NACCW&apos;s efforts to raise awareness of the scheme nationally. As well as being of benefit to the NACCW, this will give the young people involved the experience of developing a national campaign, helping to show the vulnerable, marginalised youths who use the ISPs the value and potential of their voice in shaping national debates. 6) We will organise a number of events to bring together relevant community, regional and national stakeholders to further ensure that our programme is embedded in the wider national support and policy infrastructure, in order to guarantee its longer-term sustainability. 7) We will produce a film that will document the development of the project. This will be used to further disseminate our programme and the work of the ISPs.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project will apply the research findings from AH/P007511/1 (Troubling the National Brand and Voicing Hidden Histories: Participatory Filmmaking as a tool for International Development and Community Empowerment) in a new context, in order to generate significant new impact at community level, on the one hand, and at national policy level on the other.  In the original research, we explored how community-led arts interventions - in particular participatory filmmaking projects - could be used to challenge the way national level &apos;soft power&apos; narratives are used to &apos;brand&apos; the nation internationally in 3 ODA-recipient countries. Specifically, we aimed to support particular communities in these countries who feel themselves to be excluded from these narratives: the &apos;Denotified Tribes&apos; in India, the &apos;Quilombos&apos;, or ex-slave communities in Brazil and the &apos;undocumented children&apos; of illegal migrants in South Africa. Here we were particularly focussed on the potential of participatory filmmaking as a tool to support grass-roots advocacy to raise awareness of these groups&apos; precarious place in society.   This follow-on project will focus on South Africa. We will apply our original research findings to: 1) use the model of grass-roots (in the case of South Africa, specifically youth-led) advocacy that emerged over the course of the previous project to develop an arts-based &apos;youth-leadership&apos; programme to support the work of a number of Isibindi Safe Parks (ISP), community-based organisations that help vulnerable children and young people across Ekurhuleni Municipality in South Africa. In the process we will significantly extend the community-level impact of the original project, engaging new groups of young people. 2) generate significant national-level policy impact in South Africa by working with the National Association of Child Care Workers (NACCW), who have approached us with the aim of using our research to inform the national standards of the ISP programme, and to deliver training to support the implementation of these standards. In the process, we will also deliver a child-led advocacy campaign to support NACCW&apos;s efforts to raise awareness of the ISP programme and its value nationally. Thus, our project will make a significant contribution the delivery of the UN Sustainable Development Goals in South Africa, in particular SDGs 4 (Quality Education), 5 (Gender Equality), 16 (Peace and Justice Strong Institutions), 17 (Partnerships to achieve the Goals). These are of course interrelated. However, this project also takes cognisance of the tension between them. To what extent, for example, can a focus on the creation of &apos;strong institutions&apos; (SDG 17) in practice work against a focus on &apos;participatory decision-making at all levels&apos; (SDG 16), or &apos;gender equality&apos; (SDG 5)? How might the construction of a &apos;peaceful&apos; society be challenged by the need for an &apos;inclusive&apos; society, where everyone&apos;s voice can be heard and respected (SDG 16)? Understanding the intersections and tensions between the SDGs, as they are realised on the ground, was central to our original research, and our learning from this earlier project in this regard will be important to the success of this follow-on project.  Moreover, our project will also support delivery of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, specifically Article 12: &apos;Every child has the right to express their views, feelings and wishes in all matters affecting them, and to have their views considered and taken seriously.&apos;</narrative>
