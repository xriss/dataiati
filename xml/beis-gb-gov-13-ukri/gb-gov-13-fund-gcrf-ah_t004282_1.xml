   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Cultural beliefs and practices associated with extensive mobile pastoralism enable people to live in arid regions. In East Africa modernization and increasing population densities combined with national economic policies have caused fragmentation of rangelands and soil degradation, and thus broader economic and ecological problems. Community-based rangeland conservancies provide a potential solution to these challenges and address several Sustainable Development Goals by providing food security and improved nutrition; restoring degraded land; conserving ecosystems and their services; and establishing more inclusive forms of governance that incorporate previously under-represented groups, such as women or young, unmarried men.  Despite some successes, there is a great deal of variation both in the willingness of pastoral groups to establish conservancies, and in the effectiveness and inclusiveness of governance in those conservancies that have been established. Relationships between different conservancies in challenging times have also shown the limitations of an approach based on the functioning of single conservancies. A greater understanding of how to manage rangelands more effectively and improve pastoral food systems can come from understand the landscape of different levels and scales at play in the rangelands, and the diverse cultures and institutions for managing these resources. Attempts to establish new models of community governance and rangeland management, as envisaged by the conservancy model, need to be taken up and accepted by communities, and therefore need to be suited and adapted to the different cultural and ecological situations that make up the landscape. In this partnership we will bring together a network of researchers from economics, anthropology, behavioural ecology, and psychology with policy makers in order to understand how contextually-driven policies can be developed that effectively promote sustainable and inclusive systems of pastoral food production in a way that respects and leverages the traditions and culture of pastoralist communities, and takes into account the interactions between different levels of these systems.  The project will involve meetings between researchers and policy makers, and participatory workshops with local communities in order to co-design research activities and future research applications that both meet the needs of communities and are directed towards shaping policy in an evidence-based manner. We will conduct pilot fieldwork in collaboration with local communities that will involve 3 different strands: 1) A Photovoice approach that will document the stories of local communities in producing food, their experiences of governance, and their interactions with other communities, 2) Collecting information on community governance and inclusivity, and relationships with other communities via Key Informant Interviews and Focus Group Discussions, 3) Conducting questionnaires that will aim to elucidate the social psychological factors that either facilitate or inhibit adoption of inclusive and sustainable rangeland governance practices. The project will result in the establishment of knowledge-exchange network with the immediate outputs from the project being a photovoice exhibit, community reports, open access academic papers, a project website and associated social media, and policy briefing documents.  Longer term this novel interdisciplinary collaboration will help highlight the challenges pastoralists face, understand the ways in which community-based inclusive forms of sustainable rangeland governance can be established, and improve the capacity to develop more contextually-driven and culture-focused policy relating to sustainable pastoralist food systems. We will explore how approaches to establishing inclusive and sustainable governance of food systems can be adapted and applied to enhance pastoralist and other food production systems beyond East Africa.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="Creating productive, sustainable, and inclusive pastoral food systems in East African rangelands requires understanding the people and practices of the people that make their living in these regions. Given the nature of the challenges and the geographic scales over which they play out the overall objective of this project is to establish a network of researchers with different backgrounds and expertise and connect them further with both the communities affected by these challenges, and the policy makers who can facilitate solutions to these challenges.   Through this process we aim to redress evidence hierarchies both in terms of enabling the voice of pastoralist communities to reach a wider audience, and by enabling research to be led by Kenyan and East African academics, NGOs, and policy practitioners throughout the project.  The specific aims of the work carried out during the lifetime of the current project are to:  1) Give voice to pastoral communities and document the challenges pastoral communities and food production systems are facing due to climate change and other anthropogenic changes. We will achieve this through community-based participatory research which will result in the production of a photovoice exhibit and the publishing of the stories of people in pastoral communities (including those from under-represented groups such as women and young, unmarried men).   2) Better understand the interplay between the different scales and patterns of land use and interactions between different communities and cultures, and how traditional pastoral cultural practices can be incorporated into more effective rangeland management. We will achieve this by conducting interview and focus group discussion with communities and reporting the findings.   3) Examine the cultural and psychological factors that affect whether inclusive and sustainable conservancies are effectively adopted by pastoral communities. We will conduct comparative social-psychological questionnaires and report what factors either promote or inhibit positive baehaviour changes, and make suggestions about how this can feed in to strategies to establish effective governance of rangelands.  4) Connect pastoral communities, academic researchers and policy makers so that research can be targeted to the issues affecting communities. We will write policy briefing notes based on this research so that effective policy interventions can be devised.  The Longer term aims for this research are to establish an initial evidence base upon which future research plans and funding applications can be developed. As part of this process we will seek to extend the network and explore how approaches to establishing inclusive and sustainable governance of food systems in this region can be adapted and applied to enhance pastoralist and other food production systems in other DAC-listed countries. It is hoped that the research begun in this project will eventually lead to positive policy changes that produce real-world positive impacts on the lives of pastoralists by establishing more inclusive forms of governance, increasing food security, reducing poverty, and conserving ecosystems and their services."></capital-spend>
