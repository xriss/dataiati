   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Colombia is the second most biodiverse country in the world with a large rural population of small-holder, low income farmers. As the demand for meat and dairy increases, livestock farming continues to expand onto land that is not appropriate for farming, causing environmental damage through forest clearance, loss of biodiversity and land degradation. Different national initiatives aim to encourage more intensive and sustainable farming that support farmers&apos; livelihoods and protect the environment and its rich biodiversity. Silvo-pastoral farming is one of those initiatives as it combines forestry and grazing. However due to cultural and social factors, in combination with possible economic and agronomic influences, uptake remains low and deforestation continues.  This interdisciplinary project brings together cultural geography, behavioural economics and ecological expertise from both the UK and Colombia to investigate the cultural and socio-economic reasons for low adoption of silvo-pastoral livestock farming practices that can support livelihood and protect biodiversity. Through farmer interviews and focus groups and existing socio-economic data sets we will develop and test effective mechanisms through dissemination, farmer to farmer engagement and government policy that promote effective uptake and implementation of best practice. Furthermore we will undertake a large scale field trial and quantify the scale dependent benefits of silvo-pastoral practices and forest protection on biodiversity and ecosystem services to provide landscape scale policy relevant guidance on the optimal approaches to promote forest protection and silvo-pastoral implementation at the landscape scale, beyond just the individual farm.  These approaches will help sustainably intensify livestock production whilst protecting forests and other natural areas in order to support economic development, biodiversity protection and social wellbeing in Colombia.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="The aim of this project is to contribute to the sustainable intensification of livestock production whilst protecting forests and other natural areas at the interface between intensive regions of pasture and the Amazonian ecoregion in order to support economic development, biodiversity protection and social wellbeing in Colombia. More specifically the objectives of the BIO-smart project include:   General Research Objective: build on our phase I project by scaling-up the interdisciplinary framework of analysis from the single farm household to the landscape level in order to establish landscape level impacts of forage-based silvo-pastoral systems, identify interventions for encouraging uptake of these systems and thereby enhance the sustainability of tropical agriculture in Colombia and generating lessons for other similar countries.   Strategic Objective: to produce and disseminate scientific evidence that supports the design of effective forage-based silvo-pastoral projects that improve livestock farmers&apos; livelihoods, produce nutritious food for people and animals, prevent deforestation and encourage re-forestation.   Specific Research Objectives: 1. scale-up to regional level the understanding of cultural scripts about landscape aesthetics and SPS management, particularly in relation to farmer identity and the cultural value of &quot;worked landscapes&quot;, forests and biodiversity; 2. extend a socio-economic model of farmer decision making that supports customised interventions; 3. quantify the interactive effects of landscape scale forest cover and local land use (traditional pasture, silvo-pastoral plots and forest) on the abundance and diversity of above-ground invertebrates and plants 4. compare the effects of different silvo-pastoral management regimes on invertebrate and plant biodiversity and ecosystem services at the field scale.   Collaboration Objectives: 1. underpin the long-term farmer-led continuation of CIAT&apos;s &quot;Sustainable Amazonian Landscapes&quot; project by supporting CIAT partners&apos; ongoing activities in the SAL farms; 2. contribute to CIAT&apos;s new silvo-pastoral project &quot;Implementing sustainable agricultural and livestock systems for simultaneous targeting of forest conservation for climate change mitigation (REDD+) and peace-building in Colombia&quot;; and 3. enhance research capacity between UK and Colombian partners in silvo-pastoral systems to ensure future research challenges are addressed."></capital-spend>
