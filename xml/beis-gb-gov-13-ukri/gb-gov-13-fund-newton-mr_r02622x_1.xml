   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This Newton Fund application seeks to enhance existing research links between immunology/microbiology researchers in Hanoi and at Imperial College London. The biomedical research question concerns appraisal in Vietnam of the risk of melioidosis. This is a potentially severe or lethal bacterial infection caused by the bacterium, Burkholderia pseudomallei, found in many temperate countries in the soil and in the water supply. The disease is associated with thousands of deaths annually in neighbouring Thailand. It has been predicted that the disease may be under-diagnosed in several other countries including Vietnam, but no comprehensive data exists. With more precise data, it would be possible to put appropriate plans in place for diagnosis and antibiotic treatment protocols. This proposal thus brings together researchers who have a strong, ongoing, interest in this question, from Hanoi and London. We plan to appraise the situation at several levels. The first is to take soil samples from sites across the country, determining distribution and load of the bacterium. As part of this work we will also assess presence of a closely related but non-pathogenic bacterium called Burkholderia thailandensis. This is important as immunity to the two bacteria is partly cross-reactive and there is a view that exposure to environmental thailandensis may protect against melioidosis. We will then work with collaborators at five regional hospitals across the country, collecting a small blood sample from 200 volunteer donors at each centre, during routine health-checks. This sample will be used to check for antibodies to the two bacteria, giving a dataset for &apos;seroprevalence&apos; - that is, a regional map of human exposure to the bacteria, which can be overlaid with the mapped soil samples. This will not tell us how many people have melioidosis. Rather, it will give a picture of whether or not there are indeed regions of Vietnam similar to high-risk regions of N. Thailand, where a majority of people develop high levels of antibody after bacterial exposure. Since those people who show immunity to the bacterium but show no signs of disease must have functional protection, we will do collaborative studies to characterise the nature of this protection at the level of white blood cells termed &apos;T cells.&apos; A closely related issue is that diabetes is by far the strongest risk factor for development of severe disease in individuals exposed to the bacterium. For this reason, we will use the serum samples to build a parallel, regional map of the prevalence of diabetes, believed to be growing rapidly in Vietnam. This study will include point-of-care blood glucose and analysis of pancreatic autoantibodies. A strong component of the work will be the interactive and training component, including annual workshops held in Vietnam</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="This Newton Fund project seeks to strengthen research links between immunology and microbiology researchers in Hanoi and London. The research question encompasses steps to examine the potential consequences of human exposure to either Burkholderia pseudomallei (Bp) or B. thailandensis (Bt). We here define a sample area encompassing five hospitals in four regions of Northeast, Northwest, North Central and South Central Vietnam, a patient catchment area of some 33,621km2 and around 8.4 million individuals. Blood samples will be collected from 200 healthy donors at each hospital. We thus plan to build an initial dataset of 1000 individuals, for assessment Bp and Bt exposure in terms of seroprevalence, relating clinical sampling sites to analysis of Bp/Bt load in soil samples from these regions. Furthermore, since diabetes is the strongest risk factor for development of clinically overt disease in exposed individuals, we will also assess the prevalence of diabetes. We will: (a) assess Bp and Bt bacterial soil load at almost 1000 sites distributed from North to South Vietnam,  (b) recruit 200 donors attending health-checks at each of 5 hospitals across 4 regions of Northeast, Northwest, North Central and South Central Vietnam,  (c) conduct serological analysis to assess Bp and Bt seroprevalence in relation to geographical region, gender, age, occupation and drinking water supply  (d) use the sera to obtain a related dataset on prevalence of diabetes (the strongest risk factor for clinical disease in Bp exposed people)  (e) in a more limited subset of donors, we will develop T cell immunology approaches for analysis of protective host immunity; this will utilise MHCII/peptide tetramers for phenotyping of T cell responses correlated with protection in exposed individuals (f) use collaborative studies, training and joint, annual, workshops to build close links between researchers at the respective institutes, reinforcing immunological expertise in Hanoi (g) publish papers on our collaborative findings"></capital-spend>
