   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Newton Bhabha Industrial Waste: Valorising Waste from Sugar Cane Industries via Innovations in Pretreatment, Biotransformation and Intensification</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The sugar cane industry is the second-largest agro-based industry in India and supports approximately 60 million farmers and their families. The sugarcane and associated industry however produces more than100 million tons (MT) of solid and liquid wastes every year (~80 MT of bagasse, ~10 MT of press mud, 45 billion litres of spent wash, bagasse pitch and ~25 MT of cane trash). Part of the bagasse is used to generate power by burning it in boilers. The huge quantities of wastes produced by sugar and associated industries pose a significant challenge as well as an opportunity.   The vWa project is aimed at harnessing UK expertise on transforming waste biomass to energy and chemicals for providing technological solutions to address problem of waste generated by sugar and associated industries in India. Two leading bioenergy companies in UK (Nova Pangaea Technologies and Green Fuels Research) are collaborating with three UK universities (Queen&apos;s University Belfast, Cranfield University and Nottingham University) to develop appropriate solutions for transforming five major waste streams (bagasse, press mud, spent wash, bagasse pith and sugar cane trash) to transportation fuels (bio-CNG and butanol) and chemicals (succinic and lactic acid).  The UK consortium has identified relevant Indian partners which include an apex R &amp; D organisation of sugar mills, Vasantdada Sugar Institute (which has 146 sugar mills and 74 distilleries as their members), two large sugar mills (Dhampur and Lokmangal), a start-up focussed on pre-treatment (Vivira) along with three Indian research Institute (Indian Institute of Technology Bombay &amp; Delhi and Indian Institute of Petroleum). The vWa consortium will address the key challenges in valorisation of a lignocellulosic biomass (LCB) namely development of a cost effective pre-treatment method (combination of cavitation, thermal and biological) to improve digestibility of biomass, transformation of treated biomass to fermentable sugar (after detoxification) and transformation of the sugars to products. Most of the past and ongoing efforts focus on pre-treatment for recovering cellulose from LCB and then converting it to sugars and other value added products. These approaches suffer from high costs associated to pre-treatment. In this project, we aim to develop and commercialise technologies for transforming five waste streams mentioned above to transportation fuels (bioCNG and biobutanol [BB]), and two value added chemicals (succinic acid [SA] and lactic acid [LA]). The key innovation lies in hybrid pre-treatment methods: thermal process (developed by Nova), hydrodynamic cavitation (developed by PI, Vivira) and anaerobic digestion (AD). The AD will be used for the first time to selectively convert hemi-cellulose to biogas and retain cellulose in the digestate which will be converted to sugars. Lignin from the digestate will be separated from the residue and may be sold as a by-product for further valorisation. The sugars obtained from digestate will be subjected to microbial fermentation to manufacture BB, SA and LA. The process conditions and strategies will be optimized and intensified &amp; modular processes will be developed to obtain BB, SA and LA of desired purity from the fermentation broth. The proposed approach and aimed solutions will realise a step change in the state of the art. The developed solutions will be demonstrated on pilot and field scales wherever possible. These demonstrations and industry connect of the consortium partners will be used to facilitate commercialisation of developed technologies. The developed solutions will make tangible difference in productivity of sugar cane industries in India and will therefore have significant beneficial impact on wellbeing of large population in rural India.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The vWa project is aimed at transforming wastes generated by sugar and associated industries in India to renewable energy and valuable chemicals. The focus is on developing approach, capabilities and know-how which will provide better access to energy, improve economic viability of bio-refinery, promote new industries and generate employment in rural areas of India. Multiple disciplines like physics of cavitation, multi-phase turbulent flows, chemistry, biocatalysis, bio transformation processes, reaction engineering, process separations, intensification and optimisation will be used for this purpose. The five wastes streams namely bagasse, press mud, bagasse pitch, spent wash and cane trash will be pre-treated and processed to produce four products namely bio-CNG, butanol, succinic acid and lactic acid. The goal is to develop the technological solutions for economically transforming selected waste streams to products and facilitate commercialisation of developed technologies. This commercialisation of waste transformation will lead to a tangible change in rural economy of India and realise sustainable &amp; inclusive economic growth with lasting impact way beyond the duration of the program.  One of the key objectives is to forge strong partnerships between industries from UK and India along with the research institutes for achieving the goals of vWa. The vWa consortium has a right balance of UK and Indian industries and research institutes which will facilitate commercialisation of developed solutions. Appropriate industry partners and local stake holders from India are involved on co-creating this vision and objectives. Specific objectives are:  + to develop novel cavitation based and thermal pre-treatment of waste biomass resources and enhance the yield of renewable chemicals, fuels and energy. Focus is on the design, scale-up and pilot or field scale trials for waste biomass such as distillery spent wash, and if possible, for other waste biomass  + to develop new ways of pre-treatment, detoxification and biotransformation of pretreated waste biomass to bio - CNG, succinic acid (SA), lactic acid (LA) and bio-butanol (BB). Focus is on unlocking synergy between pre-treatment, bio-transformation and process intensification to enhance economic viability  + to develop intensified and optimal pathways for value-added products from lignin and sugars derived from pre-treated biomass/ digestate from anaerobic digesters. Focus is on bio-CNG, SA, LA and bio-butanol  + to carry out field trials of pre-treatment and develop modular processes and plants suitable for implementing in the sugar industries of India  + to train researchers, industries, local stake holders (farmers) and policy makers at all levels in the area of pre-treatment, biotransformations and life cycle analysis of valorizing waste biomass and process intensification/ modular plants for sustainable production of renewable fuels and chemicals  + to develop approach, capabilities and know-how which will be generic and can be applied for addressing key global challenges and for making a tangible difference in many other developing countries</narrative>
