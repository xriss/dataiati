   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The quality of healthcare available to women and children within the first 1000 days of life (from conception until about 2 years of age) in Brazil is highly variable, despite policies for improvement. This has led to higher maternal mortality and morbidity than may be expected in a country such as Brazil. This project, EU QUERO (meaning &apos;I want&apos; in Portuguese), is testing whether an intervention to improve the quality of care is feasible to conduct as well as indicating whether it is likely to be successful. This will be conducted in two states of Brazil, Goi&#xE1;s and Maranh&#xE3;o, both of which have poorer maternal health than expected.    Prior to the intervention, a period of assessment of current quality will be conducted using two datasets that have already been collected. Results from this analysis will be mapped using the latest techniques so that hotspots of good or bad quality healthcare can be identified. This will inform the areas selected for the intervention.    The EU QUERO intervention is implemented within Basic Health Units (the smallest level of the health system organisation) and encompasses two different elements. The first is to make mothers and the wider community more aware of the current quality of care available to them at different points within the first 1000 days of life - during pregnancy, during delivery, in the immediate post-delivery period and with regard to the child&apos;s health. This will be conducted by the development of facility level quality scorecards which will highlight the good and poor aspects of healthcare to users. The scorecards will list the four different phases within the 1000 days and rate the services available to the mother within each phases, with the best quality services receiving a &apos;Diamond&apos; rating, while the poorest will receive a &apos;Bronze&apos; rating. Previous research indicates that knowledge of these aspects improves quality through greater transparency of the health system, while health workers also understand the aspects where they are not performing and make a concerted effort to improve.    The second element of the intervention is through the delivery of rights-based education to mothers. This will include knowledge about individual rights to health care, including highlighting what an individual should be entitled to and the quality that should be expected. This has been seen to empower mothers who will then be encouraged to demand more of the health providers, again improving quality of care.   EU QUERO will develop these scorecards and rights based education materials to disseminate within selected Basic Health Units and, following this happening, assess if this is a feasible intervention to conduct at a wider scale. Improvements in quality will be assessed through the development of new quality scorecards, which will indicate what has been improved and whether any improvements have occurred evenly over the 1000 days period under study. Quality will also be assessed through looking at health outcomes, such as whether mothers received adequate antenatal care or whether the child received vaccinations in a timely fashion. A further aspect is an explicit focus on ensuring that adolescent voices are heard throughout the intervention and evaluation.    The project is conducted in collaboration with the state Ministries of Health and hence the successful implementation of the intervention will inform future strategies to improve healthcare for mothers and children. It will also engage mothers, communities, health workers and policymakers throughout the period of implementation, with the actual intervention co-created between the project team and these stakeholders, so the material presented to mothers is relevant and understandable. The intervention will be assessed for scalability within Brazil and in other countries, with mothers facilitated to demand the best quality care available, strengthening the health system as it responds to these demands.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="The overarching aim of EU QUERO (&apos;I want&apos; in Portuguese) is to increase the quality of and access to maternal, newborn, and child health (MNCH) services available in the first 1000 days of life from conception in two contrasting states in Brazil, Maranh&#xE3;o and Goi&#xE1;s, through community engagement and social accountability.    The main objective is to develop and conduct a feasibility of a complex social accountability intervention to monitor the quality of delivery of health programmes throughout four phases of the 1000 days: (i) pre-natal, (ii) birth, (iii) postpartum and newborn health, and (iv) child healthcare. It will be designed to be implemented at scale and to be sensitive to the health needs of adolescent mothers during both implementation and evaluation.    The intervention is focused around two separate, complementary, activities:   - The production and dissemination of facility scorecards indicating the quality of services available to women and children within the community.    - Rights-based education, to empower women with the knowledge of the rights that they can demand from the health system.    This type of intervention for maternal and child health is novel within Brazil (and Latin America as a whole) and therefore the feasibility of such a project needs to be ascertained in order to prepare for a pilot or full-scale RCT.   A second objective is to strengthen the health system within the intervention areas to deliver greater quality of and access to maternal, newborn and child health care. The project seeks to benefit women within the intervention areas, engaging them with the health system, in order to demand and receive better quality services. Health workers in this area will also be more aware of the services that need most improvement and will develop action plans and strategies to improve services.  The project will promote citizenship of vulnerable groups through the awareness raised from educational interventions about health as a right. This will aid in the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals for Brazil through strengthening advocacy and accountability.   EU QUERO also aims to develop communities of action and moments of integration/discussion within each intervention area, consisting of mothers, communities and community groups, health workers and health managers, as well as stakeholders and policymakers at the municipal and state level. The dialogue between these actors will continue to aid in the provision of good quality care to all mothers and children. The project will strengthen social accountability, one of the main principles of Brazilian public system of health (SUS). It does so by conducting innovative and interdisciplinary, inter-organisational research into community accountability and rights based education and the link with health systems strengthening for this population group. Limited research has indicated that there are large benefits for the quality of care following both the use of scorecards and rights based education, but the actual pathways through which this occurs is unknown. This project has an explicit work package which will engage with this process.    The fourth objective is to estimate quality of care scorecards for different phases of the first 1000 days and map these services in order to identify hotspots of good or poor quality care. This will estimate the catchment area of each facility and information about the population in areas of Goi&#xE1;s and Maranh&#xE3;o in order to provide information for policymakers.   The final aim is to develop the capacity of junior researchers in all three Universities to conduct world-leading interdisciplinary research into health systems, especially maternal and child health. We will develop a research network focused on health systems and rights between the Universities of Goias, Maranh&#xE3;o and Southampton, which is envisaged to expand to include other universities both in Brazil and worldwide."></capital-spend>
