   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project takes as its starting point the religious needs of refugee women in Syria and Lebanon identified by the work of NGO partner Global One. Refugee women are in need of clean water to meet basic needs for water and hygiene, but also faith requirements for ablution. Women also require support for mental health needs created by situations of statelessness and the all too common ramifications of gender based violence (GBV); some of these needs could be met by faith-based organisations and communities. Although the rights of women to equality and religious freedom are enshrined in human rights declarations (UNDHR), in practice humanitarian organisations recognise that there is still a long way to go to attain the equal treatment and empowerment of women, and faith remains further on the margins in terms of priorities. The challenges of empowering women and girls and enabling faith to play a significant role in this are in need of further attention and solutions, areas the network addresses through cross sector and multidisciplinary approaches. Research has suggested the potential for empowerment through the creation of spaces for women of faith to meet together with other women. Yet, it should be recognised that there is no single &apos;religious space&apos;, but rather heterogeneous spaces with different constitution and character. Part of the problem addressed by the network is the differences in ways of speaking across different contexts and the role of religion in empowering groups of women in different types of spaces, drawing on a variety of religious resources, such as texts, theologies, and ritual practice. Women in refugee settings on the ground ought to be afforded their own spaces to identify in their own terms their faith requirements. In spaces of activation in the international humanitarian realm, there could be greater prioritisation of issues affecting women and girls in terms of faith, and greater involvement of women in leading development support. Multidisciplinary research can contribute to the development of these spaces, fostering informed understanding of the issues and identification of initiatives and recommendations that give religion a distinctive voice and role which is not separate from human rights principles, but recognises common goals and areas of distinctive contribution to the issues facing women. It is also important to identify where fears about faith-based organisations come from and how they are perpetuated, in order to speak meaningfully in the public sphere. The intersection of these spaces through dialogue and the formulation of concrete recommendations to policymakers and stakeholders have the potential to encourage groups of women leaders who are best placed to speak to other groups of women in crisis situations and enable them through the provision of basic needs and prioritisation of religious freedoms.  By facilitating sustained conversation between NGOs working on the ground, faith groups and academic partners, the network addresses the gap in cross sector collaboration in order to formulate concrete recommendations for addressing the needs of women in situations of crisis and greatest need. The expertise of network participants in policy, religion, sociology, and refugee and migration studies in dialogue with the perspectives of those working closely in situations on the ground establishes a strong position from which to petition governments and faith leaders to prioritise issues affecting women&apos;s identity and mental health, women&apos;s theologies and ritual needs, and realise women&apos;s potential as change makers in situations of statelessness and displacement. The recommendations of the network will be focussed on making provision for faith to be a core part of the international response to crisis situations affecting women and girls, and ensuring women and their needs in relation to religion are well represented, from refugee camp committees to UN working groups.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="The network focusses on women&apos;s spaces and the ways that practical and religious needs can be met for women in situations of humanitarian crisis. Through a series of workshops and publications, scholars and stakeholders are brought together to produce a set of strategic initiatives for future action and recommendations for gender and faith responsive humanitarian programming. The network&apos;s objectives are: 1) To initiate and extend an international network of scholars, activists, faith leaders and policy stakeholders who will establish dialogue and form collaborative links in order to support the prioritisation of women&apos;s faith needs in situations of humanitarian crisis; 2) To identify the religious resources (texts, theologies, rituals) which are most meaningful to the empowerment of women in developing countries and situations of humanitarian crisis and explore ways in which these texts might be effectively deployed in different settings; 3) To develop strategies for confronting areas where insufficient public attention is paid to the particular needs of women for religious practice and faith; 4) To ascertain future initiatives which will be able to address the needs on the ground and prioritise the role of faith in providing support; 5) To make recommendations to international humanitarian organisations for humanitarian programming which is responsive to both gender and faith in the protection of rights; 6) To draw on expertise across disciplines and to identify where issues involving women and faith have been addressed in the integration of refugees and training of NGO workers and cultural mediators at various points in experience of refugee women, from their home countries to various camps and places of settlement, especially Jordan as the network case study location, though including in the EU and UK;  7) To develop ways to empower groups of women and girls cross the spaces identified in the network: women in grassroots environments and refugee camps in terms of their practical and religious needs; women and girls as change agents and leaders in humanitarian action, drawing on religious resources and connecting to key spokespersons; women as scholar-advocates; protecting the rights of women and girls globally as human beings, and ensuring that humanitarian policy is effective in protecting women&apos;s rights to equality and the practice of religion."></capital-spend>
