   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Lighting up the dark side of the Universe</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">A series of striking observational and theoretical breakthroughs have resulted in a surprising view of the Universe in which most of its contents are dark: the bulk of the mass in the Universe is thought to be &quot;dark matter&quot; whilst the current dynamics of the Universe are governed by &quot;dark energy&quot;. The astronomical community is organizing itself into large international teams to carry out the next generation of galaxy survey to understand the nature of the dark universe.   Our objective is to develop a new state of the art in mock galaxy catalogues to aid this effort. As surveys become larger to beat down random measurement errors, it is essential that we develop a better understanding of systematic effects, such as the relation between the galaxy and matter distributions, called galaxy bias. Such effects will limit the scientific potential of future surveys unless theoretical models are developed which allow them to be properly incorporated into the estimation of cosmological parameters.   Astronomy is arguably the highest profile Chilean scientific activity on the international stage. By allowing the leading Chilean researchers access to expertise in galaxy formation modelling and a national level supercomputer, this project will lay the foundations for the scientific exploitation of major new surveys, including the European Space Agency&apos;s Euclid mission and new collaborations with Europe. We will also train young Chilean researchers. The outputs of the project will include mock galaxy catalogues which will be released to the wider astronomical community through a relational database.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Our primary objective is to develop a new state of the art in mock galaxy catalogues to aid this effort. As surveys become larger to beat down random measurement errors, it is essential that we develop a better understanding of systematic effects, such as the relation between the galaxy and matter distributions, called galaxy bias. Such effects will limit the scientific potential of future surveys unless theoretical models are developed which allow them to be properly incorporated into the estimation of cosmological parameters.   The secondary objective is to reinforce links between Chile and the UK, and between Catolica and Durham in particular.   The general objective of our proposal is to develop the theoretical modelling of large-scale structure in the galaxy distribution to the level needed to make the best possible use of upcoming galaxy surveys.   The current standard in the analysis of galaxy surveys uses only a fraction of the information contained in the galaxy distribution. Simple models are used to interpret the measurements; these are currently adequate due to the size of the sampling errors. With future surveys this will no longer be the case. Random measurement errors will be smaller than systematic errors. A major leap forward in the accuracy of theoretical models is urgently needed to unlock the scientific content of the data.  Our overall objectives are:   1) to generate predictions for the way in which galaxies populate dark matter halos from physical galaxy formation models, using a technique called semi-analytical modelling.    2) to investigate the impact of environmental factors on the galaxy content of haloes by combining the semi-analytical model of galaxy formation with a high resolution N-body simulation.   3) to compare the predictions of this physical model to less computationally expensive empirical approaches, to assess under what conditions such models are valid.   4) to implement a hybrid semi-analytical model plus N-body simulation code into giga-parsec sized computational boxes, over 200 times larger in volume than the current biggest simulation box used for such calculations.   5) to investigate ways to add &quot;sub-resolution&quot; galaxies to such large volume simulations, in order to extend the completeness of the resulting catalogues  6) to extend the implementation of semi-analytical modelling to non-standard cosmologies, such as Galileon gravity and f(R) models.   7) to make specific preparations for new galaxy surveys, including PAU, MS-DESI and Euclid   8) to release the mock galaxy catalogues which result from this project to the wider astronomical community through a relational database.</narrative>
