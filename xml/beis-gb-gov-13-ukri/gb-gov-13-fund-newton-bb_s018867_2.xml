   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Novel real-time disease surveillance and fungicide resistance monitoring tools to foster a smart and sustainable crop protection platform in Brazil</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Resistance to chemical agents used to control pests, weeds and pathogens is a threat to effective crop protection and therefore to food security. Tighter regulations and a slowing pipeline of new products have also reduced the range of available chemical classes. This has led to a greater dependence on fewer fungicides and mode of actions, increasing the selection for further cases of resistance. The limited availability of effective crop protection products, coupled with lack of genetic resistance in major crop varieties, is making key pathogens increasingly difficult to control. In order to prolong the effective life of current and new crop protection products, evolution-smart integrated pest management strategies are needed. Strategies based on different dose rates, alternations and mixtures of fungicides have been advocated to reduce the selection of resistance. However, debate continues as to which strategies are most effective and there is a need for more empirical data on the fundamental evolutionary processes underlying the selection of resistance.  Three key fungicide classes: azoles, QoIs and SDHIs: are currently used for the control of many plant pathogens. This project will focus on three major diseases in Brazil: wheat blast (Pyricularia graminis-tritici), Asian soybean rust (Phakopsora pachyrhizi) and the banana Sigatoka disease complex (Mycosphaerella fijiensis and M. musicola). Resistance to one or more fungicide groups has been detected in all four pathogens, but the occurrence of resistance within Brazil or the molecular mechanisms conferring resistance are not yet known in all cases. In addition, onset of disease epidemics is poorly understood and, therefore, appropriate anti-resistance strategies and optimal disease control cannot be achieved. In order to rationalise fungicide inputs (e.g. product choice, dose rate, spray frequency and timing, and mixing/alternation of fungicides), and to test anti-resistance strategies aiming to reduce disease inoculum (for example effect of crop free periods of soybean) and delay evolution and spread of resistance against current and new fungicides, high throughput monitoring tools, enabling quantitative measurement of pathogen levels and detection of fungicide resistant alleles, in combination with disease forecasting, are needed.   We will develop real-time disease surveillance, using automated spore trapping with pathogen DNA detection.The status and molecular mechanisms of fungicide resistance in Brazilian pathogen isolates will be assessed, and further resistance evolution predicted through experimental evolution and functional characterisation of resistant alleles. We will then develop molecular diagnostics for rapid, high-throughput monitoring of fungicide resistance. An online portal to share tools, results and recommendations with farmers, agrochemical industry and other stake holders will be created. Improved disease forecasting and optimised disease management strategies would benefit growers (lower production costs), consumers (food safety, residue reduction) and the environment (reduced pesticide applications), by avoiding unnecessary (no epidemic forecast) or ineffective (high levels of resistance) fungicide applications, and prolonging the effectiveness of fungicides for when they are needed.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Wheat blast (Pyricularia graminis-tritici (Pt)), Asian soybean rust (Phakopsora pachyrhizi (Pp)) and the banana sigatoka complex (Mycosphaerella musicola (Mm) and M. fijiensis (Mf)) are major diseases of wheat, soybean and banana, respectively, in Brazil. Control of the causal pathogens is heavily reliant on fungicides, especially the azoles, Quinone outside Inhibitors (QoIs) and succinate dehydrogenase inhibitors (SDHIs). Resistance risk is high and resistance has already emerged to some key fungicide classes in each of the four pathogens, posing an emerging threat to food security in Brazil. There is a need to more accurately assess the status and spread of fungicide resistance in these pathogens in Brazil; to inform resistance management strategies for sustainable pest management; to establish real-time monitoring of pathogen inoculum levels and fungicide resistance to inform integrated disease management; and to ensure knowledge exchange with farmers and the agrochemical industry to spread best practice. This project will establish a platform and advisory system for a smart and more sustainable crop protection in Brazil with the following activities planned: 1. Develop disease surveillance tools based on real-time DNA-based quantitative detection of airborne spores of Pp, Mf, Mm and Pt and correlate these with visual assessment of diseases in the field and weather data; 2. Application of DNA based diagnostics and next generation sequencing (NGS) to detect fungicide resistant alleles; 3. Setting up web portal for knowledge transfer on disease surveillance and spread of fungicide resistance (data and protocols); 4. Sample pathogen populations and assess the fungicide sensitivity status to different fungicide classes and elucidate current fungicide resistance mechanisms in insensitive field strains;  5. In vitro experimental evolution experiments of SDHI fungicide adaptation 6.     Sdh functional constraint analysis using a yeast-based heterologous fungal Sdh expression system to anticipate the emergence and further spread of SDHI resistant alleles for this recently-introduced fungicide class.</narrative>
