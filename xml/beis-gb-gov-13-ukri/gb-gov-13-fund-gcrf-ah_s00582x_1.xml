   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Beyond exchange: raising the value, increasing flow and ensuring socio-economic impact of arts &amp; cultural resources in peripheral territories (Brazil)</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">International cultural exchange  combined with collaborative knowledge creation increases the ability of arts organisations to develop social capital and &quot;engaged citizenship&quot;, delivering multiple socio-economic benefits for low-income territories. Previous research undertaken through the AHRC-funded project THE ART OF CULTURAL EXCHANGE: 2014-2016 [AH/M003612/1]  produced research showing how knowledge mobilization between artists and arts companies in UK and Brazil produced dynamic and innovative benefits linked to human and social development. This new proposal will shift the axis of exchange, moving from between Brazil and the UK to across Brazilian arts and cultural organisations focused on delivering significant economic, social, cultural, welfare in low-income territories of extreme vulnerability. British and Brazilian researchers will collaborate with civil society arts organisations  based in socially vulnerable territories in Brazil to develop resources, training activities and knowledge-mobilization activities for hyper-local cultural institutions in the creative economy of Rio de Janeiro&apos;s peripheral communities to strengthen and measure their impact towards the UN Sustainable Development Goals, with particular emphasis on: SDG1 (no poverty), SDG8 (decent work and economic growth), SDG16 (peace, justice and strong institutions) and SDG17 (partnerships for the goals). Drawing from the original research and by continuing on the pathways to impact that have followed, a collaborative British and Brazilian team will set up a and run a Cultural Exchange Hub for the Creative Economy in the favela-complex of Mar&#xE9;, and support a shared learning programme to train 60 arts leaders and managers working in the creative economy on innovative social technologies and methodologies that measure their socio-economic impact. The aim of the project is to draw from AHRC-funded research to strengthen the capacity of local arts organisations and create an engaged network across the city of Rio de Janeiro that builds alliances with key stakeholders responsible for policy-level decisions that can sustain development-focused creative economy initiatives. This Follow-on Funded project will take forward the innovations in creative practices advanced through research on UK-Brazil exchanges THE ART OF CULTURAL EXCHANGE. The hub and training programme will enable local producers, consumers and makers of policy in the cultural sector to construct new narratives of evaluation, facilitating civil society organisations based in vulnerable territories to enhance their work towards social and human development goals and to contribute to wider debates about how the arts create safer, healthier, wealthier and more equitable communities. The project has been co-created with two cultural organisations based in territories subject to high indices of lethal violence and low indices of socio-economic development in Rio de Janeiro. Redes da Mar&#xE9; [Mar&#xE9; Networks] and Agencia de Redes para a Juventude [the Agency for Youth Networks] will ensure that learning from the original research is put into practice by organisations using arts initiatives to achieve sustainable progress in multiple dimensions of human development across over 30 peripheral communities. The project has been designed to engage policymakers from government and non-governmental agencies in the co-creation of the evaluation indicators to ensure that the new evidence and data that is produced by the hub and training programme informs and shapes the creation of cultural policy that focuses on social and human development. This Follow-On project will mobilise knowledge, extend the impact of research and build a mutually sustaining network of cultural practitioners and policymakers that strengthens the capacity of arts organisation to address human and social development issues and demonstrate progress towards the UN SDGs.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project&apos;s objectives have been developed by HERITAGE and VALIATI in participation with Redes da Mar&#xE9; (SILVA) and Agencia (FAUSTINI). They are built on research and knowledge created through the collaboration between UK and Brazilian investigators (academic and non-academic) that was generated by the AHRC-funded project THE ART OF CULTURAL EXCHANGE [AH/M003612/1]. Key objectives: * Improve institutional and organisational capacity of arts and cultural organizations based in peripheral and vulnerable territories to deliver and be seen to deliver socio-economic benefits * Incentivise knowledge mobilization by establishing a hub for training in evaluation and skills acquisition in the creative economy and micro-cultural industries (to be based in the favela complex of Mar&#xE9;, Rio de Janeiro) * Enable socially and economically disadvantaged people to shape and inform decision-making that directly affects their territories by training 60 participants from 30 favela-based cultural NGOs working in socially vulnerable territories in Rio de Janeiro with an emphasis on strategies of evaluation, data production and social impact. The training will: - increase the participant organisations&apos; capacity to evaluate and produce data and evidence about socio-economic impact; - advance the practice of local arts organisations by sharing innovative practice emerging from UK-Brazil research and exchanges; - encourage arts organisations to become hubs and incubators of social innovation by working together and sharing knowledge and evaluation data; - contribute to shift in policy by nurturing a collaborative dialogue with key government leaders and managers; - support organisations to build resilience through the production and analysis of data about their outcomes and impact - provide supporting materials online, including interactive content which will be provided through Google Classroom or a similar free platform to ensure wide shareability and reach * Improve public understanding of cultural strategies for human and social development and facilitate co-creation of policy through two public seminars disseminating knowledge produced by the original research and the new activities of the Follow-On phase * Short term objective: Increase impact of the project by evaluating all activities across the programme through quantitative surveys and semi-structured interviews to monitor the number of beneficiaries, the territories and/or institutions where they work, the changes that they have implemented as a result of the training and the efficacy of the programme. The learning from this on-going evaluation will be used to adjust and improve the project as it takes place. * Medium to long term objectives:  - Influence policy and practice through publication and dissemination of project report that includes co-created, locally produced evaluation of the progress towards UN Sustainable Development Goals 1, 8, 17 &amp; 17 by cultural organisations working in 30 territories subject to high indices of lethal violence and low indices of socio-economic development in Rio de Janeiro - Build sustainable models for delivering the project activities after the end of the Follow-on Funding - Continue the flow of knowledge and expertise between the UK and Brazil about how the creative economy and cultural industries can have a measurable and quantifiable impact on poverty reduction and social equality thus contributing more effectively to achieving the objectives of the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.</narrative>
