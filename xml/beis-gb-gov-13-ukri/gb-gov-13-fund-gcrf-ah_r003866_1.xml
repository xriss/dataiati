   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Gendering the smart city: A subaltern curation network on Gender Based Violence (GBV) in India</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This two-year research network interweaves urban studies, feminist geography and digital humanities to critically engage with the smart city agenda on women&apos;s safety and gender based violence (GBV). It is timely and innovative in approach by bringing together a multidisciplinary collective of feminist and urban geographers, ICT initiatives, feminist NGOs and media artists from UK and India. It shifts the debates around smart urban futures in the global north by focusing on highly marginalized and invisible subaltern citizens of the global south - GBV survivors living in slums and informal settlements of Delhi and Bengaluru.  It identifies and addresses the faultlines in current smart city agendas, which seek to resolve key societal challenges of GBV through the technocratic rationality of crowdsourced safety apps.  This network draws upon urban studies debates to move away from a &apos;one size fits all&apos; (Kitchin 2015) critique to examine the diversity of &apos;actually existing smart cities&apos; (Shelton et. al. 2014) in India. It draws upon feminist geography debates on GBV as &apos;a form of political, institutional and economic violence&apos; (McIllwaine 2013, 66) and combines the liminality of cyberspace with that of everyday corporeality (Madge and O&apos;Connor 2005) to enable an embodied and gendered approach to the smart city. It uses digital humanities methods to develop the notion of a &apos;data body&apos; (Critical Art Ensemble 1995) - a virtual entity that is unencumbered by the real and imagined boundaries which structure and control women&apos;s everyday experiences with GBV.   The network activities will be delivered through two city stakeholder workshops in Delhi and Bengaluru which will share knowledge, build capacity and explore how their smart city agendas of creating safe and sustainable cities can be gendered through the voices, experiences and digital practices of GBV survivors. In particular, each workshop will explore how the existing big data on GBV collected from different sources can be creatively curated. The focus of each workshop will be an interactive digital installation on the gender smart city, co-produced by digital artists and GBV survivors. The network will culminate in a symposium and exhibition in London to foster long-term international collaborations on gendering the smart city across UK and India.  Through these activities, the network will answer three research questions.  1: How are smart city agendas addressing challenges of safe cities? We will examine smart city visions, policies, projects and technologies of Delhi and Bengaluru to understand how they aim to address GBV across public and private spaces and deliver on NUA and SDG goals on Gender Equality and New Technologies.   2: What are the &apos;hotspots&apos; and &apos;blindspots&apos; of gendered big data on GBV? We will work with our societal partner, to examine the social and spatial unevenness of the gendered big data in their Safetipin app. This currently stands at crowdsourced safety audits of over 50,000 geolocations in Delhi and 10,000 in Bengaluru. We will focus particularly on the invisibility of this data in slums and informal settlements in both cities. in order to understand the reasons behind this we will engage with a range of stakeholders from smart city experts, law enforcement to grassroots GBV organisations.  3: How can the data-driven smart city be gendered by GBV survivors? Through our networks in NGOs we will work with GBV survivors in slums by using digital humanities methods (such as networked narratives, garment testimonials, campaign hashtags and augmented mapping) to build specific capabilities for freedom as fundamental rights of all citizens (Nussbaum 2006).   The network outcomes will include a project website for knowledge exchange supported by regular social media engagements. Academic outputs include a special issue in a high-impact refereed journal and the development of long term collaborations through a larger research grant application.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This two-year research network will develop and build upon strong foundations established through partnerships between UK and Indian academics and societal partners, with a broad aim of gendering the smart city agenda. To do so, it will use interdisciplinary approaches from urban studies, feminist geography and digital humanities to critique smart city claims of creating safe and sustainable cities through crowdsourced safety apps for women. It tests the hypothesis that the corporate driven smart city based on Big Data and Internet of Things (IoT) produces cities as &apos;containers&apos; for smart technologies and GBV survivors as passive data-sensors with a disembodied yet &apos;real&apos; experience of intimate violence in the city. The network thus aims to establish an alternative curation framework on Gender Based Violence (GBV) through a combination of gendered big data as well as the voices, experiences and creative digital practices of GBV survivors in informal settlements.   The network will fulfill the following objectives:  1) To establish a network of academics, ICT enterprises, feminist NGOs and creative industries from UK and India working conceptually to engage in dialogue between current strands of research and development-oriented work on the safe smart city. While Delhi and Bengaluru&apos;s smart city agendas seek to establish them as safe cities by promoting crowdsoured safety apps for women, this network will seek to identify the &apos;blindspots&apos; of gendered big data on GBV to develop alternative curation frameworks with GBV survivors.  2) To promote and develop a network of support, co-operation and knowledge exchange in two city focused stakeholder workshops in Delhi and Bengaluru. We will examine the smart city visions, policies, projects and technologies of Delhi and Bengaluru to understand how they aim to address gender justice across public and private spaces and deliver on NUA and SDG goals on Gender Equality and New Technologies. We will invite a range of stakeholders from academics, third sector, creative industries, law enforcement agencies, state departments, media/digital enterprises and grassroots organizations working on this theme. The aim will be to initiate pathways to shift current smart city agendas in Delhi and Bengaluru to make them more responsive to the experiences of GBV survivors.   3) To co-create two digital installations with GBV survivors from informal settlements in Delhi and Bengaluru to give them voice, agency and creative space within the smart city. The installations will use digital humanities methods to explore the &apos;data body&apos; - a virtual entity that is unencumbered by the real and imagined boundaries which structure and control women&apos;s everyday experiences with GBV. The installations will initiate transformational change amongst GBV survivors and establish them as rights claiming citizens across material and digital spaces.  4) To strengthen international links between academic and non-academic partners in fostering critical dialogues on the smart city agenda on women&apos;s safety. This will be established through a London symposium in Somerset house, hosted by King&apos;s College London and the King&apos;s College London Cultural Institute (KCLCI).  5) To develop a multidisciplinary and international scope to the theme in the establishment of a project website and social media engagement through the duration of the project. The website will be regularly maintained by the team and will disseminate findings and engage with wider publics via regular blogs and announcements. 6) Catalyse the development of a long-term research programme on the gendered smart city. We will develop the network interaction between Indian and UK academics through published outputs and a joint RCUK grant application within 18 months of the project end.</narrative>
