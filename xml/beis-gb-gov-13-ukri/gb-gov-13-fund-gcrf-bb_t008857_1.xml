   <narrative xml:lang="EN">One in five members of the United Nations are small island developing states (SIDS): 38 countries with a combined population of 61 million.  The majority of these are poor, eligible for official development assistance, and over a quarter are &apos;least developed&apos; countries. They have high burdens of malnutrition, including overweight and obesity alongside anaemia in women of reproductive age, and additionally some, such as Haiti, also have high burdens of childhood stunting.   Over the past 3 decades malnutrition in SIDS has been exacerbated by an increasing reliance on food imports, the majority of which are of low nutritional quality.  SIDS Governments have committed to increasing the local production and consumption of nutritious food as a way of increasing food security and sovereignty and addressing the high burden of malnutrition related morbidity and mortality. This proposal is intended to add to the evidence base and research capacity to support these policy commitments.    The proposal builds on development work undertaken in partnership with the Universities of the South Pacific and West Indies in two SIDS: Fiji and St Vincent and the Grenadines (SVG) respectively. Through this work evaluation methods were developed and pilot data collected. In addition, relationships were established with two local and very well established NGOs, the Foundation for Rural Integration and Enterprise Development (FRIEND) in Fiji and Richmond Vale Academy in SVG.   In this proposal we will co-create community based interventions to improve local food production and consumption with these two NGOs and evaluate their impacts on household nutrition and household expenditures. Mixed methods will be used, including quantitative household surveys, qualitative in-depth group interviews and photo voice. The design of the interventions will be informed by preliminary work that identifies and appraises available evidence on current dietary intakes in those settings, and the nutritional value of locally produced foods. The design will also be informed by &apos;mapping&apos; the food systems in Fiji and SVG. This will be done by engaging stakeholders from across the food value chain in a participatory process, including a workshop, in which the factors, and the relationships between them, contributing to the burdens of malnutrition will be drawn.    In addition, to the full development and testing of interventions in Fiji and SVG, new work will be undertaken in Haiti. In Haiti available dietary and nutritional evidence will also be collated and appraised, and stakeholders engaged in mapping the food system. Pilot data will be collected in the Nippes region of Haiti, including on household nutrition and the opportunities for increasing household and small holder food production as a means to improving nutrition. This work will inform the design of an intervention ready for further roll out and evaluation.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="One in five members of the United Nations are small island developing states (SIDS): 38 countries with a combined population of 61 million.  The majority of these are poor, eligible for official development assistance, and over a quarter are &apos;least developed&apos; countries. They have high burdens of malnutrition, including overweight and obesity alongside anaemia in women of reproductive age, and additionally some, such as Haiti, also have high burdens of childhood stunting.

SIDS Governments have committed to increasing the local production and consumption of nutritious food as a way of increasing food security and sovereignty and addressing the high burden of malnutrition related morbidity and mortality. This proposal is intended to add to the evidence base and research capacity to support these policy commitments.    The proposal builds on the Community Food and Health (CFaH) project (MRC grant no. MR/P025250/1).  CFaH aimed to develop methods and collect pilot data to inform further work on the relationships between locally owned or managed food production initiatives, their contribution to local dietary quality, and identify potential facilitators and barriers to increasing their contribution to improved dietary quality. This formative work was undertaken in St Vincent and the Grenadines (SVG) and Fiji, where we now propose to engage local stakeholders and work with two very well established and local NGOs to develop and evaluate interventions. In addition, the proposal incorporates new work to address the burdens of malnutrition in Haiti, the poorest country in the western hemisphere.  Aim: To co-create and evaluate community and household level interventions aimed at improving local food production and nutrition. This will be informed by evidence reviews and participatory model building to map local food systems and take a gender-sensitive approach.  Objectives:    1. To systematically identify, collate and appraise published and grey literature on: a. Interventions in small island developing states designed to improve nutrition through improved consumption of local foods; b. The dietary intakes, nutritional status, and sources of food consumed in Fiji, SVG and Haiti;  c. The nutritional value of locally produced and consumed foods in Fiji, SVG and Haiti.  2. In each country, to engage with stakeholders from across the food value chain and including government policy makers in order to: a. Create a map of the food system and its relationship to the double burden of malnutrition, with a focus on vulnerable population groups; b. Identify systemic barriers and facilitators (including current policy environments) to increasing production and the consumption of healthy local foods.  3. In Fiji and SVG, to use the findings from the first two objectives to work with the Foundation for Rural Integration and Enterprise Development (FRIEND) and Richmond Vale Academy respectively in order to design and implement interventions aimed at improving household nutrition.  4. In SVG and Fiji, to evaluate the short term (12 to 16 months) effects of the interventions on dietary quality, food security, sources of food consumed and household expenditure.  5. In Haiti, to undertake pilot work to design and evaluate the feasibility of an intervention aimed at improving local food production and household nutrition."></capital-spend>
