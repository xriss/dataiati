   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Capacity building for bioinformatics in Latin America</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Data-driven biology promises to have a major impact on health, agriculture and environmental management. However, in Latin America uptake of data-driven biology has lagged behind despite a clear need. For example, Analysis of human genome data submitted to public databases shows that populations of African and Latin American descent, Hispanics, and indigenous people are barely represented in genomics studies[1]. Given the need to have genome data from those populations for the development of precision medicine in clinical practice, it is necessary to boost the collection of genomics data in Latin American populations. A similar scenario is found for biodiversity in the region, where there is a gap in the knowledge of the majority of the living organisms, which represents over 60% of the total number of terrestrial species on the biosphere[2]. Only by understanding the impact on biodiversity of human-driven activities such as intensive farming and urbanisation can we find a balance between economic development and the preservation and sustainable use of natural resources.  We propose a capacity-building programme, led by EMBL-EBI in close collaboration with new and existing collaborators in Latin American countries, including Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Mexico, Peru and Venezuela - all countries on the ODA development list. Through a combination of secondments, training workshops, eLearning resources and  &apos;train-the-trainer&apos; activities, we will sustainably build expertise in the fundamental skills required to generate, store, visualise, analyse and interpret biomolecular data. We will focus on three use cases: (1) Food security; (2) Data-driven monitoring and management of communicable disease; and (3) monitoring biodiversity. Biological data can be used to track pandemics in humans and livestock (the recent Zikavirus outbreak, for example), understand and mitigate the causes of crop failure, and monitor biodiversity. Our top priority area in the ODA development strategy is therefore strengthening resilience and response to crises. Latin America is a major producer and exporter of meat, fruit, vegetables and coffee. Biofuel production is also growing. These industries are crucial for the development of the region, and yet put huge pressure on Latin America&apos;s unparalleled biodiversity, which is not only of enormous importance in its own right but also contributes to economic prosperity through ecotourism. Data-driven biology can facilitate the production of crops and livestock that are more resilient to environmental challenges and enables sophisticated monitoring of an area&apos;s biodiversity. Our second priority area in the ODA development strategy is therefore promoting global prosperity.  By incorporating training on how to manage bioinformatics research infrastructure, and by involving local funders and policymakers in these workshops, we hope to contribute to the professionalisation of bioinformatics services throughout the region. This will enhance Latin America&apos;s ability to provide a significant contribution to international research projects such as the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health.  Expected outcomes of the project include: Increased use of bioinformatics tools and resources to solve research problems of direct relevance to the ODA development strategy Increased use of bioinformatics to solve applied research problems A sustainable network of skilled bioinformaticians who are also motivated and talented trainers of other researchers Enduring collaborations and mentorships that encourage women and other underrepresented groups in the research community to develop successful careers in bioinformatics and related subjects.

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The programme will address the slow implementation of data-driven biology in Latin-American countries, which have invested in genomics and bioinformatics but have an urgent lack of skills to make full use of the technology. We will implement a sustainable capacity-building programme focusing on three challenges of relevance in Latin America: communicable disease, sustainable food production and protection of biodiversity. This will accelerate use of bioinformatics in lead institutions in the region, which will become hubs in a pan-Latin-American bioinformatics network. Our consortium of ten partners in six Latin American countries will be nucleate and nurture expertise within and beyond their national boundaries, and forge collaborations with UK-based scientists that outlive the the project. Working with researchers from these institutions, we will deliver: Research secondments: Scientists from Latin America, regardless of career stage, will join an EMBL-EBI group for 6 months to develop their bioinformatics skills. EMBL-EBI group leaders have identified suitable projects that span curiosity-driven research, software development, data curation and creation of bioinformatics training materials. The projects&apos; outcomes will be placed in the public domain: Research papers will be published in open-access journals Software will be licensed under open source licenses Datasets will be made openly available (unless there are ethical reasons for controlling access) through EMBL-EBI&apos;s data resources and tools Training materials be given a CC-BY-SA license and made freely available through EMBL-EBI&apos;s elearning resource, Train online &apos;Train the trainer&apos; workshops: small groups of scientists from the network will visit EMBL-EBI for two weeks to receive tailor-made training on how to develop and deliver successful bioinformatics training. Part of this time will be spent developing training activities, which our visitors will then immediately use by participating as trainers in an EMBL-EBI course on one of our challenge topics. This will enable them to expand their network in the UK because we will involve bioinformatics experts from other UK-based organisations. This will lay the foundation for our partner institutions to develop a network of bioinformatics training centres throughout the continent. Short courses in Latin America: Our consortium will deliver 28 short courses - one in each participating country per year. Initially these will take place in our partner institutions; we will then engage with new hosts in our partner countries and in other countries on the DAC list in Latin America. These courses will be a joint effort between EMBL-EBI scientists and local scientists, with EMBL-EBI&apos;s direct involvement reducing as local experience is gained. Some courses will focus on research management and management of research infrastructure; others will focus on development of bioinformatics competencies relevant to our three grand challenges. Elearning resources: a key factor in ensuring the scalability and sustainability of our programme is the creation of elearning courses addressing our three challenges. These will provide a shared resource for use by all of our Latin American training centres; they will catalyse the roll-out of bioinformatics education and training to universities, thus inspiring the next generation of bioinformatics-aware researchers in Latin America, and they will become an instrument for ongoing collaboration among EMBL-EBI, our Latin American network, and our collaborators in the UK. We will build on infrastructure developed through a recent BBSRC-funded project - Bioinformatics for Discovery - to develop workflow-based courses around each of our three use cases. In all cases we will incentivise participants from minority groups, including women and individuals from minority ethnic groups. We will include a diversity expert on our advisory board and create a mentorship network for underrepresented groups.</narrative>
