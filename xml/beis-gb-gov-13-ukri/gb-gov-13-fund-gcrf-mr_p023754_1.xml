   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Bioengineering to combat the tuberculosis pandemic</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Infectious diseases remain an ongoing cause of poor health and mortality in the poorest countries in the world. Tuberculosis kills more humans than any other infection and is principally a disease of poverty. Unfortunately recent studies examining new vaccine approaches or shorter antibiotic courses have not been successful, demonstrating that more research and understanding of the disease is required to combat the pandemic. Tuberculosis is also becoming progressively more resistant to antibiotics used to treat it. It is widely accepted that highly innovative approaches that draw on diverse specialists are required to achieve control of tuberculosis.  This project will combine expertise at the University of Southampton, which specifically focuses on cross-disciplinary research, with the African Health Research Institute in Durban, a state-of-the-art laboratory set up to be at the heart of the tuberculosis and HIV pandemics. It is centred on a new way of studying infection in the laboratory, which relies on an innovative cellular spraying technique that permits studies of infected human cells in three-dimensions and attached to lung supporting fibres. This system has been developed at Southampton and will be introduced laboratories in Durban, where we will harness the expertise in investigation of samples from patients and fluidics to further develop the model. We will prove that this system can be used to understand how infection occurs, to investigate new vaccine strategies and to identify novel antibiotic regimes.  There will be four programmes of work which will take place both in Southampton and Durban, with regular exchange of researchers between the centres, joint conferences and scheduled videoconferences. First, we will study cells isolated from lungs removed during surgery as part of their routine clinical care.  We will compare cells from patients who either are controlling tuberculosis infection or who have developed disease to examine the factors leading to active disease. Secondly, we will separate cells which are controlling infection from cells where infection is progressing and systematically study biology to understand how human cells either control infection or permit progression. Thirdly, we will change the host immune cells using genetic engineering technology to unpick which components of the body&apos;s immune response is beneficial in controlling infection compared to that which causes damage. Finally, we will combine the human cell system with miniature fluid irrigation apparatus to permit modulation of antibiotic concentrations over time to identify l more effective treatment regimes.  This project will deliver a transformative approach to the tuberculosis pandemic, identifying new vaccine targets and antibiotic regimes, and initiate a highly complimentary collaboration which we will develop over the two years to deliver innovative cross-disciplinary research to address diseases affecting the poorest in the world.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This grant will develop a sustainable collaboration between the University of Southampton, where the 3-diminsional bioelectrospray model of TB has been developed, with the Africa Health Research Institute (AHRI) in Durban, which has highly complimentary expertise in analysis of human samples and microfluidics set in a world class laboratory infrastructure. We will study tuberculosis, an infection which kills more humans than any other, as a paradigm to demonstrate the potential of bridging biological and engineering sciences to address diseases affecting the most economically challenged countries in the world.  We will deliver a platform that can be equally applied to a diverse range of infectious diseases, and is also applicable to non-clinical diseases such as cancer.  The project is led by early career investigators who have already established international reputations within their respective fields and will combine biological, bioinformatic and engineering expertise to deliver a unique research team.  The bioelectrospray system permits the analysis of primary human cells in 3 dimensions and the context of extracellular matrix, and therefore represents a transformative system.  This grant will set up the bioelectrospray system to the AHRI in Durban, centred at the epicentre of the TB and HIV pandemics, and benefit from iterative technology exchange between the two centres.  There are four specific work streams.  First, we will integrate stromal cells into the cell culture system and then study cells from patients controlling tuberculosis to those from patients with active tuberculosis to prove the potential of the model system to interrogate host immunity to Mycobacterium tuberculosis ex vivo. Secondly, we will integrate the system with microfluidics to systematically interrogate granulomas that are controlling infection versus those where infection is progressing using unbiased readouts. Thirdly, we will utilise expertise in T cell cloning and transduction to dissect the protective versus pathological immune response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis to demonstrate the potential of the system to study complex immune phenomena. Finally, we will extend and combine current workstreams on antibiotic sensitivity testing ongoing in both groups to provide a platform that permits pharmacokinetic and physiological modelling around microspheres with high throughput capability.  The project addresses tuberculosis, a global pandemic with high incidence in all poor parts of the world, and also provides proof of concept that this highly interdisciplinary approach can be applied to a diverse range of human diseases prevalent in resource limited settings. Its will springboard the collaboration to secure ongoing funding for each workstream to provide deliverable novel healthcare solutions and set the collaboration up to make the methodology available to researchers in diverse fields.</narrative>
