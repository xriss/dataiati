   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Improving the Quality of Universal Home Visiting: The case of Creciendo con Nuestros Hijos (CNH) in Ecuador</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">It is well established that the first years of life lay the basis for lifelong development. However, many children in developing countries are exposed to poverty, malnutrition, illnesses, and un-stimulating home environments. These factors are likely to have a detrimental effect on children&apos;s cognitive, motor, physical, and socio-emotional development, thus hindering them from reaching their full developmental potential. As adults, they are more likely to provide fewer adequate stimulation and resources for their children, thus contributing to the intergenerational transmission of poverty and inequality.   A consolidated body of research has provided evidence that interventions in the early years of life can improve well-being across the life course by promoting early childhood development. The most effective interventions provide direct learning experiences to children and their families. In the last few decades, home-visiting programmes have grown in popularity in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) and elsewhere. While small-scale trials have shown sustained long-term results, however the important question remains as to whether such results can be achieved at scale. The focus on monitoring is critical, since the impact of these programs might be weakened by implementation challenges across a diversity of settings, human resources, systems, and geographical configurations, both within and across countries.  An important research and policy agenda is therefore to monitor, report and sustain the performance of the home visitors, especially when the programmes are run at scale. In this research, we propose to co-design, set up and use a sustainable monitoring system for a large-scale home visiting programme for disadvantaged children in Ecuador: Creciendo con Nuestros Hijos (CNH). This is a home visiting program which targets pregnant women and children of ages 0 to 36 months with weekly visits. The home visitors provide counselling for caregivers regarding child development, healthy behaviours, and proper nutrition; and promote awareness of other social programs.   CNH has been in place for more than twenty years, and is currently reaching almost 200,000 children; however, a centralised system for monitoring and reporting key performance indicators has never been put in place. In this project, we propose a partnership between an interdisciplinary academic team of experts in early interventions and home visiting from University College London, together with the Ministry of Economic and Social Inclusion (MIES) of Ecuador and J-PAL Latin America (JPAL-LAC), to pursue this important goal.  In the first part of the project, we will set up an Information and Reporting System (IRS) for CNH. First, we will co-develop with the programme staff and key stakeholders a performance indicators and systems outcomes framework, which identifies the relevant data to be collected. This will include both data on the program implementation, such as frequency, duration and content of the visits (currently not recorded), and data on children&apos;s growth and cognitive development (now collected in paper format). The appropriate software app will be developed for the tablets and the home visitors will be trained in their use.  In the second part of the project, we will use the CNH-IRS to improve the quality of the home visiting program. First, we will co-design the template for a standardised reporting card and examine how much variation there is in programme quality; whether certain observable characteristics of the home visitors are associated with better performance; and whether better performance indicators are associated with better children&apos;s outcomes. Second, we will co-design a low-cost motivational intervention via SMS messages, and evaluate with a randomized controlled trial its impact on performance and children&apos;s outcomes.  Our project has the potential to yield significant benefits for the development of children in Ecuador.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The overall aim of this project is to improve the quality of the universal home visiting programme Creciendo con Nuestros Hijos (CNH) in Ecuador, by co-designing, implementing and using as an evaluation, monitoring and improvement tool a sustainable tablet-based information and reporting system. This aim will be accomplished via the following objectives.  Objective 1: to design, jointly with CNH staff and key stakeholders, a Performance Indicators Framework (CNH-PIF) and implement it with a newly developed, tablet-based Information Reporting System.   CNH started in 1997 and targets pregnant women and children of ages 0 to 36 months. The home visitors (so-called &quot;family educators&quot;) provide information to caregivers about healthy parenting practices aimed at promoting child development in all its dimensions, from cognitive to socio-emotional and health development. By March 2019, CNH was reaching almost 200,000 children, however the information collected on both programme implementation and children&apos;s outcomes is very limited. We will co-design a set of core performance metrics to track the quality of the programme and a tablet-based data collection system to collect information in an electronic system.  Objective 2: to assess the quality of the implementation of CNH, the characteristics of the home visitors associated with better performance, and the association between programme quality and children&apos;s outcomes.  We will analyse the newly collected key CNH performance indicators and develop a template for a standard reporting card. We will examine how much variation in quality there is across the CNH sites, which factors are correlated with higher quality, and whether better implementation is associated with improved children&apos;s outcomes.  Objective 3: to co-design and evaluate a brief and low-cost multi-component digital motivational intervention aimed at improving the CNH home visitors performance.   We will proceed in two phases: a formative phase in which we will select the intervention components (for example, the delivery of motivational or simple reminder SMS messages), together with the CNH staff, and an evaluation phase, in which we will assess its effectiveness by means of a randomized controlled trial. We will examine the impacts of this multi-component digital interventions on the home visitors performance indicators, and also on the children&apos;s cognitive, motor, physical, and socio-emotional development at 12 and 18 months.  Our proposal is perfectly in line with the GCRF remit: it addresses the global challenge of impaired childhood development through innovative interdisciplinary research, and strengthens the capability for research and innovation, both within UK and in Ecuador. It is highly collaborative and based on a partnership between UK academics, the Ministry of Social and Economic Inclusion of Ecuador and JPAL Latin America, with the support of a technical advisory group of interdisciplinary experts. Our project will build links with current and prospective beneficiaries since its earliest stages of development. By improving the quality of delivery of a large-scale home visiting programme which provides education to the parents, it will reduce the barrier for poor and vulnerable groups to enter the educational system in conditions of disadvantage. By co-developing an electronic performance indicator system, it will promote best practices for the collection of data and the monitoring of large-scale early education programmes. By co-designing with end users an innovative, digital, multi-component motivational intervention for the home visitors, will advance the use of EdTech in developing contexts.</narrative>
