   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Peru is one the world&apos;s worst COVID affected countries. Gaps in social welfare, poor infrastucture and living conditions and high levels of informal employment exacerbate the impact of this disease. Artisanal fisheries are an important and overlooked activity which provides employment and basic nutrition for some of the poorest in rural areas. Thousands of jobs in the seadood supply chain are affected by  the pandemic. In the Piura region, the impact on fishing communities is expected to be higher due to the large number of people involved in fisheries-dependent activities and the lack of alternative economic opportunities. There has been no systematic effort to document the impact of COVID on these communities. The Regional Government has identified a need for this information in order to respond with appropiate social welfare measures and is leading an Inter-Agency Consortium (IAC) to re-establish artisanal fisheries activities. This project will support the IAC by collecting and disseminating data on the impact of COVID in fishing communities. It will assess key fisheries, rigorously estimate the impact of the pandemic througout the supply chain and look at the way that this has, or needs to adapt to become more resilient.  Throught the timely provision of relevant socio-economic information through a virtual online platform, this project will support decision-making by fishers, government and society in general, By engaging stakeholders in affected communities the project will develop recommendations for a sustained re-activation of fishing and associated activities.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="i) Aims and objectives The project aims to increase the socio-economic resilience of fishing communities to impacts of COVID in northern Peru by developing a systematic data collection and decision support platform that will enhance the capacity of fishing communities, government and wider society to reactivate the seafood supply chain whilst minimising risks to health. Specific objectives of the project are:   a) Conduct a rapid appraisal of the effect of COVID on health, production and socio-economic aspects in the main fishing communities in Piura; b) Map supply and value chains for key selected fisheries and estimate the impact of COVID on production and socio-economic conditions throughout the chain.  c) Evaluate whether the impact of COVID has resulted in novel and adapted supply chains which are potentially more resilient;  d) Engage key stakeholders including the IAC, fishing communities and supply chain representatives and disseminate targeted decision support information online. e) Develop recommendations to allow re-activation and unremitted fishing and associated activities while minimising risks to health."></capital-spend>
