   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Due to the prevailing monsoon, abundant river systems and long coastlines, floods, as a result of multiple drivers (commonly including heavy rainfall, typhoons and tropical storms) repeatedly affect millions of people in many Southeast/South Asian countries each year. There is an urgent need to develop and implement effective risk communication and management strategies to prepare the local communities for future floods, i.e. improve awareness, reduce vulnerability, mitigate impacts, and save life, and eventually develop resilience. Through actively involving community members throughout the decision-making and implementation processes, community-based disaster risk management (CBDRM) provides a cost-effective bottom-up means to improve the awareness of communities about risks, provide them with access to collective resources and knowledge, and develop community-based preparedness and adaption/mitigation programmes. CBDRM has been implemented in Southeast/South Asian countries to reduce the impacts of flooding and develop community resilience. However, existing CBDRM projects have rarely taken advantage of the latest remote sensing products, high-performance computing for flood prediction and citizen science/crowd sourcing technologies, which have experienced substantial advancement particularly in the last decade. Collectively, these provide the potential to significantly advance the current CBDRM practice.  The overarching aim of REMATCH is to take on the exciting and timely opportunity from recent scientific and technological advances and develop an innovative and effective community-based flood risk management strategy to create a step change in building community resilience to flooding from multiple sources. Specifically in this foundation-building project we will 1) assemble an inter-disciplinary research team and establish an extensive researcher-stakeholder partnership to develop effective approaches to co-produce/share knowledge, communicate and manage risk, and enhance community resilience to flooding; 2) apply a multi-hazard risk analysis framework to quantify flood risk and understand the key drivers of flood hazards; 3) investigate and understand the historical and cultural implications for contemporary resilience building and impacts on socio-economic development; 4) adopt a citizen science approach to scope a pilot community-based flood forecasting and warning system based on crowd-sourced and remote-sensing data streams and real-time flood modelling technology; and 5) identify the major challenges in developing community resilience and develop a preliminary approach to measuring community flood resilience. These research objectives will be achieved through a carefully designed research programme, and implemented and tested in a case study site in Vietnam. During the project, we will also evaluate the feasibility for implementation in Bangladesh and other Southeast/South Asian countries for the full GCRF proposal.</narrative>

These objectives will be achieved through a carefully designed research programme and implemented and tested in a case study site in Vietnam, facilitating the development of a full GCRF proposal to address the global challenge of building flood resilience in South/Southeast Asia (for which we have partners in Bangladesh and Thailand). This proposal will directly address, fully or in part, several research themes as detailed in the AO document, including underlying drivers of disaster risk (O2), understanding of and ability to forecast environmental hazards (O4), communication (O1&amp;2), governance (O1), incentivising action and measuring resilience (O5), cultural implications in building resilience (O3), and improving effectiveness of research engagement and uptake (O1)."></capital-spend>
