  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Examining Gender in Higher Education (EGHE): exploring gendered patterns of  participation and success in STEM and beyond. A UK-African Countries Network.  The proposed network, Examining Gender in Higher Education (EGHE), draws together academics and activists to share and build knowledge and expertise on key areas of concern in gender and higher education (HE) comparatively across a range of African countries as well as the UK; and to build the foundations for sustained research that will address key issues of pressing concern in the field. One key area of concern has already been identified: participation and success of women students in STEM subjects. This is a crucial focus area in relation to the goals of gender equality and social justice, and directly supports key priorities of network member countries in terms of economic and infrastructural development.  Scoping work will be undertaken in this focus area and also more broadly on issues related to gender and higher education in member countries as part of the EGHE network&apos;s activities, in order to produce policy briefings and to identify and develop further key areas for future collaboration (including a joint research bid).  The network involves a collaborative partnership between academic colleagues with interdisciplinary expertise based in Rwanda, Uganda, and The Gambia; and at the University of Glasgow, UK, where the administration of the network will be undertaken. Finally the network will benefit from partnership with a prominent pan-African NGO working on issues relating to gender and education, with a key identified focus on STEM: the Forum for African Women Educationalists (FAWE).   Network Aims   Overall aim: To bring together academics with expertise and interests in gender and HE, and gender and STEM in the UK and in a range of African countries to benefit from mutual knowledge exchange.  Sub-aims:  To collaborate on activities that will expand/exchange knowledge on current issues of concern affecting women&apos;s participation and success at HE (as students/graduates and/or academic staff) in the countries involved (looking at issues in individual countries and also comparatively across countries)  To specifically look at the issue of women&apos;s participation in, experiences of, and success at a range of STEM subjects in the participating countries (again with national and comparative foci)  To encourage cross- and interdisciplinary collaborations (notably between educationalists, sociologists and STEM academics)  To develop the research capacity of ECRs in all participating countries   To provide strong research links that will form the basis for future collaborative research projects on these themes   Network Activities  The network will create impact in relation to policy and practice within and outside HE institutions, by engaging with policymakers, practitioners, and other stakeholders through a range of activities including two Scoping Exercises mapping the current literature and key issues in members&apos; national contexts (one on the topic of Gender and STEM in HE and one identifying further areas of key concern). The findings of these exercises will be developed into accessible policy briefings, translated into French, which will be disseminated at a number of academic and stakeholder events including FAWE&apos;s triennial general meeting in Nairobi. Further network activities include an accessible website/social media presence; the production of a short film for the website; and academic outputs including a peer-reviewed journal paper and a collaborative research grant proposal.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The objectives of the network are for members to collaborate and share knowledge in the following ways:  1. To co-construct and produce two reviews/scoping exercises:   Review 1: to map out key current issues and knowledge gaps in the area of gender and STEM in HE, within (and comparatively across) network countries   Review 2: to map out key pressing current issues and knowledge gaps in other areas of gender and HE in (and comparatively across) network countries  Both reviews will be led by the PI, Dr Read. Prof Schweisfurth will also take the lead on a comparative synthesis of national contextual data for both reviews. All co-Is will contribute to the reviews in relation to their own disciplinary contexts.   In addition, the following members will make specific contributions to Review 1: Dr Miheso-O&apos;Connor (in relation to Kenya) Prof Tanner (the UK), Dr Rubagiza (Rwanda). The following members will make specific contributions to Review 2: Ms Ndow (in relation to the Gambia), Dr Baine (Uganda) Dr Rubagiza (Rwanda), Ms Doroba, Dr Munthali (multiple African contexts)  2. To disseminate the findings from these reviews in the following ways:  a) through two policy briefings to be jointly produced and sent to key policy makers and practitioners in relevant fields. These will be led by the PI and co-authored by the co-Is.  b) through the medium of a dedicated website/social media gateway, designed to be accessible for policy-makers and non-academic practitioners. This will be maintained by the administrator and content contributed to by all network members.  c) through joint presentations at key international conferences and events to both academic and non-academic audiences. This will include a STEM-focused event/conference (by co-I Prof Tanner and at least two other members); the 2017 Gender and Education conference (by PI and at least two other members); and at the FAWE triennial general meeting (by all the team).  d) through the production of a short film based on video footage produced by members and accessible (via a media-sharing platform) on the network website  e) through the joint production of 2 articles for academic journals (one based on Review 1 to be targeted at a gender and STEM journal, and one based on Review 2 to be targeted at Gender and Education journal).   f) to develop at least one jointly-produced large grant proposal to ESRC.   3. To continue strengthening and developing links between members beyond the lifespan of the current grant period, facilitated through the network website and through a social media presence.</narrative>
