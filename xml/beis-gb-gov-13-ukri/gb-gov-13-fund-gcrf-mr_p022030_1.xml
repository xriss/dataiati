  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Globally 210 million women become pregnant each year and more than 300,000 women die from preventable complications. India has the highest number of maternal deaths of any country. Every year, about 45,000 pregnant women die in India compared to only 70 in the UK, with some states like Assam being worse. Although Assam has only half the population of UK, 6 pregnant women die every day. In addition to death, around 5 million pregnant women in India suffer a life-threatening complication. It is therefore essential that work is done to investigate these complications to improve maternal health.  A starting point for this is to ensure that maternal deaths and severe complications are identified accurately so they can be researched. I have already tested the feasibility of such work in two teaching hospitals in Assam, where I successfully collected information on over 22,000 women. I will extend this method (Objective 1) to 16 hospitals in Assam and 2 in Maharashtra, which would enable information to be collected on 100,000 deliveries a year. This approach, using a &apos;research platform&apos; called &apos;Maternal and Perinatal Health Research collaboration, India (MaatHRI)&apos;, will provide a model for examining maternal health in other states in the future.  Anaemia is an important cause of maternal death in India. From my initial work, I found that, over one year, half of the deaths of mothers were due to anaemic heart failure and a third were due to severe bleeding at childbirth with some of the excess risk being related to the management of labour and delivery in anaemic women. Surprisingly, very little is published on maternal anaemic heart failure, so we do not know what individual factors are contributing to it, or why some women die from it whilst others do not. Similarly, we need more information on the safety of inducing and stimulating delivery in anaemic women. As these two areas are the most important, I will start by using MaatHRI to investigate them. I will (1) compare two groups of pregnant women with moderate and severe anaemia: one group who develop heart failure and another who do not, to look at the clinical features and factors leading to heart failure; (2) I will facilitate expert reviews of a sample of pregnancy care notes of women who suffered from heart failure to identify factors that led to the death of some women and the positive elements that saved the lives of others (Objective 2). I will also examine the safety of inducing and stimulating the process of labour in anaemic women (Objective 3) by comparing the outcomes of induction/ stimulated birth with that of normal vaginal delivery, and examine factors that may be influencing the outcomes. The results will be used to develop guidance for (1) the prevention and management of anaemic heart failure, and (2) the safety of inducing or stimulating birth in pregnant women with anaemia. I will do this by running three workshops in years 4-5. This will be done alongside plans to disseminate results and to encourage scaling up of MaatHRI to other hospitals and states (Objective 4).  Finally, I will develop proposals for research to follow on from this fellowship, using MaatHRI (Objective 5). The role of infectious diseases as risk factors for the health and well-being of mothers and babies will be explored. To this end, a survey of infectious diseases in pregnant women will be initiated in year-4. In addition, I will design studies in other areas identified as problematic in my early work, namely: eclampsia, septicaemia and ruptured womb. To summarise, this work will (1) set up a much needed research &apos;platform&apos; to survey key maternal health problems in India; thus enabling (2) studies to understand the reasons for serious complications (starting with anaemic heart failure and safety of induction in anaemic women); leading to (3) the development of guidance and interventions which can be tested and implemented in the future to save the lives of mothers and babies.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Research objectives: 1. To scale up the Maternal and Perinatal Health Research collaboration, India (MaatHRI) to the whole of Assam and two hospitals in Maharashtra. 2. To investigate anaemic heart failure by conducting an unmatched case-control study:  a. to describe the risk factors and clinical characteristics of pregnant women with anaemic heart failure;  b. to examine the clinical management and outcomes of anaemic heart failure;  c. to investigate the factors associated with progression from severe morbidity to death.  3.  To undertake a comprehensive case note review of maternal deaths and morbidity cases to identify lessons for improving care and combining this with evidence from the case-control study to develop clinical guidance. 4. To conduct a large-scale prospective cohort study to examine the safety of induction and augmentation of labour during childbirth in pregnant women with moderate and severe iron deficiency anaemia. 5. To explore the feasibility of rolling out MaatHRI in other hospitals in Maharashtra and in other states across India. 6.  To develop clinical guidance for the prevention and management of anaemic heart failure and inducing and/ or augmenting labour in women with moderate and severe anaemia. 7.  To scope the following future research projects using MaatHRI: a. Direct and indirect effects of malaria, leptospirosis and Japanese Encephalitis on maternal and fetal outcomes starting with a survey of cases and deaths among pregnant women resulting from these infections in year 4 of the project. b. Long term maternal and infant outcomes of heart failure in anaemic pregnant women; c. Priorities for a clinical trial to improve management of labour and delivery in women with moderate and severe iron deficiency anaemia; d. Large population-based studies of eclampsia, uterine rupture and sepsis. Career objectives: 1. To pursue my research interest in maternal and child health in LMICs (particularly South Asia), and to develop this area as my area of expertise within the Nuffield Department of Population Health at Oxford. 2. To develop capacity to independently lead research projects and deliver outcomes and in the process transition to independence. 3. To establish myself as a global maternal and perinatal health scientist both within the University of Oxford and among the wider scientific community, and to independently lead a team of researchers in this field. 4.  To apply for senior fellowships and secure research grant funding to lead and scale up MaatHRI in other states in India, in a phased manner, in order to develop a large and diverse collaborative platform for UK and Indian scientists to roll out population-based studies in maternal and perinatal health in an efficient and cost-effective manner. Objectives for personal development: 1. To develop further skills in large-scale observational epidemiology and statistics. 2. To undertake training in designing and conducting randomized controlled trials. 3. To undertake training and actively participate in public engagement activities. 4. To develop transferable skills for personal and professional development through mentoring and training programmes. 5. To utilize the opportunity to learn from the experiences of the leading academics and scientists from within and outside Oxford who have agreed to be my advisors and mentors throughout the duration of the fellowship.  6. To further develop communication and interpersonal skills by presenting the research outputs in scientific meetings, secondary schools and public science fairs.</narrative>
