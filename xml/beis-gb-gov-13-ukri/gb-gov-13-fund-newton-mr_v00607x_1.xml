   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The NFIS project will increase the reach and sustainability of the ToyBox Study Malaysia kindergarten-based intervention to prevent obesity. The intervention targeted four key behaviours in preschool children: healthy snacking, drinking water, reducing sedentary behaviour and promoting physical activity. This NFIS project sustains and strengthens the experienced team of professionals who delivered the successful ToyBox Malaysia intervention, through training, skill-sharing and knowledge exchange. The team has a wide range of expertise covering public health nutrition, education, community health, epidemiology, intervention trials and psychology, and represents two UK universities and two Malaysian universities representing both peninsular Malaysia and Sarawak. We aim to present the evidence to Malaysian government departments and kindergarten organisations that show how the successful and fundamental aspects of the ToyBox Malaysia programme should become standard delivery nationally in Malaysia. Importantly, we will develop innovative online interactive and animated learning modules and web-based applications promoting healthy behaviours that reduce the risk of obesity. This use of current digital technologies will increase the learning impact and engagement of both kindergarten teachers and children and their parents In addition, we intend to work with stakeholders to revise guidance and practices in relation to kindergarten teacher training, and engagement of parents, so that beneficial energy-balance related health behaviours are encouraged to become habitual among the kindergarten children and their families. By establishing the behavioural and educational basis for development of lifelong healthy behaviours that reduce the risk of obesity and associated health consequences, this collaborative project has the potential to have positive impacts on both costs to Malaysian health services and productivity of individuals and communities throughout the nation.</narrative>
