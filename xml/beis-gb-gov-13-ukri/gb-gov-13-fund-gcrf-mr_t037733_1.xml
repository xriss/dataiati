   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In the Western Cape Province of South Africa, there is a large burden of diseases including infectious diseases HIV and TB as well as chronic diseases like hypertension, diabetes and kidney disease. Often patients have more than one condition at the same time.  The Provincial Health Data Centre (PHDC) at the Department of Health collects ongoing patient information about their visits to health facilities, medicines received and laboratory tests done, in order to provide health care. Where patients consent, these health data can be used for research to better understand health conditions.   Genes and DNA are unique to each individual and can affect whether they will get some diseases, how ill they will get with those illnesses, and how they respond to treatment. By understanding this relationship between DNA and diseases, individual patients will be able to receive better health care tailored to their own DNA sequence. Most of the research done on DNA and diseases until now has been done on Caucasian populations, and African patients have been poorly represented in research. This means that most health care is not optimised for Africans, even though African populations have rich genetic diversity which can provide many insights into the mechanisms of disease through biomedical research. In addition, research about genetic effects on disease have generally been conducted from the perspective of looking at a single disease and doing the analysis on who has the disease or not without taking into consideration other health conditions that the participant might also be experiencing.   Recently, the H3Africa Bioinformatics Network (H3ABioNet) developed the H3Africa Illumina genotyping chip, a tool that is specifically optimised for measuring DNA variation in Africans, across the whole human genome. With the consent of research participants, health data from the PHDC can be combined with genetic data generated using the H3Africa genotyping chip, making it possible to research the relationship between DNA and different diseases in African individuals. In the first instance, this project aims to collect 700 DNA samples from consenting participants and link their DNA data to their health data from the PHDC.  In this first stage it will be possible to research the more common diseases - hypertension, diabetes and kidney disease; but as the number of research participants increases in the future it will also become possible to research the less common illnesses. Updated health information will be received from the PHDC twice a year, to document all health outcomes as they occur in participants going forward. An additional benefit to this research is that it will use a participant-based approach rather than a disease-based view, researching the whole health profile of the participant instead of only looking at whether they have a single disease or not.  By working in collaboration with the Department of Health, a system will be set up to return useful findings from the research so that they can be used to provide better tailored health care by the Department of Health for individuals as well as the whole population. The information will also help to inform health care in other African countries, and well as providing research insights that can help improve our understanding of disease processes across the world.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">OBJECTIVE 1,  to create a cohort of health-care seekers from Khayelitsha in the Western Cape, South Africa,  with linked routine clinical data and genotype data; and to establish a framework to grow the cohort indefinitely and update clinical data prospectively: The Provincial Health Data Centre (PHDC) is a Health Information Exchange that updates and collates daily individualised, routine health data for approximately 6.6 million clients accessing government care in the Western Cape. Informed consent will be sought from an initial 700 individuals attending clinics for chronic illness care to access their PHDC data, to link those data to a genomic profile, and to update clinical data biannually going forward. PHDC data include laboratory data, prescribed medications, facility visits, and data from disease-specific databases. Non-invasive buccal swabs will be used to collect samples for DNA preparation and genotyping on the H3Africa Illumina genotyping chip. This chip has been designed specifically by the H3Africa Bioinformatics Network (H3ABioNet.org) for the genotype analysis of samples from Africans, and using this genotyping chip will ensure the genomic data are informative and the data and findings are directly comparable with African genotype data generated across the Continent through the H3Africa Consortium (www.h3africa.org) and other studies, for future meta-analysis collaborations.   OBJECTIVE 2, to establish methodologies to create nested case-control studies to explore genetic contributions to the comorbidity profiles of participants. The PHDC uses routine clinical data to infer which health conditions healthcare clients have, providing a patient-centric, holistic view of each person&apos;s health. A sample of data from 250 753 healthcare clients in Khayelitsha indicates high levels of morbidities ascertained in this population group (clients with existing health conditions: 172 937 (69%); of these, more than 3 morbidities: 8%, 2 morbidities: 25%, 1 morbidity: 47%). For this seed-stage project, we will investigate genetic contributors to hypertension (prevalence in health care seekers = 18%), diabetes (7%) and chronic kidney disease (2%) on a background of infectious diseases HIV (prevalence=33%) and TB (ever had TB = 15%). We will enrich the initial sample set for conditions of interest by recruiting from specialist and disease-specific clinics. For this objective, we will explore multivariate statistical modelling approaches to use co-morbidity clinical data as a complex phenotype for genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Such models will: (1) assess complex genetic risk factors with multiple variants of lower penetrance; (2) use multivariate models rather than single-variant association studies, including comorbidities as independent variables; and (3) explore methodologies to transform longitudinal data into a phenotype for GWAS.   OBJECTIVE 3, to establish a data flow feedback loop so that actionable, verified genetic findings can be returned to the PHDC to be used for population-level and individualised client health care. Whilst currently only some DNA variants can be confidently linked to clinical outcomes, the growing body of research in Africa will provide increasing information about aetiological and pharmacogenetic variants that impact African populations. At the seed-stage for this project, the framework and data flow to return clinically relevant findings to the Department of Health will be established, using an example subset of already well-characterised aetiological and pharmacogenomic variants with the intention of developing more complete content at a later stage. Aggregated genome summary data (allele frequencies) at a population level will be returned, as evidence towards informing health policy and population-level decision-making; and individual findings will be returned to support clinical health care decisions for patients.</narrative>
