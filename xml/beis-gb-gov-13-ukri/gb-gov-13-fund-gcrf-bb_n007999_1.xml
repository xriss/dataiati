   <narrative xml:lang="EN">A new drug discovery pipeline for animal African trypanosomiasis</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">A disproportionate burden of the world&apos;s infectious diseases (both human and veterinary) fall upon the African continent.  Among the most devastating of the infectious agents of animals are the trypanosomes that cause Animal African Trypanosomosis (AAT). Transmitted primarily by tsetse and other biting flies, the disease is present in 40 African countries and affects nearly all domestic animals. The overall economic losses attributable to AAT are estimated at $4.75 billion per annum. These are losses borne principally by those who can least afford them: small-scale subsistence farmers and rural communities in AAT-affected areas of large parts of sub-Saharan Africa who rely on livestock for their livelihoods. Current AAT control tools rely extensively on trypanocidal drugs for the treatment of infected animals and for prophylaxis of infection. The drugs are widely available but were developed over 50 years ago and have significant limitations in terms of safety and increasingly lack efficacy against emergent drug-resistant trypanosomes.  Over ten million km2 of Africa are infested by tsetse flies and thus affected by AAT; this represents a substantial portion of Africa&apos;s fertile and watered land. Within this area, millions of small-scale livestock keepers rely on an estimated 55 million cattle and 70 million sheep and goats for their livelihoods and food security. These regions are under sustained and increasing pressure to produce more food for growing populations, increasing per capita consumption of meat and dairy products, climate change and desertification all combine to require increased agricultural output within the potentially productive areas of sub-Saharan Africa. Losses arising from AAT are both direct (e.g. estimated annual death of 3 million cattle) and indirect as a result of productivity losses (e.g. benefits of up to $7,000 per km2 from removing AAT). The net effect is a significant constraint on growth and development of the dairy and beef sectors, as well as sheep and goat rearing in the regions affected. Trypanocidal drugs are the mainstay in the control of AAT because of the absence of realistic prospects for vaccines. Vector control has had limited success and showed poor sustainability, the more so in areas where non-tsetse fly transmission is important (e.g. parts of Africa, but particularly in the Far East and South America too). The Global Alliance for Livestock Veterinary Medicine (GALVmed) was founded to help channel global efforts into amelioration of the burden placed upon the world&apos;s food security brought about by various infectious diseases. With substantial funding from the UK Department for International Development and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, GALVmed has become the primary agency involved in efforts to bring new drugs forward to treat AAT.  In this proposal, experts at the Universities of Glasgow and Strathclyde, and the Roslin Institute of the University of Edinburgh, are coming together to develop a new class of compounds that has been shown to have profound efficacy against the causative agents of AAT, both in vitro and in rodent models of the disease. Chemical structures of those compounds optimised for trypanocidal activity in cattle will be developed with the intention of taking them into clinical development. We will additionally develop new culture systems for the relevant parasite species - a crucial step for rapid and routine screening of  our candidate drugs but also large sets of unrelated  compounds (chemical libraries), with minimal need for tests in animals. We will also use state of the art biological and computational methods to learn about the internal functioning of the causative parasites, in order to understand how this new class of compound works. This part of the project will also provide key information to allow other classes of compounds to be brought forward, giving an important input to a long-term pipeline of new drugs to treat AAT.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In this project a consortium of academic research groups alongside the Global Alliance for Livestock Veterinary medicine (Galvmed) aim to fundamentally change  current paradigms for research and drug discovery for animal African trypanosomosis (AAT). There are several complementary objectives:   1. We propose to bring forward a lead candidate for future clinical development from a new series of trypanocidal minor groove binders (MGBs), optimised for activity against T. congolense and T. vivax, the primary causative agents of AAT.  2.  We will also learn about the mode of action of these compounds and assess the risk of resistance emerging to them and whether there is any risk of cross resistance to exisiting veterinary trypanocides, particularly of the diamidine class which also bind to the minor groove of DNA (but are otherwise structurally unrelated and unlikely to suffer cross resistance. Resistance to the diamidines usually involves alterations in cellular penetration due to transporter changes and uptake of the new MGBs is unlikely to involve the same processes).  3. We will use metabolomics technology to help rationally design new, improved medium for the systematic axenic cultivation of T. congolense lines that will provide a robust system to enable testing of other compounds as well as assessing drug sensitivity status of filed isolates.  4. We will generate comprehensive metabolic networks of T.congolense and T. vivax metabolism relative to T. brucei in order to assist in the deveoment of optimsed media and also to provide the cellular metabolic context in which to assist in drug target identification.  By the end of the project we intend to have new culture media suitable for routine drug screening against T. congolense, comprehensive metabolic maps of T. vivax and T. congolense to underpin creation of an ongoing pipeline of new chemical matter to treat these diseases.  Furthermore, we propose to have a lead compound from the MGB class ready to take to a clinical development programme with Galvmed.</narrative>
