   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The research aims to co-produce knowledge about the interrelationship between displacement and GBV and translate such knowledge between Bristol refugee communities and displaced communities in IKR for the purpose of contributing to the tackling of GBV.  As such, we will be addressing the following research objectives.   1. To find innovative, ethical, and safe ways to explore issues relating to GBV in the context of currently and previously displaced peoples. 2. To use research methodologies that bring to the fore the knowledges and expertise of displaced communities to co-produce knowledge that can engage different displaced communities in a dialogue about displacement, gender and violence. 3. To identify the ways in which experiential knowledge from previously displaced people can be translated to those currently displaced. 4. By engaging with groups of refugee women and men, to explore how gender, as an intersecting identity category (with race, religion, age, nationality and location), influences perceptions of GBV across the displacement journey. 5. Produce findings/knowledge that will contribute to the disruption of GBV pathways for displaced communities.   These objectives will be achieve through both the process, content, and outcomes of the project.      Objective 1 and to some extent Objective 2  will be achieved through the Development phase:  This will bring together the expertise from both the academic advisors and the Bristol refugee community group to explore different methods and research tools which might include engagement with artists who bring more innovative approaches to the collection of community narratives. This process will begin within the UK site and extend to the IKR site once a short-list of options has been identified.       Objectives 2 and 4 will be addressed during the knowledge co-production phase.  This phase focuses on using the methods identified in the development phase to engage in the co-production of new knowledge which addresses how people incorporate sometimes competing ideas about GBV in terms of their place on the displacement journey, and in relation to a wide range of intersecting factors (such as race, religion, nationality, location, sexuality, disability, age etc.).   The co-production of knowledge continues into the translation phase.   Objectives 3 and 5 will be addressed specifically within the knowledge translation and dissemination phase.  Communicating the &apos;findings&apos;, co-produced knowledges and potential artefacts, which emerge from the research is part of the process as opposed to a means to an end.  Co-produced events will take place in the UK and IKR, to share the knowledge from both fieldwork sites and to create additional space for dialogue and communication between displaced people from different points on the journey.  Of primary importance will be the translation of the project knowledges within IKR and those communities currently displaced.  Further dissemination will be encompassed within a legacy plan, embedded within the translation and co-production phases to ensure that future opportunities to build on this work are developed, supported, and taken forward.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This research will address the knowledge gap that exists regarding the ways in which displacement processes impact on perceptions and experiences of Gender Based Violence (GBV) and the potential for tackling such violence. Using collaborative techniques between academics and refugee community partners to co-produce research, the research will provide data about how displaced communities themselves experience and perceive GBV, and the potential collisions which exist between different gender norms, expectations and masculinities in this regard.The project seeks to improve the situation for displaced people within Iraqi Kurdistan Region (IKR) in particular, by sharing and translating co-produced knowledge and expertise regarding GBV of formally displaced people from within the Bristol refugee community with those currently displaced in IKR. While the focus will be largely on women (as the group mainly impacted by GBV), we will also engage with men in the refugee communities to explore their experiences and perceptions of GBV and mechanisms for disrupting pathways to perpetration.   This project brings together an inter-disciplinary team with academic and partner non-governmental organisations in the Bristol refugee community and colleagues in IKR at the Gender and Violence Studies Centre, University of Sulaimani. The approach adopted in this proposed research is that knowledge generation about gender-based violence, migration and conflict must arise from the experiences and knowledges of the these communities  and that the most appropriate methodologies involve processes of co-production that place equal value on academic and community knowledge and expertise.  The project will involve a number of overlapping phases.    The development phase will bring together the expertise from the research team, academic advisors and the Bristol refugee community groups to develop safe and ethical ways to engage in the co-productive creation of new knowledge which addresses how people incorporate sometimes competing ideas about gender and violence in terms of their place on the displacement journey, and in relation to a wide range of intersecting factors (such as race, gender, religion, nationality, location, sexuality, disability, age etc.). A major focus will be exploring different methods and research tools involving co-production which might be used. We will utilise the skills of the research team, including community facilitators, to explore using art, creative writing/poetry, music, photography, and more therapeutic techniques in order to explore participants&apos; narratives of GBV and displacement.  The development process will begin within the UK site and extend to the IKR site once a short-list of method options has been identified. We anticipate three development consultation meetings in each site, two with women and one with men. Applying lessons from the development phase, we will explore how the Bristol based knowledge production can be applied in the context of the IKR. Initial ideas and findings will be shared throughout the process between the two sites to ensure that translation between them becomes a practical reality. We anticipate at least eight meetings or workshops at each site, six with female participants and two with men. Communicating the &apos;findings&apos;, co-produced knowledges and potential artefacts which emerge from the research is part of the process as opposed to a means to an end. Of primary importance will be the use of the project knowledges within IKR and those communities currently displaced. Events will take place in IKR in particular, such as workshops with NGOs, to share the produced knowledge from both fieldwork sites and to create additional space for dialogue and communication between displaced people from different points on the journey. Two major co-produced events in Bristol and IKR, will provide showcases for the work to policy makers and practitioners.</narrative>
