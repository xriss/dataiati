   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Oil palm plantations have expanded rapidly over the last few decades and represent a significant threat to global biodiversity. This is largely because oil palm is a tropical crop and its increased production has often come at the expense of biodiverse tropical rainforest. However, oil palm is a extremely productive crop, producing a much higher volume of vegetable oil yield per hectare than other oil crops and contributing significantly to the economies of the countries that produce it. Maximising sustainable production is therefore a conservation as well as an economic priority, as increased production in existing agricultural areas may reduce expansion elsewhere and spare remaining forest habitats. A major concern within the oil palm sector is the effect of extreme weather events, such as current El Ni&#xF1;o event, on oil palm productivity. This is particularly marked in Southeast Asia, where the majority of palm oil is produced, and which suffers reduced rainfall during El Ni&#xF1;o years, reducing palm oil production. The role of biodiversity within oil palm ecosystems has received little research attention, although it is clear that some species that live within plantations may increase production, for example by contributing to important ecosystem processes, such as pollination, decomposition and control of pests. Although oil palm houses far fewer species than the tropical rainforest it replaces, it is still complex compared to most agricultural systems, with a diverse understory of herbaceous plants and numerous epiphytes growing on the oil palm trunks. It is also a very long-lived crop, with replanting taking place approximately every 25 years. There is, therefore, considerable scope for management practices to increase biodiversity levels within oil palm plantations, with potential benefits for important ecosystem processes and crop yield. Such an increase in biodiversity may have a particular benefit in El Ni&#xF1;o years, as this may make ecosystem processes more resistant to climatic variation and enable faster recovery following the drought. This project investigates the impact of the current El Ni&#xF1;o event on biodiversity, ecosystem processes and yield within oil palm plantations in Riau Province, Sumatra, Indonesia. We also experimentally investigate the potential role of different understory management and replanting strategies in reducing the severity of changes in biodiversity and ecosystem processes, and speeding recovery times following the El Ni&#xF1;o event. Findings from this work will be of direct relevance to both agricultural practitioners and to the conservation community and will lead to specific management recommendations for improving the sustainable production of this globally-important crop.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Our research project has nine major objectives:   1. To quantify the impact of the current El Ni&#xF1;o drought event in Southeast Asia on the agroecosystem of a globally-important tropical crop, oil palm (Elaeis guineensis), through empirical measurements on key taxa, key ecosystem processes and crop production and management.  2. To assess how management practices may mitigate potential impacts of the El Ni&#xF1;o drought on biodiversity: particularly ground-active insects; ants; Lepidopteran oil palm pests, and soil microbial and fungal communities.   3. To quantify the resistance and recovery of ecosystem processes, (soil feeding activity, leaf litter decomposition, soil chemical and physical properties, soil respiration, herbivory, predation) and ecosystem services (palm oil yield, soil health) associated with the El Ni&#xF1;o drought and possible mitigation of affects through management practices.  4. To gain a better understanding of the impact of the El Ni&#xF1;o drought event on plantation areas which have undergone replanting and to assess whether El Ni&#xF1;o events are likely to significantly reduce replanting success.  5. To apply the substantial baseline dataset on plantation biodiversity, ecosystem processes and ecosystem services, which has already been secured as part of the ongoing Biodiversity and Ecosystem Function in Tropical Agriculture (BEFTA) Project, to assess the influence of the current El Ni&#xF1;o event. 6. To produce datasets of El Ni&#xF1;o impacts on biodiversity, ecosystem functioning and ecosystem services that will be made available through national and international data centers, including NERC Environmental Data Centres, the University Museum of Zoology, Cambridge, the Indonesian Institute of Sciences (LIPI), and the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA). 7. To compare across experimental treatments to determine whether different management options can provide systems with high resistance and fast recovery following El Ni&#xF1;o and, therefore, whether these represent realistic options for enhancing the sustainability of palm oil production in the face of future environmental change. 8. To inform sustainability guidelines within the industry, such as the Round Table on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) Principles and Criteria and the Indonesian Sustainable Palm Oil (ISPO) Foundation guidelines. 9. To engage widely with stakeholders, by sharing our findings through conferences, peer-reviewed publications and outreach programmes.</narrative>
