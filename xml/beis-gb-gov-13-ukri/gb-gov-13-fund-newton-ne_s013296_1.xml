   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Peruvian Glacier Retreat and its Impact on Water Security (Peru GROWS)</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In the Andean region of Peru, runoff from glacierised basins provides an important and reliable water supply, and is an essential component of the local and regional water budget, as well as maintaining the integrity of mountain biomes. As such, Andean glaciers play a crucial role in sustaining mountain ecosystems and livelihoods - providing a water source for downstream rural populations, large cities and irrigated areas and hydropower generation. Significant shrinkage of these glaciers in recent decades in response to a changing climate is causing a reduction of this water supply, making glacier retreat a major concern for a large part of the population. A warmer climate is likely to result in more intense and/or longer-lasting floods and droughts, resulting in changes in the seasonality and volumes of water and further uncertainty in water availability.   The aim of Peru GROWS is to investigate the impacts of ongoing and projected climate change on glacier retreat and water resources in the Rio Santa catchment - the most glacierised catchment of Peru - and quantify adaptation strategies and alternative scenarios of water uses to enhance the resilience of Peruvian communities and ecosystems. To support this process, Peru GROWS will exploit the new knowledge produced to promote the reduction of multiple vulnerabilities related to the impacts of glacier retreat in the Rio Santa catchment on water for domestic use, hydropower, agricultural use and ecosystems, and enhance resilience by producing appropriate adaptation strategies to water scarcity and extreme events.   Our specific objectives are to:  1. Map the baseline socio-economic and water resources situations in the Rio Santa catchment and identify the dependence of ecosystems, agricultural production, food security, energy production and socio-ecological vulnerability on the hydrological regime.  2. Quantify how glacier volumes and glacier runoff in the catchment will change in the future and project the impacts on seasonal water availability through an improved understanding of processes that control glacier mass balance and meltwater fluxes in response to climate change and climate variability.  3. Model the associated impacts of the projected changes in the hydrological regime on ecosystems, agriculture, food security, energy production and socio-ecological vulnerability.   4. Work closely with stakeholders to devise robust adaptation and mitigation strategies on both local and regional scales in response to the changes in the hydrological regime that promote poverty reduction, equitable sharing of resources and economic growth.  By meeting these objectives, Peru GROWS will address three of the five challenges outlined in the funding call, specifically:  Challenge 1: Improved understanding of glacier processes that will control future glacier change and runoff in response to climate change and climate variability in Peru.  Challenge 2: Determine how future glacial retreat will impact on the role of tropical glacier runoff providing water resources to the region.  Challenge 3: How can water resources best be managed to address changing demands in response to spatio-temporal changes in water quantity and quality?</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Meltwater from glaciers in the Peruvian Andes provides an important and reliable water supply for local and downstream communities for domestic purposes, hydropower, subsistence and commercial agriculture, and industry; and to support rare, high-elevation wetlands and wider ecosystem functioning. However, this long-term, reliable water supply is threatened by increasing temperatures and changing precipitation patterns in the mountainous areas, resulting in shrinking of glaciers and changes in the amount and seasonality of meltwater runoff. A warming climate is also associated with an increasing frequency of extreme hydrological events, such as floods and droughts. Coupled with the stresses of Peru&apos;s rapid urbanisation and economic development, these changes are expected to lead to significant water scarcity, with the potential to inhibit economic growth and degrade vulnerable ecosystems (and the services they provide), which in turn will increase social vulnerability, adversely affect the equitable sharing of resources, increase social conflicts, and destabilise Peruvian societies (from local communities to the large coastal urban centres).  Peru GROWS aims to increase the resilience of Peruvian communities and ecosystems to hydrological changes arising from shrinking glaciers in the Andes. Working in the Rio Santa catchment - the most glacierised catchment of Peru - we will map the current socio-ecological system to identify where, and how, different communities and ecosystems are exposed to risks from water availability. We will then integrate field measurements and remote-sensing data into physically-based glacier and hydrological models, to simulate the past, present, and possible future changes (to the end of the twenty-first century) to the climate, the glaciers, and to river flows (including amounts, seasonality, and inter-annual variability).  In close partnership with local stakeholders, we will exploit this new knowledge to explore the direct and indirect impacts of projected change in glacier behaviour on different communities in the catchment, with a focus on food security, aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems, and energy production. We will provide information on the current state of the water balance and hotspots of potential water scarcity/trade-offs that can be easily understood by key stakeholders and will provide the basis for adaptation planning at local and regional level.   Key stakeholders and end-users have been closely involved in the design of Peru GROWS and will co-deliver the research. Two key NGOs, with a long history of work in this region (CARE and the Mountain Institute) as well as social scientists at the National Glacier and Mountainous Ecosystems Research Institute and the Pontifical Catholic University of Peru, will act as an interface with  the local stakeholders, especially vulnerable rural communities. Together, they will have a key role in co-designing appropriate adaptation strategies for water resources management and agriculture that will create lasting positive impact. With this, we lay a firm foundation from which multiple impacts can emerge during and after the project.</narrative>
