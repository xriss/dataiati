  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Transforming Education Systems for Sustainable Development (TES4SD) Network Plus will develop sustainable institutional capacity in India, South Africa, Rwanda and Somalia to produce high quality research that will assist key stakeholders in these countries and at a regional and global scale to better understand how education systems can be transformed to support sustainable development. Countries in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa are facing unprecedented challenges in relation to sustainable development including poverty and inequality and managing the risks posed by climate change. The sustainable development goals (SDGs) represent a holistic response to these challenges. Education has enormous potential to act as a driver for sustainable development and the education SDG is centrally implicated in the realisation of all of the other SDGs. At present, however, education systems in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) are some way off achieving the education SDG (goal 4). Our vision, consistent with global, regional and national agendas, is for systems of life-long learning that can provide learners with the skills, competencies, values and transformative agency required to meet the challenges of environmentally sustainable and socially just development. The &apos;wicked problem&apos; that education systems face in realising this vision is how to simultaneously address the current learning crisis in LMICs whilst transforming education systems to become drivers of SD. This challenge needs to be addressed simultaneously across all sectors of the education and training system and at the global, regional, national and local scales. Led by a world leading team containing relevant interdisciplinary and practical expertise, the TES4SD will assist in addressing this problem. Specifically, we will build sustainable research capacity in partner countries to undertake relevant research including early career researchers based in academic and non-academic organisations. The team will synthesise existing and emerging evidence on how schools can be transformed to address the learning crisis and to make them drivers of SD; how can technical and vocational education and training can be transformed to facilitate the development of green skills and to support youth agency in the transition to sustainable, healthy, lifestyles and in revitalising peaceful and democratic societies; and, how higher education institutions can be transformed to support processes of social learning within civil society and amongst policy-makers to address sustainability challenges in cities and rural communities. Questions at the system level include in what ways is Target 4.7 which relates to education for sustainable development understood and implemented and we will develop contextually relevant indicators to monitor progress towards SDG 4.7 at local, national and global levels. The TES4SD network plus will also commission new research based on knowledge co-production techniques to develop evidence and arguments urgently needed to transform education and training systems. Research questions will primarily focus on the sometimes-contradictory relationship between SDG4 and decent work and economic growth (SDG8); sustainable cities and communities (SDG11); responsible production and consumption (SDG12); and, climate action (SDG13). Strategies for developing impact will be embedded in TES4SD activities from inception including the active involvement of beneficiary groups including policy-makers, NGOs and CBOs in network plus research and capacity building activities; and, the strategic targeting of outputs including national and network wide synthesis reports, policy briefs, MOOCs, toolkits to support research capacity, teaching and learning materials for use in formal and informal settings. Dissemination of evidence to beneficiary groups will be facilitated by the creative use of social and other media and supported by a dedicated website.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The overall goal is to develop understanding of how education systems can act as drivers of sustainable development in India, Rwanda, Somalia and South Africa. We will realise this through the following objectives: Objective one: Developing a sustainable network of researchers based in universities, NGOs, government departments and community-based organisations with the capacity to undertake rigorous transdisciplinary, innovative, impactful research facilitated through the work of four national hubs in India, Rwanda, Somalia and South Africa. This responds to a need to develop Southern based research capacity in the area of education for sustainable development. Objective two: Synthesise and disseminate existing and emerging knowledge about the nature of SD and how it shapes the need for transformative education system change; This strategic objective will focus on developing genuinely and uniquely transdisciplinary understanding that can serve as an evidence base in its own right and that can inform the call for &apos;Plus&apos; funding as part of the network plus. Objective three: Co-produce the evidence and arguments urgently needed to transform education and training systems so that they become drivers of socially and environmentally just development. 50% of the overall funding for the network plus will be dedicated to &apos;plus&apos; funding of innovative projects based on principles of knowledge co-production.</narrative>
