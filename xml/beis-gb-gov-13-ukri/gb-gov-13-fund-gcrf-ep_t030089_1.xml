  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">OVERCOME consortium include world-leading organisations to develop state-of-the-art research plan that integrates digital innovations in natural hazard and risk predictions in order to develop intervention strategies for strengthening the resilience of vulnerable communities against climate hazards and health impacts. The partners from the UK, Ghana, Malawi, Mozambique, and Zimbabwe will contribute knowledge and skills in climate and  meteorology, hydrology and water resources, flood forecasting, droughts,  water quality, epidemiology and public health, smart technologies, data science, environmental science, Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH), risk communication, disaster management, social and policy sciences, and socio-economics. The collaboration will combine multidisciplinary knowledge to develop a novel holistic framework to forecast the impact of floods/droughts and associated disease outbreaks. OVERCOME also has strong support from global experts and local major stakeholders. The external partners will steer research direction throughout the project, contribute their complementary knowledge, and engage the team with additional partners through their strong international networking. OVERCOME will organise a kick-off meeting in one African partner&apos;s country to (1) brief our research ideas to the key stakeholders in African countries; (2) allow for all parties involved to learn from each other the capacity that each institution can contribute to the OVERCOME consortium; (3) understand the expectations that the stakeholders have on the project; (4) identify the knowledge gaps in research and the extra expertise required within the consortium. Following the kick-off meeting, the lead partners in Ghana, Malawi, Mozambique and Zimbabwe will further reach out to additional partners in their countries to complement the skills within the consortium.  Networking and Capacity Building Workshops (NCBWs) will be organised to incorporate local stakeholders for co-designing research methodology and outcomes to ensure that the project outputs will be adopted by stakeholders for real-world practices to deliver long-term impact to communities. Local Stakeholder Engagement Workshops  will be held for local stakeholders to review and feedback on the final second stage proposal. The participants will evaluate the objectives and planned tasks from WGs for shaping research topics to benefit most stakeholders and vulnerable communities. The engagement can also examine and guarantee the feasibility of proposed solutions. We will also synergise with other consortia, projects, and professional groups to further strengthen the consortium, enhance the research vision, collect data for the full research, and widen the impact from the project.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">OVERCOME will build a transnational consortium with multidisciplinary expertise that is ready to advance the research for creating innovative technological methodologies and applications to identify and recommend the best strategies for natural hazard risk management. OVERCOME will engage stakeholders from academic, industry, governments, NGOs and local communities to co-shape the research questions and targeted outcomes for the follow-up research in order to deliver final products that can be adopted by these stakeholders. This will strengthen the capacity in vulnerable communities for minimising the negative impact of natural hazards and associated waterborne disease,which will fulfil Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We will form four working groups (WGs), each with a specialised subteam, to address specific  challenges in flood, drought, and related disease risk management. Each WG will be co-led by a UK and an African partner, supported by other consortium members and external partners to scope the research aims and design methodologies. The main goals of the WGs are: WG 1 Natural hazard analysis Facilitate dialogue among cross-sectoral experts to identify research gaps in cholera epidemic, weather and climatic hazards to propose a hybrid modelling approach for enhancing the understanding of flooding and drought mechanisms in partner countries, and building the capacity of local stakeholders to analyse and reduce relevant risks (SDGs 9 and 13). WG2 Risk assessment Engage with local communities, government departments and experts to identify potential problems and prioritise solutions related to damage and epidemics in the community suffering from natural hazards. The collaboration will gather evidence related to critical mechanisms for disasters and disease spreading, and evaluate the effectiveness of humanitarian response options for co-developing research plans for smart communities (SDGs 11 and 17). WG3 Interventions Collaborate with local authorities and communities to: (i) identify potential intervention options for developing long-term adaptation and short-term crisis management strategies including technological equipment and novel modelling techniques for monitoring and predicting natural hazards to issue on-time early warning in short/long-term, (ii) analyse potential solutions for various natural hazards, and (iii) prioritise options to enhance resilience-based performance of the community e.g. WASH provision, flood protection infrastructure (nature-based solutions and/or ecosystem services as well as physical measures), preparedness for droughts, health care facilities and socio-economic systems for risk management co-benefits (SDGs 3, 6, 8 and 9). WG4 Holistic framework  Integrate the state-of-the-art methodologies identified in WGs 1-3 to establish transformative approaches in order to advance scientific research in natural disaster risk reduction (DRR) in African countries. This will ultimately lead to the co-creation of an intelligent decision support system at stage two (full proposal) that provides a digital platform for technological developments for both short-term emergency prediction and management of hazards in urban/rural communities and mitigation/adaptation recommendations, and long-term policy making and strategic planning (SDGs 9 and 15).</narrative>
