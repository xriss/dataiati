   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Bangladesh is a low-income country with an estimated 40% of the population living in extreme poverty. Against this background of poverty, Bangladesh is internationally recognised for achieving &apos;good health at low cost&apos; through community-based interventions to improve the health of the most disadvantaged. However, antibiotic resistant bacteria are known to be present in drinking water, wastewater and in patient samples, and the availability of over-the-counter, inexpensive antibiotics means that there is a high risk of a rapid and uncontrolled spread of antibiotic resistance throughout the population. Studies in Bangladesh suggest that 63% of prescriptions for antibiotics are from practitioners with no qualifications, and antibiotics are prescribed in nearly half (44%) of all consultations in primary health care. Tackling antibiotic resistance is essential for the long term economic development and welfare of the country. In order to slow the spread of antibiotic resistance, there are complexities around balancing the need for access to health for the disadvantaged, at the same time as introducing greater regulation around the prescribing and ready availability of antibiotics. Research is required to better understand the needs of households and individuals for antibiotic treatment for their family and livestock, as well as understanding the prescribing behaviours of qualified and unqualified practitioners.  We will study the pathways of antibiotic use 1) from the perspective of lay people who buy or consume antibiotics either for themselves, family members or for livestock and 2) from the perspective of the healthcare practitioners, including qualified and unqualified providers (market sellers, unqualified drug shop owners and untrained &apos;doctors&apos;). Through in-depth interviews in urban and rural Bangladesh, we will gain a better understanding of behaviours around antibiotic prescribing and consumption as well as establishing whether there is an awareness of antibiotic resistance among healthcare practitioners, or their patients and clients. By interviewing practitioners across the whole range of formal and informal outlets we will assess the potential for practitioners to change prescribing practices or act as agents of change. The third aim of the study is to work with government and non-government agencies to inform the development of interventions to reduce antibiotic use. We will use the formative research from interviews to work with a professional communication team to develop culturally appropriate messages and materials for awareness-raising and communication campaigns on antibiotic resistance. These materials will be pre-tested with lay people, healthcare providers and drug shop owners to establish the acceptability of messages, who should be targeted, and what potential there is for the users and stakeholders in antimicrobial resistance to develop national awareness-raising or behaviour change interventions. The benefits of this research are to shed light on the behaviours around antibiotic treatment seeking behaviour and prescribing, the relationships between lay people and their local healthcare practitioner, motivations for seeking or selling antibiotics for people and animals; who and what the antibiotic treatment is sought for; what happens to antibiotics after prescription or purchase, and on the perceived effects of antibiotics on the resolution of symptoms. The findings will provide formative data on which to identify pathways for behaviour change. Our international partner, the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research Bangladesh (ICDDR, B), is internationally recognised for the development and delivery of low-cost, scalable solutions to major health problems. Capacity-building in Bangladesh and establishing a leading centre for research on antimicrobial resistance are integral parts of this pump-priming initiative.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="Overall aim: We will conduct an integrated study that considers the behaviours of lay people surrounding antibiotic use for themselves, their family members and their livestock; the behaviours and priorities of formal and informal practitioners across the range of providers; and the extent of knowledge around antibiotic resistance in lay people and healthcare providers. The findings will be used to inform government policy makers and identify pathways for behaviour change among providers of antibiotics and the community.  The detailed study objectives are: 1. To understand the pathways of antibiotic use within households from the onset of illness to the purchase and consumption of antibiotics.  2. To examine the role of qualified and unqualified private practitioners (drug shops, street vendors, &apos;quack&apos; doctors and village markets) and government health services in antibiotic prescribing and their understanding of antibiotic resistance in humans and animals. 3. To inform government policy, and identify pathways to behaviour change among healthcare practitioners, livestock and poultry owners, people/patients and users of antibiotics. The first objective will be achieved through in-depth qualitative interviews with household members who have decision-making responsibilities around health seeking behaviour and treatment in rural and urban areas (n=48 interviews). Follow-up interviews will be conducted in households where there is an illness to understand the decisions and outcomes of a particular illness episode (n=12 interviews). The second objective will be achieved through in-depth interviews with qualified and unqualified healthcare practitioners in urban and rural areas. The selection of formal and informal antibiotic providers will mirror the types and locations of antibiotic suppliers that are used by the households interviewed in Objective 1. The second objective will provide insights into the customs and practices around prescribing, the demands from clients and medical representatives and maintaining a livelihood, as well as knowledge of appropriate prescribing practices and antibiotic resistance (n=44 interviews). In addition we will conduct focus groups with lay people in the community and carry out participant observations on client-provider interactions to triangulate findings from a range of sources.  The third study objective will be achieved through interviews with key informants from local and national government, regulating authorities and non-government organisations involved in the development of national regulation and antibiotic policies. The formative data from interviews with household members, practitioners and key informants will be used to inform potential interventions to reduce the use of antibiotics. During the study we will work with a professional communications team to develop and pre-test communication images and messages around appropriate prescribing and antibiotic resistance for the public, practitioners and for antibiotic sellers.  This pre-testing and development work will form the basis for subsequent funding applications for feasibility and pilot work."></capital-spend>
