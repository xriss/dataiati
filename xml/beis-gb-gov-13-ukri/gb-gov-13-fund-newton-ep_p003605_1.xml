   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Energy is a key driver of economic and sustainable social welfare. It is an essential prerequisite for modern industry and commerce. The need to decarbonise the energy supply is generally accepted and solar photovoltaics (PV) will play a large role in this in both the UK and India. The two countries have seen very rapid installation since both countries introduced their respective market stimulation programmes in 2010, cumulative installations have risen to 5GW (India) and 8.5 GW (UK) by December 2015. This has had a very significant impact on the power system and may endanger quality of supply or grid reliability. JUICE will focus on tools to understand and quantify the associated issues, find the most economical way to ameliorate or control the issues generated.   PV can often be located near to load centres but its temporal alignment with conventional demand profiles is far from perfect. Electricity at the wrong time or in the wrong place has very little value and there are already numerous examples of PV (and other sources) having to be curtailed when local demand or capability to transport it are insufficient. As the penetration of installed PV increases, so too does the need for its effective integration into power systems at all levels and including both national and localised networks. Energy storage and demand-side response will play a big role in this as well as managing grid capacity. JUICE would be investigating the amount of generation of PV, the stress this is putting on the network, the cost and benefits of mitigation technology options (storage and demand shift). The inclusion of storage and PV places relatively large power electronic converters into the system, which may also allow further services to stabilise the network to be viable technically as well as economically. It is key to address these challenges across the different research communities, as changes in one technology may change the boundary conditions for others and e.g. economics may change drastically. JUICE will, as an example, look at the viability of storage technologies in dependence of quantity of installed PV, local demand and transfer capacity.  JUICE will bring together internationally leading experts in PV technology, applied PV systems, power electronics, electricity networks, energy storage and demand-side response; and through their combined efforts, will develop integrated solutions to ensure that the value of PV generation is optimised in both India and the UK. The techniques and solutions developed will also be readily transferable to many other countries that face similar challenges and contribute to increase economic and environmental welfare in developing and developed countries. The breadth of experience and skills brought by the collective UK and India teams is appropriate to the scale of the problem and will encourage development of novel concepts and solutions to these global challenges.   In the UK, the team has been drawn from the national flagship SuperGen projects: SuperSolar, HubNet and SuperStore, which specialise in PV, networks and energy storage respectively. In India, world-leading universities and researchers will be led by IIT-KGP and IIT-B. JUICE will focus on a value optimisation for the end user, i.e. meeting demand at the lowest economic and environmental cost. Specific topics to be addressed include: PV yield optimisation and localisation, transmission and distribution network stability and utilisation, microgrids, the control and lifetime of storage and its role alongside demand response.  The overarching integrative management of the centre will ensure that the specific technical developments undertaken by the partners are coordinated and effective in contributing to the overall aims of providing improved energy services, lowering environmental impacts and minimising costs.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The overarching aim is to solve the integration of intermittent renewable energy with energy storage for grid and isolated communities in India and UK with a view to grid integration. This is fully aligned with the objectives of EPSRC, DST and the development goals of the Newton-Bhabha Fund.  In order to achieve this, JUICE will mobilise significant resources (26 institutions, in excess of 100 investigators) to connect the research verticals of Power Networks, Solar and Storage, which are driven in the UK by the three SuperGen consortia: HubNet, SuperSolar and SuperStore. This will be achieved by a vertical research programme focussing on clean energy provision, clean energy utilisation and economic value. JUICE will have a close relation with two Indian centres (IUCERCE and UKICERI) to deliver research to enhance the standard of living in both countries by improving the quality of power available, or make power available, to the populations in both countries. JUICE, in conjunction with IUCERCE and UKICERI, will deliver the tools required for a step change in the power system management in the presence of intermittent energy sources.  The objectives of JUICE are defined in the call as:   1. Support the development of demonstrators on renewable energy (solar) and storage and eventual grid connectivity for a current grid isolated community (25 to 50 kW mini-grid system) and scalability challenges. JUICE will supply tools for forecasting, control and optimisation of the entire system as well as characterisation methods for key components. Demonstrators themselves are developed by our Indian partner centres.  2. Identify and address the challenges of integration of large amounts of intermittent renewable generation on the Indian and UK grid (up to GW level). JUICE will provide key tools to understand and mitigate the problems associated with the GW scale integration as well as microgrid scale integration. JUICE will actively engage with counterparts in the Indian centres to maximise synergies to mutually enhance the research programmes.   3. Coordination and further development of the existing RCUK-India portfolio of research and innovation on solar, grids and networks and energy storage. JUICE will input through its management board and high level strategic advisory board. This will link industry involved in commercialisation of clean energy technologies in both countries to the funding bodies.   4. Build and sustain a community of researchers, innovators and end users related to clean energy and especially other sources of clean energy. JUICE will mobilises a significant number of key academics in the field and will manage a fund to engage with further groups. There is a strong effort on community building in the centre.  5. Training and capacity building. JUICE has an associated PhD cohort of 19 PhDs which will research collaboratively aligned projects. There is a focus on building networks for PhDs and early stage researchers. Secondments to industry in both countries for all levels of research experience as well as an intercontinental staff exchange programme.  Additional to the call objectives, JUICE will focus on international integration. Collaborations with our Indian partners are planned in detail at present. Each RA has a travel budget that will allow a stay at a partner institution over the lifetime of the project. The institutions will accept incoming RAs without charging a bench fee. The work programme is highly complementary between JUICE and the two Indian centres, ensuring excellent collaboration potential and joint publications which are already in development.</narrative>
