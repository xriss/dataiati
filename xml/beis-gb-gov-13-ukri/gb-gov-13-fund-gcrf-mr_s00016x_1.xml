   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Background  Snakebite is a neglected tropical disease that kills ~100,000 people each, year and causes long-term morbidity in 3-5 times that number. Venom variation between snake species severely undermines the efficacy of existing snakebite therapies, known as antivenoms. These intravenously delivered treatments work poorly against bites caused by snake species that were not used to make the antivenom. Therefore many different antivenoms have to be manufactured for each region of the world. In addition, existing antivenoms have (i) poor specificity, (ii) poor safety and (iii) high treatment costs. There is therefore an urgent and compelling need to dramatically improve therapy for the rural impoverished people of the tropics suffering the greatest burden of snakebite.  Rationale  The most common lethal snakebite pathology is haemotoxicity, which can present clinically as haemorrhage, coagulopathy and/or hypotension, and is primarily caused by three enzymatic venom toxin families. In this project, we seek to develop a new type of therapy for treating haemotoxicity, consisting of repurposed enzyme inhibitors (small molecules). Our preliminary data shows that various enzyme inhibitors are capable of neutralising the enzymatic activity of haemotoxic venom protein families irrespective of the snake species involved, and at lower therapeutic doses than antivenom. We have also demonstrated that inhibitory molecules are capable of preventing snake venom induced lethality in vivo in pre-clinical animal studies. We therefore anticipate that a rationally selected mixture of different enzyme inhibitors will result in a low-dose therapy that (i) neutralises venom lethality irrespective of the snake species, and thus will exert worldwide efficacy, (ii) exhibits a significantly improved safety profile, and (iii) is substantially more affordable than antivenom.  Approach  We will use a variety of enzyme inhibitors previously approved for human use and test their in vitro and in vivo neutralising capability against ten medically-important, haemotoxic, snake venoms. 1. First, we will use a variety of enzymatic in vitro assays to characterise the haemorrhagic, coagulopathic and hypotensive action of each venom. Subsequently, we will repeat these assays with each venom mixed with individual enzyme inhibitors to identify those inhibitors that confer venom neutralisation. 2. Our preliminary data suggests that combinations of different inhibitors will be required for &apos;generic&apos; (i.e. across lots of different snake species) neutralisation of venom lethality in vivo, due to the complexity of toxic venom components, and that combinations of enzyme inhibitors can reduce the therapeutic dose required for neutralisation. Consequently, we will repeat our in vitro assays using rational combinations of the different inhibitors identified (those that exhibited neutralising capabilities in 1) at different dose combinations. 3. Lastly, we will demonstrate the superior efficacy of the two inhibitor combinations exhibiting the highest neutralising capability in vitro, in in vivo neutralisation of venom lethality studies. We will use murine pre-clinical efficacy studies (survival and survival times) and subsequent biomarker analyses (e.g. markers of haemorrhage, coagulopathy, hypotension) to determine whether the enzyme inhibitor mixtures exhibit superior venom neutralisation than existing commercial antivenoms.  Implications  We anticipate that our optimal enzyme inhibitory mixture will exert superior venom neutralisation characteristics (lower therapeutic doses, generic cross-species neutralisation) than existing &quot;gold-standard&quot; antivenoms. Consequently, this project has the potential to revolutionise snakebite therapy via the generation of a pre-clinically validated &quot;generic&quot;, affordable, treatment for the millions of impoverished snakebite victims who suffer from venom-induced haemotoxicity each year.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="Our overarching objective is to address the therapeutic neglect of the world&apos;s snakebite (1.8 million envenomings, ~100,000 deaths/year) by developing a new type of therapy effective against all haemotoxic snake venoms. Current antivenoms are weakly effective because animals are immunised with venoms from multiple snake species, and each venom consists of multiple proteins of varying amounts, toxicity and immunogenicity. This undirected immunisation means that the proportion of total IgG targeting the venom of any one snake is small, and consequently many vials of antivenom are needed to achieve clinical cure. This significantly increases antivenom-induced adverse effects and frequently makes treatment unaffordable to the impoverished communities at greatest risk. Furthermore, these therapies are typically only effective against those snake species whose venom was used in the immunisation process. Consequently, there is a strong rationale to improve the paraspecific efficacy, specificity, safety and affordability of treatment for the world&apos;s snakebite victims.  Here we seek to address this issue by repurposing existing, clinically-safe, enzyme inhibitors (small molecules) to neutralise the enzymatic activity of snake venoms that cause the most frequent, medically-important, pathology observed following envenoming - haemotoxicity. The generic inhibitory properties of enzyme inhibitors mean that this treatment will greatly expand the snake-species efficacy of treatment (i.e. generically inhibit all haemotoxic venoms) without compromising dose-effectiveness. Our proof of concept data supports this premise, by demonstrating that enzyme inhibitors can neutralise venom haemotoxicity in vitro and in vivo, and that combinations of inhibitors neutralise the toxicity of highly distinct snake species and at lower doses than existing antivenoms. Consequently, we anticipate that the new therapy devised from this project will be eminently translatable into a more efficacious, affordable and safer snakebite treatment than those that exist today.  The priority objectives are:  1. To characterise the in vitro efficacy of each inhibitory molecule against snake venoms: Using a variety of in vitro biochemical enzyme/functional assays, we will characterise the activity of ten medically-important, geographically-distinct, haemotoxic snake venoms. We will use both crude and fractionated venom in these established assays, before quantifying venom neutralisation by a panel of enzyme inhibitors. These studies will be undertaken in comparison with existing commercial antivenoms.  2. To determine the optimal inhibitor mixtures and their dose combination: Because of venom complexity/variation, we will require a mixture of distinct enzyme inhibitors to effect cure in a &apos;generic&apos; manner. Therefore we will rationally (based on Objective 1 results) select combinations of effective inhibitory molecules and re-screen these mixtures against each venom using the same in vitro bioassays. This approach will be used to identify the two most optimal neutralising mixtures and their most appropriate dose ratio (eg, 1:1:1), based on (i) their venom-neutralising capabilities and (ii) the extent of paraspecific neutralisation that they confer.  3. To demonstrate that inhibitory mixtures confer superior efficacy and cross-specific neutralisation than antivenom in preclinical venom neutralisation studies: We will use in vivo &apos;neutralisation of venom lethality&apos; studies to characterise the efficacy of the inhibitory mixtures against each medically-important venom. These gold-standard preclinical efficacy assays will be undertaken in comparison with existing antivenoms to determine whether our enzyme inhibitor therapies exert superior dose efficacy and cross-snake species efficacy (i.e. paraspecificity) than existing treatments. We will also use biomarker analyses and preclinical imaging approaches to assess the neutralisation of specific venom-induced pathologies"></capital-spend>
