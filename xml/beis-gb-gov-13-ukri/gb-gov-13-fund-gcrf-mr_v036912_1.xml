   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This proposal is focused on indigenous peoples&apos; response to the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil, a country which now has the second highest number of infected people in the world (2,962,442 cases by 7th August). Indigenous peoples are taking responsibility to contain the spread of the new virus among their communities into their own hands. Using anthropological knowledge and methodology, we will identify indigenous responses and help to mobilise strategies to mitigate risk. We will work closely with the special agency for indigenous health (SESAI), and we aim to cooperate with global and public health agencies and policies, as well to engage decision makers to shape better responses to face this outbreak. Three programme themes will frame the research and actions: 1. Health, Care and Death; 2. Mobility and Circulation; and 3. Gender. A digital platform &apos;Amerindian Response COVID-19 - Anthropology Platform&apos; will also be developed and used as a tool to publish brief reports in real time, using different media, including podcasts and video diaries, in addition to academic papers. Monthly reports will be addressed to SESAI and eight case studies will be conducted across Brazil&apos;s regions. The project will have an important impact to mitigate the severe impact of this pandemic on indigenous people. It will also provide vital lessons to increase resilience for the future for Brazil, for all nations with large indigenous communities and for other nations where community-based responses may be a key to help prevent transmission and loss of life.</narrative>
