   <narrative xml:lang="EN">[Philippines] Catchment susceptibility to hydrometeorological events: sediment flux and geomorphic change as drivers of flood risk in the Philippines</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">River morphology results from sediment transport and sedimentation, which are both a consequence of water flow. Episodic variation in natural (e.g. typhoons, earthquakes, volcanoes) and anthropogenic (e.g. gravel mining, river bank protection) sediment supply drives changes in riverbed levels and sedimentology. These changes determine channel capacity and flow routing, and thus associated flood risk to people and property. The same factors determine variations in lateral bank erosion rates; elevated rates result in the loss of developed floodplain and the failure of critical infrastructure such as road bridges. Despite the significance of variation in riverbed levels and channel position for flood risk, geomorphological processes are commonly overlooked in flood risk mapping. In the Philippines, rivers are particularly dynamic; risks arising from sedimentation and erosion need to be assessed and incorporated into flood risk management to mitigate the impact of flooding on welfare and the economy.  This project aims to: (i) develop a national-scale catchment characteristics database, and associated river geometry relations, to assess the susceptibility of different catchments to morphological change impacts on flood hazard; and (ii) assess flood hazards arising from morphological change associated with variations in sediment supply and the influence of lateral constraints on channel morphological adjustment. To achieve the first aim we will use national scale topographic models and repeat satellite imagery to assess fluvial and landscape characteristics to identify indicators of enhanced channel mobility and sediment transport, with outputs available from a river centreline Geographic Information System with data points every 1 km along the Philippines river network. This national scale dataset will be used by project partners to assess and plan infrastructure developments. To achieve the second aim we will generate repeat, high-resolution Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) of the Pinacanauan de Ilagan River and the Bacarra Rivers, from airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) and bathymetric surveys. We will difference these DEMs to map patterns of erosion and deposition during a wet season, and calculate a sediment budget for each river. The DEMs and sediment budget will then be used to parameterise and assess hydro- and morpho-dynamic models that will be used to investigate changes in flood risk due to morphological change. This framework will be used, by project partners, to guide river and flood management in the Pinacanauan de Ilagan and the Bacarra catchments. The framework will also be transferable to other rivers in the Philippines, and farther afield in SE Asia and beyond. This proposal forges a partnership between the University of the Philippines (UP) Diliman, the University of Glasgow, four Filipino project partners, and project partner Prof Brierley (University of Auckland). Specifically, the Philippine project partners are: the Mines and Geosciences Bureau; the Department of Public Works and Highways; and two Local Government Units in the study catchments, namely City of Ilagan and Municipality of Vintar. The project brings together UP Diliman&apos;s expertise in geomatics with the University of Glasgow&apos;s expertise in fluvial geomorphology and numerical modelling, to undertake research that will shed light on the morphodynamics of tropical rivers and produce tools that will be used for sustainable fluvial flood management in the Philippines.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project has the following aims: (Aim 1) To develop a national-scale catchment characteristics database, and associated at-a-station and at-many stations hydraulic geometry relations, to assess the susceptibility of different catchments to morphological change impacts on flood hazard; and (Aim 2) To assess flood hazards arising from morphological change associated with variations in sediment transport and the influence of lateral constraints on channel morphological adjustment. Specific objectives are, at a national scale, to: (Objective 1) Derive a national scale database of catchment characteristics to assess catchment scale susceptibility to geomorphological change; and (Objective 2) Empirically derive at-many-stations hydraulic geometry equations to inform river management, and derive at-a-station and downstream hydraulic geometry data to empirically calibrate regime theory predictions of channel morphology; and for two case study river systems, each at the river segment (10^1 to 10^2 km) scale, to: (Objective 3) Employ a combined airborne LiDAR and bathymetric mapping survey methodology to derive high-resolution topographic models before and after the 2020 flood season; (Objective 4) Quantify sediment transport rates by applying a reach segmented morphological approach; (Objective 5) Assess the sensitivity of flood hazard to observed morphological change using DEMs from two surveys; and (Objective 6) Develop two-dimensional morphodynamic models to investigate the effects of different flood and sediment supply scenarios, and river management options on sediment transport, morphological change and flood hazard. The case study river systems are the Bacarra River, and the Pinacanauan de Ilagan River and two of its tributaries the Abuan River and the Bintacan River. These rivers, on the island of Luzon, exemplify the flood risk management challenges in the Philippines that are associated with morphological change, and natural and anthropogenic variations in sediment supply.</narrative>
