  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">1) To increase the energy yield of offshore wind farms through very large scale simulation and optimization tailored to specific site conditions and weather, and to demonstrate this on existing and prospective sites in the East China Sea.  2) To reduce system integrity risks on offshore wind turbines under extreme events through the combined simulation of atmospheric dynamics, their action on the farm and the response of the blades, and to demonstrate it in the simulation of a typhoon event.  3) To enable the quantitative prediction of the long-term interactions between offshore wind farms and the local (atmospheric and marine) environment through highly-resolved simulations across all relevant scales, and to use it investigate the potential effects of farms in Chinese coastal areas.  4) To support the sustainable development of offshore wind in the Jiangsu province of China through application of state-of-the-art physics-based simulations and big-data analytic tools to the design of a new generation of offshore wind farms.  5) To build confidence, through the careful analysis of numerical results against data from operational wind farms, in the predictive capability of massive-scale simulation across scales.  6) To investigate new physics-driven strategies for wind farm optimization for energy production or system resilience, and data-driven strategies for operation and control, and to demonstrate their viability in a realistic context.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed project will develop an integrated computational simulation approach capable of handling the complex interactions between the local atmosphere, the coastal ocean and sedimentary environment, farm aerodynamics, turbine response and grid integration in offshore wind farms. This will target a substantial reduction in the cost of energy in offshore wind by exploiting: high-fidelity optimization of array design and operation, tailored to a specific site and able to deal with realistic marine atmospheric boundary layer conditions, in particular the very slow dissipation of rotor wakes; combined with big-data analysis of very-large-scale simulations of the whole system under extreme conditions, to minimize integrity risks without overly conservative safety factors. Both situations will be investigated within the context of the development of offshore farms off the Chinese coast, which brings particular challenges regarding coastal characteristics (e.g. high sediment concentrations) and extreme events (in particular typhoons).   To achieve this we propose a multiscale approach to wind farm design and network integration that considers, first, a more accurate characterisation of extreme events (and active mitigation strategies) in the analysis through highly-resolved computer simulation; second, new optimization techniques for the design and operation of wind farms that allow for sustained power extraction using relevant knowledge of both the marine atmosphere and individual turbine (aeroservoelastic) dynamics; and third, robust grid design and operation strategies that accommodate wind resource variability and maximise the sustainability of energy generation. FENGBO-WIND will carry out the most ambitious computer simulations to date on farm dynamics and farm/environment interaction, to build physics-based predictive capabilities on farm output and investigate long-term interactions between farms and their local environment.  An interdisciplinary consortium of experts, including Earth/environmental scientists, civil and electrical engineers, and fluid dynamicists, have been assembled to tackle this challenging computational problem. The team will have access to (1) the world&apos;s largest supercomputer (Sunway TaihuLight) to carry out full system simulations of energy output and farm state for specific environmental scenarios, (2) operational data from existing wind farms off the Chinese coast as well as conditions at a target site through a partnership with a local grid company, and (3) performance data for a state-of-the-art wind turbine design from the leading Chinese manufacturer. The results will be benchmarked against state-of-the-art industrial design tools and protocols for grid integration for offshore wind farms.</narrative>
