   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The world&apos;s 33 largest deltas are being drowned by relative sea level rise and are, as a result, rapidly losing land. This process is also driving an exacerbation of flood risk in these environments, which is placing many large cities, key infrastructure and over 0.5 billion people at risk globally. These issues are most acute for deltas across Southern and Southeast Asia, where an estimated 20% of land will be lost by 2100. These risks are significant. For example, floods during the 2011 Asian monsoon killed an estimated 2000 people and caused ~US$45 billion in economic damage across SE Asia. Moreover, these deltas, and their ecosystem services, underpin regional food security for rapidly growing populations. There is therefore an urgent need to evolve an improved generic understanding of the processes behind the relative sea level rise and flood risk dynamics in these deltaic environments into the future.   Significant recent advances have been made in our understanding of many aspects of delta morphodynamics and evolution. This has included work on distributary channel flow processes, bifurcation stability and bar dynamics, and the profound influence of tidal backwater effects on longer-term channel hydro- and sediment dynamics. However, despite this progress there are significant uncertainties around the influence of: i) upstream migrating backwater effects, forced by sea-level rise, on delta bifurcation stability; ii) declining sediment delivery and increased hydrological variability on distributary channel stability; iii) connectivity between the channels and the delta surface on the routing, dispersal and trapping of sediment. Each of these uncertainties are key knowledge gaps that must be addressed for effective delta management, flood risk mitigation and maintenance of ecosystem services.    Our project will investigate flow and sediment routing through the Mekong delta across the annual monsoon flood and develop a new generic understanding of the impact of relative sea-level rise and sediment routing processes through distributary channels and key bifurcation sites on the delta. This will be achieved through collection of new state-of-the-art field datasets, development and application of morphodynamic numerical modelling and utilization of system dynamics modelling to guide aquaculture and agriculture adaptations to changes.    We will leverage a range of existing links we have to engage with, and communicate the outcomes of the work, to agencies and policy makers in the region and inform water resource planning and mitigation/adaptation strategies in the context of climate change.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="We will investigate flow and sediment routing through the Mekong delta across the monsoon and develop a new generic understanding of the impact of relative sea-level rise and sediment dispersal processes on the evolution of flood risk and the overall resilience and sustainability of deltaic ecosystem services over the longer-term (to &gt;2100). This will be achieved using new field datasets, development and application of morphodynamic numerical modelling and application of system dynamics modelling to guide aquaculture and agriculture adaptations to changes. The specific objectives are to:   O1. Collect targeted field data comprising: (i) channel bathymetric and floodplain topographic data; (ii) water level, quality and sediment concentration data across a network of deltaic floodplain channels and flood basins, and; (iii) high-resolution bed and bank erosion and flow velocity data at critical bifurcation nodes across the delta.   O2. Develop robust models within DELFT3D FM that are capable of simulating regional scale flood and morphodynamics dynamics accounting for channel migration and distributary channel dynamics.   O3. Use the models from O1 with the field data sets from O2 to evaluate model predictions and to thus develop quantitative relationships for predicting flow and sediment routing across the delta across a range of boundary condition rate changes.    O4. Implement the validated DELFT3D FM models to quantify the impact of sea-level rise, sediment supply reductions and flow variability, on (i) the timing, magnitude and duration of delta plain inundation; (ii) flow discharge at key sites that control distributary channel-floodplain connectivity and water fluxes; and (iii) rates of bank erosion and the potential for associated levee destruction to affect flood response.   O5. Use the predictions from O4 to set parameters within system dynamics models that will investigate impacts on flood risk, ecosystem services, and agricultural production under a range of scenarios. This will also underpin the execution our Pathways to Impact that will enable end-users to build resilient adaptations to the adverse impacts these changes in the Mekong delta into the future."></capital-spend>
