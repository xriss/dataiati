  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Our overarching aim is to improve population health and wellbeing in SSA&apos;s cities, through evidence-based policies and social programmes that reduce air pollution. We will realise our aim through co-development and co-design (current proposal) and implementation, testing, documentation and promotion (work in phase 2) of an integrated digital urban air pollution monitoring system, which is suitable for the local infrastructure and social context.  The first phase of work will be used to engage academic, policy, civil society and industry partners and stakeholders with the following objectives.  1. Identify key policy opportunities and options for management of air pollution in SSA cities. 2. Co-develop the features of an integrated digital urban air pollution monitoring system for informing policy priorities and evaluating their impacts on pollution. 3. Evaluate the potential for integrating ground level and satellite sensing technologies with data analytics and AI methods for achieving Objective 2. 4. Co-design a prototype measurement campaign, and identify candidate cities, for implementing the technologies and methods from Objective 3.  5. Identify training and capacity strengthening needs, especially as related to data analytics and modelling skills that would enable a sustainable environmental surveillance system. These objectives will form the basis of our submission to the second round of DIDA funding. Our Aim and Objectives are directly related to the Smart Communities (monitoring and management of pollution) theme of Digital Innovation for Development in Africa.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The number of people living in cities in Africa is growing faster than in any other part of the world. Poverty, lack of alternatives and limited regulations have also increased the use of polluting cars and fuels by families and small industries. This has resulted in high levels of air pollution which puts the residents at risk of different diseases. However, the governments do not have complete information on where in cities air pollution is high; nor do they know how different sources are distributed around the city. The equipment used for measuring air pollution in wealthy countries is too large and expensive to be used in African cities. Our network of African and UK universities, together with partners in government, community and industry, plans to fully map what information is needed to help control air pollution and use new forms of technologies, like data from satellites and artificial intelligence, to create new ways of measuring and monitoring air pollution in African cities.</narrative>
