   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Exploring Narrative Storytelling as Mental Health Support for Women Experiencing Gender-based Violence in High Prevalence Settings</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Our main objectives for this partnership include:  1. Establishing an international network of academics, poets, civil society, and feminists committed to exploring relevant responses to gender-based violence and women&apos;s mental health in high prevalence settings;  2. Developing a narrative storytelling approach to address the mental health needs of women experiencing gender based violence in high prevalence settings and piloting this approach with women residing in safe houses in the Kurdistan region of Iraq;  3. Sharing women&apos;s stories of mental health and gender-based violence from Kurdistan with an international audience of academics, policy-makers, activists and the public to foster broader social change.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Our partnership brings together medical experts, poets, civil society organisations, and feminist activists working on GBV in the UK and across the Middle East, North Africa and Asia to develop a narrative storytelling approach to gender-based violence (GBV) against women in high prevalence settings. Setting that have a high prevalence of GBV (where over 50% of women experience violence in their lifetime) are often countries or regions where GBV is publicly accepted as a normal part of women&apos;s everyday lives and condoned by state inaction. This is the case in the regions and countries included in our proposal, namely: Afghanistan, Kashmir (India), Tunisia, Kurdistan (Iraq), and Turkey. Storytelling is widely used as a means of personal expression in response to violence in these contexts, drawing on their shared socio-cultural origins as ancient Persian societies. Our collaboration draws on this shared history and the cultural importance of storytelling to develop a culturally-relevant intervention for women experiencing gender-based violence. We do this through four main activities: (1) collaboratively designing a potential storytelling intervention based on our team&apos;s diverse expertise from the medical sciences (psychiatry, psychology) and the humanities (humanitarian ethics, gender and women&apos;s studies, literature studies, poetry); (2) tailoring and piloting the intervention with women residing in safe houses in Kurdistan (Iraq); (3) developing an online networking tool to foster collaborations related to the pilot study and build future project ideas; and (4) creating a collection of stories based on women&apos;s accounts to reach a broad national and international audience to effect social change. This is an innovative approach to creating a culturally-relevant intervention to address the mental health needs of women experiencing GBV in high prevalence settings and will ideally challenge discourses that accept violence in the lives of women as part of a broader project of social change.</narrative>
