  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">(1) Establishment of an accelerated longitudinal cohort of &gt;10.000 individuals in India with the age range of 6-23 years by enriching existing birth cohorts and high risk cohorts of &gt;14.000 individuals.  (2) Assessment of addictive behaviour, both substance-based and behavioural, and carrying out a detailed behavioural characterisation, with special emphasis on externalising behaviour, as well as a clinical assessment according to DSMV/ICD10. (3) Assessment of environmental exposures through the developmental span to select risk and resilience factors, including psychosocial stressors, socioeconomic status, societal discrimination, food and asset security, physical activity, nutrition and environmental toxins, which are thought to impact gene expression, brain development and eventually temperaments and behaviours.  (4) Collection of biological samples in all participants.  (5) Assessing neural processes associated with externalising behaviour and addictions using functional and structural neuroimaging in a randomly selected deep phenotyping subgroup of 1000 individuals.  (6) Investigation of gene x environment mediation of brain development, and externalising and addictive behaviour through genetic and epigenetic studies in the deep phenotyping subset.  (7) Establishment of a sustained and accessible bioresource with integrated database and biobank to facilitate analyses by consortium partners and collaborators.  (8) Building capacity through joint UK - Indian analysis teams, technology transfer, training sessions and summer schools, dedicated neuroimaging and biostatistical support teams as well as the provision of short-term fellowships.  (9) Providing pilot data for the establishment of a nationwide mental health cohort in India.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Alcohol use disorders (AUD) account for a disproportionately high share of the health burden in India and other low- and middle-income countries. This increasing burden is linked to societal changes in emerging nations, which include growing availability of alcohol, greater normalization of use and rapid changes in socio-economic conditions. Individuals with externalising behaviour, which are characterised by altered brain activity during reward processing and behavioural control have a higher risk for AUD. AUD and externalizing disorders share moderate to high heritability with environmental factors being important contributors. While both environmental and genetic factors conveying risk and resilience have been identified it is not established to what extent these factors are dependent on the wider socio-cultural and psychosocial context they are embedded in, or whether they are influenced by epigenetic and genetic factors that are specific for certain ethnicities. It is therefore unknown to what extent environmental and genetic risk factors are similar or distinct in industrialised nations and emerging societies such as in India. Furthermore, some environmental risk factors are largely specific to emerging societies, including exposure to nutritional stress, environmental neurotoxins and culturally dependent forms of psychosocial stress. We propose to investigate in collaboration with Prof. Vivek Benegal of the National Institute for Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS), Bangalore and our Indian partners from Bangalore, Mysore, Calcutta, Chandigarh and Pune if environmental and genetic risk factors in industrialised countries and emerging societies shape brain function and behaviour in distinct ways, thus leading to different risk constellations and neurobehavioural trajectories for substance misuse and externalising disorders.  To address this aim we will establish a comprehensive database allowing comparative analyses of behavioural trajectories in childhood and adolescence, which provide a platform for sustained India-UK collaborations in mental health research. This platform will ascertain a great variety of environmental factors (exposome), biological samples as well as detailed neuroimaging analyses. We propose to compare insights into etiology and trajectories into substance abuse and externalising disorders gained from major European and UK studies including the longitudinal imaging genetics study &quot;Reinforcement-related behaviour in normal development and psychopathology&quot; (IMAGEN) and the &quot;Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children&quot; (ALSPAC) with existing Indian cohorts. The Indian cohorts, which comprise &gt;14.000 participants with aged 0-25 years include both high risk for substance misuse and population-based individuals from different social and environmental (rural and urban) backgrounds. They have been selected to cover the developmental period assessed in the UK cohorts, thus rendering the studies comparable. We aim to enrich the Indian cohorts, which have mainly been designed to investigate somatic disorders by adding a comprehensive assessment of mental health, externalising behaviour and substance use disorders involving psychometric and neuropsychological characterisation, as well as biological sampling in &gt;10.000 participants with an age range of 6-23 years. Assessment instruments and protocols have been selected to allow comparison to IMAGEN and ALSPAC. We will randomly select among the cohort participants 1000 individuals aged between 10 and 23 years for neuroimaging, genetic and epigenetic analyses. We will control for socio-cultural and environmental influences by investigating determinants of substance abuse in SCAMP, a UK cohort recruiting 6.500 11-13 year old adolescents, &gt;1000 of which are of South Asian descent. Together these data will allow for the most comprehensive comparative analysis of brain development and behaviour across different social and cultural environments to date.</narrative>
