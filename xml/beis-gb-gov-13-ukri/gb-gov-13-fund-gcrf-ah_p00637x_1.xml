   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Resources of Hope: Giving voice to underprivileged communities in India</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">&apos;A picture is worth a thousand words&apos; but there are those who suffer by being in the frame. In the media, the poorest inhabitants of India&apos;s cities  are portrayed  as slum dwellers-- the product of the migration of low- skill labour from the countryside and consequent underemployment. Rural populations  living through small-scale farming fare just as badly. They are regularly represented as ignorant, backward-looking and an obstacle to development.    Building on the AHRC Remaking Society project, Resources of Hope will respond to the International Development Theme and spark a cultural shift for disadvantaged members of urban and rural Indian communities, one that will replace hackneyed stereotypes with their own vivid portrayals of life in India in 2017.    Our UK-India team of community engagement practitioners, artists and researchers will create counter-narratives using multi-media materials and co-production methods to reorient global images and media representations of life in Dharavi and Telangana.   Dharavi, Asia&apos;s iconic &apos;slum&apos;, featured in the 2008 blockbuster Slumdog Millionaire. Part of Mumbai, Dharavi degrades the city&apos;s &apos;world-class&apos; image. For policy makers and government planners it is a symbol of employment-, education-, housing- and sanitation- failure that they would rather erase. The UN&apos;s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) suggest that local decision-making in self-organised, informal settlements can be effective at dealing with housing-related issues. Yet policies of self-help and slum upgrading have often been replaced by demolitions and evictions.    Telangana&apos;s population is 69% rural. Many are small-scale farmers, nomadic shepherds or   harvesters of forest products and members of indigenous and Dalit (&apos;untouchable&apos; caste) communities. They are regarded by developers as &apos;peasants&apos; who are inefficient and resistant to modern industrial approaches, despite increasing evidence that their traditional techniques could be vital to achieving food security. Many are forced off their land to make way for larger industrial units.     We will engage ten community artists in each location, particularly women from disadvantaged castes.    They will: 1) reclaim and re-interpret media images of communities so that people can appreciate how they might represent themselves; 2) retrace the unrecorded histories and testimonies of people subjected to &apos;development&apos; by the state and private sector agencies; and 3) generate records of communities with little documented history of their own, using approaches that are easy to make public.    By June 2017 we will deliver: 1) an engagement programme of 20 community artists who will have critically appraised current media portrayals of their communities and generated an authentic multi-media alternative using participatory approaches; 2) a two-site multimedia festival covering the inner city (Dharavi) and touring rural communities (Telangana), bringing film and digital media to an audience of tens of thousands;  3) a co-authored illustrated booklet to be shared among community members who have no access to digital media and are unable to participate in the festival; and  4) a new pilot approach to stimulate community-led creativity in aid projects to be launched at the at a meeting at the Royal Geographical Society hosted by our collaborators, the People&apos;s Archive of Rural India, ACORN Foundation, Yakshi and the Remaking Society network, formed as part of the AHRC Remaking Society project.     Legacy:  i) a rich historical multi-media archive illustrating the importance of personal histories in allowing those whose collective voice has been silenced to communicate and articulate the circumstances of their lives at first-hand; and  ii) in collaboration with our long-term partners in India, we will create a UK-India community of practice, demonstrating how citizen-generated multi-media can directly address the Sustainability Development Goals.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="Responding to the International Development Highlight Notice, Resources of Hope will work with three leading India-based collaborators to:   a. use artistic methods of storytelling and knowledge production with people in two sectors of Indian society to articulate and build their hopes for obtaining their rights to food, housing and democratic participation under the Indian constitution.  b. create capacity for knowledge exchange between leading researchers and NGOs in the UK and India in the field of participatory use of multi-media, particularly in contexts of high deprivation and gender inequality.  c. improve the practice of community-led creativity, both in UK-based and Indian development agencies.  d.  contribute to cultural and policy change that sees democratising access to knowledge and valuing expertise gained through experience as a vital means of implementing the UN&apos;s Sustainable Development Goals.   To achieve these aims, Resources of Hope will:  1. establish two &quot;Art-mix&quot; Groups events with our collaborators in Dharavi (ACORN Foundation) and Telangana (Yakshi). Each group will bring together ten grassroots community artists, the majority of them women, who will critically assess their representation in media that influences the policies of the state, international philanthropic groups and other agencies.   2. provide training for them to document their analysis through storytelling, performance and film in order to generate a larger-scale debate both in their community and with policy-makers via two Art-max Festivals.  3. collaborate with community activists and our project collaborators to develop advocacy strategies for policy change, particularly relating to the constitutional right to food, control over land and participation in decisions that directly affect quality of life (as specified in the UN&apos;s 2015 Sustainable Development Goals - SDGs).   4. provide the cultural tools and expertise to produce counter-narratives that challenge media representations and taken for granted &apos;othering&apos; of underprivileged classes and castes."></capital-spend>
