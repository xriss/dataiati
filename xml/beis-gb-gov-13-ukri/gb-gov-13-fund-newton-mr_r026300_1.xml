   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Establishing and evaluating minimally invasive autopsy to determine cause of death from infectious disease in Vietnam</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">A primary goal of public health is to prevent mortality, which requires specific knowledge about the causes of death in a population. Unfortunately, accurate nationally representative statistics on total and cause specific mortality in Vietnam are lacking due to inadequate routine information systems. Verbal autopsy surveys to ascertain the cause of reported deaths have been undertaken to fill this gap, but these are often lacking in both sensitivity and specificity. Infectious diseases account for an estimated 10-15 % of total mortality, but data on specific aetiology are incomplete. Diagnostic sampling and testing is often limited and post-mortem investigations are rarely carried out in Vietnam, except in forensic investigations. The latter is due to various reasons including a lack of pathology laboratory capacity, the fact that terminally ill patients are often discharged to die at home among family members and low acceptance of autopsy due to cultural and religious reasons. In this proposal we aim to combine anthropological research into the cultural sensitivities surrounding autopsy with diagnostic pathology capacity building and implementation, after which we will evaluate the efficacy of minimally invasive autopsy in establishing cause of death as compared to standard of care.  Primary Objective - To evaluate the efficacy of minimally invasive autopsy to establish cause of death in a total of 100 patients who have died from central nervous system infections, severe acute respiratory infections or sepsis/septic shock in two infectious diseases referral hospitals in Hanoi, Vietnam  Secondary Objectives - To explore the cultural sensitivities surrounding post-mortems/autopsies and to assess whether minimally invasive autopsy would be an acceptable alternative to full autopsy in the community and among healthcare professionals, religious leaders and relatives of patients - To build sustainable pathology capacity in two infectious diseases referral hospitals in Hanoi, Vietnam by establishing pathology laboratories and training of clinical and technical staff by UK pathologists and technicians and to implement diagnostic procedures for routine hospital diagnostics that can be sustained and continued after the project is completed.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Pathology is the science of the causes and effects of diseases, especially the branch of medicine that deals with the laboratory examination of samples of body tissue for diagnostic or forensic purposes that have been obtained from an affected part of the body while the patient is alive (biopsy) or dead (necropsy or autopsy). In medicine, pathologic examination of tissues from patients who have died can be helpful to establish the cause of death. Knowledge of cause of death is of importance for prioritizing and distribution of public health resources. In Vietnam pathology is not part of routine diagnostics of patients and is not routinely used to establish cause of death. Knowledge of cause of death in Vietnam is therefore limited, also due to limited diagnostic capacity and inadequate national recording and reporting systems. In infectious diseases, which are the cause of death of around 10-15% of all people who die, the cause of death is only known in a minority of cases.  In the proposed project we aim to do three things. 1. To explore the attitudes towards postmortem investigations 2. To build pathology capacity in two large infectious diseases hospitals 3. To evaluate the use of a novel way of doing autopsies by only taking small samples using hollow needles from different sites of the human body. This is called minimally invasive autopsy (MIA).   Attitudes: A social scientist will explore the attitudes and perceptions towards postmortem investigations and sampling among a) the general public by inviting people to complete an online survey in a press release in national newspapers and b) healthcare professionals, religious leaders and patients relatives during focus group discussions. We will discuss postmortem investigations and sampling in general, and full autopsy and MIA in particular. We will show a video of both full and minimally invasive autopsies and ask participants to comment, to discuss their perceptions and beliefs regarding both procedures on a professional and personal level. Capacity: Simultaneously, we will build capacity for pathology in the National Hospital for Tropical Diseases and Bach Mai Hospital in Hanoi. This will include purchase of necessary equipment and consumables for taking and analysing biopsy and MIA samples, training of Vietnamese clinical and laboratory staff by UK based pathologists and enabling implementation of pathology in routine clinical diagnostics, e.g. liver biopsy in infectious diseases of the liver Evaluation: Evaluate the contribution of MIA to establish the cause of death in patients who have died from one of three infectious clinical syndromes: infection of the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord), of the lungs (pneumonia) and of the bloodstream (sepsis/septic shock). After obtaining permission from relatives, we will use the validated MIA protocols - adapted to be acceptable locally using information from the Attitude phase - to take samples from the deceased patient and we will use general and pathogen specific pathologic examination and highly sensitive molecular techniques that detect genetic information of almost all known infectious agents (next generation sequencing) to establish cause of death. We will do this on a total of 100 patients.   All OUCRU&apos;s work is made available in open-access publications, and will be presented at (inter)national conferences and at policy groups. Public Engagement (PE) activities will be designed and coordinated by the very active OUCRU PE team, working with project researchers and health workers in each site to implement and communicate these activities.</narrative>
