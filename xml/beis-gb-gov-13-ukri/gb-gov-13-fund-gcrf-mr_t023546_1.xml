   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Evaluating the role of pharmacists and m-Health strategies in the management of hypertension in General Pueyrredon</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Hypertension is one of the main cardiovascular risk factors in Argentina and the cause of a high number of diseases and deaths. Although there is extensive knowledge about effective treatments and preventive strategies, there is a gap that limits the translation of this knowledge on the benefits of the patients, especially of the poorer ones. Almost half of hypertensive patients do not know their condition and most of them are not appropriately controlled. Lack of access to health services due to multiple types of barriers as well as the lack of patients&apos; adherence to control and treatment are the main problems that explain this gap. The incorporation and integration of the pharmacists to the health system and the use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) have showed highly promising results in the improvement of the management of this condition; however, they are scarcely used in Argentina. In 2018, the Secretariat of Health of the Municipality of General Pueyrred&#xF3;n, Province of Buenos Aires, prompted an innovating community-program, which incorporates the pharmacists to the municipal health system as well as a virtual platform (&quot;Health MGP&quot;, https://saludmgp.rpmplay.com/) and a mobile app targeted to hypertensive patients. Pharmacists&apos; incorporation will improve patients&apos; access to health services, as most people have a pharmacy near their home and they do not need a scheduled turn to assist. Besides, pharmacists will collaborate in patients&apos; follow-up, through blood pressure, counselling and medication use supervision. The virtual platform will permit hypertensive patients to be part of a virtual community, in which other hypertensive patients and health professionals participate and through which, the patient can interact with others and be actively involved in the management of the disease. The mobile app will send reminders to hypertensive patients to support their involvement in the program and reinforce adherence to recommendations. We propose a mixed-study to assess the access, acceptability, adoption and impact of this program, and to use this experience as a case study to promote the debate among key stakeholders of the policy and legal fields about the pharmacists&apos; participation in the health system as well as the use of ICTs in the management of NCDs and hypertension. The incorporation of these technologies not only constitutes the future in the management of Chronic Disease but also represents a shift in the paradigm of care. They contribute to the transformation of the health system from one that is essentially reactive to one that is proactive through the active involvement of the patient in the self-management of their disease.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In 2018, the Secretariat of Health of the Municipality of General Pueyrred&#xF3;n, Province of Buenos Aires, prompted an innovating community-program, which incorporates the pharmacists to the municipal health system as well as a virtual platform (&quot;Health MGP&quot;, https://saludmgp.rpmplay.com/) and a mobile app targeted to hypertensive patients. In this project we will evaluate the access, acceptability, adoption and impact of this program, specifically our objectives are: 1. To assess factors that hinder or facilitate health services access, ICTs adoption and program participation, considering both the perspective of patients belonging to different social vulnerability strata as well as health professionals working at different health system sub-sectors. 2. To assess patient access to the program, according to social vulnerability strata and to health coverage.  3. To assess the acceptability of the program and each of its components (pharmacists incorporation and ICTs) from the perspective of patients and implementers. 4. To assess patients, pharmacists, and physicians program participation and ICTs adoption, at the municipal level and by social vulnerability strata and health system subsectors. 5. To assess positive and negative findings of the program according to the views of patients, implementers and decision-makers. 6. To assess the impact of the program on patient adherence to treatment recommendations, followup and clinical outcomes (blood pressure levels, disease-related complications, and mortality), at the municipal level and by social vulnerability strata and health system subsectors. 7. To assess the costs associated with program implementation from the municipal health system perspective, according to different social vulnerability strata. 8. To assess the impact of the program on local policies and local and national legislation, particularly on those related to the pharmacist&apos;s role in NCDs management.</narrative>
