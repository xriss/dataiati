   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The overarching objective of this project is to strengthen the capacities of local mountain communities in the world&apos;s great ranges for water-related climate resilience. It will link existing centres of excellence in mountain wetlands and water management in Ayacucho Province (Peru), Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh States (India), and the UK using multidimensional case studies to deliver generically relevant principles. 
Our primary objectives in order of priority are:
1. Build the &apos;MountainWet&apos; Network of key stakeholders involved in socio-ecological monitoring and management of mountain wetlands, integrating scientists, policymakers, practitioners, citizen-scientists and local communities. 
2. Investigate the multiple socio-ecologies of mountain wetlands particularly with respect to climate resilience, livelihood support and water-related ecosystem services across the MountainWet network. 
3. Develop transferrable principles and robust analytical approaches based on RAWES (Rapid Assessment of Wetland Ecosystem Services: a method adopted globally in 2018 by the Ramsar Commission), remote-sensing techniques and social survey research (using HWISE, a globally-validated research tool for better understanding water insecurities). 

Three work packages to achieve these objectives are:
WP1: Developing the &apos;MountainWet&apos; Network
Initial attempts to integrate local and scientific knowledge have been initiated in both Peru and India. We see an opportunity to strengthen dialogues between actors through shared interests in sustainable wetlands management through the development of the MountainWet network. We will conduct stakeholder mapping, then create a website that holds datasets generated in this project. It will be accessible by the public and members of the network, with a single sign-on for the latter to access the datasets.  

WP2: Investigation of roles of mountain wetlands 
UWE, PSI and CCA researchers have been separately and bilaterally collaborating on prior studies on mountain wetlands. Through MountainWet, we aim to continue this investigation and have identified four specific types of monitoring activities:
2a. Ecosystems Services: Assess the roles of mountain wetlands in livelihood support based on a systemic assessment of principal wetland ecosystem services using the Ramsar-adopted RAWES approach.
2b. Hydrological functionality: Assess the hydrological processes of mountain wetlands using low-cost sensors, remote-sensing technique to generate Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) and related assessments.
2c. Ecological state: Assess the ecological state of wetlands based on ecological indicators, including conventional quadrat surveying and macroinvertebrate sampling, and using a remote-sensing technique to generate Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI).    
2d. Anthropogenic pressures and potential mitigation measures: Assess critical natural and human factors impacting on the status and functioning of mountain wetlands and on climate resilience.
Where possible these monitoring activities will be conducted integrating citizen science approaches.

WP3: Building a comparative set of case studies 
As part of the institutional and local capacity-building, we will develop a South-to-South learning partnership, that is, creating a dissemination plan for within countries (Peru-Peru and India-India) and between countries (Peru-India). 
We will use the STEEP approach (Staddon and Everard, 2017) to organise data obtained in WP2a. The overall monitoring activities will be enhanced by the application of remote-sensing techniques using drones (WP2b,c). The UWE team has developed the required capacity and expertise in this field and believes that this is a potentially cost-effective method to examine the health of wetlands. 

WP1 is both a key objective and a key enabler of this project. WP2 is the approach taken to thisclimate resilience challenge and WP3 describes key written outputs.</narrative>
