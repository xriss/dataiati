   <narrative xml:lang="EN">For several complex pathogens, we have an incomplete understanding of the kind of immune response we need an effective vaccine to induce. In part this is because these pathogens live inside cells and can hide from the host immune response. This makes it very difficult to develop vaccines against these pathogens. The diseases caused by these pathogens, including tuberculosis (TB), leprosy, leishmaniasis and melioidosis, disproportionately affect people in low and middle-income countries (LMICs) and are often neglected due to the poor predicted commercial return and marginalisation of affected populations. The current approach to vaccine development is to identify a part of the immune response that might be important, develop vaccines that induce that kind of immune response and then test that vaccine to see if it works, first in animal models and then in human clinical trials. This approach does not work for these complex pathogens and is slow and inefficient. In this Network we will adopt an iterative approach and develop more accurate working models of the immune response by cycles of repeated integration of data from human clinical studies and animal models across the different pathogens. The inclusion of vets working in large animal models will mean the results obtained are relevant for the development of animal vaccines as well. The inclusion of partners from LMIC where these diseases are endemic, together with partners from industry will help ensure real world relevance. Furthermore, the smaller animal models will allow us to easily look at single components of the immune system. The insight gained into immune mechanisms will allow us to design and develop vaccines more efficiently and more effectively.   This Network will provide a unique opportunity to bring together individuals working on four exemplar complex intracellular pathogens (M.tb, M.leprae, Leishmania spp. and B.pseudomallei), which share a common lifestyle as pathogens that live in a particular host cell called macrophages, induce similar end-stage pathologies in humans and are known to affect host immune and metabolic responses. The horizontal collaborations established throughout this network, together with the provision of a protected environment for early data sharing, will exploit the biological synergies between these pathogens. Positive and negative results can be disseminated rapidly, and partners working on each of the complex diseases can learn from the successes and failures of those working on the other diseases. By understanding mechanisms that lead from infection to disease, we plan to uncover common approaches to inform vaccine development strategies for these and other complex intracellular pathogens.   Key Network activities and deliverables include annual meetings for knowledge sharing; creation of a virtual network for real-time data sharing; pump-priming funding to fill knowledge gaps, and provide data to enhance the competitiveness of larger grant applications; a website and other communications to enhance collaborations and research dissemination; and career development by funding, training and mentoring of early post-doctoral and new PI researchers. All activities work towards more effective vaccine development for these important diseases, and the improvement of research capabilities in our partner LMICs.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="This Network will facilitate the development of sustainable collaborations between vaccinologists, industrial and basic scientists in the UK and LMIC working on complex intracellular pathogens. These vertical and horizontal, cross-pathogen collaborations will allow research and development in one pathogen field to lead to testable hypotheses in another, thus facilitating and expediting vaccine research and development. Novel insights into host protective immunity will allow the more rationale design of vaccines for these complex pathogens, and improve the chances of success.   Our specific objectives include:   1. A Network communications strategy A website and social media will keep the Network connected. We will create a virtual, secure, web-based Network for real time data sharing, data analysis and interpretation. Access will be password-protected for all Network Investigators. State-of-the-art communications will be used for virtual meetings to increase ease and frequency of interactions between partners.   2. Annual face-to-face Network meetings We will hold a kick-off meeting in the first 3 months to define key priorities. The annual meetings  will include networking sessions, with short talks and poster sessions. Pre-meeting sharing of information via the virtual Network will ensure ample time in the face-to-face meeting for discussion and iterative model development in real time.   3.   Pump-priming grants Between &#xA3;20-50k, these will focus on addressing key knowledge gaps and on developing collaborations that would fill these gaps. Cross-pathogen, cross-institute, and collaborations involving LMIC applications will be prioritised.    4. Workshops  These will be focussed on specific topics of interest and on disseminating knowledge from one field to another. Some examples include assay based workshops such as one on functional growth inhibition assays, and on humoral immunity.  5. Training grants  The Network website and virtual Network will allow the identification of training opportunities, which could potentially be provided by our members, and also includes courses, for example in flow cytometry, which will be facilitated by training grants. There will also be support to bring new investigators into the field.  6. Mentoring We will establish a Network of mentoring to support junior researchers in LMIC and the UK, aiming to support the next generation of vaccinologists."></capital-spend>
