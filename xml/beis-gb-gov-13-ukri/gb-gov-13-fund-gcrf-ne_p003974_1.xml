   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Impacts of El Nino events on ecosystem services provided by Colombian mangroves</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Research questions (1) How have the structure and functioning of mangrove systems with respect to condition, biodiversity, coastal fisheries and sediment dynamics changed due to in response to the current El Ni&#xF1;o event?  (2) What are the implications of changing system dynamics for the provisioning and regulating services that the mangroves provide to support local livelihoods?  (3) What are the implications of these changes on the resilience of the mangrove system to future El Ni&#xF1;o events and the ecosystem service benefits to local communities? Specific objectives (1) To quantify the current state of the two mangrove systems in terms of area, biodiversity, structural integrity, coastal fisheries provision, and sediment characteristics.  (2) To understand the changes in these characteristics as a result of El Ni&#xF1;o in the context of normal variations, based on historical data, expert opinion and local perceptions, and to derive estimates of economic values associated with these ecosystem services fluctuations.  (3) To use a scenario approach to determine the potential impacts of future El Ni&#xF1;o events on mangrove ecosystem services and  economic values, and identify key processes and interventions that contribute to system resilience.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The current El Ni&#xF1;o event in the tropical Pacific region is forecast to be one of the two strongest since records began. There is increasing evidence of links between the El Ni&#xF1;o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and climate change. Climate change is putting increasing pressure on many ecosystems, making them and the communities that depend on them for their livelihoods more susceptible strong El Ni&#xF1;o events, such as the 2015/16 event.   Mangrove conservation has been proposed as a form of Ecosystem-Based Adaptation (EBA) to help protect livelihoods in the face of climate change, providing co-benefits for biodiversity and local communities. However, this strategy may be rendered ineffective if the impacts of extreme El Nino and La Ni&#xF1;a events threaten the survival and functioning of mangrove systems and their socio-economic consequences. It is therefore particularly urgent to quantify the impacts of El Ni&#xF1;o on mangroves and their socio-economic consequences on the local communities; the current El Ni&#xF1;o event provides a transient opportunity to obtain these critical baseline data. Colombia is being affected severely by El Nino. There is a dearth of data for coastal regions, yet the impacts of both El Ni&#xF1;o and La Ni&#xF1;a on coastal communities in areas vulnerable to both droughts and floods have been severe, with shortages of fish and degradation of mangrove systems. Mangroves provide a range of ecosystem services that support livelihoods, including provisioning services such as fisheries, wood, agriculture and transportation, and regulating services such as flood protection, sediment regulation, erosion regulation and carbon storage. The status of mangroves and their intimate link to human well-being and poverty alleviation provides a unique opportunity to quantify the broader impacts of El Nino events.  In partnership with Grupo Laera and INVEMAR in Colombia, we will quantify the impacts of the current El Ni&#xF1;o event on mangroves in two contrasting mangrove systems in Colombia - La Boquilla, which is a relatively high energy system, facing the open sea, and Cienaga Grande de Santa Marta (CGSM), which is a low energy, lagoonal system. Working with our partners, we will collect empirical data on the status of the mangrove system and the following ecosystem services: fisheries, flood and erosion regulation and sediment regulation. We will combine these data with quantitative and qualitative data on the economic and social impacts of the current El Ni&#xF1;o event, and supplement them with time series environmental data from a series of monitoring stations maintained by INVEMAR, the Colombian Marine and Coastal Research Institute. We will derive economic values associated with key ecosystem services from the mangroves using a combination of market-based and spatial value transfer approaches. We will work with local community groups and stakeholders (via workshops) to develop and refine our models of ecological and physical properties of the mangroves into integrated ecological-economic models, and use a future scenarios-based approach to examine the ecosystem and livelihood impacts of various anthropogenic pressures and internal changes within the mangroves.  The work will enhance the environmental and socio-economic evidence base of the impacts of the current El Ni&#xF1;o event in Colombia and, through the development of co-produced models, contribute to a better understanding of resilience of these systems and the livelihoods they support, to future El Ni&#xF1;o events in the region.</narrative>
