  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Objectives The overall aim of this project is to contribute to improvements in radio provision with regard to women&apos;s rights and empowerment in three DAC-listed countries in the Sahel (Mali, Niger, and Burkina Faso). Radio remains the best way to reach populations marginalised by crisis. It gives a voice to the poorest, including women and young people, and can contribute to their ownership of the very development strategies that are supposed to improve their lives. The project draws on NGO secondary data (radio output; concept notes; related documents; statistics; theories of change; and legal texts) from radio stations in the three countries and investigates and compares perceptions of women&apos;s rights and empowerment, how they are shaped and portrayed by radio, and how they impact understandings of, and attitudes towards women and gender equality in the countries, in order to give recommendations, impacting on policy and practices, which will promote gender equality and give women a greater voice in society.   The project has the following objectives:  1. Assess, compare, and contrast representations and perceptions of women&apos;s rights and empowerment, on a large scale, within the context of three Sahel countries (Niger, Mali, and Burkina Faso) by investigating three strands of radio broadcasting in the three countries: women-related programmes; youth-related programmes; and programmes in the general schedule. This builds on findings from previously-funded stages of the project. 2. Identify cases of good practice and areas for improvement in the programming, thus co-producing substantive, innovative and impactful data (creating two data sets for future re-use) with NGO partners, and recommend changes and improvements to broadcasts through the on-going use of feedback (large-scale listener feedback, CSO and media workshops, and training sessions with journalists). This, in turn, impacts on policy and practices and contributes to the promotion of gender equality in the three countries. 3. Establish innovative methods for large-scale secondary data - in this case, radio analysis - using natural language processing (NLP), which is a form of artificial intelligence, for the secondary data analysis and WhatsApp surveys for the feedback. These methods can be re-used and transferred both to other similar DAC/ODA countries and to other subjects, contributing to the development of radio as principal source of information and promoter of stability and democratic progresses in fragile societies such as these.  4. To encourage the participation of listeners in the design of the radio output and therefore in the process of owning development strategies that are supposed to improve their lives.    The project will also be designed to include a wide range of &apos;users&apos; including radio listeners, CSOs (women-related and general), representatives from the media and regulatory bodies in the three countries, and international organisations and donors.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Summary   The project builds on existing research using data resources held by NGOs to produce high-quality, impactful research into gender equality in Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso. Its aim is to further contribute to improvements in perceptions and representations of women&apos;s rights and empowerment in these three DAC-listed countries in the Sahel by developing an innovative methodological approach to secondary data research and by bringing together traditional media (radio) and social media platforms. Using natural language processing (NLP) - a form of artificial intelligence - for the large-scale qualitative and quantitative analysis of the data, and WhatsApp surveys for listener feedback, the project examines NGO secondary data (radio output; concept notes; related documents; statistics; theories of change, and legal texts) from radio stations in the three countries. It investigates and compares perceptions of women&apos;s rights and empowerment, how they are shaped and portrayed by radio, and how they impact understandings of, and attitudes towards women and gender equality in the countries in order to give recommendations, impacting on policy and practices, which will promote gender equality and give women a greater voice in society.   Gender inequality is extensive in the three countries and women have always been the first victims of under-development. There are high child marriage rates, low literacy rates, especially amongst girls, polygamy is common and violence against women is rife, particularly in conflict-affected zones. Radio is the main source of information. To be effective and to reduce obstacles to women&apos;s voices being taken into account and ensure the evolution of gender-related problems, radio needs to broadcast relevant subjects in an accessible manner, and must target not only a female audience, but the whole population. Programming must be designed with the participation of listeners and experts.  The project uses NLP to transcribe and initially code the secondary data, allowing large quantities of information to be analysed. Listeners are questioned interactively on the programme content and their perceptions of women&apos;s rights and empowerment throughout the project using WhatsApp surveys. These enable significant numbers of individuals to be consulted over large areas, some being conflict-affected and not reachable by researchers, and at low cost, not achievable through individual or group interviews. Such surveys also allow for questions and responses as voice messages promoting greater inclusivity amongst populations with low literacy rates.  Civil society organisations (CSOs), media experts and journalists are consulted and involved in the process at knowledge exchange workshops during the project.  There are two rounds of automated secondary data collection and analysis (weeks 3-7 and 11-15). Each is linked to WhatsApp listener surveys. Knowledge exchange workshops are held before, in between, and after the two rounds of secondary data collection and analysis.  Training will be given to journalists in between and after these two rounds regarding improvements to broadcasts and the transfer of best practice.  The project benefits women and youth in the three countries; radio stations; donors and other NGO and media development organisations; women&apos;s CSOs in the countries; journalists; and academic researchers and practitioners.  The project generates two data sets which are based on the NGO secondary data, and additionally generated data from WhatsApp listener surveys. It also expects to deliver at least 3 academic papers, 2 working papers, pamphlets and posters to inform dissemination events; present at a minimum of 3 conferences; hold at least 3 dissemination workshops; and develop and sustain the project website and other media platforms.</narrative>
