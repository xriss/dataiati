  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">RESPiRES aims to address major knowledge gaps in the implementation of Smart City initiatives to ensure sustainable outcomes for people, the environment and the economy. These aims will have a focus on social-ecological resilience across emerging (Mexico) and established (UK) economies and met in four core objectives:  1. Identify future-proof and smart tools and techniques that are available, accessible and appropriate, and could be adopted by community-based monitoring (CBM) initiatives across Smart Cities to monitor blue-spaces (e.g. wetlands, ponds, lakes and rivers)  2. Determine place-based values and perceptions of urban blue-spaces (positive and/or negative) held by local communities across demographic gradients (e.g. age, gender, wealth, health, education) 3. Co-construct and validate a suite of social-ecological resilience indicators that represent intrinsic as well as instrumental values held by local people, and can be used by local governance to deliver highly valued and resilient blue-spaces in Smart Cities 4. Identify local and regional factors that contribute to highly functional and resilient blue-spaces and associated ecosystems that provide important ecosystem services to local communities  In achieving these objectives, RESPiRES will explore the role of environmental justice and equity regarding access to blue-space provision that are both healthy and valued. The co-construction process and development of a CBM programme will engage local communities in Mexico City and Bristol and encourage sustainable behaviour change through citizen participation and the co-development of knowledge. Critically, through investigation of current and emerging technologies as well as the barriers and opportunities for their use in CBM, RESPiRES will provide solid foundations for the smarter use of data and information in future Smart Cities.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Smart and sustainable cities require functional and resilient ecosystems to support the health and well-being of their human population. However, this can only be achieved by understanding how people interact with and perceive these ecosystems. blue-spaces, such as wetlands, ponds, lakes and rivers, play a key role in the urban ecosystem and for human health in cities. Understanding the factors that favour healthy ecosystems will facilitate the design of governance systems that improve the provision of highly beneficial services for people. Therefore, we propose to directly address the call topic &apos;resilience and environmental sustainability&apos; through multi-stakeholder engagement and social-ecological systems investigation in different economic contexts (emerging vs. established economy). By eliciting place-based values and applying a standardised analytical framework in both Mexico City and Bristol, we will co-construct a suite of indicators for each city that facilitate purposeful monitoring of social-ecological resilience by local communities, and propose the best technologies available to the Smart City in order to do this. Through RESPiRES we will entrain a network of stakeholders and foster relationships for a sustained impact beyond project completion.   The proposed research also supports the topics &apos;politics of the smart city and urban economies&apos; and &apos;digital social innovation&apos; by assessing present-day public access to urban blue-spaces by different sections of the urban populace (considering wealth, education, health, age and gender and their intersectionality) as well as access to technology. This applied interdisciplinary research will result in evidence-based recommendations for environmental monitoring in Smart Cities and influence both short- and long-term policies for urban resilience.</narrative>
