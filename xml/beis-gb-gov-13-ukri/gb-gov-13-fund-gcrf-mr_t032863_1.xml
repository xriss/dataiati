  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Each cell in our body contains an identical DNA blueprint inherited from our parents (excepting sperm and eggs that contain half a copy). The decoding and expression of these genes needs to be finely regulated to make different cell types and govern cell metabolism. This is achieved by &apos;epigenetic&apos; modifications to the DNA. One form of epigenetic regulation is achieved by marking certain regions of the genome with methyl groups that tend to block gene expression. Most of this DNA methylation is faithfully inherited every time cells divide and so acts as a semi-permanent regulator of how genes operate.  When sperm fertilises egg the methylation marks on each are largely erased in the first few days after conception and a new &apos;methylome&apos; is created for the embryo. We have studied a seasonal experiment of nature in rural Gambia whereby conceptions occur against very different dietary and nutritional conditions. We have shown that certain &apos;environmentally-sensitive hotspots&apos; across the genome are very sensitive to the baby&apos;s season of conception. These hotspots have a characteristic signature indicating that they are permanently altered in the very early embryo. We believe that they may have evolved to SENSE the mother&apos;s (nutritional) environment, RECORD that information, and ADAPT the developing fetus to be best suited to the predicted future conditions. If the future conditions are different these changes may become maladaptive and cause disease. We have already shown that certain of these variable regions may be linked to diseases such as obesity, cancer and thyroid disease.  In this grant, we seek to better understand HOW diet affects the laying down of these methylation marks, WHICH areas of the methylome are especially sensitive to such influences, HOW they influence the development of the placenta and fetus, and ultimately WHAT effects these changes have on the baby&apos;s development and life-long health.  To achieve this, we will follow rural Gambian families planning to conceive and collect data and blood samples within +/-15 days of conception to much better characterise the environmental factors that are driving the epigenetic changes we study. We will use advanced metabolomic methods to measure differences in the pathways required for DNA methylation and search for possible factors beyond diet (including pesticide and other toxic exposures, pharmaceuticals, etc). We will also search for seasonal differences in the mothers&apos; gut microbiome to see if that may be influencing the changes we see.  We will use new finely-targeted epigenetic arrays to study our hotspots of interest and learn how and why they might have evolved, playing special attention to how these changes affect genomic processes (such as imprinting) that are crucial for placental (and hence fetal) development.  Finally we will examine the effects of these changes on the babies born in the new cohort and follow them into the future. This will create an open, accessible &apos;Early Developmental Epigenetic BioResource&apos; for researchers worldwide.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">We have previously shown that seasonal changes in diet have a significant and reproducible effect on the establishment of the DNA methylome in the very early human embryo. We now seek to understand HOW environmental (nutritional) factors affect methylation pathways, WHICH areas of the methylome are sensitive to such influences, HOW they influence placental and fetal development and ultimately WHAT effects these changes have on phenotype and life-long health.   The key OBJECTIVES of this application are:  1) To establish a new prospective season-of-conception cohort in rural Gambia that will record a diverse range of dietary and other environmental exposures, and collect maternal blood and fecal samples within +/-15 days of conception in order to:  a) define the nutritional (and/or other) exposures driving differences in methylation at environmentally-sensitive hotspots in the offspring methylome;  b) better characterise regions of the methylome that are especially sensitive to periconceptional environment;  c) understand the role of gene-by-environment (GxE) interactions in directing these epigenetic changes;  d) examine their influence on the placental transcriptome and links to parent of origin-specific methylation and imprinting.  2) To use this cohort to create an open-access Early Developmental Epigenetic BioResource (EDEBR) to encourage secondary analysis by others and to lay the foundations for a longitudinal cohort to explore the influence of periconceptional environment on lifelong health and disease.  3) To integrate this work with our ongoing investigations into phenotypic consequences with the ultimate goal of designing next-generation nutritional interventions aimed at optimising fetal developmental outcomes.</narrative>
