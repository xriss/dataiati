   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Aims and Objectives_x000D_
This project aims, through interdisciplinary collaboration, to explore the healthcare and socioeconomic impacts of COVID-19 on people with T2D in rural and urban areas of Tanzania and Kenya._x000D_
There are six specific Objectives:_x000D_
1. Explore how COVID-19 has affected the work of self-management (treatment burden) experienced by people with T2D and their capacity to self-manage effectively._x000D_
2. Understand the knowledge, attitude and practices of people with T2D in relation to COVID19._x000D_
3. Estimate the socio-economic burden (individual and societal) of T2D during COVID-19._x000D_
4. Examine healthcare providers&#x2019; experiences of managing T2D during COVID-19 and their perspectives on factors influencing patient treatment burden and capacity to self-manage._x000D_
5. Review relevant policies and develop policy recommendations for T2D management in the context of COVID-19._x000D_
6. To develop and promote health education messages for T2D management in the context of COVID-19._x000D_</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">People with type 2 diabetes are known to be at increased risk of complications and death from COVID-19, and yet their healthcare has been disrupted by the pandemic. This could lead to more indirect COVID-19 related deaths. Tanzania and Kenya are experiencing increases in the numbers of people with type 2 diabetes, and their ability to manage their condition during COVID-19 may be hampered through lack of access to support, economic hardship and health system challenges. In addition, increased vulnerability may prevent patients seeking treatment, and experiences for people living in urban and rural areas and in the two countries may differ. There is therefore an urgent need to understand how COVID-19 has affected the healthcare and socio-economic welfare of people with type 2 diabetes in Tanzania and Kenya to inform policy recommendations and health education messages to improve health and welfare for this vulnerable population during the pandemic. This project will provide this evidence by administering questionnaires and interviews to people with type 2 diabetes and through interviews to healthcare providers in urban and rural settings in each country. It will also identify the cost of type 2 diabetes to each country during COVID-19 and gaps in national policy and emergency planning responses. The findings will be shared with relevant stakeholders to allow them to input into the development of context-specific policy recommendations and health messages for each country.</narrative>
