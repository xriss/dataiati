   <narrative xml:lang="EN">GCRF-BBR: The Global Vector Hub - The global open access community for vector control information and research</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">More than half of the world&apos;s population is at risk of vector-borne diseases such as malaria, dengue and lymphatic filariasis (WHO, 2014). The burden of these diseases is disproportionately felt by countries on the DAC list of ODA recipients, both in terms of welfare and economic development. The Global Vector Hub aims to have a profound impact on both human and animal health in these countries through the development of an open access, interactive resource, that will transform the way vector control and vector research communities operate and communicate, fostering interdisciplinary community networks and revolutionising preparedness and the ability to respond quickly and effectively to vector-borne disease outbreaks around the world. This will be achieved through the below objectives:  1. We will create an interactive, accessible and current vector information resource relating to vector control research. This will take the form of an online registry and searchable database, with an interactive map, giving the user relevant control research data and information about any country at the click of a button. Country-specific vector information will include the vector species, diseases currently transmitted by these species, and what vector control initiatives are in place. Users will be able to access efficacy data, standardised guidelines and networking tools relating to the interventions relevant to the disease, vector species and ecological circumstances of interest to them, produced, provided and vetted by researchers with local field knowledge and experience. We are developing this tool to be utilised by those working in healthcare settings on the ground in places where vector-borne disease outbreaks most commonly occur, policy makers aiming to change the way that disease outbreaks are dealt with, and researchers contributing to the control of vector-borne diseases to ultimately improve the lives of individuals in countries most susceptible to vector-borne diseases.  2. We will provide free, online research tools, guidelines and training packages. Through a series of menus, users will be able to download bespoke research tools and guidelines, specific to their vector of interest and geographic area. This will enable local healthcare providers and practitioners in countries on the DAC list to have access to current guidelines and training tools, such as guides for testing insecticide resistance, implementing environmental management to remove larval habitats, or how to demonstrate the efficacy of bed nets against local mosquitoes. It will additionally provide a space to access research tools that will aid in knowledge sharing around the world.  3. We will include a registry of academic, government and industry-led organisations, research institutions, vector research sites and vector control programmes. This will facilitate collaborations between individuals, institutions, organisations, programmes, specialisms and consortia with vector related associations. This online network will be compatible with active online discussion forums where experiences and expertise can be shared, lessons learnt, gaps identified and impact demonstrated and shared in regions that are currently dealing with, or are at risk from, vector-borne diseases.  4. We will develop an online database of companies and control programmes with capacity to supply vector control tools and a set of clear criteria for quality assurance checks and due diligence tools to enable the user to make informed decisions about which companies and which products to choose.  5. Disseminate and engage stakeholders. We are working with The Global Health Network (TGHN) who have many years of experience producing highly successful and impactful databases and online resources for users across the globe in both developed and developing countries. All structural elements including the build and ongoing technical support will be performed by the technical team at TGHN.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Global Vector Hub is an open access, interactive resource that will improve the control of life-threatening vector-borne diseases such as malaria, dengue and Zika. Vector-borne diseases impact over half of the world&apos;s population and exacerbate poverty by disproportionately affecting the most vulnerable societies in the least-developed countries. The Global Vector Hub not only has the capacity to transform vector research and vector control programmes, but revolutionise our preparedness and ability to respond quickly and effectively to vector-borne disease outbreaks. We aim to bring together researchers and health workers on the largest scale ever seen, cutting across several disciplines, diseases and vectors around the world by developing a global platform for collecting, sharing and disseminating data and information.   By working collaboratively with organisations such as the WHO, CDC  and The Global Health Network, we will create an information resource with useful data, tools, guidelines and online networking for scientists interested in controlling diseases transmitted by insects, heath workers and programme managers facilitating the support of those affected by vector-borne diseases and policy makers able to make changes in the approach to disease outbreaks at a government level. Using state-of the-art software, the Global Vector Hub will identify and share what vector research and control is being done where and by whom, strengthening research around the world and helping to share data and information for the welfare and economic development of countries.  The tools that the Global Vector Hub will utilise to ensure a successful resource will include the following:  1. Mosquito database A database of vectors, their distributions, diseases transmitted, biology and preferred habitats available for download or for filtering. 1.1. Mosquito distribution map An interactive map will be a core feature, showing the distribution of vector species across the world and providing pop-up summary details about the diseases transmitted. 1.2. Country-specific content Country-specific data will be reached through the map and provide more in-depth information, including current vector control methods, who is doing vector control, research institutions and emergency response organisations.  2. Site finder Will contain a list of research organisations, institutions and vector control programmes. The site finder will be a unique resource within the Global Vector Hub that can quickly put users into contact with others working in their field.  3. Resources The Resources section will provide online articles, links and downloadable documents in three main areas: 3.1. Training and educational materials Training and educational materials available on the site will give introductions to key subjects, and will host standard operating procedures. 3.1.1. Standard operating procedures 3.1.2. Summary documents 3.1.3. Educational resources 3.2. Vector control product testing and selection This section will give users easy access to lists of products that have been approved by WHO and links to their manufacturers, as well as contacts details for sites available for testing novel products. It will also provide guidance on how to select suitable vector-control products. 3.3. Online links An extensive database will provide links to established online resources, ranging from vector control programme websites to mosquito identification tools. These will be structured in the following sections  4. Discussion forums The Global Vector Hub intends to create lively discussions on the following subjects between scientists working on different diseases, different vectors and different control tools, policy-makers, healthcare workers and vector control implementers.</narrative>
