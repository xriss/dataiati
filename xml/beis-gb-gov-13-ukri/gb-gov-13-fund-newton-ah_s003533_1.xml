   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Our primary objective is to deliver a two-strand research project linking collaborative international research work on a unique Chinese collection of British-built 17-18thc clocks. These also form the case study for a significant piece of work of co-designed digital interpretation. With this linked dual approach, we unite the arts and humanities (history of technology in international context) with the capabilities of new digital media, serving in the process to understand the opportunities for new collaborations with Chinese companies and institutions.  Both China and the UK see Creative Industries as central to future economic growth and social and cultural development and for the transition from a manufacturing to a knowledge-based economy.  The two nations are at different points within this transition and define the sector and its intersection with the digital economy differently. Both see the role of cultural organisations as pivotal to the development of their respective creative economies, but within the cultural sector there are also significant differences in interpretation, audience engagement and technology implementation which will inform this project.   The UK&apos;s cultural institutions and creative companies lead in the development of globally renowned exhibitions and galleries, supporting their development through creative research and research into audiences. Our museums and designers are at the cutting edge of international exhibition design, object interpretation and audience research, focusing many of their interpretative approaches on compelling narratives and historical artefacts. China&apos;s museums and galleries are growing fast - particularly in the field of science and technology - and are seeking strategies to move from object-based display to more engaging visitor experiences. In China, digital technologies are predominantly used to recreate and replicate other spaces, places and times. Virtual tours of historic and cultural sites have become a widespread feature of the museum sector. The past 5 years have seen digital companies in China beginning to use digital reproduction to connect Chinese audiences to international collections.  Our ambition is that this project will enable companies to build stronger links and support understanding across the creative industries in the UK and in China; that it will make a major contribution towards understanding the contexts and interests of museum audiences in both countries; and that it will lead to the development of digital cultural resources to support the interpretation of heritage for new Chinese audiences. To that end we deliver these subordinate objectives:  - Build relationships and understanding between UK/China creative companies and the museums through two workshop activities - Facilitate knowledge exchange between historians, museum professionals and those working in the History of Science and Technology, especially in the history of time measurement and scientific instruments more generally - Share the process, methods and experience online, through appropriate platforms in UK and China, for others to learn from - Create guidelines for creating digital heritage products in UK/China - Develop prototype digital experiences which build on knowledge and cultivate interpretation techniques for cultural heritage in different contexts - Develop collaborative research papers and conferences and talks to build knowledge exchange beyond the project</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Time, Culture and Identity will foster creative and commercial collaboration between cultural partners and businesses in the UK and China by exploring the history of cultural and economic exchanges between the two nations through the lens of timekeeping. Exquisite, but rarely-seen clocks from the collection of Beijing&apos;s Palace Museum will be brought to life for audiences across China and around the world via new digital experiences, co-designed by UK and Chinese creative businesses. By stimulating knowledge exchange and brokering commercial relationships between the UK and China, the project will develop methods for cross-cultural approaches to connecting audiences with their scientific heritage. This project will explore the potential of the cultural and creative economy through two interacting strands:  *  a collaborative research programme between curators and researchers at the Science Museum in London and the Palace Museum in Beijing, working with scholars at Beijing Jiaotong University and the Chinese Academy of Sciences, around a unique collection of 17th and 18th century clocks, manufactured and designed in England, but created for the Imperial court and held in China. *  a co-design approach to the digital interpretation of the clocks involving knowledge exchange between UK and Chinese creative businesses. This will be supported by audience research into the display of the clocks in three locations: Beijing, Hong Kong and London, and will bring together creative companies in both countries to explore new alliances and ways of working. In this way, &apos;Time, Culture and Identity&apos; will not only act as an exploration of the long history of cultural and economic exchanges between Britain and China but also a practical example of this in the contemporary context - stimulating knowledge transfer between the cultural partners and brokering commercial relationships between the UK and Chinese creative businesses. But this project is also designed to exploit a larger opportunity for UK/China collaboration. In its boldest form, the outputs of &apos;Time, Culture and Identity&apos; will inform a joint effort between the UK and Chinese partners to reimagine the industrial revolution through material culture; to question narratives that focus on the Western development of eighteenth and nineteenth century sciences and technology, and see this as part of a continuum that embraces the Chinese experience of industrial revolution leading to our globally interconnected society.  Whilst such themes are broad and ambitious, by focusing on a single key area - the concept of time as transmitted between the Britain and China in the 18th Century - we will be able to illuminate and test a strand of this larger thesis, and the possibilities of collaborative research, interpretation and creative trade between the UK and China in the 21st century.</narrative>
