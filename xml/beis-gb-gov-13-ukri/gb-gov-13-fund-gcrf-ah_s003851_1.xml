   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Arts of Inclusion (TAI): Examining the Role of Performing Arts for Peace Education in Conflict. A UK-Latin American Countries Network.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The focus of the proposal is to establish a network of academics and activists to share and build expertise to critically assess the role of performing arts practices for peace education and inclusion in conflict settings across a range of Latin American ODA recipients; and to build the foundation for sustained research that will address key issues of pressing concern in the field. The network will facilitate expertise in middle-income countries so that it can be applied to neighbouring low-income countries. The network involves a collaborative partnership between academics with interdisciplinary expertise based in Colombia, Mexico, Brazil and the UK. The proposal has been developed in consultation with and to reflect the needs of ODA partners, building from an existing ESRC IAA collaboration. The proposal reflects local development priorities on peace education through arts engagement with individuals affected by Colombia&apos;s internal armed conflict, and Mexico and Brazil&apos;s gang war. Our network aims to: a) Create new research capacity by investigating the uses of performing arts (music, dance, theatre) for peace education in conflict settings in Latin America, paying particular attention to co-production of knowledge with programme developers and participants. b) Facilitate networking, critical debate, and resource awareness among scholars focussed on performing arts for peace education of all career stages, community arts professionals, programme developers, policy leaders, and the public. c) Enlarge initial membership and resourcing through the members&apos; international networks, developing it into a self-sustainable hub of networks to benefit low-income ODA countries (from year 2).  It will achieve these aims through six objectives: (1) Scoping the literature on the role of the performing arts for peace education in conflict settings, looking at issues in individual countries and also comparatively across countries. (2) Scoping relevant practices through critical ethnographies of conflict-affected individuals participating in performing arts activities in Colombia, Mexico and Brazil, developing the capacity of Early Career Researchers, who will work with victims once a week for 9 months to critically co-evaluate the role of performing arts. (3) Providing extended networking and impact opportunities through a website, blog, externally produced documentary and two briefings for non-academics from the scoping exercises. (4) Hosting three two-day workshops in Colombia, Mexico and the UK where critical dialogue about performing arts for peace education will focus, respectively and progressively, on the topics of: 1. Performing arts policies for peace education in conflict; 2. Arts pedagogies for peace education in conflict; 3. Global challenges for future policy, research and practice of performing arts for peace education. The workshops will encourage cross- and interdisciplinary collaborations (notably between education and performing arts) that will generate KE and impact with NGO and policy leaders. (5) Preparing a joint research and development bid to undertake further KE and fieldwork in a range of locations within the remit of non-academic members (to run after year 2). (6) Preparing an essay collection on performing arts for inclusion in Latin America, already solicited by Routledge.  In establishing the network we plan to lay the groundwork for research which is genuinely multi- and interdisciplinary; that explicitly springs from a co-constructed view of knowledge creation, particularly in conflict settings; that views such settings from an intersectional perspective, taking into account the interplay between ethnicity and other aspects of identity such as social class/position and gender. Finally, by emphasizing a comparative perspective, the network seeks to counter discourses of the role of performing arts for social purposes in Latin America that implicitly homogenise such experience across the continent.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This interdisciplinary network of academics (education and performing arts) and peace education advocates will critically explore the contribution made by the performing arts in developing peace education with - and the welfare of - individuals affected by violent conflict, beginning with Mexico, Colombia and Brazil. Beyond the benefits that the network will have for participants from these three countries and eventually the countries surrounding them (Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Bolivia), the network activities will benefit practitioners and NGOs working with conflict-affected individuals as well as local communities by helping to develop research-informed practices.  Examples of social arts programmes abound, but developers in conflict settings do not appear to comparatively and systematically study how and under which conditions individuals benefit from participation. This network will begin to address this gap. The proposal emerged through a collaboration between academic and non-academic colleagues in Colombia, Mexico, Brazil and the UK facilitated with an ESRC Impact Acceleration award that explored the participants&apos; research needs. The network&apos;s initial theoretical framework is based on previous international research by the PI that investigated the uses of preforming arts for inclusion in post-conflict Northern Ireland. Nevertheless, the network will allow participants to identify key areas for further collaboration, research and capacity building to address the needs of individuals affected by conflict in their own countries. The three overlapping phases of activity during the 24-months time-frame focus on relationship building (through links among collaborators); capacity strengthening (through critically co-evaluating and sharing best practices and policies), and international development and outreach (through KE links with potential partners in other ODA countries).  The connections between academic and non-academic collaborators will be strengthened over the course of a series of 2-day workshops in Bogota, Chihuahua and Glasgow, where participants will share best practices, theories, and methodologies to support peace education activities built around the use of performing arts. The links created during these workshops will be further sustained through wide-access social media such as a dedicated Blog and Twitter. The network will expand its outreach through sharing a suite of multimedia resources developed throughout the project. These resources will include recorded practices of using performing arts for peace education, discussions and key presentations conducted during the workshops along with images of practices in situ, one policy briefing (from comparatively scoping the literature) and one practice briefing (from 9-month critical ethnographies conducted in the three countries, which will become an edited book). These resources will be shared with potential partners in other ODA countries identified through network participants, academic partners and advisory board members who already have links in these countries. To address the issue of access to resources, the materials will be available in a number of formats: video recordings via YouTube (key workshop videos will have subtitles in English and Spanish), press releases, blog posts, and through the high-visibility webpages of our collaborators, as well as through our own website. We will broadcast some of the KE activities developed during the network events and will also develop short toolkits (such as &quot;How to&quot; mini-tutorials and &quot;Top 5 Strategies&quot;) for high circulation and visibility across the social media sites mentioned above. A professional media company will be commissioned to prepare a short film of network highlights for BBC pitch as an idea for a primetime documentary.</narrative>
