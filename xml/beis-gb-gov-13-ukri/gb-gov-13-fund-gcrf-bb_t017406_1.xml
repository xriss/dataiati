   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The growing prevalence of AMR is a global health challenge that requires accurate and
rapid diagnostic methods to confirm phenotypic testing in surveillance studies and to
understand the mechanisms responsible for development of AMR. This project will create
and deliver training programmes for researchers from Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and India to
become expert in the detection of AMR, using techniques from basic antimicrobial
susceptibility testing to molecular diagnostic methods. This objective will be achieved
through an online training course followed by a practical workshop. The selection of
researchers for training will be based on their current experience, future roles in AMR
research with respect to diversity and gender balance. This training programme will create
a network of researchers who are capable of conducting molecular AMR diagnostics
safely and reliably to detect resistance-coding genes and/or resistance-associated
mutations. The training programme will build on current and previous research
partnerships and collaborations between the Royal Veterinary College and Anand
Agricultural University (AAU), Gujarat, India. Appropriate ethical approvals will be
confirmed prior to starting the training.
The specific objectives are:
1. To develop an online training module in research skills in the diagnosis of
antibacterial resistance. The training module will include basic phenotypic
resistance testing and more advanced quantitative and molecular-based methods
and their quality control. The online training course will be developed using
appropriate pedagogical design and a variety of audio-visual media to include
protocols for field collection and laboratory methods. Online training modules will
be hosted on the iHEN (interdisciplinary Hub Education Network) Moodle-based
platform which is specifically developed for the UKRI GCRF One Health Poultry
HUB.
2. To offer practical workshops at AAU, Gujarat, India. The practical training will be
provided to researchers that have satisfactorily completed the online training
course. Practical training will include a) all necessary skills in obtaining and
handling samples of faeces from animals and humans and samples of soil and
water from the environment, b) growing pure culture c) phenotypic disc diffusion
analysis of resistant isolates c) serotyping/phage typing, d) quantitative and
molecular-based approaches including Polymerase chain reaction (PCR),
quantitative PCR (qPCR), Next-generation Sequencing (NGS) and introducing
whole genome sequencing and its uses for typing, generating phylogenetic trees,
resistome analysis and identifying mutations related to AMR.
3. To fill a research skills gap in UKRI GCRF funded researchers and associated
networks, including the One Health Poultry Hub</narrative>
