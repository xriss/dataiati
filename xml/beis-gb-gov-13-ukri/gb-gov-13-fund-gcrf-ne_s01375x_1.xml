   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Africa is rapidly urbanising and with this growth has come a proliferation of informal settlements. Residents of informal settlements often have limited access to services, insecure tenure and high exposure to shocks and stresses such as flooding and disease. Several global and national frameworks have indicated that a key tenet of sustainable urban growth is building &apos;resilience&apos;. Yet, resilience can mean different things to different decision makers - an engineer might measure it as the number of alternative cables in the electricity network if one breaks; a psychologist might describe resilience as a person&apos;s ability to adapt to adversity. Indeed, resilience often does not have a direct translation in many languages. Those involved in making cities more resilient to natural hazards (e.g., floods) such as engineers and planners tend to have highly technical training. Within these groups, traditionally there is a tendency to quantify resilience in terms of what can easily be placed on the map - such as housing, infrastructure and critical facilities. This can result in some tunnel vision about what types of projects should be taken forward when local experience and perceptions are not taken into account. In spite of these challenges there is a genuine desire in our study city of Nairobi (Kenya) to include the voices of residents in decision making. However, it is not always clear how this more qualitative, experiential information on resilience (e.g., narratives) can be incorporated to existing ways of working by city actors, nor is there necessarily the capacity to undertake major new ways of working. The Expressive Mapping of Resilience (E-MoRF) project aims to mainstream innovative, low-cost ways of representing these community voices on the map, coupled with simple ways for decision makers to incorporate this data into their existing systems to result in more inclusive planning for resilience. The work here builds upon a previous NERC funded project &apos;Why we Disagree about Resilience&apos; (WhyDAR) that was delivered with Kounkuey Design Initiative (KDI) in Nairobi (who we work with in E-MoRF). In WhyDAR, artists and residents of informal settlements worked together in a collaborative environment to define a broad range of ways that people cope with flooding, and the threats to their resilience. Using themes that came out of the workshop, coupled with data collected in the settlement using smartphones, we generated immersive maps combining 360 deg photos, audio and text to communicate a broader perspective of what resilience meant to the community. These prototype maps were made publicly available online using free software. We showed these prototype maps to decision makers such as urban planners, consultants and NGOs who stated that these maps are an engaging way to better understand what planning interventions might support the community, and commented that the data layers could be incorporated into their existing mapping software. At present these maps are static and there is no method in place to continually update them to make them regularly useable. In the E-MoRF project, we will move from prototype to operational maps through: A. Creating and distributing training resources for community groups to identify key components of resilience specific to them and then generate expressive map data to visualise this B. Creating an open, online platform where this map data can be uploaded, viewed and distributed to a range of decision makers C. Creating and distributing training resources for decision makers to help understand these new types of map and how they can be incorporated in their daily work  D. Throughout the project, having a continuous cycle of feedback from community groups and decision makers to ensure the maps are useful, useable and used  E. Exploring how the process affects decision making with regards to resilience  F. Disseminating resources to encourage uptake of the approach in additional cities</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project aims to develop and deploy an innovative tool for enabling transformative resilience. It takes forward and actionizes techniques tested within the NERC-GCRF &apos;Why we Disagree about Resilience&apos; (WhyDAR) [NE/P01609X/1] project. This refined tool aims to create qualitative map visualisations of resilience to natural hazards with community members. The tool will be developed in Nairobi, Kenya but has general application to other urban areas for use by a range of stakeholders including representatives of the urban poor and urban planners in the global south. The outcome is increased local inclusion and the incorporation of social data in urban planning processes for more resilient cities. This will be achieved through the following objectives:  A. To refine and co-produce a range of expressive map layers that capture aspects of resilience particular to that community. The WhyDAR project found that at the city level, resilience tends to be framed in terms of physical infrastructures (e.g., roads) which can easily be visualised with typical data and GIS software. However, this technical approach often overshadows social aspects of resilience and local assessment of infrastructure quality which are not represented as easily within spatial data. Yet there are clear needs at international, city and community levels for more inclusive and participatory approaches. The WhyDAR project developed two key forms of prototype map layer: (a) StorySpheres which are immersive, 360 degree photographs combined with multi-directional audio that can be embedded to a map to show multiple (often opposing) narratives of a space; (b) Social Network maps which indicate how the community connects to a range of formal and informal actors at different points in the disaster lifecycle, accompanied with descriptions of how these connections operate. The map layers generated in the WhyDAR project will be refined by co-production partners and stakeholders such as Kounkuey Design Initiative (KDI) and Nairobi City County Government (NCC) throughout the project. The expressive map layers we will develop are innovative in terms of GIS research and practice as they explore ways to spatially represent time and a multiplicity of perspectives.  B. To operationalise methods to generate spatial data to populate the prototypes developed in (A) and to create training materials for community groups and city actors. Data is generated through (i) arts based community workshops to identify the main themes of resilience important to a specific community and (ii) field based data collection using low-cost smartphones. There will be a focus on low-cost/free methods to generate data. This objective involves embedding new knowledge within KDI and city stakeholders to generate and apply the data layers. Our point of entry to city actors is through the NCC Nairobi Risk Partnership initiative (see letter of support).   C. To deploy an open online platform for the upload and visualisation of the maps generated through objectives A-B. This will incorporate community generated spatial data into existing GIS tools and planning activities for city and local level plan, project design and infrastructure monitoring for resilience. The mapping methodology is generic. Encouraging wider use of the platform is an important step to strategic uptake including by agencies like UN-Habitat or commercial entities like Arup (members of the project Advisory Group). Wider use will be enabled through the creation and dissemination of online training resources. In both cases, there is an emphasis on methods and data fitting in with existing capacity and approaches rather than significant resource requirements.   D. To explore the planning interventions that result from the inclusion of local knowledge in urban planning and improved collaboration between community actors and city level stakeholders. This will build evidence to support this approach and its wider adoption.</narrative>
