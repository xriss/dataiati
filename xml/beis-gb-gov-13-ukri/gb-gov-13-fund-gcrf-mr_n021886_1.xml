   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Bridging the Mental Health Treatment Gap through Tele-psychiatry - &apos;REACH&apos; a Formative Research Project from Goa, India.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">India has a significant burden of mental illness with almost 70 million people having some form of mental illness. This problem is compounded by an acute shortage of trained specialist manpower to provide mental healthcare to those who require it. The existing manpower can only provide care for one third of the mental health needs. Furthermore, 70% of this manpower is inequitably concentrated in urban areas while 70% of the Indian population lives in the villages. This mismatch is a great public health challenge and there is an urgent need to look at innovative ways to overcome this barrier to access. Affordable technology, which is easily accessible in India today, might provide the turning point in the field of mental healthcare delivery. In this project we plan to use videoconferencing technology to provide mental healthcare for patients attending primary care clinics. We plan to discover whether such an innovation is feasible and safe to deliver, acceptable to the various stakeholders and has a positive impact on the mental health of the people. Videoconferencing facilities will be established between District Hospital and Primary Health Centres, where most patients access health care. Patients with Depression, Alcohol use disorders and Severe mental illness will be identified by research workers, who will be offered consultations with a psychiatrist based in the District Hospital via videoconferencing. Medication and follow up services will be provided in the primary health centres. Before-after assessment will measure change in symptoms and disability level. Since the service is delivered in the community we expect better compliance rates. In-depth interviews will be conducted with all stakeholders including service delivery agents, patients and their families to determine the acceptability of tele-psychiatry. Demonstrating that delivering mental health care through tele-psychiatry is feasible and acceptable has significant policy implication. Tele-psychiatry can then play a transformational role in mental health delivery in low resource settings.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The main objectives of REACH are to determine the: 1. Feasibility of delivering psychiatric consultation services via tele-psychiatry to patients with mental health problems identified in primary care. Vast number of patients in India access health care at the primary level however availability of mental heath care is poor in these settings. This is largely due to lack of trained mental health manpower. Further the health personnel at primary level are poorly trained to identify and treat mental health issues. It will not be possible to bridge this mental health treatment gap in the near future hence this innovative use of  tele-psychiatry via videoconferencing is being considered. Though telepsychiatry has been used in some settings it remains to be seen if it can be integrated into the primary health system, which if found to be possible would have significant impact on mental health care delivery in India. We aim to demonstrate that it is feasible to integrate such services into routine primary health care. 2. Acceptability of tele-psychiatry services to various stakeholders including the delivery agents, patients, and their family members. One of the challenges would be engaging the end user and the peripheral health team in delivering care in a safe and acceptable manner. Besides feasibility and acceptability there are other concerns in delivering such a service such as  issues of privacy, confidentiality, record-keeping, ethical and legal implications as well as duty of care and handling of emergencies. The study will delve into these issues through in-depth interviews with all stakeholders. 3. Preliminary impact of psychiatric consultation services delivered via tele-psychiatry on various outcomes in patients with mental health problems identified in primary care. We will recruit patients identified with Depression, Alcohol use disorders and Severe Mental Illness; before-after assessments of symptom burden and disability levels will be done to determine the impact of the tele-psychiatric consultations. We hope to demonstrate that providing mental health care through tele-psychiatry has a positive effect on the outcomes.</narrative>
