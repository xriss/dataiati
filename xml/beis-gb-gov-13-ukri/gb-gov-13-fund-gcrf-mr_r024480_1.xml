   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Healthy Crossroads in Pregnancy Care (HCPC) - A Scoping and Participatory Design Study of the Potential for ICTs to Improve Maternal Health in India</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Our objectives are: 1. To hold three scoping workshops to build a multi-disciplinary, cross-cultural, and cross-geographical consortium of researchers, technology designers, public &amp; community health workers, and grassroots citizens&apos; organizations to explore how to empower pregnant women to cope with their self-care management practices through technology.  2. To engage in initial ethnographic work including interviews, observations and focus groups with pregnant women, relatives, healthcare workers and other members of their communities in Channapatna to better understand pregnant women&apos;s lived experiences, the (un)healthy practices related to pregnancy care and how these are coordinated and negotiated with other practices in the messiness of everyday life, to ensure our work is grounded in situated care needs.  3. To engage in a community-based participatory design process with pregnant women, caregivers and the key community members through a series of design workshops to explore, experiment with ICTs, and create new innovative technological-mediated experiences to inspire new ways of thinking to address the uncovered challenges of pregnant women to improve health and wellbeing. 4. To share the uncovered pregnancy experiences and generated design ideas with situated stakeholders in India and with the wider communities including the government, the creative/design industries and research communities. 5. To outline an AHRC &amp; MRC proposal for a) exploring ways to artfully-integrate (Suchman, 2002) the ICT concepts with the ongoing care practices in Channapatna, and b) explore the implementation and scaling of the generated concepts and ideas to design an intervention that can be piloted at  the state and potentially in the longer term at the national scale.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This partnership aims to co-inquire what roles Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) might play in enhancing and shaping (individual and community-based) socio-cultural practices around pregnancy care in India. Maternal health is one of the foremost public health challenges in India. Additional disorders and complications such as anaemia and gestational diabetes makes the self-care management of pregnant women more challenging in particular in urban slums and rural areas in India. In addition, the low utilization of maternal and reproductive healthcare services together with the exacerbating socio-cultural and economic inequalities have jeopardised pregnant women&apos;s health especially at the lower level of the socio-cultural system in India. For instance, pregnant women often find themselves in subordinate positions, and cultural everyday practices (e.g., serving the husband food first), family structures and traditions challenges women&apos;s autonomy, the delivery process and and the postnatal period, whilst engaging in unhealthy practices that can potentially be harmful to both the mother and the baby. Exploring the socio-cultural practices around pregnancy and the everyday experiences of pregnant women can provide opportunities to enhance pregnant women&apos;s autonomy, agency, self-efficacy and self-reflective practices through technology design.  As such, this partnership aims to explore the complexities of everyday pregnancy care and scope opportunities and concerns for the design of technological interventions that can support and reshape the maternity journey, accounting for the autonomy and agency of pregnant women within and beyond households, to improve their health and wellbeing. We have brought together a multi-disciplinary, cross-cultural, and cross-geographical group of researchers, technology designers, public &amp; community health workers, and grassroots citizens&apos; organisations to explore the opportunities afforded by ICTs to help identify, promote and/or restrict the consequences of (un)healthy practices and lifestyle behaviors in the health of pregnant women, the newborns, and the community.  To meet our project&apos;s aim, we will, over a period of nine months (between March and November 2018), engage in 2 stages of co-inquiring studies (ethnographic work and co-design work), and meet as a team to hold 3 scoping, networking and dissemination workshops in India: at the beginning of the project, after 4 months of the ethnographic work, and at the end of the project.  The partnership will gain further understanding of (un)healthy practices around pregnancy care, as well as explore and create a collection of design probes and innovative ideas and experiences to empower, enhance and promote the active and positive participation of pregnant women, their families and communities in maternal care. The insights from the ethnographic work and the generated design ideas and prototypes will be shared with the participants, their communities and the public in general. We will develop a larger research study to further explore the implementation of the generated ideas on national scale across India. The project will provide the basis for additional further collaborations and strengthen our individual practices through sharing best practice and methods across fields.</narrative>
