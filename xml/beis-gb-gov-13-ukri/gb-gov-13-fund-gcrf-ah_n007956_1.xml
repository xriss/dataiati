   <narrative xml:lang="EN">&apos;Witchcraft&apos; and conflict: Exploring alternative discourses of insecurity</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project focuses on exploring three sets of questions: how do African borderland communities understand and articulate security threats and in what ways does &apos;witchcraft&apos; feature in these articulations? How do African and Western policy-makers, in turn, understand and articulate the major security threats faced by these communities and how far do they consider &apos;witchcraft&apos; within this? Finally, how should Western researchers and Western/African policy-makers engage with these unfamiliar (in) security discourses, and what challenges does attempting to do so pose? Scholars and policy-makers, for example, now largely agree that security threats should be understood not just through the eyes of generals, spies and other state actors but through those of individuals and communities themselves - particularly those in conflict-affected regions. This &apos;human security&apos; perspective allows us to understand insecurity not just - or even primarily - in terms of foreign armies or terrorist attacks but also unemployment, starvation, disease and oppression. Indeed, the latter usually feature far more prominently and substantively as security concerns for most. We know surprisingly little, however, about how communities in Africa articulate and perceive their own (in) security - their voices rarely feature in policy papers and academic studies, particularly those beyond the realm of anthropology. Moreover, little work has been undertaken in political science and history to study and understand indigenous (in) security narratives when they speak to themes and belief systems which differ dramatically from Western ways of thinking. Communities on the Uganda/South Sudan border, for example, have historically come to frame much of what human security scholars would understand as &apos;security concerns&apos; using the language and worldview of &apos;witchcraft&apos;. Indeed, some view those human rights-based approaches to justice and security promoted by Western donors and their own governments as deeply problematic since they &apos;protect&apos; witches at the expense of the community.   Policy-makers and practitioners face practical challenges in reconciling these worldviews with Western systems of justice and governance. More broadly, though, they and Africanist academics interested in security face a broader challenge - how to study, represent, engage with and respond to these narratives which are deeply meaningful for communities but fundamentally at odds with Western modes of thinking. Furthermore, how can and should researchers broach so sensitive a topic with communities? This project will tackle these difficult questions head-on in a highly innovative collaboration between and across disciplines and continents. At its core will be a partnership between a political scientist and an historian who will work to combine different approaches from their respective disciplines in order to explore witchcraft as a discourse of insecurity in the Uganda/South Sudan border region - and to reflect on the wider methodological and epistemological questions raised above.   This will be undertaken in the context of a broader collaboration between a core group of UK and Africa-based academics from history, political science, development studies and anthropology - together with practitioners and policy-makers - who will help design the methodology, advise on the fieldwork and co-produce the outputs through participation in regular workshops in the UK and Africa.  In adopting this experimental, inter-disciplinary approach it will be possible to explore and debate the nature of human security - and the place of witchcraft discourses within this - in a dynamic and exciting intellectual space which goes beyond the limits imposed by individual disciplinary boundaries. In doing so, the project will seek to challenge, re-frame and guide key debates within African Studies, security studies, history and anthropology as well as within policy communities.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project has six key objectives: 1. To explore and analyse indigenous discourses on insecurity in Africa through an innovative collaboration between the PI (a political scientist) and CI (an historian) and a broader, cross-disciplinary network of Western and African scholars. In doing so, the project will seek to challenge and reframe contemporary scholarly and policy perspectives on the nature of &apos;human security&apos; and provide empirical data on local experiences and perceptions of insecurity in Africa (specifically the Ugandan/South Sudan border) which are largely absent from studies outside anthropology. 2. Through adopting a novel focus on witchcraft as a discourse of insecurity, to prompt debate and reflection within policy and scholarly communities on critically engaging with oft-ignored epistemologies of insecurity. In its first phase, the project will bring together a range of academics and practitioners to deliberate on and to co-design an experimental, inter-disciplinary methodological framework to be applied during phase two (fieldwork). This framework will be aimed at reconciling, where practical, Western approaches to understanding security challenges with those of some African communities where supernatural forces emanating from social and political relations represent more meaningful explanatory frameworks. 3. To build a novel and enduring cross-disciplinary research partnership between the PI (an early-career researcher) and CI, bringing together their disciplinary approaches and networks around a common set of concerns and enhancing their career development through facilitating their management of a project of considerable size and complexity. 4. To bring together and consolidate an inter-disciplinary network of researchers, policy-makers and practitioners interested in the project&apos;s themes from a number of perspectives and disciplinary approaches. A core group of 15 will take part in four workshops across the project&apos;s lifetime to maintain and build coherence and to provide maximum space for exchange, dialogue and the production of joint outputs. A central objective here will be to take the project&apos;s concerns further through this network in a larger funding application following the project&apos;s conclusion. 5. To co-develop, co-design and co-produce the project&apos;s methodological and epistemological framework and its outputs with academic and policy colleagues from across disciplines and from both Northern and Southern institutions. Funds are built-into the project&apos;s budget to ensure that the same core network can participate in each of the four workshops - the first two as a plenary - to ensure continued participation from the project&apos;s inception. 6. To produce outputs co-authored by the PI and CI (and, where appropriate, with other members of the network) over the course of the project - and beyond - to steer and influence critical academic debate on insecurity in Africa across political science, history and anthropology as well as policy and practice among both Northern and African state and non-state practitioners. This will include three article submissions, two policy briefs, blog pieces and other outputs (see Case for Support and Pathways to Impact). The PI and CI will work with key members of the network to tailor outputs to specific groups of stakeholders, including African policy-makers who are less often targeted in the dissemination strategies of academic research projects.</narrative>
