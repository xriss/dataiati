   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Invasive species pose a serious threat to native ecosystems, food security and income generation. The Old World cotton bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera, is a global crop pest, causing &gt;US$2 billion of damage annually. Recently, it was found that this voracious pest had finally arrived in Brazil and is now established across the country. The aims of this partnership are: - To convene a workshop of stakeholders to undertake a risk assessment of the potential impact of bollworm spread in Brazil. - To collect field samples of bollworms for analysis of genetic diversity, beneficial microbes and natural enemies. - To assess the potential for microbial symbionts to modulate biopesticide efficacy.  - To determine the role of phenotypic plasticity in modulating susceptibility to biopesticides. The longer-term goal is to establish a consortium of stakeholders equipped to identify, monitor and control the spread of this invasive species and to minimize its environmental impact.</narrative>
