   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Tales of Spring and Winter: Gender, Histories and Intergenerational Exchange in Global Theatre</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">&apos;Tales of Spring and Winter&apos; is a creative and critical investigation into women making theatre within and for fractured communities, in the wake of violence, or in the shadow of historical conflicts, around the globe. We will be working directly with artists from  Rwanda, Burundi, Congo, Palestine, Serbia, Sri Lanka and India.  The central unifying theme of Tales of Spring and Winter is dialogue between the generations, in the broadest sense: encounters between old and young; transitions from past to present; historical regeneration and renewal; the return of spring after winter. Our aim is to find out what underlying and particular qualities women theatre-makers bring to the processes of generational bridge-building, in post-conflict, diasporic or fractured communities across the globe.  This project is conceived as the first step towards creating a new forum and network for women theatre practitioners around the globe (the Women&apos;s Global Theatre Forum). The goal of this website and organization is to make the work of women theatre practitioners visible to the world, now and in the future; to further and support their work through networking, strengthening links, facilitating communication and sharing practice; and to forge connections between women theatre practitioners and those working in international development. This project is structured around the creation of two new original performances. We will be collaborating on a new incarnation of Dear Children, Sincerely, by working with the six female directors who comprise Project Ariadne: Hope Azeda of Rwanda; Ruwanthie de Chickera from Sri Lanka; Frederique Lecomte from Burundi and D.R. Congo; Iman Aoun in Palestine; Dijana Milosevic in Serbia; and Susannah Tresilian, UK. Dear Children, Sincerely, has already begun with a Rwandan-Sri Lankan collaboration between Hope Azeda and Ruwanthie de Chickera.   We will be crafting a new and original contribution to this on-going ambitious project, instigated by Project Ariadne, in which theatre-makers from around the globe have been invited to collect stories from elders in their communities.  In turn these stories, as told to the younger generation, are then woven together into performative memory-banks, an oral cultural archive, to preserve and give voice to the hidden and personal stories behind national stories. In this collaborative project we will extend and develop in new directions this ambitious global intergenerational project. Alongside Dear Children Sincerely, we will be taking a contrasting dramaturgical approach to the issues of hidden histories, intergenerational conflict and reconciliation. Playwright and Principal Investigator, Elizabeth Kuti will be writing a new play, Cold Season in Calcutta, inspired by Shakespeare&apos;s The Winter&apos;s Tale. The artists involved in this piece are: Trilby James (director, UK) and the Anglo-Indian actors, Shelley King; Shanaya Rafaat; Umar Pasha; also Sean O&apos;Callaghan; Madhyama Segal (dancer, India); Kiran Segal (Choreographer, India); and musicians Daniel Dhondy and Hassan Mohyeddin. This creative re-imagining of The Winter&apos;s Tale will be informed by collaboration with these international performers, and also by historical theatre research, and interviews with the Bengali community in the UK.  Transposing key elements of The Winter&apos;s Tale (Shakespeare&apos;s intertwining of Bohemia-Sicily; the sixteen-year Time gap; the theme of violence against women and the younger generation&apos;s &quot;healing&quot; of the older generation), Cold Season in Calcutta will explore, through the lens of gender, interlocking themes of the Anglo-Indian relationship; the legacy of empire; the diaspora, gender and intergenerational struggle. Through comparing the work of women theatre makers across cultures and national borders, this project will uncover new insights into the way women theatre makers across the world are re-telling personal and national stories, in the context of turbulent political landscapes.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Tales of Spring and Winter is a creative and critical investigation into women making theatre in the wake of violence, or in the shadow of historical conflicts, around the globe.  The main objectives of the project are:  1)  critically and creatively to investigate the working methods and artistic practices of women directors and theatre-makers from around the world, in particular Rwanda, Burundi, India, Sri Lanka, Palestine, Serbia and Democratic Republic of Congo;  2) to explore their work through artistic collaboration and engagement in the making of new performances 3) to analyse their work in aesthetic, historical and theoretical contexts;  4)to evaluate the active contribution of women theatre makers as shapers and instigators of reparative processes of peace-building and conflict-resolution at grass-roots levels 5) to create a visible and accessible platform for the work of key women theatre practitioners from vulnerable parts of the world; to bring their work to international attention; to provide professional support and development for practitioners and artists (and through them, the communities with which and for which they work); and to nurture links between female practitioners and international theatre networks, encouraging future collaborations and local creative projects for the enrichment of creative economies in the countries of these participants.  6)  to provide and nurture inter-disciplinary links between practitioners, researchers and academics in the fields of gender, development, history, theatre studies, transitional justice, theatre and human rights, and peace-building and reconciliation processes.     The central unifying theme of Tales of Spring and Winter is dialogue between the generations, in the broadest sense: encounters between old and young; transitions from past to present; historical regeneration and renewal; the return of spring after winter. Our aim is to find out what underlying and particular qualities women theatre-makers bring to the processes of generational bridge-building, in post-conflict, diasporic or fractured communities across the globe.  This project is therefore conceived as the first step towards creating a new forum and network for women theatre practitioners around the globe (the Women&apos;s Global Theatre Forum). The goal of this website and organization is to make the work of women theatre practitioners visible to the world, now and in the future; to further and support their work through networking, strengthening links, facilitating communication and sharing practice; and to forge connections between women theatre practitioners and those working in international development. This project will provide a unique, intensive forum for intercultural exploration, collaboration and conversation between practitioners and a multi-disciplinary body of academic researchers.  It will connect arts and humanities research to issues in development.</narrative>
