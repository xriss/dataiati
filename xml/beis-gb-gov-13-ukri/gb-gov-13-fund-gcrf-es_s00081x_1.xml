   <narrative xml:lang="EN">GCRF Decent Work: FAIRWORK in the Platform Economy in the Global South</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Digital work platforms represent a rapidly growing new economic model that provides employment for millions of workers in the global South. The ways in which these new work practices impact worker livelihoods are especially evident in South Africa: a country with high rates of poverty, extremely high youth unemployment, significant populations excluded from the formal labour market, and relatively high internet penetrations. This constellation of factors have seen digital labour platforms begin to exert significant impacts throughout various sectors of the South African economy. At this moment of change, we seek to bring together South African and UK-based scholars with specialities in Law, Economic Development, Economic Geography, and the Sociology of Work in order to achieve the following objectives (in order of priority):      1. Improving working conditions for digital platform-workers in low- and middle-income countries. This will be achieved by engaging with stakeholders from our existing ESRC-GCRF network, and completing an action-research project in South Africa that seeks to draw out key lessons that about effective mechanisms of change by actively influencing policy and practice. This will specifically be achieve though:     2. The development of a certification scheme designed to set minimum standards for decent work, and the active certification of platforms through a newly created &apos;Fairwork Foundation.&apos; The objective of this certification will be to pressure employers to not fall beneath those key standards. Once implemented, is the certification scheme that we see as having the most potential to travel beyond South Africa and start to be applied in a range of other contexts. These standards will initially be developed by a combination of empirical and legal research in South Africa, but will then be allowed to further evolve at yearly multi-stakeholder events (inviting platforms, employers, workers, trade unions, and academics) that the International Labour Organisation (ILO) has agreed to host. We will assess and certify working conditions on platforms, using the standards as a benchmark.     3. At the same time, we recognise the need for a close reading of the South African context. As such, one of our objectives is the creation of a Code of Practice for South African platforms. This will be developed through a combination of a legal analysis of how current South African regulation can apply to platform workers, a social science analysis of the issues workers face, and a multi-stakeholder dialogue between platforms, workers, and policy makers. The objective will be to get policy makers to give legal recognition to the Code of Practice as a guideline for courts in interpreting the applicable law. Legislative amendments extending the envisaged protection to platform and similarly-situated workers will be advocated if this proves feasible.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">There are millions of platform workers who live all over the world, doing work that is outsourced or organised via digital platforms or apps in the gig economy. This work can include jobs as varied as taxi driving using Uber, translation on Upwork, or the training of machine learning algorithms through Amazon&apos;s Mechanical Turk.  Despite the potential of such work to give jobs to those who need them, platform workers have little ability to negotiate wages and working conditions with their employers, who are often on the other side of the world. Our previous research has shown that platforms often operate in relatively unregulated ways, and can encourage a race to the bottom in terms of workers&apos; ability to defend existing jobs, liveable wages, and dignified working conditions.  The potentials and risks of platform work touch down starkly in South Africa. A country that, by some measures, has the world&apos;s highest income inequality, and 28% unemployment rates. At the same time, the country has relatively well-developed internet infrastructure, and a relatively stable political climate and state/legal institutions. These factors make the country a site in which the platform economy is nascent enough to allow us to co-develop solutions with a multi-disciplinary team from Law and the Social Sciences that will offer tangible opportunities to influence policy and practice surrounding digital work. As other middle- and low-income countries quickly develop their internet infrastructures and millions of more potential digital workers rush online in search of opportunities, the interventions that this project proposes will be of crucial need if we are to avoid some of the &apos;race to the bottom&apos; that the current world of digital work is bringing into being.  Our project will culminate in two key initiatives. First, building on a work package of legal research, a Code of Practice will be developed to  serve as an interpretive tool to outline the ways that existing regulations can be made applicable to platform workers. Second, we will develop a &apos;Fairwork Foundation.&apos; Much like the Fairtrade Foundation has been able to certify the production chains of commodities like coffee or chocolate, the Fairwork Foundation will certify the production networks of the platform economy, and therefore harness consumer power to significantly contribute to the welfare and job quality of digital workers. This programme of work aims to not just uncover where fair and unfair work takes place, but also seeks to codify that knowledge into both a &apos;Fairwork certification scheme&apos; and an annual ranking of platforms. These two initiatives will ultimately allow for the development of an international standard for good-quality digital working conditions. These objectives will be achieved with 5 project stages. First, the Law team will analyse S. African labour laws, social security laws, and other legal and policy regulations relating to the platform economy, and ask how those laws might be adapted to provide decent work standards for digital platform workers. At the same time, the Social Science team will use a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods to map the key issues faced by S. African platform workers: developing a rich understanding of how platform work may be failing to live up to decent work standards. Third, we develop meaningful decent work standards for platform work that happens outside of the Global North. Fourth, we take those standards and use them in a process of action research in which we seek to certify the digital work platforms: assigning them a Fairwork certification if they pass. Finally, through an extended process of stakeholder engagement and outreach with workers, platforms, and policy makers, we plan a short-term strategy of pressuring platforms to change their policies to improve working conditions and a longer-term strategy ofinfluencing the direction that regulation takes in a currently highly unregulated sector.</narrative>
