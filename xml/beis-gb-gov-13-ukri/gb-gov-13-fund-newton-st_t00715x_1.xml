   <narrative xml:lang="EN">1. To develop the relationship between researchers at LJMU (UK) and NARIT (Thailand) to address the needs of this project and provide a basis for future joint development of astronomical infrastructure.  2. To carry out the proposed research and collaboration activities using a methodology that is Official Development Assistance (ODA) compliant under the economic development strand, through  2a. transferring to NARIT the expertise and experience of the LJMU group in developing control systems for telescopes, increasing the scientific productivity and outreach scope.  2b. increasing the expertise of the NARIT group in the field of telescope control, informing the decisions in the development of their infrastructure, and allowing the group to play a greater role in future international collaborations.  3. To develop a new, modular framework for telescope control systems, which can be applied to current and future NARIT and STFC funded infrastructure.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Since 2017 we have been undertaking a collaborative project of software and hardware development towards a new telescope control system for current and new UK and Thai telescopes. In 2017 we were awarded a year of funding for the first phase of this project, which is focused around a requirements analysis and prototype of critical parts of the proposed system for benchmarking against the existing Liverpool Telescope systems. We apply here for funding to continue this project into its final phase, in which we will develop the telescope control system with the aim of full deployment on the Thai National Telescope in 2021.  Thailand has a burgeoning astronomical community and an impressive array of existing infrastructure, along with an established engineering team for the support of operations. However, since much of their equipment has been purchased from external suppliers some of the systems are poorly understood. The TNT control systems for example are based around a proprietary, closed source software, and their network of 0.7 metre telescopes have also been supplied with an entirely different, dedicated interface. This is a risk for the long term stability of these facilities, compromises productivity and limits the ability of the NARIT team to provide upgrades to the current system.  The ARI owns and operates the LT, with operational support from STFC. This facility has a bespoke and established telescope control system (TCS), which is well documented, well understood and with source code available. However, by modern standards it is out-dated.  Our collaborative development project will deliver a control framework which can be deployed on a variety of different facilities. The end product will be a versatile, modular system which will be used on facilities owned by both partners. This will be deployed initially on the TNT, enhancing its scientific and outreach productivity. In the medium term this will replace the system in use on the Liverpool Telescope (LT), and form the basis of the control systems for the NRT project: a major international collaboration with NARIT participation. Aside from the software itself the key benefit for NARIT will be knowledge transfer from the Liverpool Telescope group, which has over a decade of telescope control system experience and expertise. This will provide the NARIT group with the capability to build new control systems for future hardware, such as the Thai radio telescope currently under construction.</narrative>
