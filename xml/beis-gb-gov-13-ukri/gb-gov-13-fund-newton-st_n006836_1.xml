   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Synthesis of remote sensing and novel ground truth sensors to develop high resolution soil moisture forecasts in China and the UK</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The aims of this proposal are to combine multi disciplinary expertise to develop high resolution soil moisture maps within both China and the UK. The resolution will be at two layers of accuracy, at a both a field  (500m x 500m) and sub field level (10m x 10m).  The specific objectives will be; 1) To install a network of static cosmic ray (Cosmos) soil moisture sensors across in Henan and Hebei province in China. This is one of the most important agriculturally intensive regions in China with 40% of winter wheat production. Cosmos sensors are state of the art passive devices which count fast neutron albedo above soils, this is correlated to water content. 2) To use the sensors to monitor soil moisture in China and to determine if moisture in the crop biomass affects the response of the sensor. If crop biomass does have a significant effect the project will develop approaches to calibrate the sensor with in situ biomass. 3) To develop an autonomous vehicle which can mount a new mobile cosmic ray sensor. 4) To use the vehicle to map soil moisture levels within fields at a 10m x 10 resolution and to provide additional data on the variance in soil moisture level within fields and between the static sensors deployed for objective 1. 5) To use data from the inSAR sensor mounted on the Sentinel-1 satellite to predict the soil moisture level at a 500m x 500m resolution within China with deployed static sensors. 6) Calibrate the InSAR sensor with the data derived from the static and mobile cosmic ray sensors. Compare the calibration with other and existing ground truth techniques.  7) Synthesise the SARS data with the cosmos sensors to develop a near real time map of soil moisture across Henan and Hebei province in China.  8) To provide effective KT with the team at the Institute of Ecology and Agrometeorology, China. This will include the embedding of Chinese personnel at the University of Lincoln (autonomous vehicles), the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, Wallingord (cosmos sensors) and the University of Aberwstwyth (remote sensing). 9) Engage with end users which include the agricultural community and government policy implementation organisations (e.g. Satellite Catapult) to ensure rapid uptake of the technology post project completion.  The deliverables will be  1) Application of remote sensing to develop 500m x 500m maps of soil moisture in China. This is a field scale and will enable multiple agri tech opportunities, for example future studies to optimise irrigation systems, assessment of flood / drought risks etc 2) A new autonomous sensor platform to measure soil moisture at a 10m x 10m resolution. This technology will enable multiple precision agriculture opportunities, including within field irrigation management, drainage system design, measuring crop responses to localised changes in soil moisture 3) A state of the art network of static cosmos sensors and therefore the ability to measure changes in soil moisture levels over time and at a very high level of accuracy 4) A well trained Chinese team in the development of SARS maps, autonomous vehicle design and soil moisture monitoring.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The availability of water is a key driver of agricultural productivity. It directly impacts plant growth, and in many countries and locations it is in short or over supply. The impact of water availability on global food production is seen as a key global risk and challenge. Water availability is a hugely contentious international issue, and global climate change, potentially driving increased droughts and flooding, is considered a compounding factor. This projects seeks to develop agri-tech solutions to help alleviate the issue of water in agriculture, and for producers to ultimately drive water use efficiency. Soil moisture directly impacts crop growth, it drives irrigation systems and once a soil has reached its holding capacity excess water rapidly runs into the drainage system, potentially impacting flood risk and system drainage capacity. One of the most significant challenges within the water debate is that there are few simple and reliable systems to measure soil moisture. It is difficult to accurately measure. Techniques developed include spot THD capacitance sensors, the use of neutron probes and more recently the use of remote sensing techniques. Currently, there is no system to measure soil moisture distribution accurately across a field, and the resolution of remote sensing has not been sufficient for agricultural application, or local water management to reduce flood risk. In this project we will bring together a suite of new technologies which increase the resolution of soil moisture measurement to render it applicable for agricultural application on a field, as well as, landscape scale.  The project will deploy two new sensors (one static, one mobile) within China that measures soil moisture content as a function of the albedo of cosmically generated fast neutrons (Cosmos sensor, designed by Hydroinova, US). The static sensor measures soil moisture within a field up to a 200m radius from the measurement point. A mesh of static sensors will be deployed within Henan and Hebei province (which produces 40% wheat of China), China. The mobile sensor will be deployed on a bespoke autonomous vehicle or rover to measure soil moisture variation within a field.  The vehicle will be developed within the project and will be the first autonomous deployment of this sensor technology. Data from the soil moisture sensors will be used to calibrate the InSARS sensor on the Sentinel-1 satellite to monitor soil moisture within China to within a 500m x 500m resolution. This is a 5-fold improvement on current resolution from SARS. Ultimately, the technology will enable near real time forecasts of soil moisture at a field scale. This information will be invaluable to agricultural producers and for flood risk forecasting, including key insights to improve water use efficiency, irrigation practices, land drainage and the implementation of precision agricultural techniques.   This is an ambitious multi disciplinary project. The project coordinates the expertise of four key groups, the University of Lincoln (robotics, mapping and deployment of autonomous vehicles), the Institute of Ecology and Agrometeorology (IEAM) of Chinese Academy of Meteorological Sciences, University of Information Science &amp;Technology, the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (Wallingford) and the School of Geography and Earth Sciences, The University of Aberystwth. Considerable focus is placed on knowledge exchange, not just with the agricultural and hydrological communities, but also between international partners within the project. We anticipate that the UK will benefit from understanding the challenges of developing sensor networks in China, with significant differences in scale and environment. The Chinese team will spend considerable periods embedded with the UK academics to learn new skills in remote sensing, sensor deployment and autonomous vehicles.</narrative>
