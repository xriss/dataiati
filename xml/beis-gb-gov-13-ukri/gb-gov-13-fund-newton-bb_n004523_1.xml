   <narrative xml:lang="EN">BBSRC Embrapa - Developing mitochondrial mediated resilience to abiotic stress during plant reproduction.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Problem: Pollen development is highly sensitive to abiotic stress, frequently resulting in failed fertilization and resultant yield losses. Production of pollen requires the extensive coordination of gene expression networks in the maternal and gametophytic pathways. These are dependent upon high-energy requirements, facilitated by increases in mitochondria number during pollen development. This project will bring together expertise in mitochondria biology and floral development to address the problem of energy demands and the need for resilience to high temperature stress during pollen development.  AIM:This project will develop resources and capability to tackle the issue of how plant reproduction is effected by heat stress. The focus will be the changes occurring during heat stress and their impact on the mitochondria and the energy sources during pollen development. Objectives: i) Analysis of the cytological changes occurring during heat and drought stress in wheat anthers. ii) RNA-seq expression analysis during heat and drought stress of wheat anthers. iii) Screening of germplasm with altered resilience to heat stress during flowering iv) Manipulation of mitochondria biogenesis and activity to develop resilience to abiotic stress Background:- Plant reproduction and the formation of viable gametes is vital to fertilisation and seed formation, which is fundamental to crop yield and food security. Population increases, combined with climate change and reduction of the available agricultural land makes it imperative that we develop sustainable, effective agricultural systems with increased yield, but less environmental impact. However, pollen development and release are extremely susceptible to extremes of temperature, with minor temperature changes having a significant effect. Climate change and variable weather patterns are currently impacting upon current cereal yield and this is likely to increase in the future. The effect of temperature stress on pollen viability therefore poses a serious threat to current and long-term crop yield, with the potential for devastating future losses if steps to develop tolerance and understanding of pollen temperature stress are not initiated. The time-scales involved mean that this is a critical issue that needs to be urgently addressed.  Wheat as a temperate crop is particularly prone to heat stress; amongst the major crop plants it has the lowest threshold temperature of 26 C, compared to rice at 34 C. The grain filling stages are very sensitive, but the reproductive phase is also particularly susceptible, resulting in reproductive sterility. Understanding how different plants cope with stress during reproduction offers the potential to identify genetic traits for manipulation to improve temperature tolerance, thus the study of high temperature stress on wheat fertility is crucial.  Production of pollen is dependent upon high levels of energy; this is characterised by a massive increase in mitochondrial numbers (~300X in the tapetum). This requirement for energy is particularly evident when there are defects in the mitochondria, resulting in pollen degeneration and Cytoplasmic Male Sterility (CMS). These lines show impaired development of the tapetum prior to pollen degeneration, a phenotype also seen in heat stressed anthers. It is not known whether the impact of heat and drought stress during male reproduction is a direct consequence of impaired mitochondrial function, or whether there is also increased sensitivity in the pollen development pathway.  Results:- This programme will address the role of mitochondria in abiotic stress resistance during plant male reproduction and will develop tools and resources to to generate wheat with resistance to high temperature and drought stress during reproduction. This will help ensure that wheat yields are maintained under changing climatic conditions and potentially enable expansion of the regions where wheat is cultivated.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project will bring together groups from the UK and Brazil who are working on different aspects of heat and drought stress, pollen development and mitochondrial function in wheat to address the molecular genetic and physiological events occurring during reproductive heat and drought stress. This will enable development of germplasm with enhanced resilience to environmental stress during flowering. University of Nottingham(UoN) -Prof ZA Wilson: Reproductive development and male fertility in wheat. Expertise in the molecular regulation of pollen development and translation of gene networks from models, to crops. This has identified conserved transcription factors, which are being explored as tools to control crop fertility for hybrid breeding. Investigation of flowering adaptations in wheat associated with flowering time, stamen structure and anther dehiscence. The impact of temperature stress of pollen development, with the target of identifying traits for resilience during temperature stress. -Prof I King &amp; Dr J King: Ancestral Introgression Programme to transfer genetic variation into wheat from its distant relatives, by transferring the entire genome of a range of species, e.g. Secale cereale, Aegilops speltoides, Ambylopyrum muticum, Triticum urartu, Thinopyrum bessarabicum, Th. elongatum, Th. intermedium, Th. ponticum, T. timopheevii, into wheat in small overlapping chromosome segments. While still at a preliminary stage derivatives carrying introgressions from this programme are already under study for a wide range of traits, e.g. tolerance to abiotic stress, chemical composition, morphological traits. -Assoc Prof J Foulkes: Resource-use efficiency in wheat: Expertise in wheat physiology- focusing on ear fertility and resource-use efficiency. Includes (i) physiological and genetic basis of ear fertility; thresholds for assimilate partitioning to the ear and alternative sinks. Novel ear-fertility genes related to increased efficiency of tillering, spikelet primordia number and floret fertility (ii) physiological and genetic basis of N-use efficiency and (iii) water-use efficiency. Brazilian Researchers - Universidade Estadual de Campinas Expertise in Molecular Genetic manipulation of Mitochondria. Paulo Arruda - (PI) Molecular biology, genetics, genomics, Natalia Verza - (post-doc) Molecular biology, metabolic engeneering Pedro Barreto - (pos-doc) Molecular Biology, genomics, mitochondrial metabolism Juliana Yassitepe -  (Embrapa researcher) Genetics Geraldo Can&#xE7;ado - (Embrapa researcher) Transgenic approaches. Infrastructure:- Biosciences, UoN has excellent research facilities, including purpose built molecular labs, imaging facilities with state-of-the art Micro-CT Imaging Facility, Controlled Environment facilities; the research environment is conducive to cutting-edge research, in a collaborative, interdisciplinary environment. ZAW is part of the Centre for Plant Integrative Biology (CPIB), a major international centre to develop dynamic and multiscale models of plant development, involving data capture on dynamic hormone fluxes; cell &amp; organ growth; gene expression, protein &amp; metabolite profiles and tissue mechanics. CPIB will provide added support for data analysis, modeling and provide a platform for data dissemination.</narrative>
