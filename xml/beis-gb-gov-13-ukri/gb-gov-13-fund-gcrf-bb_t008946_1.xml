   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The production and promotion of nutrient rich foodstuffs to address the double burden of malnutrition.</narrative>

  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Aim. The consortium&apos;s overarching goal is to improve the nutritional quality of foodstuffs &quot;globally&quot;. To achieve this goal we aim to identify and promote diverse foodstuffs that when incorporated into the diet will have immediate and long-term health benefits across populations. Our particular focus will be increasing provitamin A (beta-carotene) consumption in children. Vitamin A Deficiency (VAD) is widespread in low-income countries and prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) where 83% of children aged 2 to 5 years exhibit VAD. This results in malnutrition, 500,000 cases of blindness and 1.25 million deaths occur annually. We will achieved this goal through (i) the identification and promotion of new nutrient dense food and vegetable varieties, (ii) food processing applications for the retention and enhancement of nutrients and (iii) the promotion and education in schools and households. To achieve this ambitious aim the following objectives will be performed.  Objective 1. Survey the existing food systems to assess nutrient content. This activity will involve literature and consumer surveys performed concurrently with modern metabolomics approaches to metabolite profile the &quot;dinner plate&quot; in diverse regions and among independent households of varying financial income.  Objective 2. Identify new nutrient dense varieties and foodstuffs and there incorporation into food systems. Natural variation in tomato, amaranth, cassava and yam will be exploited to identify new varieties/germplasm with nutrient dense/enhanced chemical profiles. The feasibility of incorporating these emerging foodstuffs into the supply chain will be performed.  Objective 3. Perform home/school-based interventions to demonstrate the nutritional potential of nutritional foodstuffs. Two case studies in Nigeria and Benin will be carried out and outputs quantified to provide an assessment of healthy food interventions on households and their children.  Objective 4. Disseminate and educate the benefits and approaches to foods rich in vitamin A and other phytonutrients. Modern communication technologies such as social media, web-based portals will be used to explain findings and through on-line video demonstrate how to prepare and plan healthy meals in a cost-effective manner.  Objective 5. Training and capacity building through, short training missions, training schools and workshops. Inter and intra-disciplinary training including intersectoral activities will be promoted. Workshops, utilising co-design approaches will be carried out on an annual basis, engaging the public  (particular mothers with school children), NGOs, policy makes and multi-actors across the supply chain.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The United Nations have declared 2016 to 2025 as the decade of action to eradicate all forms of malnutrition worldwide; ensuring access to healthier and more sustainable diets for all, regardless of location and whoever they are. This brief also encompasses the double burden of malnutrition now facing most societies and characterised by the coexistence of undernutrition along with overweight, obesity or diet-related noncommunicable disease (NCDs). The proposed project &quot;NUTRIFOOD&quot; will improve the nutritional quality of diets in West Africa by identifying new nutritionally enhanced varieties of tomato, amaranth, cassava and yam; incorporating these fruits and vegetables and their derived products into the food systems will diversify the existing food basket and provide improved quality. The project will draw upon global resources and expertise, utilising unique germplasm. The tools and resources developed are generic in nature and although our focus will be Nigeria and Benin in West Africa the findings can be translated across other SSA countries and Low Medium Income countries globally.  Fruit and vegetables are rich in provitamin A. One of our key performance indicators will be the provision of foodstuffs with the potential to reduce Vitamin A Deficiency (VAD).  VAD is widespread in low-income countries and prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) where 83% of children aged 2 to 5 years exhibit VAD. As a result of this malnutrition, 500,000 cases of blindness and 1.25 million deaths occur annually. With this aim, NUTRIFOOD will focus on high provitamin A fruits and vegetables as well as the high caloric staple crops cassava and yam biofortified with provitamin A and other nutrients The processing approaches used will potentially create storable products with improved nutrient uptake. As vitamin A is essential for well-being in the first 1000 days of life and the development of children, schools and households will be target in NUTRIFOOD. In Benin and Nigeria nutritional interventions in schools will be carried out. Potentially, these studies could contribute to the alleviation of VAD and improved cognitive development in infants. Modern communication technologies and approaches will be used to communicate the advantages of healthy diets and how to generate healthy diets in a cost-effective manner. The consortium will carried out a series of workshops to which multi-actors across the supply chain will be invited. With, scientists, NGO representatives, policy makers, parents (mothers) and civil organisations involved co-design approaches to the implementation of healthy diets will be attempted and promoted.</narrative>
