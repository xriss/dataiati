  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">- Provide advanced training in skills at MSc level to a number of students from AVN countries to enable them to carry out research using the AVN. These students will be able to form the foundation of radio astronomy groups in their countries.  - provide engineering advice and assistance to those in developing countries engaged in or planning to convert defunct 30 m class telecommunication dishes in to radio telescopes.  - provide business advice to those who have received training in radio astronomy in developing countries who want to use those skills to start a business.  - provide business advice to partner institutions hosting dish conversion projects on how to commercialize the opportunities afforded by earth station locations.  - provide support for small development projects themed around astronomy to be carried out by groups of radio astronomy trainees  - Build a sustainable network of African radio astronomers who can collaborate with each other and utilize the AVN. They will also build links with both UK and SA experts in the fields of radio astronomy and related industrial fields that will lead to a sustainable collaborative network.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">We will conduct a programme in radio astronomy in Africa that will help to drive economic growth. South Africa is hosting part of the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) - the major next generation radio telescope and the first big science project on the African continent. A network of up to 2000 dishes will eventually spread out across southern Africa to give the telescope its powerful resolution to see small structures in the sky. To this aim South Africa is partnering with eight other countries in Africa that will host these outstations. However, there is virtually no astronomy activity in these countries at present and so SKA-SA are building the African VLBI Network (AVN) as a precursor instrument and very useful addition to the world&apos;s radio astronomy networks in its own right. The AVN will consist of 30 m class radio dishes in each partner country, either converted from defunct telecommunications dishes or newly built ones.   The UK team, together with SA colleagues, will provide advanced training in the form of a number of MSc bursaries to citizens of AVN partner countries. The students will undertake research training using interferometric radio telescopes. The advanced STEM skills learnt as part of this training can be applied to a range of industries such as telecommunications, space science, land management and computing.  An integral part of the training programme will be interaction with entrepreneurs who have experience of setting up businesses using related technologies.    We will fund an antenna consultant who is an expert in antenna control systems to assist with projects in Africa. For the students who have received radio astronomy training and now want to use their new skills to start up their own business we will provide business advice from an entrepreneur experienced in the field. Our business consultant previously worked for Goonhilly Earth Station Ltd in Cornwall where a project in collaboration with several UK universities is also aiming to convert large old dishes in to radio telescopes. He is therefore uniquely experienced in the synergies and business opportunities that lie at the interface of radio astronomy and the burgeoning space sector. Groups of our newest trainees will be able to carry out small development projects that utilize their astronomy knowledge. This will be overseen by experts from the International Astronomical Union&apos;s Office of Astronomy for Development.</narrative>
