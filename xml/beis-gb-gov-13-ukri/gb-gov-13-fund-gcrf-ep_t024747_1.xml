   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Risk at the Margins (RAM): a blueprint for defragmenting disaster risk reduction with populations at risk</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The burden of disasters remains grossly unequal: they disproportionately and repeatedly impact the most vulnerable populations in low- and middle- income countries. This proposal will bring a cluster of projects together to collectively address the lack of progress in disaster risk reduction (DRR) in these contexts. This lack of progress can be attributed to a lack of methods and strategies that allow people to adapt to, cope with, or avoid the accumulation of future risk while furthering sustainable development. We need a joined-up approach to develop methods and strategies that create  &apos;useful, usable and used&apos; interventions to reduce disaster risk. Integration needs to include: knowledge of the cumulative social and physical impacts of multiple hazards, the wider context (&apos;everyday risks&apos;) and processes and products that align interventions with the needs and demands of the community. The aim of this Cluster Pilot is thus to bring together fragmented groups (domains of &apos;experts&apos;) working on disaster risk and related themes to create and test a blueprint to improve how we integrate DRR into sustainable development, at the community level.  We will achieve our aim via the following objectives:  (1) Embrace and benefit from failure by using our &apos;Design Challenges&apos; within existing participatory DRR projects as a platform to excite interest in the creation or integration of technological solutions into their successful turnaround as part of equitable and participatory processes, and to understand where they are most valuable (2) Explore the value of extensive hazards as an entry-point and a bridge to help conceptually bring together those who focus on disasters and those who look at broader environmental stresses and sustainable development  (3) Deepen our understanding of the barriers to success from a transdisciplinary perspective in our existing projects (4) Calibrate these insights through reference to wider literature sources and DRR communities that discuss the inter-relation between intensive, extensive and everyday hazards in research findings, research practice and risk management implementation (5) Understand the extent to which these more joined-up initiatives generate knowledge of value to future sustainable development or planning (6) Synthesise our findings to develop a blueprint for the integration of community based DRR to be extended and deepened in both the prospective projects and beyond.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The burden of disasters remains grossly unequal: they disproportionately and repeatedly impact the most vulnerable populations in low- and middle- income countries. Thus, we wish to find a way to improve how we address community disaster risk in those contexts. Poor progress in reducing the impacts on lives, livelihoods and sustainable development that natural hazards have on populations in developing countries has been attributed to a weak focus on &apos;prospective practice&apos; in addressing resilience to  multiple hazards.  In other words  a lack of methods and strategies that allow people to adapt to, cope with or avoid the accumulation of future risk while undergoing sustainable development.  Current academic and development practices are largely siloed, which means they focus on individual hazards, or approaches that are either focussed on understanding and warning people about the hazards, or on understanding how communities can be vulnerable and acting to change that. For example, hazard specialists often frame their analysis of risks &apos;upstream&apos; on the basis of physical drivers rather than &apos;downstream&apos; on social and environmental impacts. Those whose analysis focuses on vulnerability outcomes can overlook the way that hazards can change and radically reshape the nature of exposure. This fragmentation creates situations where problems and solutions commonly are not effectively aligned, and it becomes much harder for populations at risk to implement strategies that adapt, cope with or avoid future risk (prospective practice). This problem remains despite a growing recognition of the value that interdisciplinary engagement would bring in solving this.  We aim to address this by bringing together a wide grouping of GCRF and other related projects to drop the disconnect between scientific-technical solutions to disaster risk and projects that address the fundamental social vulnerabilities (the first stage). We will use this in order to develop methods and strategies that encourage prospective practice (to develop in the second stage). We will use the lens of extensive hazards to address this challenge during the first stage. Extensive hazards (those experienced for long periods or more intensely in smaller geographic areas - e.g. drought, ashfall, landsliding, pollution) can generate negative outcomes that are more damaging to sustainable development than infrequent high cost events, particularly for populations with other vulnerabilities. We think that extensive hazards need a multi-hazard approach to their characterisation and monitoring, and that their mitigation could be considered from the point of view of their impacts on the local populations: they need a joined up approach. We will begin by focussing on three &apos;design challenges&apos; in places where we understand the social, political and cultural context and have identified projects that could benefit from this joined-up approach. These are in Nepal, St Vincent and Ecuador and, importantly, will be grounded by community groupings in situ. We will evaluate how we answer that and wrap around a broader review of the integration gap and how, why and when it is important to overcome. These processes will create &apos;a safe space&apos; where we can discuss failures as well as successes and air suspicions arising from different ways of working, experiences or perspectives. We will create new solutions in our focus areas, and synthesise the findings across the project (by working together and the consultation represented in the review). This develops a blueprint for prospective practice that will understand how to: (1) monitor, characterise and mitigate extensive hazard from the perspective of those who experience them; (2) how to situate extensive hazards in the context of everyday risk challenges and policies for sustainable development. We will use this in the second stage project and to inform two new projects that begin during our first stage.</narrative>
