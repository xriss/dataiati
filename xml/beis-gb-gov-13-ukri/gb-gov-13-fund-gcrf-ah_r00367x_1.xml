   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Roles of IP and Diversity in the Creative Industries</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The creative and cultural industries have been the focus of policy attention in both South Africa and the UK over recent decades.  A common theme is the contribution that the creative industries can make to wealth creation.  Two issues lie at the heart of the debate: the first is how intellectual property (IP) might be used by the creative industries, and the second is around how participation in the creative industries could be more diverse and inclusive.  These are linked as both address sustainability of the sector through the potential for direct economic return and deepening of social and cultural representation.   This network seeks to address these debates by bringing together researchers, creative industries participants and representatives, IP practitioners and early career researchers from South Africa and the UK to explore similarities and differences between the regulation of IP, and of equality and diversity in the creative industries.  The network is interested in how the protection of indigenous knowledge as IP in South Africa might impact on trade with the UK (and Europe), how diversity and equality policies play out in practice, and how different cultural traditions may have different impacts on both IP and diversity and equality in the creative industries.   The network will come together three times: the first in London where the meeting will be timed to coincide with a major cultural industries event such as a Remix Summit.  The second network meeting will take place in Grahamstown in South Africa to coincide with the National Arts Festival and during which the network will participate in the Thinkfest.  The third network meeting will also be in South Africa and will be an open meeting to which a range of stakeholders will be invited and at which the network will disseminate its findings.  Outputs of the network will include:   A peer-reviewed paper co-authored by network members addressing the findings from the network and containing a case study comparing diversity in the creative industries and the place of IP in the creative process as between the UK and South Africa, illustrating the possibilities and challenges faced, and policy implications.   Three think papers and policy briefs for creative industry decision-takers and policy-makers on the place of IP in the creative process with comparative observations on diversity in the creative and cultural industries. These will be short, provocative, forward-looking documents based on insights from the meetings.   Online resources and media including a website, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook and six &apos;talking heads&apos; explaining in clear and accessible terms and to a general audience the purpose of the network and of its outcomes.  A Thinkfest event in South Africa organised to coincide with the National Arts Festival, Grahamstown.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The overall aims of this network are to:  1)      consider the extent to which the findings from UK and EU research projects investigating the role of intellectual property in the micro creative industries might be useful for informing South African policy and practice, and to consider ways in which the protection of indigenous knowledge and traditional knowledge  in South Africa might impact on cultural industries&apos; trade with the UK (and Europe), and how, if at all, that might inform policy-making in England; 2)      investigate and compare the extent to which different regulatory frameworks on diversity and equality between South Africa and the UK impact on participation in the micro creative industries; 3)      consider if, and how, the different cultural traditions as between South Africa and the UK in relation to intellectual property and diversity policy as they impact on the micro creative industries, might inform policy-making in the respective jurisdictions with a view to strengthening sustainable development.  The objective is to inform policy-making in both South Africa and the UK in relation to IP and diversity strategies for the micro creative industries and international trade.  It is also to create strong and lasting conversations among academic researchers, creative industry participants, policy-makers and practitioners across South Africa and the UK; and to foster new academic links between South Africa and the UK through which new research proposals can emerge.  This project, and subsequent ones arising out of network activities will also help to strengthen understanding of, and adoption of good practice around IP and diversity by arts and cultural practitioners, thus ensuring greater sustainability for this sector.  The network aims to disseminate findings to creative industry participants, policy makers, IP practitioners and the general public through:  1)      Invited attendance and participation at the three network meetings; 2)      Three think papers and policy briefs for creative industry decision-takers and policy-makers on the place of IP in the creative process with comparative observations on diversity in the creative and cultural industries. These will be short, provocative, forward-looking documents based on insights from the meetings and qualitative interviews with creative industry participants; 3)      Online resources and media including a website, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook and six &apos;talking heads&apos; explaining in clear and accessible terms and to a general audience the purpose of the network and of its outcomes; 4)      Participation in a Thinkfest event in South Africa organised to coincide with the National Arts Festival, Grahamstown.</narrative>
