   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Engaging Grassroots Perspectives on Health and Well Being in Northeast Thailand and Lao PDR</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In the UK cholangiocarcinoma - known as CCA, or bile duct cancer - is classified as a rare cancer, affecting only around 2000 or so people each year. In parts of mainland Southeast Asia, however, and especially in Northeast Thailand (Isan) and Lao PDR, it is among the most common cancers to be diagnosed. Doctors treating the disease at Khon Kaen hospital in Isan witness a regional burden in excess of 20,000 cases per year, while estimates of those suffering from the disease in Lao PDR are even higher. The prevalence of CCA in mainland Southeast Asia is predominantly caused by widespread infection with liver fluke that results from the deeply culturally embedded practice across this relatively impoverished region of consuming raw and partially cooked freshwater (cyprinid) fish as a ready source of cheap and sustainable protein. To date public health campaigns in Thailand have been largely characterised by a top-down approach, in keeping with a more widespread, hierarchical social structure that tends to place rural citizens as socially inferior. This is reflected in interpersonal relations where open self-expression and agency among grassroots communities in formal contexts, such as engagement with local authorities, education and health officials has tended to be impeded. Furthermore, the relationship that pertains between the Thai state, centred in Bangkok, and the peripheral, rural hinterland of Isan and neighbouring Laos is one of inequality, with the former deeming the latter to be culturally and civilisationally inferior. As a result, for over the past 50 years public health campaigns against the consumption of raw and fermented fish have had limited effect. This proposal therefore aims to explore innovative and effective ways in which the voices of those deemed at risk of developing CCA can be expressed and listened to and carefully heard on their own terms. Its intended outcome is to find meaningful ways in which local communities in Isan and Lao PDR can contribute to and direct their own public health interventions in ways that are most meaningful to their everyday realities and health priorities. We therefore propose to engage with those at risk of CCA in innovative and creative ways to develop broader, contextual understandings of health in relation to a range of related issues driven by the communities in the affected areas. Through a series of community-focussed workshops led by local filmmakers, artists, writers and poets and mediated by local NGOs and academics, this project invites grassroots expression of important daily concerns on the following themes: perceptions and interpretations of well being; life priorities and approaches to risk; diet and nutrition; definitions and significance of cultural and regional identity; and experience and understandings of the physical body in relation to both mundane and spiritual practice. The resulting artworks produced in the workshops - short films, drawings, paintings and pieces of creative writing and reportage - will form the basis of an exhibition that will tour the schools and hospitals of the region as well as having a more interactive presence on social media (Facebook and Line). Taken together, the workshops and exhibition aim to trigger a wider appreciation of bottom-up perspectives on the specific healthcare issues facing the region as well as the more general context of health and wellbeing in which those issues appear. The potential benefits will be in feeding this important, yet formerly little heard and acknowledged grassroots voice, into more effective public health campaigning and policy making in Thailand and Lao PDR with reference to CCA and other healthcare concerns (such as diet related diabetes, hypertension and heart disease).</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The principal objective of this proposal is to open up new avenues of self-representation for rural citizens at risk of developing disease and experiencing ill health, in the broadest sense of that term, in Northeast Thailand (Isan) and Lao PDR. Given the impediments to self-expression that pertain in relation to a range of topics, our primary objective is to explore innovative opportunities for the expression of grassroots voices in Isan and Lao PDR through direct engagement with local artists, writers, poets and filmmakers.   - Objective 1 is to run a series of creative arts workshops in February/March with local communities in Isan and Lao PDR to empower modes of self-expression among their members. These workshops will be led by named authors, artists and filmmakers and will be further facilitated by named local NGOs in Thailand. The 2 fine art workshops and the 5 writing workshops will last for 2 days each; and the 4 filmmaking workshops will last for 3 days. All workshops will comprise village participants across a range ages, with total numbers of 10-20 participants per workshop.  - Objective 2 is to invite sharing of ideas and experiences through open discussion on the last day of each workshop between art makers and art facilitators, NGOs and academics.  - Objective 3 is to select at the end of March, with the permission of the art makers, a range of works that can become part of a touring exhibition to have a wider impact on the region and the stakeholders concerned. - Objective 4 is to open the exhibition in conjunction with Workshop 2 of AH/R00613X/1 in April 2019 so that the former constitutes one of the foci of discussions among academic researchers at the workshop. This will allow for the careful consideration of the content of the artworks in terms of their implications for healthcare strategies and policy making with direct reference to the specific health problem of opishorchiasis (OV or liver fluke infection) and bile duct cancer (CCA) in the region; but also with wider relevance to other healthcare initiatives and challenges in the region. The presence at the workshop of named UK charity AMMF as well as NHS colleagues such as Co-I Taylor Robinson on AH/R00613X/1 will also encourage consideration of a grassroots, creative approach to public health initiatives in the UK. - Objective 5 is to tour the exhibition from April to the end of June in approximately 10 schools and hospitals across Isan, in Pakse in Southern Lao PDR and in the capital Vientiane facilitated by local NGOs and key stakeholders. Research assistant Srikhaw will interview exhibition visitors and collate a report on viewer responses to precisely monitor impact. - Objective 6 is to extrapolate from the experiences of the workshops themselves together with the responses to the touring exhibition what lessons can be learned in terms of implications for future public health interventions in the region and beyond. This will be considered at a meeting between all stakeholders in Khon Kaen, Thailand in June 2019 at CASCAP (the Cholangiocarcinoma Screening and Care Program) under Khuntikeo, who is another Co-I on AH/R00613X/1. The exhibition will then be handed to CASCAP for display in their own peripatetic screening programme in the region. - Objective 7 is to extrapolate from the experience of the FoF project in Thailand and Lao PDR what implications this has for public health interventions pertaining to CCA and OV in the wider region of mainland Southeast Asia and to share the results as part of the agenda of the final workshop (3) of AH/R00613X/1 - Objective 8 is to place ourselves in a position at the close of the FoF project to draw on the lessons learned from this pilot engagement in order to develop a larger public-health related engagement project in conjunction with creative artists in other parts of the world beyond Southeast Asia, and including the UK.</narrative>
