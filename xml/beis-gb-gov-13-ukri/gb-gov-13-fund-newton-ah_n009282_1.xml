   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Heliopolis was arguably the first truly modern suburb in Africa, yet is not a threatened heritage asset.  Its old cosmopolitan communities are gradually breaking up, its buildings decay and fall and even its historic electric tramway is about to disappear.  Its contribution to the making of modern Egypt is little understood outside a few university specialists and old residents.  As traditional populations move away from the suburb, the oral histories and stories of Heliopolis are lost forever.  This project, therefore, seeks to capture the rich, storied history of Heliopolis through the memories of the many families and communities who have called it their home.  The project seems to raise awareness of what is threatened and what we have already lost.  It seeks to develop a collaboration between academics, residents and community activists to preserve the tangible and intangible heritage of the area in a sustainable form.  It also seeks to raise awareness of the wider threats to Egypt&apos;s modern heritage, a heritage that is often hidden and neglected in a country with such a long and rich history.  This, it is hoped, will be a model for other community heritage project across Egypt and one which will help ordinary people appreciate the buildings and storied landscape that surrounds them.  The project will address the life of the great buildings of Heliopolis - the Empain palace, the Basilica and the Heliopolis Palace Hotel - but it will also examine the buildings and places that gave Heliopolis its everyday human stories.  This history will be a history of tram stations, cafes, crumbling hotels, fish markets, dive bars and cinemas.  It will the story of the doorman, shoe-shine boys, the flower sellers, the donkey cabbies, the rubbish collectors, the car-repair men, the juice sellers, the shop keepers, the waiters, the rent collectors all those who gave life to the buildings of the suburb.  It will reveal a positive and cosmopolitan vision of Egypt, one in which those of different nationalities and religions of a suburb live together in peace and mutual respect.  It will reveal a history that future citizens can be proud of and one which they might cherish.</narrative>
