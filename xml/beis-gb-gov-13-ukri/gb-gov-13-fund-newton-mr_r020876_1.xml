   <narrative xml:lang="EN">A scalable solution for delivery of Diabetes Self-Management Education in Thailand</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The health and economic consequences of Type 2 diabetes mellitus are largely attributable to its complications, which can be prevented or delayed by good disease control, achieved through medical care and self-management. Diabetes Self-Management Education (DSME) programs are effective and cost-effective, and part of standard care in high-income countries, but are unavailable in Thai healthcare system, despite universal coverage of medical aspects of diabetes care. Negative perceptions of educational programs, sustained by a lack of high quality local data, and concerns about burden on existing staff time and costs are thought to be responsible.   Given the focus on community based education for chronic diseases in recent primary healthcare reforms, it is timely to scale-up DSME in Thailand, if an affordable model of delivery for a locally-tailored intervention can be found. Taking this opportunity, we propose to work in close collaboration with the Thai Ministry of Public Health to develop, pilot and evaluate a peer-based DSME program and delivery model, finally producing a list of policy recommendations for optimal integration into the Thai healthcare system.  Our overall aim is to identify a scalable model for delivery of DSME across Thailand.  Our specific project objectives are: 1. To design a prototype of the DSME intervention 2. To refine the intervention prototype and trial design 3. To evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the intervention under two alternative modes of delivery (nurse-led and peer-led)  4. To identify the &apos;best buy&apos; model for scale-up of DSME delivery in the Thai health system  Our primary hypothesis is that either model of DSME delivery will be effective and cost-effective, but the peer-led model will be a more scalable option for the Thai health system.  The two key research gaps in scientific literature we aim to address are:  a) Clinical and cost-effectiveness of DSME programs in low- and middle-income countries, specifically Thailand b) Role of peer programs in supporting complex behaviour change generally, and its implementation in low- and middle-income settings specifically.   The main expected outcomes are:  a) Development of a fully worked-up rapidly scalable model for DSME delivery in Thailand;  b) Capacity building of emerging Thai researchers and practitioners (nurses, village health volunteers) in the science and delivery of complex behavioural interventions, which could be expanded to other chronic conditions; c) Long-term collaborative research links between UK and Thai researchers.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Type 2 diabetes is a leading health problem in Thailand, with over 4 million adults living with the chronic condition in 2015. If the disease is not managed properly, it can lead to severe complications (e.g. heart disease, kidney disease, loss of sight) and even death. In addition, there are steep costs to the Thai economy - treating diabetes and its complications consumes over 10% of all healthcare spending, and many people with diabetes have to stop work due to the condition.  To successfully manage diabetes and prevent its negative consequences, education and lifestyle counselling are prescribed as standard in many countries, supported by research evidence. Such programs (known as Diabetes Self-Management Education, DSME) help people by giving them motivation and skills to lead a healthier lifestyle, monitor warning signs for complications, follow complex medication regimes, and manage the stress of having diabetes. In Thailand, people suffering from diabetes are not currently offered any DSME services by the national health system, which means that management of diabetes is poor and rates of complications are high. The reason for this gap in service is partly the lack of a DSME program proven to work in Thailand, but also government concerns over affordability and feasibility of offering such a program at national level. To overcome these barriers, we propose to develop a new low-cost DSME program for people living with diabetes in Thailand, test that it works in a trial, and also find out how it can be made affordable for the government to provide it to everyone.  The DSME program will be delivered as monthly meetings led by community health volunteers and nurses, aided by a short films about living with diabetes, to introduce key topics. These films will be produced in Thailand featuring real patients, in collaboration with award-winning charity Medical Aid Films (www.medicalaidfilms.org). The education and skills training will be followed by an open discussion session to discuss common challenges and solutions, set lifestyle goals and seek advice. We will develop the content of the DSME program through working closely with health care workers and patient groups, testing our initial version and refining it, based on observing what works and what doesn&apos;t work. Then we will test its effectiveness in a trial, by randomly assigning 15 community hospitals to offer all newly diagnosed persons either a) DSME program delivered by community health volunteers, b) DSME program delivered by nurses, or c) usual care (no DSME program). After one year, we will compare the control of blood glucose and risk of heart disease between patients of hospitals with and without the DSME program. We predict that in hospitals receiving the DSME program, management of diabetes will be better than in those without any program, and that both nurses and community health volunteers will be able to deliver it effectively.  Alongside the main trial, we will collect data from participants and health care workers (through interviews) on their responses to the program and why and how it helped to improve diabetes management. Understanding these processes is vital to be able to adapt the program for other countries, making use of lessons learnt in Thailand. We will collect data on the costs involved with each part of the DSME program, and use it to identify the most affordable way of providing DSME in the Thai health system (we suspect it will be DMSE provided by community health volunteers). We will summarize all these results into policy recommendations, to be used by our collaborators at the Ministry of Public Health to decide whether and how to deliver the DSME program to the whole country. If adopted, the program has huge potential to improve the lives of people with diabetes and contribute to Thailand&apos;s continued economic growth and development.</narrative>
