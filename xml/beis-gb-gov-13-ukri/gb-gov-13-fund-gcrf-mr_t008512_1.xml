   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The human gut microbiome as the key link between childhood malnutrition and risk of metabolic disorders in later life in south India</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Our research aims to understand how the infant intestinal microbiome affects malnutrition, growth trajectories and the subsequent risk of developing metabolic disorders such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease, among children and young adults in southern India.  India is the second most populous country in the world, and whilst having a huge burden of malnutrition is now also facing a rapidly growing problem of obesity and non-communicable diseases, in particular metabolic disorders. India ranks second in the global diabetes epidemic. Westernisation of diet, increasing affluence and urbanisation are believed to be major causes for this increase in rates of diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. However, this burden is also shifting towards younger people, those less affluent and rural populations.  Studies have shown that the first 1000 days of life are key to determining both stunting and obesity. This early period also coincides with development of the infant&apos;s intestinal microbiome. Our research puts the gut microbiome as the likely mechanistic link between nutrition in early life and metabolic health in adulthood. There is some strong evidence for this hypothesis.  Studies have shown marked differences in the intestinal microbiota composition in malnourished individuals compared to healthy ones. Short chain fatty acids, which are produced by bacterial fermentation from non-digestible sugars in the diet, are major energy sources. Recent studies have shown distinct microbiota profiles in undernourished compared to obese children and that the gut microbiome composition of children at 2 years of age has the potential to identify those that are at risk of obesity. Some of the bacteria that inhabit the intestine are responsible for inflammatory responses, which are linked to risk of metabolic disorders such as diabetes, and gut microbiome alterations are associated with insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes. Gut microbes are also able to produce chemical substances linked to the development of cardiovascular diseases.   Our research proposes to investigate the following questions: (1) Are growth trajectories in Indian children linked to their microbiome profiles? (2) Can we identify key changes in the microbiota profiles that correspond with changes between normal and stunted growth states? (3) What is the role of enteric infection on microbiome profiles and on chronic inflammation as a marker of risk of metabolic disease in later life? (4) Can we identify key aspects of the microbiome profiles that translate into changes in metabolic markers of risk of disease leading to a pathway for intervention?  To conduct this research, we will make use of an extensive collection of clinical samples and data already collected from a cohort of 300 children recruited at birth in Vellore, Southern India, and followed up into adolescence. We will define the gut microbiome profiles over time using stored stool samples, measure markers of risk of metabolic disease using stored blood, and investigate how the results differ according to their growth trajectories. We will continue to follow up this cohort into adulthood to gather additional information and measurements to assess the onset or risk of obesity and metabolic disorders.   Our work aims to provide evidence that malnutrition and associated metabolic disorders are linked to gut microbiome profiles from a very early age. Malnutrition may then be controlled, or its effects modified, by modulating the gut microbiota, and therefore lead to the development of effective therapeutic interventions. Finding solutions to tackle malnutrition will have far-reaching impact; Prevention or correction of malnutrition can lead to improving cognitive development and therefore contribute to breaking the cycle between malnutrition and poverty with far-reaching societal and economic impact in low and middle-income countries.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed research (full application) will aim to understand the role of early infant intestinal microbiome establishment on growth trajectories and the development of different types of malnutrition and subsequent risk of NCDs, specifically, metabolic disorders, in southern India.  The objectives of the research are to investigate: 1. The link between growth trajectories in Indian children and their intestinal microbiome. 2. How transitions between normal and stunted states relate to intestinal microbiome changes. 3. How early intestinal microbiota profiles and enteric infections define chronic inflammation and drive the risk of metabolic disease in later life. 4. How and for how long  intestinal microbiota profiles are altered by enteric pathogen infections. 5. Key features of the intestinal microbiota profiles that translate into changes in metabolic markers and could indicate a pathway for intervention. We will leverage biological samples and extensive anthropometric data available from a birth cohort in Vellore, Southern India. The cohortof 300 subjects enrolled at birth and followed up intensively for the first 3 years of life, and subsequently at 5, 7 and 11 years and each year subsequently (currently 16 years of age).  This cohort is resident in an area where demographic surveillance on the large population of approximately 45,000 urban individuals has identified increasing rates of obesity in women in the last decade, mirroring a rapid transition to increasing NCDs in urban India Preliminary analysis using a modelling approach for growth trajectories has already identified three main trajectories in the first three years of life and from infancy to adolescence. Some infants remained within normal growth parameter from birth to 3 years of age, a significant proportion that started life stunted remained stunted at the age of 3 and a third group that were born with normal weight transitioned to being stunted by the age of three. Form 3 years of age to adolescence there we those that remained within normal parameters, those that were chronically stunted and a third group transitioned from stunting to healthy weight. We will use the extensive stool sample collection to describe the microbiome (via 16S RNA sequencing) among subjects that have followed distinct growth trajectories. Extensive data on rotavirus and other enteric virus infections throughout the first 3 years of life already exists, and we propose to compliment this by evaluating frequency of infection with Shigella, enteroaggregative E coli, Campylobacter, and Giardia, recently identified as key pathogens associated with malnutrition. We will use existing plasma samples to measure markers of nutrition, and well as markers associated with risk of metabolic disorders from infancy through to childhood and adolescence. In addition, we will follow up the cohort prospectively as the enter adulthood, to asses evolution of markers of metabolic disorders and other risk factors such as family antecedents of obesity, metabolic disease and dietary information through administration of questionnaires. Due to the role of host genetics in malnutrition, obesity and risk of NCDs, we propose to conduct SNP genotyping.  For the development award we will undertake the following activities: 1. Analysis of enteric infection data against growth trajectories from the main long-term cohort. 2. Preliminary analysis utilising exiting microbiome data for another cohort study in Vellore for which we also have inflammatory markers and anthropometry for up to 1 year of age, with the aim to produce preliminary data that will enable detailed study design for the full proposal. 3. Review of the availability of host genetic control data for this population for meaningful interpretation of the host genotyping data.  4. Assessment of the potential to include the study of epigenetic factors in the prospective follow up.  5. Investigator workshop and submission of full application.</narrative>
