   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Effects of air pollution on cardiopulmonary disease in urban and peri-urban residents in Beijing</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In the last few decades China&apos;s rising energy requirements have led to increased air pollution emissions from coal-fired power plants. Its motorized transport growth is the fastest in the world with the number of motor vehicles projected to quadruple in the next two decades, reaching over 380 million by 2030. Meanwhile, nearly half of all Chinese still cook and heat their homes with highly polluting biomass and coal fuels. The resulting particulate matter (PM) concentrations in the majority of Chinese cities routinely exceed the World Health Organization&apos;s (WHO) annual Air Quality Guideline of 10 microgrammes/m3 by a factor of 10 or more.   Epidemiologic studies undertaken in China increasingly confirm links between poor air quality and a range of health risks previously observed in the West. Moreover, they confirm that the number of Chinese that are vulnerable to air pollution is increasing, as evidenced by a large and growing burden of disease from chronic non-communicable diseases - such as ischemic heart disease (IHD), cerebrovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and cancer. Research to enhance the understanding of the impact of environmental exposures on human health is needed to influence both government policy on pollution and also individual behaviours.  The outcomes of the research described in this proposal will extend our understanding of the impact of air pollution on human health to a megacity in the world&apos;s largest country and promote evidence-based policies that in turn may greatly improve the health and quality of life of China&apos;s ageing population - both of which are important sustainable development aims.  Working closely with Chinese scientists we will recruit a panel of 240 subjects from urban and peri-urban Beijing. Subjects will be recruited from two existing populations cohorts (PRC-USA and INTERMAP) ensuring a rich source of baseline data and stored samples for access. Across the project period we will obtain detailed information on the current health status of the subjects, details of the personal exposure to air pollution and biosamples for biomarker analysis.   The UK has been at the heart of the scientific study of air pollution issues over many decades, whereas such scientific studies are much newer in China. Although the Chinese teams have developed a high level of expertise in some areas, the UK team will provide strong complementary expertise, in particular in personal exposure air pollution measurements and biomarker analysis. Inherent throughout however is the synergistic combination of Chinese expertise and capability, complementary UK air quality instrumentation and health expertise. Therefore, this project will serve as a new platform to further enhance the research capacity of the Chinese teams in air pollution and its impact on health, which will leave a legacy beyond the project lifetime, thus contributing to the continuous improvement of life and welfare of more than a billion people.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The aim of this project is to enhance our understanding of the impact of air pollution on cardiopulmonary disease in residents in urban and peri-urban Beijing.  We will utilise novel personal air pollution measurement technologies in a panel of residents selected from two well established cohorts with a wealth of baseline data. We will utilise a biomarker of response approach to determine internal signatures of exposure in panel members across different seasons and finally we plan to work with investigators selected to represent the other 3 themes to ensure we have access to highly detailed pollution measurements and models outputs for our work.  In this project we will address the following scientific objectives:  Objective 1: To establish two panels comprising of 125 subjects each from the PRC-USA and INTERMAP cohorts with the aim of reassessing seasonal differences in cardiopulmonary risk factors.  Objective 2:  To use personal air pollution monitors to assess exposure to key health related pollutants and to assess exposure mis-classification when central monitor and/or modelled exposure estimates are made in inner and outer Beijing.   Objective 3:  To assess the association between air pollution exposure and key cardiopulmonary measures.</narrative>
