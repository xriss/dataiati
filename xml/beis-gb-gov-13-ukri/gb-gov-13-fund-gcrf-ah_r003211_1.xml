  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The &apos;Urban Heritage and Digital Humanities in India&apos; Research Network will develop the considerable potential of Digital Humanities technologies for the documentation, promotion and conservation of heritage in dynamic urban environments. The network will consist of three inter-related events to bring together historians, heritage professionals, geographers, architects, computer scientists, amateur activists and the public in India and the UK. The network will adress the conservation of tangible and intangible heritage in Delhi. Delhi&apos;s extraordinarily rich and complex heritage is held under a range of, often complex, state and private custodies. The city is also a rapidly changing urban environment in which physical transformation, formal and informal, and concomitant social and economic change within localities places heritage under persistent pressure. This project will take an integrated approach to the physical fabrics of the past and will encompass monuments protected by legislation and fragmented physical remains that are embedded within living urban environments. The network will be particularly concerned with the range of intangible heritages - memory, oral lore and song - which enrich and animate the pasts of the city. A key aim of the project will be to promote awareness, engagement and dialogue about the heritage of the city among those who live around fragments of the physical past.   The Project Partners for the Research Network are the Delhi Chapter of the Indian National Trust for Art and Culture Heritage, The Centre for Community Knowledge based at Ambedkar University Delhi and the 1947 Partition Archive Project. These Project Partners have a wealth of knowledge about the city&apos;s past, and present, and will provide experience and expertise in tangible and intangible heritage documentation and conservation. The Research Network will promote the potential of digital technologies to enhance and integrate documentation, conservation and engagement work. The workshops will consider the potential and the challenges associated with the use of digital technologies and media for the conservation, sustainability, custodial and access rights in relation to tangible and intangible heritage. The network aims to build capacity in Digital Humanities technologies. Practical, hands-on software training in GIS mapping, digital conversion, statistical and corpus linguistic analysis will form a core component of the two workshops to be held in Delhi in September 2017 and August 2019.   A key outcome of the project is the creation of a prototype smart phone app - SHARC Dilli - that will create interactive maps of heritage in the city. The geomapping app will be configured from geomapping software developed in the School of Computing and Communications at Lancaster University and will be developed collaboratively by the Research Network at workshop events in Delhi and Lancaster. Geomapping has particular potential in Delhi, a city in which heritage is richly layered, and often obscured, within rapidly changing urban environments. The app will map textual, visual and aural information against particular localities in the city to provide heritage-place stories and to connect monuments, memories and remains which are spatially dispersed across the city. Geospatial mapping captures the complexity of everyday understandings of urban spaces and their pasts and can, uniquely, encompass the multiple meanings that characterise the dynamic richness of urban history. The app will be designed in Hindi and English to promote awareness, discussion and, in turn, protection for a range of tangible and intangible heritage across the city. As a prototype, the app will provide located textual, visual and aural information about the refugee occupation of various heritage buildings in the city during and after the Partition of British and Princely India in 1947.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The principal objectives of the Research Network are:  1. Create a sustainable network of scholars, professionals and activists in India and the UK interested in developing digital approaches to India&apos;s and, in particular, Delhi&apos;s tangible and intangible cultural heritage, 2. Build capacity in India in Digital Humanities methodologies to deal with heritage documentation, conservation and engagement in challenging urban environments, 3. Develop and launch a prototype app that geomaps heritage as means of transforming heritage management and public engagement in Delhi, 4.     Maximise engagement between local communities and tangible and intangible heritage in dynamic and diverse urban contexts using heritage as a cultural and economic asset, 5. Work towards future projects using the capacity and &apos;proof of concept&apos; prototype heritage App (SHARC Dilli) established through the Research Network.    1. The Research Network will bring together a multidisciplinary network of historians, heritage professionals, architects, archaeologists and geographers to explore the potential of Digital Humanities methodologies for the documentation and conservation of urban heritage. The use of Digital Humanities methodologies will allow a broad, integrated approach to heritage that will encompass a range of heritages held under a range of public and private custodies. The network will draw together registered and protected monuments, physical fragments embedded in living neighbourhoods and intangible forms of heritage.   2. The specific needs of heritage organisations in relation to Digital Humanities technologies will be identified. Three events will be held during the 18-month life-span of the project: one in the UK and two in Delhi. These events will explore heritage applications of specific software for the creation of robust, integrated systems of documentation, archiving and analysis of diverse heritage materials. The workshops will provide training in specific software applications (geomapping, corpus linguistics, tabular analysis) and will address broader infrastructural and organisational challenges associated with the creation of integrated and sustainable digitisation projects.  3. Public engagement will be central to the work of the network. The network will develop India&apos;s first heritage app: SHARC Dilli. This native app for smart phones will create immersive, on-line, mobile experiences and off-line explorations of textual, visual and aural information about Delhi&apos;s heritage. The objective of the network in developing SHARC Dilli is to engage new and diverse publics in dialogues about Delhi&apos;s tangible and intangible pasts.  The prototype app will collate a range of information about the displacement of hundreds of thousands of people in the city during and after the Partition in 1947. In cities like Delhi, which have gone through several, often jarring, discontinuities - refugee influxes, changes of jurisdiction and changing official nomenclatures of place - digital mapping offers a unique means to both coalesce and communicate these many pasts as valued cultural heritage.   4. Heritage awareness can create significant place-values within urban localities. The network will explore the digitisation of tangible and intangible heritage from across the urban landscape with the objective of promoting engagement with and dialogue about heritage within the dynamic and diverse urban environs of the city. Those living within heritage localities will be engaged as stakeholders in the development of strategies for the documentation and protection of urban heritage.  5. The network will provide a platform for innovative collaborations between governmental and non-governmental heritage professionals, academics and heritage advocates with the aim of generating original and longer-term impact-orientated projects in India and in the UK.</narrative>
