   <narrative xml:lang="EN">1) Develop ambitious and impactful research agendas on justice and development in FCAS. The primary objective of the network is to develop collaborative research projects to address the most pressing knowledge gaps around justice and development in FCAS, and to apply for funding to pursue these projects. The network activities will enable a critical and creative rethinking of existing research foci and methods to generate new and emancipatory research streams that cross disciplinary and professional divides. Workshops in the case sites (Colombia, Sri Lanka, Lebanon [for Syria] and Uganda) will generate research agendas through engagement with diverse recent scholarship (by network participants and others) on development and the political economy of justice in transitioning states, and via the identification of alternative sources of knowledge in stakeholder communities. Central to achieving objective 1 is the involvement of project partners from the case sites. Advocacy organisations in these states have long recognised the interactions and tensions between justice and development work, despite academics tending to theorise and research justice and development in isolation. Learning from those who are trying to campaign for, build or strengthen justice institutions in the context of a variety of development challenges, and from their target populations, will lead to research agendas which can deliver practical findings. The focus of the network on four cases will enable participants to co-produce research projects to confront specific challenges in these states and also to identify scope for comparative research. 2) Synthesise, map and disseminate existing knowledge and identify knowledge gaps. To map the existing knowledge base and identify gaps, resources have been allocated to gather and review academic and non-academic research, as well as material such as visual representations and works of fiction. This mapping will include links to current research projects underway within and outside the network to provide the fullest possible picture of existing work, and to expose gaps. Gaps will also be exposed by engaging with the perspectives of less powerful stakeholders in the case sites. The research map, and links to all open access material, will be made available publicly to academics and non-academic stakeholders via a resource centre on the network website. The resource centre will be interactive, enabling users to suggest additional material to be included to ensure it stays up to date. Non-academic stakeholders often have research resources to generate knowledge on the cases that they are actively engaged in, but have limited exposure to developing theoretical and empirical work on comparable cases or the field more broadly, which the resource centre will provide.  3) Foster interdisciplinary engagement through relationship and capacity building. The primary activities of the network are four workshops at which all network participants will meet. The workshops will include both structured and less formal meetings to enable participants to build durable and self-sustaining relationships. The workshops will also build capacity by facilitating research users and academics to engage with the latest conceptual and applied scholarship, to develop expertise in designing and implementing research agendas. Participants will also develop their interdisciplinary skills through exposure to alternative approaches to their field of study and opportunities to collaborate across disciplinary and professional boundaries. In addition, exchange visits, PhD student meetings and an informal mentoring programme within the network will build capacity outside the workshop settings. 4) Engage policy makers, advocacy groups and publics in the case sites and elsewhere. Engagement, including with more marginalised stakeholders, is central to the success of the network. The impact summary gives full details of how it will be achieved.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">One of the most pressing challenges for many developing countries is how to achieve and maintain peace. Conflict makes development in any form (economic growth; poverty reduction; increased human rights protection) extremely difficult to achieve. This has been recognised by international organisations and aid donors, and much development assistance is now directed to conflict resolution in Fragile and Conflict Affected States (FCAS). This network focuses on one of the main ways in which states and the international community now approach conflict resolution: the promotion of justice initiatives. The use of &apos;transitional justice&apos; (TJ), including trials, commissions of inquiry, reparations and amnesties, has increased markedly since the 1990s, with justice seen as a way to end conflict and achieve societal reconciliation. Academic and donor work has attempted to assess the impact of TJ on peace and development, but has produced inconclusive, even contradictory results. This leaves a significant research gap, and a pressing need to fill it as donors increasingly fund justice projects as part of development agendas, and policy makers and advocacy groups seek to achieve justice for, and promote the welfare of, conflict-affected populations. The network is motivated by a desire to better understand the relationship between justice and development by focusing on four conflict-affected developing countries (Colombia, Sri Lanka, Syria and Uganda). Each of these states (or opposition groups, in the case of Syria) is currently making decisions on what kinds of TJ institutions to build, often under pressure from the international community, but without robust evidence about the likely impacts of their policy options. The network brings together 18 academic and non-academic experts, plus civil society project partners, who collectively have a broad range of knowledge and experience in the case sites and elsewhere. Project partners will facilitate links with stakeholder groups (including those whose voices tend to be marginalised within policy circles, such as those displaced and dispossessed by conflict; woman; youth) and arts organisations, to feed alternative sources of knowledge into the network. Most participants are either nationals of developing states or work in them. The aim of the network is to develop interdisciplinary research agendas, relationships and capacities to understand the interactions between TJ institutions and development in FCAS. To achieve this aim, the network objectives are 1) Develop ambitious and impactful comparative research agendas on justice and development in FCAS, including applying for at least one large grant; 2) Synthesise, map and disseminate existing research and identify knowledge gaps, including by engaging alternative sources of knowledge; 3) Foster interdisciplinary engagement by capacity and relationship building; 4) Engage policy makers, advocacy groups and publics in case sites and elsewhere. The network will be hosted by the LSE Centre for International Studies. It will achieve its objectives through three sets of activities: 1) Project workshops, to be held in Colombia, Sri Lanka, Lebanon and Uganda (plus a &apos;virtual&apos; workshop). Workshops will be attended by all network participants plus local researchers and stakeholders. They will be structured around conceptual frames (e.g. Conflict/ Peace; Legal/ Political; International/ Local) rather than cases or disciplines in order to generate creative approaches to research questions and methods. 2) Activities organised around workshops to maximise engagement with, and benefits to, stakeholders, e.g. public roundtable discussions; meetings between network participants and policy makers, journalists, non-academic stakeholders and PhD students; exchange visits to case sites for network participants. 3) Virtual engagement via an interactive project website (including open access resource centre), a series of blog symposia and a LinkedIn Group.</narrative>
