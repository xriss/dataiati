  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Document individual parasite transcriptional patterns and different developmental stages in vivo for three species of wild human malaria parasite. Sequence &gt; 300,000 individual P. falciparum parasite transcriptomes generated from samples taken from 50 symptomatic and 50 asymptomatic carriers. Use these data to build a &quot;Malaria Cell Atlas&quot;, a data repository with expression information on every gene across every cell, with interactive visual options (see our current website). Ensure the &quot;Malaria Cell Atlas&quot; is easily accessible and fully open access for both small and large queries from a range of users (academics to pharmaceutical industry). Use genetic relatedness to measure the relationships between asexual and sexual parasites within hosts and whether this differs between symptomatic and asymptomatic hosts. Understand intra- and inter-host variation in parasite transcriptomes and how this relates to symptoms. Determine the repertoire of different parasite cell types present in natural carriers of three species of human malaria. Document patterns of multigene family expression and sexual development in P. malariae and P. ovale for the first time. Develop methods supporting field deployment of single cell transcriptomics in a low resource setting. Develop methods allowing multiplexing of malaria single cell transcriptomics by cell hashing. Use genetic variation present in RNAseq reads from single cell transcriptomes to assign  a genotype to each individual parasite. Expose mosquitoes to the same parasites present in the deeply interrogated 300K/100 donor cell set. Use single cell sequencing to understand how gametocyte genetic diversity is represented in the next generation&apos;s transmitted sporozoite population.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Malaria is caused by a parasite that is transmitted exclusively by mosquitoes. The greatest malaria reduction and eradication success stories have been achieved by interrupting transmission. Historically, this has been through mosquito control. Targeting the small population of specialised parasites residing in the human host that are transmitted through mosquitoes would provide a similarly powerful malaria control method but we know too little about this population. Until now, the genes expressed by parasites have been analyzed by combining millions of parasites together. This approach confounds differences between individual parasites that could underlie success in getting into another host or in resisting the drugs we use to kill the parasites. We have recently developed a method to analyse single parasites one at a time. This technological leap has allowed us to understand parasites in the laboratory with more precision than ever before and importantly to understand how one parasite may differ from another during the whole life of the parasite both in the host and in the mosquito. Although the laboratory setting and lab strains of parasites are powerful tools for understanding parasite biology, in the lab we cannot understand the full diversity of parasites that exist in the wild causing devastating consequences for infected individuals. In this project we propose to characterise wild parasites at an individual level in partnership with Malian scientists. Our exploration will allow us to characterise the three main species of malaria parasite in sub-saharan Africa on a single parasite level for the first time. We will integrate the data into an interactive website called the Malaria Cell Atlas. This will become a key resource for the research community. We will then explore the changes from one patient to the other of the deadliest malaria species in both patients that are suffering from malaria symptoms and also from infected carriers who are not suffering from malaria, both of which contribute to the overall reservoir of parasites. Altogether, we will look at more than 300,000 individual parasites and get a very deep understanding of how individual parasites are both similar and different from each other.  Understanding this infectious reservoir is pivotal to identifying how parasites efficiently get from one person to the next. Altogether our findings using cutting-edge tools to explore wild parasites will be key to understanding malaria and how to best control it.</narrative>
