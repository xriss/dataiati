   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Wars and conflicts shape societies worldwide. In the last two decades, Latin America&apos;s truth and reconciliation projects, and its attempts at transitional justice, have often been used as model for states just entering their own post-conflict scenarios. Latin Americanist scholarship has shown, however, that the voices of marginalized peoples have too often been absent from official &apos;truths&apos;. Creative methodologies have been adopted in order to integrate the voices of women, indigenous people, young people and rural residents into discussions about the history of wars.    In order to foster an inclusive transition, we start from the premise that it is essential to amplify voices from such local initiatives working with marginalized populations (indigenous, women, youth, rural). While existing initiatives have been important they have in most cases remained isolated from one another, impeding the exchange of know-how and knowledge. As a result, their chances of having an impact in the struggles over the narratives of the war in order to achieve reconciliation and peacebuilding, can be limited.  This project proposes to tackle these challenges by creating a space for dialogue across methodologies, actors and countries regarding the methodological challenges and possibilities, the alternative narratives that subvert the already established accounts of the war and the strategies for the preservation of these non-official stories.  We are an interdisciplinary team: the PI is Professor Matthew Brown, a historian of Latin America based in the School of Modern Languages, and the CI is Dr Karen Tucker a political scientist based in the School of Sociology, Politics and International Studies. The RAs are Goya Wilson, a Peruvian researcher who has recently completed a PhD on memory in the Graduate School of Education at UoB; and Maria-Teresa Pinto, a Colombian researcher who is working on a doctoral thesis - supervised by the CI - on historical memory in the Colombian peace process. Our diverse backgrounds are fused together in this project, which aims to bring to bear the extraordinary moment taking place right now in the Colombian peace process, to compare it with the Peruvian experience, and to share experiences and innovations globally.  We will identify outstanding examples of projects in Peru and Colombia that have been able to amplify the voices of marginalized peoples, and to incorporate their stories into historical memory. Projects such as:-  Colombia: 1) Ruta Pacifica.  2) Hijas e hijos por la Identidad y la Justicia contra el Olvido y el Silencio (Daughters &amp; sons for Identity &amp; Justice against Oblivion &amp; Silence)..  3) National Movement of Victims of State Crimes (MOVICE).  4) Association of Indigenous Councils Nasa &#xC7;xh&#xE3;&#xE7;xha.  5) Peace Village of San Jos&#xE9; de Apartad&#xF3; (Comunidad de Paz de San Jos&#xE9; de Apartad&#xF3;)   Peru: 1) Lugar de la Memoria, la Tolerancia y la Inclusi&#xF3;n Social (LUM).  2) Movimiento Ciudadano Para Que No Se Repita (PQNSR).  3) Coordinadora Regional de Organizaciones de Victimas de la Violencia Politica en Ayacucho (CORAVIP) 4) Coordinadora Contra la Impunidad (CCI).    5) H.I.J.O.S. de Peru (a.k.a. HIJXS).   We will bring participants from those projects into dialogue by means of a three-day Peace Festival, to be held in Cartagena de Indias, in Colombia. Participants will present their own project, learn about other complementary projects, and discuss how to overcome the challenges that face their work and the endeavours of projects like them.  We will analyse the discussions from the Peace Festival, and disseminate our findings through academic articles, traditional press and broadcast media, and through social media. The lessons learned will help Colombians and Peruvians to identify marginalized voices, and to incorporate their stories into post-conflict societies.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="Colombians and Peruvians have been feeling their separate ways towards peace in recent years. In Colombia, the ceasefire recently signed between the state and the FARC guerrilla group represents a moment of hope and anxiety. How to bring peace about? In Peru, two decades of a precarious peace after the declaration of the military defeat of the Shining Path guerrilla group has bequeathed a society still divided by memories of war. Many practitioners in both countries are trying new methods to heal the wounds of war - through monuments, digital archiving, dance, mapping, dialogue and in many other ways. This project will bring together practitioners from Colombia, Peru and the UK to share experiences and promote an innovative comparative dialogue. Our Peace Festival, to be held in Cartagena de Indias in Colombia, will explore ways that have been adopted to facilitate the emergence of alternative accounts of war in these two post-conflict Latin American countries. The project aims to create dialogue between projects that challenge the mainstream narratives that are hindering national reconciliation and democracy building in post-war contexts of Peru and Colombia, and therefore strengthen cultural memory and institutional capacity for peace in both countries. We will:  1. Map, systematize, and disseminate relevant methodological practices used in local initiatives aimed at unearthing alternative stories of marginalized victims of war, for example through sharing the work of the prize-winning Ruta Pacifica NGO.  2. Through the organization of a Peace Festival in Cartagena de Indias, inviting representatives of seven projects from Peru and seven projects from Colombia, we will build a space for knowledge exchange and networking between local practitioners who have been on the front line of the peace moment, for example the Peace Community of San Jos&#xE9; de Apartad&#xF3;.   3. Come to understand the potential of local and critical narratives in the construction of peace and reconciliation, particularly regarding how they problematize and dispute entrenched war narratives in the Colombian and Peruvian cases, for example through reflecting on the experience of the new Peruvian Lugar de la Memoria (Place of Memory, LUM).  Long-lasting peace will not be possible without these memory-seeking initiatives. This project will bring together the most adventurous projects seeking to open up ways of thinking about peace in Peru and Colombia. In will strengthen their efforts, rooted in civil society, building networks and sharing experiences. It should go without saying that our partners in this projects risk their lives everyday as they seek to encounter alternative visions of society in countries still emerging from conflict. Our project will support them and make them better able to withstand the challenges they confront in their work and in their lives."></capital-spend>
