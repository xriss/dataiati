   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Biological crop protection: a new &apos;slow down/speed up&apos; strategy for aphid management</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Aphids are important insect pests of a wide range of crop plants. For crops grown outdoors, including field vegetables and arable plants, the standard way of managing aphids has been to apply synthetic chemical insecticides. Originally these were very effective, but excessive use of pesticides has caused some key aphid pests to evolve resistance. At the same time, there are concerns about the environmental impact of pesticide use, which has led to many products being withdrawn from sale. Such as the neonicotinoids. This has left farmers with few workable options for controlling aphid pests which have now become a major threat to farm production. A sustainable form of aphid management that can be used by farmers is urgently needed.   To make crop protection more sustainable and less prone to resistance, it is better not to over-rely on any one intervention. Diversification of tactics can be achieved through Integrated Pest Management (IPM), a way of controlling pests by combining different, complementary control agents in an environmentally sensitive way. These should principally be biological methods that include breeding pest resistant crop varieties, the use of natural enemies such as parasitic wasps, together with &apos;biopesticide&apos; products based on beneficial microbes or natural products. These crop protection tools are safe for people and the environment and so they should provide a better form of crop protection. Chemical insecticides do have a role in IPM, but they are used only when necessary in order to reduce the chances of pests evolving resistance to them. Unfortunately, because farmers have been so reliant on chemical insecticides as the principle form of pest control, there is currently no effective IPM system in place yet for the majority of aphid pests in field crops. The development of IPM has been held back by a lack of new pest control agents and the knowledge about how they interact when used together.   The project involves five interlinked pieces of work. (1) Data on gene expression from multiple brassica crop types is used to identify plant lines that have a high probability of showing resistance to aphids, and this will be confirmed in experiments with aphids feeding on plants in the laboratory. The gene expression data will allow genetic makers to be developed that can be used by seed companies in their plant breeding programmes. (2) The biological basis for plant resistance to aphids is determined using a series of laboratory and field experiments. (3) Research on fungal biopesticides is done to determine how their performance is affected by the environmental conditions in the field, and also to understand how crop plant resistance affects their efficacy against aphids. (4) Complementary research looks at how different types of brassica plant, with resistance to aphids, affect the function of parasitic wasps, which are important natural control agents of aphids on field crops. (5) The interaction of resistant crops, fungal biopesticides and parasitoids are studied in the field in an IPM system.   The aim of this project is to develop the new knowledge and tools needed for an IPM system for aphid pests of field crops. The work centres on the peach potato aphid, Myzus persicae, which is a pest of a wide range of crops and has evolved resistance to many commonly used insecticides.  The experiments involve vegetable brassicas and oilseed rape but the intention is to extend the system to other crops (sugar beet, potatoes) in future research.  The research is based on a hypothesis that brassica plants with partial resistance that slows down aphid development makes the pest more susceptible to biological control agents and speeds up control with biopesticides and parasitic wasps.   The project will benefit farmers and growers and others in the supply chain. The general public will benefit from improved food security and better care of the environment.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project will underpin the development of a new &apos;slow down / speed up&apos; approach for managing aphid pests of field crops that combines plant breeding and biological control. Our approach involves slowing down the growth rate of pests while speeding up the performance of their natural enemies.   Because of widespread evolution of resistance to insecticides in aphid pests and restrictions of insecticides such as the neonicotinoids, there is an urgent need for new technologies that allow aphids to be managed in a sustainable way. This issue is now of the highest priority for many farmers and growers.  Our proposal is to develop an Integrated Pest Management system for aphid pests of field crops. We will focus on the peach potato aphid, Myzus persicae, a polyphagous pest species that has evolved resistance to many insecticides. Brassicae will be used in an experimental system which will be extended to sugar beet and potatoes in future research.   There are 5 Objectives:  Objective 1: Use genetic markers to identify partial resistance in brassica species germplasm. Identification of candidate brassica genotypes with potential resistance will be confirmed using a combination of bioinformatics analysis of RNAseq data sets and phenotyping experiments.  Objective 2: Determine the mechanisms of aphid resistance in selected brassica lines.  Transcriptomics data from Brassica will be used to elucidate the molecular basis for partial resistance to M. persicae. Laboratory and field experiments will be done to quantify the feeding and development of M. persicae on a range of Brassica genotype breeding lines with aphid resistance markers and under different field temperature regimes.  Objective 3: Determine how environmental conditions affect the performance of fungal biopesticides. Entomopathogenic fungi will be evaluated against different life stages of M. persicae feeding on resistant brassica genotypes. Effects of temperature on biopesticide performance will be studied using a day degree model.     Objective 4: Elucidate the extent to which parasitism of aphids can be enhanced by Brassica genotypes with indirect defence traits and by cis-jasmone treatment. Field surveys will be done to confirm the predominant parasitoid species of M. persicae on Brassica.  Parasitoid responses to volatiles from aphid-infested Brassica genotypes will be quantified and the role of cis-jasmone in parasitoid attraction will be elucidated.   Objective 5. Integrated Pest Management. Biologically-based tools for management of M. persicae will be tested in the field. Field experiments will be done to measure aphid control on contrasting Brassica genotypes following treatment with fungal biopesticides, parasitoids and cis-jasmone.   Studies with the Myzus-Arabidopsis model system have shown that defence responses against the aphid are based around differential expression of phytohormone signalling pathways (particularly JA) and the phytoalexin camelexin.  We have analysed the expression of homologues of these genes from RNAseq data for &gt;100 brassica accessions and identified significant variation in expression of PAD3, 4 and JA signalling pathway genes, suggesting that identification of partial resistance to M. persicae in brassica crop breeding material is highly likely.   We will test the hypothesis that brassica genotypes with partial resistance that slows down aphid development makes the pest more susceptible to biological control agents and speeds up control by biopesticides and parasitoids. At the same time, we will provide new understanding of how environmental conditions in the field modulate the efficacy of biopesticides, and how crop genotypes with indirect defence traits and / or semiochemical treatments can enhance the performance of parasitoid natural enemies.</narrative>
