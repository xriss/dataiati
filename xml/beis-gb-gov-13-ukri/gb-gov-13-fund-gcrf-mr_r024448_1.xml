   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Culture and bodies: an interdisciplinary approach to non-communicable disease prevention in Malawi and Tanzania</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The incidence of non-communicable diseases such as hypertension and diabetes is rapidly increasing in countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, like Malawi and Tanzania. In 2010, there were more than 2 million deaths from non-communicable diseases in the region, which was a 46% increase from 1990. Many people in Malawi and Tanzania, as elsewhere in Sub-Saharan Africa, are moving from rural areas into cities. Here, calorie-dense foods and drinks are easily accessible, and opportunities to be physically active reduced. These factors, together with traditional cultural norms, such as a larger body size being associated with respect and attractiveness, contribute to increasing risk of non-communicable diseases in both countries. People&apos;s understandings and responses to non-communicable diseases draw on biomedical, as well as traditional, knowledges; traditional healers, as well as medical doctors and nurses, are consulted in attempts to understand (and treat) the symptoms of non-communicable diseases.   If interventions to prevent non-communicable diseases in Sub-Saharan Africa are to be effective, it is essential they reflect not only Western experiences and biomedical accounts, but also local knowledges, perceptions and values. However, as these local knowledges and values are often deeply-rooted and unspoken, traditional research methods, such as surveys and interviews, are often inadequate to describe them. Community arts offer an alternative approach.  They have great potential to allow researchers to access people&apos;s cultural, emotional and historical beliefs and practices, and then to work creatively together with local communities to develop non-communicable disease interventions that reflect these beliefs and practices.   In this project, we aim to develop an interdisciplinary partnership of medical and social science, and arts and humanities researchers, and local arts organisations in Malawi and Tanzania to learn together as we work closely with local communities to create culturally-relevant approaches to non-communicable disease prevention in Malawi and Tanzania. We will do this using a variety of methods drawn from the different disciplines we represent. We will first analyse existing survey data from both countries, and conduct a review of previous arts-based health promotion initiatives in the region. This information will inform pilot projects in Malawi and Tanzania working with people living in or near cities to use community arts to access local knowledges, perceptions and values, and to develop a culturally-relevant intervention activity. By the end of the project, we will produce a framework describing ways of using community arts in non-communicable disease prevention. This will allow us to apply for more finding to test, refine and evaluate the framework in other settings in Malawi, Tanzania, throughout Sub-Saharan Africa, and beyond.    The project will allow partners to develop new interdisciplinary understandings and skills around gaining access to complex local knowledges, perceptions and values, and working closely with local people to develop innovative approaches to non-communicable disease prevention. Participation in the project will build research skills capacity in the UK, Malawi and Tanzania. Local communities will benefit from involvement in the project through becoming more aware of how to prevent non-communicable diseases in ways that are culturally-relevant for them. We will publicise our findings widely to local residents, and to local, national and international policymakers, practitioners and other researchers, through face-to-face and online events, and conferences, and through local, national and social media. We will also have a dedicated project website which will host project news and outputs (translated into local languages, where appropriate), as well as an online resource bank to support other researchers to use similar approaches to non-communicable disease prevention.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed project will allow us to develop a large interdisciplinary partnership of Malawian, Tanzanian and UK researchers and practitioners, spanning the arts and humanities, medical and social sciences, NGOs and local artists, with the aim of creating culturally-situated, arts-mediated approaches to non-communicable disease (NCD) prevention in Malawi and Tanzania. We have six related objectives.  1) To establish an international, interdisciplinary, collaborative partnership of researchers, NGOs and artists working across the UK, Malawi and Tanzania, which by the end of the project will be well-placed to attract major project or programme funding around non-communicable disease prevention.  2) To promote in-depth interdisciplinary learning, and share academic knowledge and methodological skills and expertise in relation to the real-world context of the project. We will facilitate this by undertaking a number activities that will encourage people to bring their own disciplinary expertise to the table to be challenged and critiqued as new understandings and ways of working are established.   3) To work closely with local people in urban/peri-urban areas of Malawi and Tanzania in two pilot projects that will use community arts to develop an understanding of local knowledges, perceptions and values in relation to NCDs and NCD risk factors, and to co-create a culturally-compelling NCD prevention intervention activity.    4) To develop a pilot methodological NCD prevention framework to support the application of community arts-mediated approaches to change the landscape of NCD prevention in Malawi, Tanzania and elsewhere in SSA.  5) To describe a programme of future work for the partnership (including identification of funding opportunities and other partners in SSA) based on testing, refining and evaluating in large scale studies, the pilot arts-mediated methodological NCD prevention framework in other settings in Malawi, Tanzania and elsewhere in SSA.    6) To engage with policy makers, NGOs, local community members, artists and other researchers, to raise awareness of: the need for culturally-situated and relevant interventions to address NCDs in local communities in Malawi and Tanzania; and the role of community arts methodologies in developing these interventions.</narrative>
