   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Strengthening private-sector medicine systems to tackle the persistence of poor-quality medicines in Africa: a proof-of-concept study</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Poor-quality medicines, containing little or no active ingredient - whether through deliberate fraud, poor manufacturing practice or post-manufacture deterioration - represent a major public health threat in low/middle-income countries (LMICs): responsible for more than 200,000 under-5 deaths each year in Africa and contributing to antimicrobial drug resistance. Efforts by governments and international agencies to curb the problem through improving detection rates, tightening regulation and public education have been hampered by the economic realities of medicine supply in resource-poor, high-need contexts, but also - we suggest - by a failure to apprehend fully the complex workings of medicine supply systems, particularly beyond the public sector.  Private-sector medicine systems can be characterised as &apos;complex systems&apos; involving multiple dispersed actors with no central organising authority. Recent developments in the study of complex systems have revealed how the actions of individuals can combine to have non-intuitive effects on the system as whole. This has significant implications for well-intentioned policy interventions based on &apos;common sense&apos; intuition, which may have unwelcome unanticipated consequences. Our ultimate goal is to understand - and predict - the workings of complex medicine systems in order to inform effective interventions to minimise the penetration of poor-quality products in LMICs. This will require: mapping complete medicine supply chains; understanding the motivations/behaviours of buyers, sellers and regulators; developing sophisticated computational models to simulate the system; and engaging stake-holders to co-design evidence-based interventions. This is an ambitious project which needs careful groundwork through a proof-of-concept study with the following objectives and activities: (1) To assess fieldwork feasibility in these contexts and validate research instruments: Very few people have attempted to trace a full medicine supply chain in an under-regulated context. In order to assess feasibility, safety and ethical issues, we will map a limited number of medicine supply chains starting at retail outlets across Ghana and Tanzania and moving upwards to point of manufacture, obtaining as much relevant information as possible at each stage. Research instruments will be validated in each local context, and re-validated across contexts to ensure consistency. (2) To develop our understandings of the structure and operation of private-sector medicine systems: Geographically weighted analysis will be employed to describe the structure/organization of supply systems (length, number of transaction points, degree/level of vertical &apos;collapse&apos;, etc.) and investigate spatial dependencies in the data. Thematic analysis of ethnographic data and secondary sources will be used to understand actors&apos; decision-making and behaviour at each point. (3) To build Agent-Based Models (ABMs) simulating medicine systems, based on empirical data: We will build a sequence of ABMs simulating medicine supply systems in Ghana and Tanzania as &apos;complex systems&apos;. These models will allow us to understand, and ultimately predict, how individual behaviours might affect the system as a whole. We will develop &apos;user-friendly&apos; models to use with policy-makers, highlighting potential unintended consequences of interventions. (4) To develop and evaluate strategies for engaging relevant actors (market, regulatory, political) in the research and intervention design:  In each country, we will convene  National Stake-holder Groups (NSGs), with policy, regulatory and high-level market actors and Project Working Groups (PWGs), comprising &apos;on-the-ground&apos; supply-chain actors (buyers, sellers and regulators). Through a series of collaborative workshops, we will work with &apos;user-friendly&apos; models to identify potential &apos;bottlenecks&apos; or problematic behavioural logics that might underpin interventions.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The overarching AIM of this Foundation Grant application is to prepare the ground, through a proof-of-concept study, for a full-scale project that can inform evidence-based interventions to strengthen the integrity of private-sector medicine supply systems in LMICs and minimise the penetration/spread of poor-quality medicines. This major project will entail four components: 1. Mapping full medicine supply chains on a large (nationally-representative) scale, identifying all actors (market, political, regulatory) involved at each at each step; 2. Conducting multi-sited ethnographic research to uncover actors&apos; motivations and practices all points across supply chains; 3. Developing a series of robust, empirically-grounded computational models to understand - and ultimately predict - how individual actions/interactions aggregate up to influence system-level properties and vulnerabilities of medicine supply chains (and vice versa); 4. Working with key actors (buyers/sellers, regulators, political actors) to co-design contextually-appropriate interventions to help eliminate poor-quality medicines from the system. This ambitious project will require working across disciplinary boundaries, conducting fieldwork in some difficult locations, and working with market actors, policy-makers and regulators in innovative ways. We are therefore seeking a Foundation Grant, to conduct a full proof-of-concept study in Ghana and Tanzania with the following objectives and associated research questions: Objective (1): To assess fieldwork feasibility and validate research instruments:       - Can we effectively trace supply chains of different kinds/brands of medicine in these contexts, from retail right up to point of production/import, collecting reliable data at each step?       - How do we achieve consistency and validity across sites (between and within countries)?        - How can we best ensure ethical compliance and researcher safety in this fieldwork? Objective (2): To develop our understandings of the structure and operation of private-sector medicine systems:       - How are supply networks structured (i.e. length, number of transaction points, degree/level of vertical &apos;collapse&apos;, etc.), and how do these vary according to medicine type, price, outlet location, etc.?       - How do actors (market, regulatory, consumers) make decisions at each point, and what constraints (informational, resource, regulatory, etc.) come into play? What matters for each?       - How can we distinguish empirically and theoretically between &apos;pragmatic&apos; and &apos;strategic&apos; (&apos;corrupt&apos;) behaviours? Objective (3): To build Agent-Based Models (ABMs) simulating medicine systems, based on empirical data:       - How can we most effectively incorporate ethnographic and GIS data into ABM development?       - How effectively can we calibrate and validate resulting ABMs against empirical and historical data?        - Can we build empirically-credible, &apos;user-friendly&apos; ABMs that are policy relevant and accessible? Objective (4): To develop and evaluate strategies for engaging relevant actors (market, regulatory, political) in the research and intervention design:        - How willing/able will stake-holders be to engage productively with models for policy development?       - How do we engage actors who may be market competitors or involved in incriminating activities?</narrative>
