   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Ixchel: Building understanding of the physical, cultural and socio-economic drivers of risk for strengthening resilience in the Guatemalan cordillera</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project is based on in-depth research in rural and indigenous communities in the cordillera of Guatemala (volcanic arc and southern highlands) that are located close to active volcanoes and in the vicinity of Lake Atitl&#xE1;n. This region has an extraordinarily high level of hazard exposure that intersects with, and is exacerbated by, existing forms of socio-economic vulnerability. People die, suffer and lose livelihoods in disasters in part because of Guatemala&apos;s geological and climatological conditions that make it prone to earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and hurricanes, as well as frequent landslides during the rainy season. The dynamic and interactive nature of these risks are still poorly understood. There is then an urgent need to gain better understandings of physical processes and, in particular, of multihazard interactions in the Guatemalan context from a scientific perspective. However, this hazard exposure cannot be separated from long histories of landlessness, state-led violence and genocide that manifest themselves today in colonial and discriminatory attitudes towards poor indigenous and mixed race (ladino) Guatemalans. Such attitudes result in failures by authorities to protect, warn, evacuate survivors, exhume and properly count the dead, and to relocate or rehouse people with dignity and in culturally appropriate ways. These experiences also mean that local people often do not trust state agencies or western science, and indigenous peoples also have their own knowledge systems and modes of understanding risk and resilience that they deem to be more reliable. The losses and complexities of recent disasters such as the June 2018 eruption of the Fuego volcano and the building of resilient communities urgently require research that brings physical sciences into dialogue not only with social sciences and humanities, but also with diverse cosmovisions and beliefs. This project involves a close collaboration between physical scientists, social scientists, humanities scholars and Guatemalan community leaders in communities exposed to multiple forms of risk. It is based on a shared commitment to reduce the suffering caused by hazards and disasters but involves people who work with very different epistemic, theoretical and methodological approaches and knowledge frameworks. We ask whether we can better understand risk and do research that is both respectful and useful to local people by putting these different knowledge systems on an equal footing. We will therefore combine quantitative monitoring techniques with artistic and ethnographic work and a range of community engagement activities. The scientific and the cultural will be combined in a 8-episode television series produced in collaboration with local organizations, actors and mediamakers in which the complexity of rural community lives and livelihoods of indigenous peoples living with risk will be ethically represented and followed up by a range of outreach activities in community spaces and on radio, television and social media. We will produce a cultural product that will provoke high levels of audience engagement and debate by scientists, community members, development practitioners, emergency managers and government agents.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">We seek to adopt a more holistic approach to risk, by providing new approaches for improved hazard and risk assessment, which places close attention on the geographies at play in Guatemala, but also improves understandings of why hazard management strategies often fail. It will emphasise that scientific understanding of physical processes is urgently needed but that its effectiveness will be limited if it does not consider how hazard exposure and susceptibility co-exist with, and are exacerbated by violence, poverty, inequality and discrimination. It will reveal how interdisciplinary research must also be inter-epistemic and intercultural if it is to protect lives and livelihoods. Our aim is to produce a series of multivocal outputs that can shape hazard and disaster management practices in positive and decisive ways.   The main objectives are:  To develop novel methods for probabilistic hazard assessment and forecasting for linked multi-hazards relating to the triggering of different types of geophysical mass flows (e.g. landslides, debris flows, mudflows, and pyroclastic flows) that occur frequently in the Guatemalan cordillera. These methods will include the designing and quantification of probabilistic event trees and time-dependent hazard assessment and maps.  To review critical historical case-studies which represent a suite of physical triggers, hazards and social settings, and to pull-forward lessons learned from less recent disasters. Synergies and differences will be explored, through a number of lenses that will focus on short-term institutional response, vulnerability, community-lead recovery and enforced relocation.   To characterise dynamic risk in communities living in hazardous areas, focusing on key sources of vulnerability (physical, systemic, functional, social, economic and political) that affect risk to life safety from mass flows.   To document how socio-economic vulnerabilities and structural forms of racism are embedded in and reproduced by systems of governance, policy regimes and legislative frameworks and to explore how these can integrate and better represent community interests.  To produce an 8-episode docunovela that is available on national television and online and that produces complex forms of participatory civic engagement in community forums and on social media and community radio stations. The script will draw on in-depth ethnographic fieldwork in affected communities and we will monitor and track reception in the convergent media environment to evaluate its impact.  To work with local civil society leaders and mediamakers to produce bottom-up forms of engagement and knowledge production that shape the decisions taken by governments and emergency managers.  To inject questions of discrimination and indigenous cosmovisions into the context within which scientific work on multi-hazards and systemic risk is undertaken.  To produce more genuinely impactful understandings of interdisciplinarity in the context of DRR and development research in which physical sciences must engage with non-scientific perspectives and vice versa.   This proposal will bring together UK-based hazard and risk scientists, with key Guatemalan institutions and colleagues, and expert, international partners involved in DRR. Informed by current socio-economic strategies and policies, our research will deliver improved knowledge, new datasets and cultural products, and build capacity to strengthen disaster risk reduction and response in multi-hazard environments. We aim to generate understanding about risk that is useful, usable and used to reduce the impact of future disasters in Guatemala, Latin America and globally.</narrative>
