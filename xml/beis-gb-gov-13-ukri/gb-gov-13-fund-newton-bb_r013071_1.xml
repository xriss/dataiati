   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Infection of pigs with influenza viruses is a problem both for animal and human health. Swine influenza virus infections cause production losses and can predispose to more serious complications leading to loss of stock. Moreover infections of pigs by avian influenza viruses can pre-empt the emergence of a novel influenza virus that infects humans. Indeed the last influenza pandemic in 2009 had its most recent origin in pigs. Pork is an important protein source for the developed and developing world. China is a major pig producer, where pigs are reared in large holdings under sometimes crowded conditions; a perfect breeding ground for the evolution and emergence of new strains of virus.  The high population in China, its geography and its climate make it a hotspot for emergence of influenza viruses.  One future solution to these threats is to employ recent developments in gene editing to make a pig that is resistant to infection with influenza viruses. This is not so far-fetched; indeed, pigs resistant to another pig virus called PRRS were recently generated. However, in order to apply the breakthrough to the influenza problem we need to identify which genes in the pigs should be altered  to stop the virus from being able to infect, and then define precisely how to alter them so that there is as little disruption to the meat production and breeding capacity in the edited animals. We will identify the pig genes that are co-opted by swine influenza viruses to support their replication using a novel screening method, in pig cells with authentic swine influenza viruses typical of those circulating in China today. Then we will employ another novel screening method to work out the least changes we can make in the pig gene in order to stop the virus from infecting, because we reason this minimalistic and precise editing strategy will be the most acceptable to consumers and farmers alike.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">We aim to set the pathway towards generation of gene edited pigs that are resistant to infection with swine influenza viruses by 1. identifying candidate pig genes that influenza virus replies upon, and  2. defining precise mutations that prevent the virus from utilizing the host factor. To achieve this goal we will Develop reagents and methods to perform a CRISPR based  screen to identify host genes in pig cells that are required to support replication of swine influenza virus. Characterize the identified host factors to understand the point in the swine influenza virus replication cycle for which they are co-opted by virus and ascertain any interactions they have with swine influenza virus proteins. Develop reagents and methods to undertake a high throughput library based codon mutagenesis screen to define amino acids in the identified host factors that are essential for their ability to support swine influenza virus replication. Design a gene edited variant of the identified host factors that will no longer support swine influenza virus replication but is minimally affected for the normal host function of the protein.</narrative>
