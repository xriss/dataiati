   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Ukraine&apos;s hidden tragedy: understanding the outcomes of population displacement from the country&apos;s war torn regions</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Since the beginning of the conflict in eastern Ukraine, and the annexation of Crimea, approximately 1.7 million Ukrainians have been internally displaced and are facing an uncertain future. The majority have experienced a significant drop in living standards, problems in accessing services such as health care, difficulties in obtaining suitable work and an overall lack of support for their situation. Furthermore, the displacement has had a significant impact on individual identities with people forced away from their &apos;homelands&apos; while at the same time feeling abandoned by their state. While the conflict has gained a great deal of international attention, this is mainly focussed on the actions of the Russian and Ukrainian states and the former&apos;s relationships with the rest of the world as a result of the war. Attempts at conflict resolution also focus on state level issues and thus the experiences, problems and voices of those internally displaced remain unheard. The project&apos;s overarching argument is that meaningful post-conflict reconstruction, and reconciliation, cannot take place without a full understanding of problems that people displaced by the conflict face and their full incorporation into social, economic and legal structures within the country.  This project addresses this gap by interviewing those displaced by the conflict as well as those charged with assisting them. The key areas it explores are centred around their legal and social status, their everyday experiences, their ability to obtain work in their new locality and how they cope with their new challenges. This will involve over a 100 in-depth interviews in multiple locations in Ukraine. The research team is interdisciplinary, with investigators from social geography, law, politics and economic geography, ensuring that differing approaches and methodologies will be brought together throughout the research. As well as the individual experiences, the research also examines how local and national authorities have attempted to assist this group and the barriers they have faced in doing so. Once this has been fully understood, the project then looks to the actions of the international community, such as the EU, UN etc, and how their actions have assisted/impacted upon the lives of internally displaced people. Together these research areas will provide deep understandings of the many problems that internally displaced people face in Ukraine and how institutions, both state and NGO, can best provide assistance. Importantly, the research will also explicitly explore how internally displaced people can be more meaningfully involved in civil advocacy and political decisions at central and regional levels Given the scale and urgency of the issues that the research explores, its findings will be of interest to a wide range of policy makers, government/NGOs representatives and academics. Through its interviews and public engagement events, the work will also provide a voice and pathway into debates for internally displaced people who are far too often unheard. The ground level data that the project will produce, contextualised by a deep engagement with policy reports and legal documents, will provide the basis for evidence-based policy development by the Ukrainian government, the EC and the UN/NATO etc. The project will also produce accessible guidelines for internally displaced people, based on the research findings, to help them access the services that they need. These outcomes will combine to improve the lives of this group and to ensure they have a voice in future policy developments. Based around the concept of necropolitics, the research&apos;s theoretical base will ensure that the project has a broad academic engagement and will provide comparative elements to debates surrounding the problems internally displaced people face in other conflict torn regions.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project&apos;s overarching objective is to explore the experiences of Ukrainians displaced by the annexation of Crimea by Russia and the de facto invasion of its eastern regions. While a relatively large amount is understood about the political outcomes, both internal and external, there is little in-depth work on the social, legal, cultural and economic impacts on the estimated 1.7 million Ukrainians internally displaced (IDPs) by the conflict, and the impacts this has had on their identities and relationships with their nation state. By using intersectional and interdisciplinary approaches the project will develop such understandings through the following objectives 1) What are the legal and social citizenships of IDPs and how does this impact upon their political and social freedoms and rights? How does IDPs&apos; visions of the state, regime and institutional legitimacy inform their internal legitimacy of Ukraine and the quasi states. This objective explores how the displacement impacts upon memories of &apos;home&apos;, how it shapes new identities and attitudes towards Ukraine. This will be achieved through extensive interviews with IDPs in numerous locations across Ukraine.  2) What are the everyday experiences of IDP in Ukraine, their survival tactics and barriers to social inclusion? How are these experiences shaped concurrently by ethnicity, language, class, gender, disability, age and by external forces such the discourses that surround them and social policies towards them? This will reveal the barriers member of this group face in accessing employment, health care and post-traumatic stress provision and education and the impact this has on their overall well-being. It will also, through elite interviewing, look at the provision made for this group and how such policies resonate with the daily needs of IDPs and the scale to which they actually operate.  3) What are the opportunities for engaging IDPs in host communities and economies? What are capacities of local economies to support social and economic integration of IDPs? Economic marginalisation was commonplace across Ukraine prior to the conflict and clearly the majority of IDPs will find it difficult to quickly find work that provides a suitable income. This objective explores this issue both through the lens of the IDPs themselves but also through that of the host community. For example, what are the impacts of mass inwards migration on regional/local labour and housing markets and what measure have authorities taken to try and integrate IDPs into host economies. This will involve the case study of two regions as well as analysis at the national level.  4) How do external/international actors affect the process of social integration of IDPs and how can this impact upon conflict prevention and resolution?  This objective will explore the policies and actions of external actors (such as the EU, NATO etc) in relation to IDPs in Ukraine. As well as examining the success of relative schemes it will also analyse the constraints they are forced to work within and how these are negotiated. This will reveal a great deal about how external actors can operate in regions effected by new &apos;hybrid&apos; forms of welfare.  5) What are opportunities of IDPs to be involved in civil advocacy and political decisions at national and regional levels?  How can dialogue and reconciliation in communities through enhancing the voice of IDPs at the local and international level be achieved? This is important as the project strongly argues that unless issues of fractured identities are engaged with then reconciliation in Ukraine will be very difficult to achieve. To enable this IDPs, and NGOs supporting them, have to have a voice in debates and be able to articulate their key everyday concerns.  Overall these objectives will provide a wide range of qualitative data upon which more nuanced policies toassist IDPs in Ukraine can be developed.</narrative>
