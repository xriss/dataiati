   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Our vision is to bring together a critical mass of international expertise and research excellence to build capability and capacity to conduct research on Deliberate Self Harm (DSH).   Our main aim is to produce new and robust information to inform the understanding of the nature of DSH in the context of profound social, political and economic challenges in low and middle-income countries (LMIC) such as India and Pakistan.   Research leaders are thinly spread in LMICs, which limits capability building and restricts capacity. There are serious gaps in knowledge about DSH in South Asia. We will meet these challenges in two ways:  - firstly by conducting research - secondly by providing training.   Research that is collaboratively designed, culturally appropriate and rigorously implemented is one of the best learning tools for building capability.  A trained and skilled workforce will continue to build capability and capacity for research.  In this partnership, capability building is reciprocal and sustainable. We will share knowledge across the partnership.  The programme of work will include training in different areas such as research methods, systematic reviews, data analysis and research governance.  PhD students will benefit from the training.  We will design some of the training ourselves and bring in other experts to help.  We will draw on the expertise of people with lived experience to develop our work programme.     A lot of different academic disciplines are involved in the programme.  We will work together and share our knowledge to support post doctoral researchers and PhD students who will become the research leaders of the future.    Our research programme will develop new evidence and strengthen our understanding of DSH.  We will carry out research using quantitative and qualitative methods.     We will develop a flexible and trained research workforce in India and Pakistan to carry out fieldwork safely, efficiently and rigorously in challenging environments.  We will work closely with Non-Governmental Organisation (NGO) partners in Pakistan and India.  We will share our findings widely with a range of stakeholders including the local community, international forums and in high impact scientific journals. Our work will inform the development of culturally relevant community and primary-care responses to DSH and suicide in LMIC. Our work will also inform the development of suicide prevention policies, including public health messages and measures.  We will document and evaluate the development of the partnership and knowledge exchange processes, and disseminate the findings on conducting this work.    Our three core datasets (household survey sample, stakeholder sample, and DSH Register) will help us to examine and describe DSH in local context, explore substantive areas of interest in rich detail, answer a number of research questions and inform policy development and community and health service responses.  We will find out more about differences and similarities between India and Pakistan and the differences and similarities between South Asia and other regions of the world.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="In 2016 the United Nations (UN) refers to 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) as part of an interrelated sustainable development agenda. Goal 3 is to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all ages.  RCUK note five challenge areas in the context of the need to create sustainable economies and societies.  One of the five challenge areas is sustainable health and wellbeing.   Suicide is a leading cause of death and self-harm is highly prevalent worldwide.  Both are a considerable burden to individuals, communities and health and care providers. For each person who dies by suicide, many more attempt suicide or experience an episode of Deliberate Self Harm (DSH). The WHO publication World Health Statistics 2016: Monitoring health for the SDGs includes suicide as one of the SDG indicators.  The proposed programme of work has a series of interrelated objectives which involve both capability and capacity building and the conduct of robust research to meet the global challenges research agenda.    1.Build a critical mass of international expertise and research excellence by creating a sustainable and strong international partnership.   2.Deepen and sustain research capability in the UK, India and Pakistan across the whole career pathway from fieldworkers to research leaders using: a. Knowledge exchange processes  b. Extant structured research training (for example, systemic review methods, health economics, computerised qualitative data analysis, quantitative analysis of complex survey data) c. Bespoke experiential training (for example, research governance, narrative interviews, development and exploration of case vignettes, involvement of service users and carers in research planning and implementation, dynamic analyses of longitudinal data) d. Reciprocity across a strong interdisciplinary, multi-sectoral, international partnership (for example, joint supervisory arrangements for students, joint mentoring arrangements for researchers)  3. Develop new empirical evidence and strengthen our theoretical understanding of DSH by: a. Planning, developing, piloting and implementing a structured household survey in each study site. b. Undertaking in-depth narrative interviews with stakeholders (for example, policy makers, health workers, survivors of DSH, family members, public) c. Planning, developing, piloting, implementing and evaluating a DSH Register in each study site. d. Planning, and where appropriate, conducting further research including scoping reviews, feasibility intervention studies and follow-up work based on the Register cohorts.  4. Develop a flexible and trained research workforce to carry out fieldwork safely, efficiently and rigorously in challenging environments drawing on the existing experience of the academic and NGO partners.  5. Disseminate the findings from our research to the local community, in international forums and high impact journals.   6. Pro-actively inform the development and plan the evaluation of culturally relevant community and primary-care responses to DSH and suicide in LMIC including seeking further research funding.  7. Pro-actively inform the development of suicide prevention policies, including public health messages and measures.  8. Document the development of the partnership and knowledge exchange processes and disseminate the findings."></capital-spend>
