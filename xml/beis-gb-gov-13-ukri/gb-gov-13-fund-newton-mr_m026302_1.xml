   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Newton001 Understanding Antimicrobial Resistance Mutations in Tuberculosis: Towards Personalised Treatment to Combat Multi-drug Resistance</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">1.Use the emergence of high-throughput sequence based diagnostics to improve patient treatment for multi drug resistant and extensively drug resistant tuberculosis.  2. Identify and catalogue missense mutations on Mycobacterium tuberculosis populations and annotate them according to phenotype and drug efficacy.  3. Develop an in-depth understanding of what types of mutations and their characteristics lead to drug resistance across diverse populations of Mycobacterium tuberculosis  4. Develop an integrated pipeline to rapidly evaluate the effects of mutations upon protein interactions and function, facilitating the rapid identification and characterisation of resistance mutations.  5. Develop novel automated in silico methods to predict potential, but not yet described, drug resistance mutations, as well as to better understand quantitatively how mutations affect protein-drug interactions and affinity/potency.  6. Translate the findings and developed methods as public and freely accessible web services and databases, making them widely available for the scientific community.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Tuberculosis is recognised as one of Brazil&apos;s leading infectious diseases, with over 70,000 cases notified each year. There has been a significant increase in the number of diagnosed Multidrug resistant TB cases, with 10% of those also resistant to the two most important second---line class drugs (XDR-TB). This project aims to build upon existing collaborative programs on understanding effects of mutations, and on combating multidrug resistant and extensively drug resistant (MDR and XDR respectively) tuberculosis (TB). The two nodes, Brazil and UK, have complementary skills that encompass epidemiology, human and pathogen genetics, bioinformatics, structural biology and drug discovery. This multidisciplinary combination will facilitate the development of a novel platform to rapidly identify resistant TB from genomic sequencing. Novel mechanisms of drug resistance in TB will be explored using cutting edge techniques and correlated with clinical outcomes. This will help guide more suitable patient treatment, public health policies and future drug discovery efforts, with potential to bring benefit to individuals and public health in Brazil and UK, providing solutions to a problem that affects a third of the world&apos;s population.</narrative>
