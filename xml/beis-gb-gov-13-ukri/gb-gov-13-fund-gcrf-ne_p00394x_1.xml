   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Socio-ecological response and resilience to El Ni&#xF1;o shocks :The case of coffee and cocoa agroforestry landscapes in Africa</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In many developing country contexts, rural smallholder agroforestry landscapes are very important sources of livelihoods for millions of households, but are also constrained by ecological and climatic factors. Our understanding of how these landscapes respond to environmental shocks and long-term change is poor, but can be significantly improved by using multidisciplinary approaches that incorporate ecological, climate and social science methods (Fisher et al 2014). Combining these disciplines into manageable research projects as well as finding appropriate funding to support them remains a serious challenge.  We are exceptionally well placed to address this dearth of knowledge due to our work monitoring a coffee-farming landscape in Ethiopia and a cocoa-farming landscape in Ghana. Both studies are part of the ECOLIMITS project, funded by the NERC/DfID Ecosystem Services and Poverty Alleviation programme (ESPA). These studies are focussed on gradients of management intensity from natural forest through high shade/low fragmentation to low shade/high fragmentation agroforest farms. We have gained a detailed understanding of the ecological system (how farming is affected by and affects biodiversity, ecosystem processes and ecosystem services) and the social system (how farming relates to rural livelihoods and multiple dimensions of poverty, and how these relationships are modified by local and national institutions). In the last few months, a strong El Ni&#xF1;o-associated drought and increased temperatures have affected both regions. This has generated many challenges in both landscapes, but also provides a rare opportunity to study the sensitivity and resilience of agroforestry landscapes to weather shocks. In this proposal, we seek to monitor ecosystem services and crop yields through this El Ni&#xF1;o event and beyond to 2017, and survey households to understand the impacts they have experienced as well as identify the key factors that lead to their resilience or vulnerability. In particular, we plan to explore the relationships between tree cover, crop yields and vulnerability to climate shocks. Our work will directly inform regional and national agendas in both countries to develop climate strategies that are resilient to environmental shocks, and hence maintain crop yields and rural livelihoods in a changing environment.   The proposal is urgent because funds are needed to immediately conduct household surveys and biodiversity measurements during the El Ni&#xF1;o, and maintain ecological monitoring to mid-2017 to assess recovery.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Since 2014 we have been monitoring key features of the ecological and social dynamics of two rural agroforestry landscapes: a coffee-farming landscape in Ethiopia and a cocoa-farming landscape in Ghana. We have gained a detailed understanding of the ecological system (tree species, carbon stocks, bird diversity, pollinator abundance and diversity, microclimate, coffee and cocoa yields) and the social system (farm management, key local and national institutions and multiple dimensions of poverty). The 2015/16 El Ni&#xF1;o event is a unique opportunity to explore the social and ecological impacts of a sudden climatic shock on cocoa and coffee systems of Ghana and Ethiopia to understand what ecological and social factors hinder or support resilience to future climate shocks.   In this study we plan to address the following questions: 1- What are the socio-ecological impacts of this El Ni&#xF1;o event on ecosystem services that underpin agricultural systems, crop production and rural livelihoods and poverty? 2- Is there a relationship between tree shade, microclimate and the response of cocoa/coffee yields to the El Ni&#xF1;o, leading to optimum long-term resilience in higher shade systems? 3- Are certain people more resilient to El Ni&#xF1;o related environmental change? If so, what household characteristics and institutions are associated with resilience? 4-  Do people change their behaviour in response to El Ni&#xF1;o? How effective is this behavioural change? What socio-ecological factors constrain behavioural change?   We hypothesise that: (i) raised temperatures and drought in our study landscapes lead to a decline in coffee/cocoa yields that is a predictable function of local within-plot microclimate (temperature/air humidity/soil moisture);  (ii) More shaded/less fragmented systems experience less decline in yield, demonstrating a trade-off between yield under optimum climate conditions and resilience of yield to climate shocks;  (iii) the decline in yield in coffee/cocoa will result in a large income shock to the farming communities; (iv) there are a diversity of coping strategies among local communities, with socio-economic resilience being related to key assets such as land and savings, alternative income sources, social networks and a supportive institutional context.   Working with our in-country partners, this work will directly inform regional and national agendas in both countries to develop climate strategies that maintain resilience of coffee/yields in high carbon landscapes.</narrative>
