   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Rhizo-Rice: a novel ideotype for deeper roots and improved drought tolerance</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Rice is a mainstay of global food security. Drought stress is a primary limitation to rice yields and is projected to worsen in the future due to the effects of global climate change. The development of rice cultivars with better drought tolerance is therefore an important strategic goal for global food security.  This project addresses this need by developing Rhizo-rice, new rice lines that have root traits that permit them to have both improved soil exploration and more efficient water capture under drought conditions. Rhizo-rice lines will have 1) steeper root growth angles, 2) fewer major roots, 3) greater root branching in deep soil, 4) increased formation of root air spaces (aerenchyma), which reduces the cost of root tissue, and 5) smaller water conductance vessels (xylem), which forces the plant to use soil water more sparingly. It is hypothesized that these traits will have much more value in combination than would be predicted from their isolated effects. This project will evaluate the benefits of Rhizo-rice lines in the field and computer simulation modelling and will discover genetic elements controlling Rhizo-rice root traits. Furthermore, we will evaluate these root traits in rice breeding lines in use in Thailand and will train Thai scientists in methods to incorporate root traits in rice breeding programs. This project integrates leading rice researchers and breeders in Thailand, leading crop physiologists in the UK and at the International Rice Research Institute in the Philippines, and leading root modelers in the UK.  We will investigate how different root architectures and drought conditions affect rice growth by measuring features of the root system in rice plants grown in different conditions. By recording the number, length and angle of different types of roots and taking microscopy images of the root structures, we will test how these features affect drought tolerance. These measurements will be complemented by computational modelling, which will enable us to test many different root structures and drought conditions. We have previously developed computational models to simulate root growth in maize, barley, common bean, lupin and squash. We will adapt these models to simulate rice root growth, which will enable us to predict the best type of root growth to maximise water uptake in drought conditions. Finally, we will determine which genes are responsible for creating the desirable root structures. We will use recently developed techniques to analyse the genes and root structures in many different varieties of rice, which will enable us to identify suitable varieties for maximising drought tolerance. This project will generate several tools to facilitate the breeding of more drought tolerant rice lines. It will validate specific root traits as selection targets in rice breeding; will discover genetic markers for these traits; will identify sources for desirable root traits in rice germplasm, and will enhance the ability of Thai scientists to create a team for breeding rice lines with superior root traits.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The overall goal of this project is to improve the drought tolerance of rice through multiple traits that interact to improve root water uptake. To achieve this goal we will validate Rhizo-rice, a novel ideotype consisting of 5 synergistic root traits: 1) steeper root growth angles, 2) reduced nodal root number, 3) redistribution of lateral root branching density to deeper soil strata, 4) increased formation of root cortical aerenchyma, and 5) smaller metaxylem vessel diameter. We propose to evaluate this ideotype in the field and in silico; to analyse the genetic architecture of these traits; phenotypically profile Thai breeding lines; and train Thai scientists in root biology and root phenotyping. Specific objectives are: 1) Test the hypothesis that these 5 root traits increase rooting depth, water capture, and yield among contrasting rice lines under drought stress in the field. Physiological analysis of contrasting phenotypes will be conducted in natural drought environments in Thailand and in intensively monitored field rainout shelters in IRRI.  2) Test the hypothesis that these traits are synergistic; i.e. that they are more beneficial in combination than predicted from their additive effects, and assess their utility across many possible environmental and phenotypic scenarios, through functional-structural modelling in SimRoot/rice, a new simulation tool to be developed in this project.  3) Discover genetic markers and candidate genes controlling these traits in rice, and sources of these traits in Thai germplasm, through Genome-Wide Association Analysis of a rice diversity panel, Quantitative Trait Loci analysis in Chromosome Segment Substitution Lines, and phenotypic profiling of Thai breeding lines. This information will be useful in developing markers for desirable root phenotypes in Thai breeding programs.  4) Improve the capacity for root biology research and root phenotyping in Thailand through a regional workshop, training at IRRI, and web outreach.  This project will develop new concepts and tools, including ideotypes, validated traits, genetic markers, parental lines, in silico tools, and human resources for the development of rice lines with deeper roots, and therefore improved yield under drought stress.</narrative>
