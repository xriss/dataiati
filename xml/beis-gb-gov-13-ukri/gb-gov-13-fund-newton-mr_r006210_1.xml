   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Newton RCUK-SEAMED - Assessing the health impacts of air pollution in Thailand</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Air pollution is an important preventable cause of illness and disease around the world. Pollution levels in many South East Asian countries are higher than are typically found in the UK and other European countries. In Thailand there are often unhealthy concentrations of ozone and airborne fine particulate matter in cities and towns. These pollutants are mostly caused by road traffic and industrial emissions. The pollution is regularly exacerbated by smoke (haze) from regional forest burning, which mostly affects the northern provinces of Thailand. Indoor air pollution levels are also higher in Thailand and other countries in the region than in the UK, which is partly because of ingress of outdoor pollutants, but is also due to second hand cigarette smoke and emissions from burning of charcoal, incense and other materials.   It is important for government, industry and other stakeholders in Thailand to have a good understanding of the health impact from indoor and outdoor pollutants. In particular, the number of people living with disease caused by air pollution and the annual number of premature deaths from air pollutants, linked to the main sources.  Knowledge of the health impacts is a prerequisite for developing appropriate intervention strategies to prevent future disease.   This project will collect a wide range of already available data on air pollution concentrations, population demographics, along with mortality and morbidity statistics. In addition, we will collect new data on indoor and outdoor pollution in urban and rural residences, and data on the time-activity patterns of a sample of the Thai population using a questionnaire.  We will carefully review the published scientific evidence for the associations between air pollutants and health to derive appropriate mathematical relationships that can be used to predict the impact of long-term exposure on the health of the Thai population. In addition, we will produce a model of pollution exposure to the Thai population based on the available data. The health impacts will be expressed as an annual numbers of premature deaths and the total number of population years that are lost or lived with disease (as disability-adjusted life years or DALYS). We will include a range of chronic diseases known to be caused by air pollution and diseases for which the evidence for an association is still emerging, although these data will be reported separately. Importantly, we will explicitly attempt to account for all uncertainties involved in the calculations so that we can express our evaluation in terms of the like range of impacts rather than as single figures. This approach is novel, and will allow us to identify the main sources of uncertainty in our estimates and make recommendations to improve the data available for future evaluations.   An important aspect of the project is early engagement with a wide range of stakeholders in Thailand to ensure we take account of a wide range of views and that we gain access to all relevant data.  At the end of the project we plan to re-engage with these stakeholders to start a dialogue about possible practical intervention strategies to reduce future risks.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project aims to carry out an assessment of the chronic health impact for the Thai population from indoor and outdoor air pollution sources, taking account of the uncertainties in the source data, to produce a likely range of impacts. We plan to use the results from this analysis to understand the best interventions to reduce the health burden of air pollution and to engage with national stakeholders.  The key objectives are:  1. Consult with air pollution stakeholders in Thailand and engage in awareness activities, including networking with other air pollution researchers working in Thailand. 2. Collect available published data on outdoor air pollution concentrations in Thailand, population data, background rates of mortality and morbidity in the country and other publicly available data that will inform the impact assessment. 3. Review the available epidemiological and toxicology data relevant to pollution in Thailand.    4. Undertake a programme of measurements in urban and rural homes in different parts of Thailand.  5. Undertake a survey on time-activity patterns for urban and rural populations. 6. Estimate the health impacts from air pollution using a novel probabilistic approach, subdivided by indoor and outdoor exposure. 7. Re-engage with air pollution stakeholders to communicate the findings and initiate a national debate about suitable interventions to reduce the health impact.</narrative>
