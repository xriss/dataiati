   <narrative xml:lang="EN">El Nino x forest resilience</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Ecological processes in Southeast Asian dipterocarp forests across three trophic levels operate at virtually unchanged rates in primary and logged forest. This resilience to forest modification, however, is conferred through functional redundancy: although the contribution of invertebrate functional groups (termites, ants, beetles and earthworms) to key ecosystem functions (litter decomposition, seed predation and removal, and invertebrate predation) is reduced by up to a half following logging, this was compensated for by increases in vertebrate abundance (small mammals, amphibians, insectivorous birds) that maintained levels of ecosystem function.  Here, I will examine the resilience of tropical forest ecosystem processes to an El Ni&#xF1;o event, focusing specifically on whether an El Ni&#xF1;o event disrupts the resilience of ecosystem processes to logging disturbance that has been previously demonstrated. There is indicative evidence to suggest this may be the case: for example, logging resulted in an 83% decrease in the density of reproductive trees during masting events and reduced seedling production by 85% in comparison to primary forest, and the mortality rate of seedlings in logged forest during El Ni&#xF1;o-associated drought is double that in primary forest.  Given the whole-system impacts expected in dipterocarp forests during an El Ni&#xF1;o event, I expect to find further changes to the functional composition of key invertebrate and vertebrate groups that may disrupt the resilience observed in non-El Ni&#xF1;o years. More formally, I test the hypothesis that: El Ni&#xF1;o events will act as a tipping point for logged forests, exhausting the already reduced functional redundancy and resulting in decreasing rates of key ecosystem processes. By contrast, those rates in primary forest will be maintained during El Ni&#xF1;o events due to their pre-existing reservoir of functional redundancy.   My approach will be to build on an unprecedented dataset that contains data on both biodiversity and ecosystem processes through time along a gradient of logging damage extending from primary through to salvage-logged forests. I will examine the data for any signs of threshold levels of logging damage beyond which resilience is lost. My explicit goal is to generate a broad picture of the interactive impacts of El Ni&#xF1;o and logging on the forest ecosystem as a whole, for which I will necessarily sacrifice detailed understanding of any one ecosystem process . I will achieve this by: 1. Experimentally quantifying a broad range of 15 ecosystem process rates across multiple trophic levels.  Data will encompass (a) Tree dynamics using repeat censuses of tree and seedling plots to determine (i) tree growth rates; (ii) tree mortality rates; (iii) forest productivity; (iv) tree fruiting and flowering patterns; (v) seedling growth rates; (vi) seedling mortality rates; and (vii) seed germination rates; (b) plant-animal interactions including (i) leaf herbivory rates; (ii) seed dispersal and (iii) seed predation rates; (c) animal-animal interactions including (i) invertebrate predation rates and (ii) ant competition intensity; and (d) nutrient recycling including (i) leaf litter decomposition rates; (ii) ant scavenging efficiency; and (iii) vertebrate scavenging efficiency. 2. Track corresponding temporal changes in the abundance and biomass of 26 plant and animal functional groups nested within seven broadly defined communities (Table 1b), covering all major trophic groups including early and late successional tree species, and vertebrate and invertebrate herbivores, predators, scavengers and omnivores., including: (a) (i) tree and (ii) seedling communities; (b) invertebrate communities, focusing on (i) total invertebrate biomass and the functional composition of (ii) ant and (iii) beetle communities; and (c) (i) small and (ii) large mammal communities.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The widespread and rapid logging of tropical forests may mean they are unable to withstand climate shocks such as El Ni&#xF1;o events.   Logging slashes the abundance of invertebrates like ants and earthworms, but vertebrates can take up their roles in the ecosystem. Invertebrates perform essential functions for the smooth running of the ecosystems in tropical forests. For example, creatures such as termites and millipedes help dead leaves decompose and release their nutrients back into the soil, and carnivorous ants and spiders act as predators of herbivorous invertebrates that would otherwise munch through all the foliage.  Nearly a half of all tropical rainforests worldwide have been logged, and this often causes heavy changes to the number and type of invertebrates, with many species being lost from the ecosystem. But when invertebrate diversity declines, their vital functions can be carried out by other members of the ecosystem, including vertebrates including rodents, birds and bats. Because of this, rainforest ecosystems have a remarkable resilience to change.   However, although the ecosystem can continue to function with vertebrates taking more of a leading role, the situation leaves rainforests vulnerable: the forest will keep maintaining itself, but it will be much more susceptible to further change. Relying on vertebrates is probably a bad tactic - they are less diverse and vulnerable to new challenges.  One such new challenge is the drought that accompanies El Ni&#xF1;o events. There is already evidence that El Ni&#xF1;o events can disrupt the resilience of ecosystem processes to logging disturbance. For example, the number of seedlings germinate and establish in logged forest during an El Ni&#xF1;o year is just one-sixth of the number that establish in primary forest during the same year.  What&apos;s more, those seedlings then die almost twice as fast in a logged forest during El Ni&#xF1;o than they do in primary forest.  This project will examine the resilience of tropical forest ecosystem processes to an El Ni&#xF1;o event, asking specifically whether El Ni&#xF1;o reduces the resilience of ecosystem processes to logging disturbance that otherwise keeps those forests functioning between El Ni&#xF1;o events. I will do this by comparing historical data collected in both primary and logged forests with new data that will be collected during the 2016 El Ni&#xF1;o event. My goal is to generate a broad picture of the interactive impacts of El Ni&#xF1;o and logging on the forest ecosystem as a whole, for which I will necessarily sacrifice detailed understanding of any one ecosystem process.  Instead, I will be looking at a very broad range of data types and measurements of how the forest works and what species are doing the jobs. The data will record the rate at which 15 ecosystem processes operate in primary and logged forest habitats, encompassing metrics of tree dynamics, interactions across plant and animal communities and nutrient recycling processes. These data will be compared to records on the abundance and biomass of 26 functional groups nested within seven plant and animal communities, covering all major trophic groups including early and late successional tree species, and vertebrate and invertebrate herbivores, predators, scavengers and omnivores.</narrative>
