   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Dynamics of Filovirus Infection in bats in Ghana</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The main scientific objective of the study is to determine key aspects of the dynamics of filovirus infections in reservoir bat species in Ghana, West Africa. An understanding of how these viruses persist in their natural hosts is necessary in order to identify the optimal local means of avoiding spillover of infection into humans, or into &apos;bridging&apos; domestic animal or wildlife species. Local public health responses to the presence of these infections, informed by local knowledge, can thus be enhanced. In order to deliver this objective, we will develop and validate the necessary assays for filoviruses in West African bats, based on the characterisation of filoviruses that persist in infected bat populations in Ghana. These will include optimised PCR assays and pseudotype virus-based serological assays.  An important parallel objective of this work is to add to ongoing capacity building efforts in West Africa, by extending the University of Cambridge collaboration with the University of Ghana (UG) and by building South-South collaborative networks to strengthen local response capabilities. We aim to fully equip the virology laboratory within WACCBIP to allow modern molecular analyses and cell-culture based pseudotype virus neutralisation studies. The Cambridge based CAPREx fellowship held by Dr Osbourne Quaye will be extended to include training in all of these approaches. Also, the virology laboratory in UG will be linked with the sequencing facility established at the University of Makeni, Sierra Leone by funding from the Wellcome Trust as part of a Cambridge-Africa supported post-Ebola legacy program.  Sequencing of all African viruses will be undertaken within the University of Makeni Infectious Disease Laboratory.  Specific scientific objectives include 1) Testing purposefully collected samples from bat roosts shown serologically to be infected with Ebola and/or Marburg viruses for the presence of filoviruses and the molecular characterisation (including isolation if possible) of the virus variants in the samples; in doing so, determining the variability of filoviruses both within individual bats and in populations.  2) Developing and standardising pseudotype virus-based neutralisation assays to determine serological responses to those viruses actually present in the infected roosts and to determine the age profiles of infected bats to identify key epidemiological patterns of how the viruses persist in their bat reservoirs.  3) Test prospectively collected longitudinal samples from infected bat roosts to allow estimation of rates of transmission of filoviruses between individual bats and also between different species of bats in Ghana.  4) Using our Ghana-specific filovirus serology assays, to expand on preliminary work using an Ebola Zaire sGp antigen-binding assay, to identify &quot;at risk&quot; groups of people for virus spillover, such as bat hunters, bat butchers and people who live and/or work underneath bat roosts. 5) Work with local Public Health officials to use the data derived from these studies to mitigate risks of further filovirus spillover to humans in West Africa.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This research aims to understand the enigma of how highly virulent viruses that cause lethal outbreaks in humans can persist in bat populations, without causing obvious death and disease in these animals. While some of the reasons likely relate to immune systems targeting the specific viruses, other reasons will relate to the ecology and lifestyles of the bats that host these viruses. When these viruses, which include Ebola and Marburg, transmit into the human population, they cause significant death and disease and occasional major epidemics, as in the recent West African Ebola crisis. If we understood how the viruses persist in their wildlife reservoir, we could identify mechanisms for spillover and develop better means of reducing the likelihood of outbreaks occurring in humans.  The programme will characterise the actual Ebola- and Marburg-like viruses (termed filoviruses) that infect bats in Ghana, West Africa, where preliminary testing has provided evidence of infection with both viruses. Using data from the characterisation, we will then develop specific tests for the viruses in Ghana, rather than using tests based on viruses found in other parts of Africa. This phase of the work will also characterise variability in Ebola and Marburg, and potentially other filoviruses, in their bat hosts, thereby providing important information for strategies to control them, such as how these viruses are transmitted and the effectiveness of medical interventions. The specific assays developed will include tests to detect viral genomes, which will be able to pick-up low levels of specific viruses as well as blood tests for immune responses to detect prior infection; an important feature is that the tests will be developed against the range of filoviruses actually infecting bats in Ghana.  Using these tests and working with our long-standing veterinary collaborator in the Ghana wildlife services, we will screen infected bat roosts in Ghana over the 2 year time period of this grant to obtain a picture of how viruses transmit amongst and between different species of bats in Ghana. This will allow us to distinguish whether, for example, Ebola persists at a low level, persistently infecting roosts, or whether the virus depends on spreading waves of infection involving many different interconnected bat roosts. This basic knowledge does not currently exist for filoviruses in bats.  We will also use our new tests to investigate the presence of past infection of people in Ghana, in particular in those with livelihoods that bring them in close contact with bats (e.g. hunting).  The work will be delivered through careful collaboration between UK-based and Ghanaian scientists, with a strong capacity building focus. Cambridge University has a major capacity building Cambridge-Africa programme that includes the University of Ghana as a specific partner. Dr Osbourne Quaye, the Ghanaian virologist leading the programme there, has benefitted from a visiting fellowship as part of that programme. This proposed programme will fully resource his laboratory with molecular and serological equipment and also allow for specific training in the specialist assays that will be developed with Dr Wright in Westminster. The field studies in Ghana will be led by Dr Richard Suu-Ire, who recently completed his PhD on bat virus infections in the University of Ghana, co-supervised by Professors Wood and Cunningham.  We will also establish South-South collaborative links between our Ghanaian collaborators and the University of Makeni Infectious Disease Laboratory (UniMak IDRL), Sierra Leone. This laboratory was established during and following the Ebola epidemic in West Africa with funding from Wellcome and the support of the Cambridge-Africa program to provide capacity in the area of genomics. The equipment within the UniMak IDRL was used during the Ebola epidemic in West Africa to provide real-time sequencing capability.</narrative>
