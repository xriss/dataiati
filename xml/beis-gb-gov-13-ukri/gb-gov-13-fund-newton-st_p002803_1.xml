   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Newton RCUK-CONACYT MUSCAT - a new technology large-format camera for the Large Millimeter Telescope</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Our general aim is to develop a next-generation large-format mm-wavelength camera, MUSCAT (Mexico-UK Sub-mm Camera for Astronomy), for the 50-m diameter Large Millimeter Telescope (LMT), using new detector technologies. The scientific competitiveness of the LMT, after the installation of MUSCAT in 2018, will significantly exceed all other existing single-dish mm and sub-mm observatories around the world. The technological development of MUSCAT will enable the LMT to conduct &quot;Big Science&quot; programs and fulfill one of CONACYTs key objectives identified in the RCUK-CONACYT Research Partnership call for proposals.   The MUSCAT camera will be developed in close collaboration between Mexican researchers at the Instituto Nacional de Astrofisica, Optica y Electronica (INAOE) and UK researchers at the University of Cardiff to provide full and in-depth technology transfer on detector design and fabrication, and instrument development at mm-THz wavelengths. The short-term scientific goals can be achieved within the timescale of this RCUK-CONACYT project, whilst the longer-term scientific objectives will be supported by a larger and sustainable collaborative network within both countries. It is anticipated that this instrument development project for the LMT, Mexico s largest scientific infrastructure, and the related technology transfer to Mexico with possibilities for future industrial and commercial applications, will encourage a more permanent scientific collaboration between the UK and Mexico.   In completing this project we will meet the following specific objectives:  1. Build a state-of-the-art mm-wavelength camera, MUSCAT, for the 50-m LMT capable of delivering unique world-class scientific observations and to support the growth of future sustainable Mexican and UK collaborations.  2. Conduct a focused scientific program, using MUSCAT on the 50-m LMT, to provide higher-resolution and higher-sensitivity follow-up of extragalactic and Galactic Herschel SPIRE surveys and SCUBA-2 surveys that will generate an increased scientific return and greater legacy value on the previous UK investment in Herschel and the JCMT, and the UK development of the SPIRE and SCUBA-2 instruments respectively.   3. Provide crucial technology transfer, and consolidation of a technology transfer program,  from the Astronomy Instrumentation Group (AIG) at Cardiff University to the LMT instrumentation group at INAOE that will enable Mexico to compete internationally in sub-mm and THz research within science and industry.   4. Develop an instrument capability that is scalable and flexible, utilizing emerging technologies, to meet the future demands of sub-mm instrumentation at the LMT.  With the support of RCUK-CONACYT funds, these focused project aims are designed to not only accelerate the capabilities of Mexican instrumentation and astronomy groups but also serve to provide a solid platform to enable future Mexican-UK collaborations to conduct &quot;Big Science&quot; astronomy. The conclusion of this project will also enable autonomous THz instrumentation development in Mexico across many areas of science and industry that are priority areas in the short-term and long-term strategic plan of CONACYT for the development of science, technologies and innovation (PECiTI). Although it is beyond the scope of this RCUK-CONACYT project, a long-term benefit of acquiring these imaging and spectroscopic detector technologies is the potential for Mexican commercial and industrial development of passive sub-mm wavelength cameras with applications in the priority area of national security (e.g. video-rate body-screening at airports, stadiums or large public events that require security checks, postal packaging checks, chemical (explosive, drug) analysis) and in medicine (e.g. non-invasive imaging to conduct screening for early stage cancers, ex-vivo biopsies, and dental screening and diagnosis, and THz spectroscopy for blood analysis).</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The scientific potential of any telescope, and the opportunity to make important new discoveries, is based not only the size of the primary mirror or the reflecting surface, but also on the performance of its scientific instruments. The Large Millimeter Telescope (LMT) is the world&apos;s largest telescope, with a diameter of 50-m, designed to operate at a wavelength of 1mm. The LMT has recently started scientific operations on the summit of Volcan Sierra Negra at an altitude of 4600m, in central Mexico. The LMT is Mexico&apos;s largest scientific project, however, in order to maintain its unique position in world astronomy in the future, the and effort made in the construction of this world-class facility must now be matched with an equally ambitious instrumentation development program to support the scientific objectives of the LMT.    The RCUK-CONACYT Research Partnership offers an exciting new opportunity to build a sustainable scientific collaboration between students and researchers in the UK and Mexico. This will result in a significant contribution to the development of the LMT scientific user-community in Mexico, and to the creation of an independent capability in Mexico to design and fabricate new-technology detectors operating at (sub-)mm (THz) wavelengths with applications both in astronomy and other areas of science and industry. This proposal will fund the construction of MUSCAT (Mexico-UK Sub-mm Camera for Astronomy),  a next-generation large-format camera for the LMT, as a collaborative project between the University of Cardiff and the Instituto Nacional de Astrofisica y Electronica. This state-of-the-art instrument will exploit the previous Mexican investment in the construction and operation of the Large Millimeter Telescope, and enable this new scientific infrastructure to conduct high-impact &quot;Big Science&quot; which will serve as an inspiration towards the formation of new generations of scientists, technicians and engineers in Mexico.    Our research partnership will transfer and exchange a wealth of scientific knowledge and experience in (sub-)mm astronomy between the UK and Mexico through a joint scientific-program that we hope to expand in the future beyond the completion of the RCUK-CONACYT Research Partnership. An element of this &quot;Big Science&quot; program will address fundamental questions related to the formation and evolution of structure over the full history of the Universe that are central to the LMT, as well as the ground-based James Clerk Maxwell sub-mm telescope and the satellite-borne SPIRE camera on the Herschel telescope. The data-products and research papers that will result from the combination of MUSCAT observations on the LMT with the archival data from the JCMT and Herschel will enhance the legacy-value of both the latter facilities and provide a greater scientific-return on the UK investment in these two transformative telescopes.   The RCUK-CONACYT project will also transfer skills and expertise in THz technologies and instrumentation that currently does not exist in Mexico. With a wide range of commercial applications in industry and applied sciences, this technology transfer from the UK to Mexico can enable long-term economic development and provide additional social benefits in priority sectors of the CONACYT strategic special programme for science, technology and innovation such as health, telecommunications, space-sciences, and national security.</narrative>
