   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The true extent of lives destroyed and communities broken because of the growing human trafficking challenge in Kenya is not fully known. National policies are not being implemented and the complex impact on people, communities, economic development and conflict is not systematically documented. There are gaps in quantitative human trafficking data and not all victims are given victim status, further complicating the picture. This collaborative research between Leeds Beckett University (UK) and Haart Kenya responds to a limited window of opportunity for the development of new approaches to counter human trafficking interventions in Kenya, which depends upon timely collection and exploitation of experiential research data. By collecting data from victims and those at risk of human trafficking, this project will raise their voices through using empowering narrative research methods. Having already developed relationships with policy-makers, Haart are well positioned to advocate for change, but to have greater impact they need research data that can convey the complexity of trafficking streams and the impacts of trafficking on victims. Building on a track record of research in areas of violent conflict using arts and narrative, Leeds Beckett will support the data collection, capacity building and dissemination of results for policy influence. This research will use narrative inquiry to elicit experiential knowledge, engage multiple perspectives, and draw out meaning about the nature of harm and injustice in human trafficking. A locally hired researcher will work with Haart&apos;s local networks to collect stories and narratives from victims and those at risk. By applying narrative inquiry, the research findings will demonstrate the needs of victims and patterns in trafficking streams. To meet the needs of policy makers and influencers, the results will be disseminated through a range of media, including film, exhibition, a stakeholder forum,  research reports and academic papers. The research will use an empowering research method which allows victims to control what they share and makes their voices heard. It will be embedded for longer term change and impact. As a result of this project the Kenyan MP&apos;s SDGS Caucus and other policy makers in Kenya will be more likely to effect rapid change and improvements in counter human trafficking policy; policy makers will be able to make better informed decisions about policy development related to preventing trafficking streams and meeting the needs of victims, and to respond to specific challenges; the stakeholder forum will use the research papers to work together on policy reform; Haart will expand and increase the effectiveness of the policy component of its work; and participants will understand how sharing their stories will lead to improving conditions and reduced risk for others in the future.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="The aim of this research is to fill a knowledge gap by uncovering new insights into the complex threats and impacts of human trafficking in Kenya through the study of the lived experience of those involved. Whilst most research on human trafficking is conducted within the frameworks of law, migration or development, this research will draw on arts and humanities methodologies that recognise cultural context and lived experience (ethnography, storytelling and narrative, life histories and film). This approach enables the gathering and sharing of experiential data from those who have been, or at risk of being, trafficked, bringing their voices into the policy making process. This data will be combined with existing datasets to reveal patterns and opportunities for new policies and approaches to countering human trafficking in Kenya. Policy engagement will be achieved through the use of narratives and stories to demonstrate and communicate the research findings.   We will achieve this aim through the following objectives: 1. To collect and analyse new narrative data from victims of human trafficking in Kenya. 2. To develop innovative and creative ways of presenting and communicating the results to policy makers to maximise their exploitation and impact. 3. By doing so, to influence policy makers and influencers in the development and implementation of Kenya&apos;s counter human trafficking and protection policies.  4. To develop Haart&apos;s research capacity in narrative inquiry for longer term change and impact.  The milestones we will monitor are: 1. Researcher and Haart staff confidently trained in methodologies and provided with online support set up.  2. New data is available and uploaded to secure shared drive and findings agreed with the research team. 3. The research findings are set out in engaging reports, exhibition and film. 4. To run events and meetings for stakeholders to discuss policy development and implementation based on research findings."></capital-spend>
