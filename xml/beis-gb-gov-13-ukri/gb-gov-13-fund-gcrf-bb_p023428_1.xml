   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Rice is the most important staple crop in the developing world. It has been estimated that over three billion people in Asia rely on rice to provide 30 to 75% of their calories. The most widely used method for cultivating rice involves germinating the seeds in nurseries and transplanting the seedlings to flooded &apos;paddy&apos; fields. This puddled transplanted rice (PTR) method accounts for ~55% of global rice cultivation and ~75% of world production. However, in many parts of South and Southeast Asia, farmers are switching to direct seeded rice (DSR) because the availability of labour and water is in decline and their associated costs are rising. A similar transition is also occurring in West Africa. To obtain a good crop using DSR it is imperative that the seeds germinate quickly in the soil and that the seedlings grow vigorously. However, because breeders have focused on developing varieties for PTR there has been little or no selection for seed vigour. Agronomists have highlighted a need for the development of new rice varieties with improved seed vigour so that they perform better in dry direct seeded conditions. The first aim of this project is to identify which genes are responsible for controlling seed vigour in rice by filming the germination of ~1000 different rice varieties that have had their genomes sequenced and identifying the key genetic differences that are associated with strong vigour. This knowledge can be used by breeder to develop new varieties. The second aim of this project is to determine whether the shoot growth of existing elite semi-dwarf rice varieties can be improved by enhancing the production of the plant growth regulator gibberellin in a specific seedling tissue called the mesocotyl. The increase in mesocotyl elongation could help seedlings to emerge from the soil when the seed has been planted at a greater depth. This is a key weakness of current varieties.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="The overarching aim of this project is to assist in the genetic improvement of rice varieties for enhanced seed vigour in dry direct-seeded conditions.  1) New high-throughput laboratory phenotyping platforms at the John Innes Centre and Rothamsted Research will be adapted to screen for seed vigour in a large diversity panel of ~1000 re-sequenced rice accessions provided by the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI).   2) Multiple component traits associated with seed vigour will be measured in the laboratory including seed size, germination, initial root and shoot growth rates and the relative contribution of specific tissues (1st leaf, coleoptile, mesocotyl, radicle, lateral and adventitious roots). The speed and uniformity of seedling establishment will also be scored at three planting depths in small-scale field experiments performed in parallel on the same material by IRRI.  3) Statistical analysis of the relationships between all the component traits measured in the laboratory and field will be carried out and Genome Wide Association Studies will be performed in order to identify genes and alleles that confer stronger seed vigour and can be used for molecular breeding.  4) One of the causes of poor seed vigour in modern high-yielding semi-dwarf rice varieties is known to be the loss of mesocotyl elongation. A comparative transcriptomic analysis will be performed on rice accessions with short and long mesocotyls using RNA-seq to provide additional insight into the regulation of this key trait.  6) Mesocotyl-specific gene promoters identified by the transcriptomic analysis will also be used to drive the expression of the gibberellin biosynthetic enzyme GA20ox2 in a modern semi-dwarf rice variety in order to increase mesocotyl length in a targeted manner and thereby improve seedling emergence."></capital-spend>
