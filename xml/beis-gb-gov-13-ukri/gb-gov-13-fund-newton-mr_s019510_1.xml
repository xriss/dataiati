   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Recently, Brazil has been affected by unexpected and explosive epidemics of insect-transmitted viruses (arboviruses), most notably Zika, chikungunya, dengue, and yellow fever viruses. The huge economic burden of the Zika epidemic in Brazil and the widespread presence of urban mosquitos in the country highlight an urgent need for accurate predictions of disease spread, particularly in large, densely populated regions. Our UK-Brazil Partnership (CADDE) will enhance and expand an excellent existing collaborations, with the aim of anticipating and controlling future epidemics of arboviruses in Brazil. It is our vision for CADDE to become a strategic centre of excellence for research in South America that focuses on providing timely analysis, based on genomic, epidemiological and geographic evidence, to anticipate and control transmission of arboviruses, today and in the future..  Our research questions include: 1) What arboviruses circulate in human, mosquito and reservoir populations in Brazil? 2) Where and how do arboviruses persist during non-epidemic periods? 3) What are the biological and medical implications of the genetic diversity of circulating arboviruses and of mutations in their genomes? 4) What factors control the transformation of a single introduction of a new arbovirus into human populations into sizeable epidemic, and 5) how quickly can we detect and characterise such epidemics, and how best to respond? Active virus surveillance in vectors and reservoirs will be combined with seroprevalence surveys in blood donors (to characterise features such as virus genomics, transmission, and immunity). Novel portable genome sequencing technologies and modern real-time epidemiological analyses will be applied to the most important arboviruses in Brazil.  Using modern techniques that can unify the information from genomics and epidemiology, CADDE will strengthen the evidence base for public health actions, and strengthen the capacity of Brazilian health system to respond to emerging arboviral diseases. We will transform local capacity by training research scientists and public health personnel in field epidemiology, laboratory testing, the use of portable genomic technologies, and computational and statistical methods.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Brazil-UK Centre for Arbovirus Discovery, Diagnosis, Genomics and Epidemiology (CADDE) will strengthen the scientific basis of public health protection in Brazil, and enhance the capacity of the Brazilian health and research systems to prepare for, and respond to, current and future outbreaks of emerging and re-emerging arboviruses. CADDE is a team comprising researchers from four Brazilian and three UK institutions who will jointly address critical questions in arbovirus epidemiology and public health.  The aim of CADDE is to rapidly discover, detect and characterize new emerging pathogens using innovative genomic and epidemiological techniques, and to use this information to anticipate and control the spread and establishment of arboviral diseases of national and international importance. CADDE has four primary objectives. Objective 1 covers the development, validation and application of novel genome sequencing technologies to characterise known and unknown arboviruses in human populations, in sentinel vector (mosquito) populations, and in non-human reservoirs. Objective 2 covers the analysis of epidemiological surveillance data, both retrospectively and in real-time, using mathematical and geographic approaches to better understand and predict transmission. Objective 3 covers the integration of genetic and epidemiological data, in order to quantify arboviral transmission and inform arbovirus disease control. Objective 4 will ensure the maximum impact of the previous scientific goals, via engagement with policy makers and through capacity-building and technology-transfer initiatives, with the aim of improving the preparedness of the Brazilian research and health systems to future arboviral diseases outbreaks. Further background and full details of these objectives can be found in our Case for Support.</narrative>
