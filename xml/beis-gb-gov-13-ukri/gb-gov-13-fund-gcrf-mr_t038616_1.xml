   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Addressing Perinatal Depression in Deprived Areas of Istanbul, Turkey</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In Turkey, the prevalence rate of perinatal depression has been estimated to be between 20%-40%, reflecting the global average of 25%. Despite its enormous burden, perinatal depression in Turkey remains under-recognized and under-treated. In recent decades, large scale rural to urban migration has contributed to the breakdown of traditional family support systems and inequalities that increase the risk of perinatal depression. Unplanned urban populations are also characterised by inadequate specialist mental health facilities. The World Health Organization (WHO) has highlighted the need for psychological interventions, such as group therapies, that can be integrated into existing health care systems.  Our project has the following objectives:  Objective 1: To develop, and test for feasibility, a group-version of an evidence-based psychological therapy for perinatal depression, based on WHO Guidelines.  This will be achieved by: -Consulting stakeholders and experts to develop manualised training, supervision and delivery procedures for a group psychological intervention delivered by nurses running antenatal care schools in deprived urban areas of Istanbul. The intervention will be adapted from the existing individually-administered WHO Thinking Healthy Programme for perinatal depression. -Conduct a pilot/feasibility study of the intervention in a socioeconomically deprived population in Istanbul.   Objective 2: To build research capacity at the Department of Social Paediatrics, Marmara University, Istanbul, in conducting large-scale randomised controlled trials in maternal and child mental health. This will be achieved by: -Conducting two workshops in research methods tailored for early and mid-career researchers in low and middle income countries. -Providing ongoing supervision to these researchers.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Why is it important to address depression in women during pregnancy   Worldwide, depression during pregnancy affects about one in four women. The situation is similar in Turkey. The majority of these women do not receive any treatment. Untreated depression causes great suffering not only to the woman, but also affects the relationship between the mother and infant. It can lead to impaired brain development and poor growth in the infant in the long-term. Timely treatment can prevent these complications.  Perinatal depression be treated effectively with &apos;talking therapies&apos;. One of the most effective talking therapies, the Thinking Healthy Programme, was developed by Rahman and his team in Pakistan. The programme was adopted by the World Health Organization as its official first-line treatment for perinatal depression. However, the programme was developed for close-knit rural communities and delivered individually to rural women by community health workers. In big cities like Istanbul, rapid migration from rural areas can lead to breakdown of traditional family and community support which may increase the  risk of depression. In High Income countries, group therapies have been shown to be effective and deliverable at lower cost. These may also be very useful for communities in which support networks are disrupted. There is currently no group version of the Thinking Healthy Programme.   Objectives of the project  The objectives of this project are two-fold:  Objective 1. To adapt the well-established WHO Thinking Healthy Programme so it can be delivered to groups of women in deprived urban areas of Istanbul and to test the programme in selected antenatal hospitals in deprived districts of the city.   Objective 2. To build capacity of researchers at Marmara University so they can undertake future large-scale studies in this important but neglected area of public health.   How will we address our objectives  The study will be conducted in 6 public hospitals serving low socioeconomic districts in  Istanbul. These hospitals run regular antenatal classes for women from very poor backgrounds. We will integrate our intervention in these hospitals.   Objective 1: This will be achieved in two phase. In the formative phase, we will talk to groups of all key stakeholders, including women, their partners and nurses who deliver the intervention. We will hold a workshop with local specialists and experts to adapt the intervention to the group-delivery format. In the feasibility phase, we will compare the adapted &apos;group&apos; Thinking Healthy programme (intervention) with routine Antenatal classes (control). Both interventions will be delivered to 120 women, randomly divided into intervention and control groups. Our aim is to explore if the new intervention is feasible and acceptable to all our stakeholders, the training and supervision procedures work, and to test the tools required  a future large-scale studies. We will use both qualitative and quantitative methods to explore these issues.  Objective 2: Through our previous work in South Asia, we have developed a special course to train new researchers in designing and evaluating interventions for mental health in low and middle income countries. We will conduct two workshops aimed at training researchers at Marmara University in this comprehensive course. The content of the course includes design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of interventions in low- and middle-income countries.   How we will use the results of our project  We will work closely with the World Health Organization to incorporate our findings into the revised &apos;group&apos; version of the Thinking Healthy Programme which will be disseminated to all member countries through the WHO&apos;s flagship mental health gap action programme. Our partners at Marmara University are ideally placed to scale-up the intervention to other districts in Istanbul. We will publish papers in journals and present at conferences.</narrative>
