   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Why we Disagree about Resilience: epistemology, methodology and policy space for integrated disaster risk management</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Resilience programming often draws on technical science to highlight its benefits, yet little systematic work has studied the role of science in shaping resilience policy trajectories. Improved knowledge of how science is used by different actors and interests in resilience policy processes is important of resilience is to help build inclusive, transparent and just development. This calls for a better understanding of why specific actors prefer certain kinds of scientific knowledge when making the case for resilience, how languages of science alienate or support specific actor groups, and if the worldviews projected through individual science traditions preference particular kinds of policy response and outcomes from calls for resilience.   Thinking of science as integral to policy processes and arguments moves analysis past linear explanations of risk communication and places science within governance systems. This allows much more fine grained explanation of where and why science is used and by whom, and opens questions about the duties of scientists as actors in governance systems - not as neutral experts acting from the outside of governance processes. Opening up a systematic research agenda on the role of science in resilience can draw upon mature work of this kind on risk governance. Opening up to the justice implications of specific science-policy relationships is made timely by the heightened role given to science by the UN Sendai Framework for Action 2015-30. Here science is called upon to help innovate, monitor and evaluation but also to convene of risk management policy. The convening role of science is little explored within disaster risk management and work is needed that can help policy actors learn how to use science to provide shared spaces for common dialogue around contentious topics like resilience and to avoid resilience becoming a tool for policy domination and capture.   Opening a research agenda on the role of science in governance for risk and resilience requires a transdisciplinary approach - one that combines interdisciplinarty with stakeholder coproduction. The proposed project will combine political philosophy and critical social science to ask questions of duty and power to science production processes, review participatory methods used to describe resilience and bring together experience from hazards mapping and visualisation and arts and performance methods to provide multiple methods that can surface different interpretations of resilience. Performance based methods will allow for interpretive and emotional aspects of resilience to be presented and contrast with geographical information systems using spatially defined hazard and social attributes for specific places. The framing of questions, methods and analysis will also incorporate stakeholders from each of the three pilot study sites: Cape Town (Philippi), Manila (Tay Tay) and Nairobi (Kibera). These were chosen because of existing research partnerships and ongoing resilience policy and programming that can be augmented by the proposed work. Nairobi and Cape Town are also members of the Rockerfeller 100 Cities programme.   Research impact planning has commenced in the pre-proposal planning stage and will be developed from the start of the project through collaboration with city practitioners and policy makers. City partners have been enthusiastic to collaborate in a project that can help surface competing visions of resilience and how resilience can be used to secure desirable futures from the perspectives of competing urban stakeholders. Partners are keen to compare experiences and lessons learnt form the proposed work and take these forward. The project will produce a single policy brief for each city and two academic papers. It will also convene workshops in London and Warwick to bring practitioners and scientists together to collaborate in research design and in the verification and fine tuning dissemination of results.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed research has five objectives. These are interdependent. As with any interdisciplinary project that seeks to develop original methods and insights and use this to mobilise a new network and community of scholars and practitioners, multiple objectives will be approached simultaneously. This said the in order of priority research objectives are:  1. To build a group of applied researchers that can bring AHRC, ESRC and NERC science to better examine resilience.  Established relationships between ERSC (Pelling) and NERC (Malamud, Millington and Taylor) scientists have been developed through the DFID-ESRC Urban ARK programme and recent NERC SHEAR project. During pre-project work and as a core objective of the proposed research these will be strengthened and extended through collaboration with AHRC science (Sitas and Hyams). Further research community building will be achieved through reaching out to the international science network Integrated Research in Disaster Risk, and within the UK to the UK Alliance on Disaster Research.   2. To connect the academic community to a practitioner network demanding more comprehensive framings of resilience policy.   The project draws on relationships between individual project researchers and city level partners: Pelling, Malamud and Taylor have worked with KDI in Nairobi, Pelling and Blackburn have worked with the Ateneo and Christian Aid in Manila and internationally Ziervogel and Sitas have worked with Cape Town City. These individual relationships are successful and trusted, and will be strengthened through the proposed project which will bring these partners together. Collaboration provides the context for comparative methods development and for horizontal practitioner learning. Subsequent work will build from these relationships and to offer these practitioners as advocates and to build demand for wider transdisciplinary resilience work across these cities and in other cities. Existing partnerships with the Rockerfeller 100 Resilient Cities and with networks like ICLEI (Local Governments for Sustainability) will support this process.  3. Open a research and policy learning agenda on the role of science in resilience programming.  Despite improved knowledge, risk and loss continue to grow, especially for the urban poor. Governance is at the heart of this challenge and central is the role played by science and its interaction with interests in the city that together determine and give legitimacy to the framing of resilience policy and its deployment. This goes beyond the communication of science to understanding science as an integral part of urban risk governance. The foundational work proposed here seeks to open a research agenda on this question, drawing from existing research on the social production of risk.   4. Question ethical obligations and duties of justice arising from &apos;expert&apos; science deployment.  Justice concerns have long been a motivator for social science research on risk and urban governance, yet they have seldom directly engaged political philosophy. The project will open future research and policy questions on the role and duties accruing to science and scientists working on resilience.  5. Examine opportunities for methodological innovation in the visualisation of resilience.  Past work has used GIS (including participatory GIS) to describe states of resilience, scenario methods have been deployed to open discussion on future states and performative methods have been used to help actors understand the textures of resilience they live through. These methods have seldom been brought together to help resolve disagreements on what resilience is and what future resilience might look like from diverse actor viewpoints. Examining how science methods are received and reacted to by participants in interdisciplinary workshops will help better position a range of science approaches to facilitate open dialogue in future research and practical work.</narrative>
