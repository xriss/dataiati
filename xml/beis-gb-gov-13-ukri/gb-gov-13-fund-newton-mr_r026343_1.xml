   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Fighting AMR of hard-to-reach microbial pathogens by repurposing antibiotics using a targeted liposomal delivery strategy: A Helicobacter pilot study</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Background: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a major threat to global health, particularly in low-income countries, where access to antibiotics is less restricted, leading to frequent overuse. This in turn leads to increasing failure of previously efficacious antibiotics to eradicate infection. H. pylori (Hp) is a bacterium infecting 80% of adults and 70% of children In Vietnam. In comparison, prevalence is &lt;15% in many parts of the UK. The increasing prevalence of AMR strains is the crucial cause for failure in controlling Hp, leading to higher medical costs, and increased mortality and morbidity from related diseases. A 2015 study in Vietnam found 42.4% strains resistant to clarithromycin, 41.3% to levofloxacin, and 76.1% to metronidazole.   ODA compliance: Hp is the main cause of gastrointestinal ulcers and stomach cancer. The high prevalence of disease and a high rate of reinfection in Vietnam is thought to depend on the low socioeconomic status, e.g. crowded living and poor hygienic conditions. There is now a huge discrepancy between low income and affluent countries in terms of Hp prevalence and related diseases, such as gastric cancer. The latter is the 4th most common type of cancer in Vietnam, but only the 16th in the UK. The impact of Hp is particularly strong on the more vulnerable sections of the population; cancer (e.g. gastric cancer caused by Hp) is a significant cause of impoverishment associated with the costs of its treatment in vulnerable sections of the Vietnamese population, pushing many households into poverty. Therefore, our project, which is designed to train Vietnamese scientists and clinicians in cutting-edge advanced drug delivery, empowering the Vietnamese health system to develop and ultimately make available this new treatment to the general population. Hence it is likely to lead to long term socioeconomic benefits to poorer sections of the Vietnamese population, in line with official development assistance principles. One cause underlying the failure of antimicrobial treatment to eradicate Hp infection is the low accessibility of the drug to the bacterium, underneath the thick mucus and in crypts. Further factors are the short retention times of drugs in the stomach, and the susceptibility of some antibiotics to stomach acid. As a result, some antibiotics which are highly effective against Hp in vitro have failed in vivo. Solving these two problems, by increasing the gastric retention time and protecting the antibiotics from the stomach acid, would increase efficacy of treatment in eradicating Hp infection while allowing the use of existing antibiotics which currently cannot be used. Repurposing of antibiotics is a very cost-effective strategy to fast-track the drug development process.  Our long term aim is to contribute to improve the health of the population in Vietnam by reducing the prevalence of GI ulcers and gastric cancer. We suggest solving the problem of short gastric retention times and gastric acid inactivation by using functionalized liposomes. These will adhere to the gastric epithelium and mucus due to the addition of two Hp adhesins (BabA and LabA) on their surface. The increased gastric retention of drugs encapsulated in the functionalized liposomes will be verified in vivo using NanoSPECT-CT imaging, which we have successfully tested in mice. Binding of functionalized liposomes to epithelial cells will be assessed in vitro by measuring binding to human gastric cell line AGS stably transfected with human MUC5AC, a mucin which contains the physiological ligands of BabA and LabA used for liposome functionalization. Screening of ~600 clinical Hp isolates from both the UK and Vietnam will allow us to identify various levels of AMR and allow us to test the efficacy and safety (e.g. cell toxicity) of our functionalized liposomes in vitro. Finally, the ability of this formulation to eradicate Hp will be assessed in vivo using am established murine infection model.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Helicobacter pylori (Hp) infects half of the world&apos;s population and is the leading cause of gastric ulcers and cancer. While the prevalence has declined steadily in high income countries, due to appropriate hygienic standards and the existence of various first line or rescue therapies, it remains very high in low income countries. This has led some authors to suggest that Hp should be added to the list of 18 Neglected Tropical Diseases recognised by the World Health Organisation. In many Asian countries, including Vietnam, gastric cancer is a leading cause of death. Additionally, there is a rising failure of drugs to eradicate Hp infections due to steadily increasing antimicrobial resistance. Important drugs commonly used for first line treatment of Hp, such as Metronidazole and Clarithromycin, are becoming obsolete in Vietnam. We are aiming to create an efficient drug delivery platform which can be used to combat the increasing resistance of Hp as the leading cause of gastric cancer in Vietnam (and elsewhere in low income countries).  Objective 1) In the long term, to improve socioeconomic status and public health in Vietnam by combating the leading cause of gastric ulcers and cancer (the fourth most common cause of cancer in Vietnam). This will be achieved by the development of a novel therapy for Hp infection, based on the use of functionalized liposomes with encapsulated antibiotics. This follows a three-pronged strategy: A) functionalization of liposomes with the same adhesins used by Hp for attachment to the gastric epithelium, resulting in increased gastric retention times and close physical proximity of the drug-loaded liposomes with the bacteria, also in difficult-to-reach locations such as the gastric mucosa and crypts, B) Protection of antibiotics from the acidic gastric milieu which degrades some antibiotics, and C) direct delivery to the intended site of action (of beta-lactams such as Amoxicillin) after fusion with the outer membrane of Gram-negative Hp, and direct destabilisation by incorporation of small amounts of linolenic acid, which has been shown to have a direct microbicidal effect on Hp.  Addresses the following problems: insufficient retention time of  antibiotics in the stomach (increasing exposure time of pathogen to drug), inactivation of antibiotics by acidic gastric environment, prevents AMR mechanisms based on reduced porin uptake by bypassing this step in Gram-negative bacteria  Objective 2) Large scale assessment of antimicrobial susceptibility to commonly used antibiotics of ~500 HP clinical isolates (approx. 400 from the UK and 100 from Vietnam) following British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy (BSAC) guidelines, using validated Etest from bioMerieux, the leading manufacturer for antimicrobial testing.  Addresses the following problems: lack of knowledge of increase of antimicrobial resistance since last survey in Vietnam and identification of antibiotics that could be repurposed (see objective 3) Objective 3) Repurposing of antibiotics that are effective on Hp in vitro, but failed to work in vivo. The development of new antibiotics is a lengthy and expensive process. It is economically more viable if existing antibiotics can be repurposed, making such a solution more accessible to low income countries such as Vietnam. This will be achieved by assessing the efficacy of three antibiotics, which have been shown to act on Hp in vitro but have been unsuccessful in vivo, on multiply resistant Hp strains: erythromycin, cefixime and tigecycline. Based on their documented inefficacy in vitro, these antibiotics have not been used in Hp treatment, but we believe that they can be used with our technology. Addresses the following problems: increasing inefficacy of antibiotics used for standard first line chemotherapy such as clarithromycin and metronidazole by allowing repurposing of antibiotics active in vitro, but not in vivo due to the gastric environment and short retention.</narrative>
