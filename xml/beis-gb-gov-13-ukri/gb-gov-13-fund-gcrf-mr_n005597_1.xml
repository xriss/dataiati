   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Verbal Autopsy with Participatory Action Research (VA-PAR): Developing a people-centred health systems research methodology</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Recent estimates suggest that two-thirds of the world&apos;s deaths pass unrecorded. This situation seriously limits the ability of health systems to respond to the needs of vulnerable and excluded populations. Developing methods to reliably understand why people die in populations with weak health systems is therefore an important strategy for saving lives.   Registering medical cause of death has long been considered essential for public health. Despite increasing globalisation, in many resource-poor countries, universal registration of vital events remains lacking and uncertain estimates provide an inadequate basis for policy and planning. In addition, the social inequalities and social contexts play an important role in shaping health for disadvantaged groups. Even with the data available, insufficient attention is paid to the root causes of mortality in resource poor settings.  Considering these factors, there is an urgent need to improve health information about and for marginalised populations to inform public health responses. The proposed research will develop an extension to an established method called Verbal Autopsy (VA). VA is used to measure the levels and causes of death in populations where large numbers die outside health facilities or without registration. The development will help local health systems to assess their own health situations, identify priorities and develop action plans for positive health change.   We will do this through three phases of work.  - Firstly, we will develop improved ways to classify causes of death by combing information on medical causes with data on the circumstances of deaths (seeking and using care at the time of death). In settings where health services are under-funded, weak and fragmented, these can often play a crucial role. The classifications will also be developed in consultation with local health planners to be of practical use. - Secondly, we will develop an additional method to gain the views of local communities on long-standing health challenges. This will allow us to further understand how social, economic and health systems issues influence availability, accessibility, acceptability, and quality of care. The method may also help foster social inclusion in health.  - In the final phase, we will consult with higher levels of the health system about the method. This will help develop how we use the extended cause of death classifications combined with community knowledge. The aim here is to explore how the method could be used in an ongoing fashion to connect health surveillance to service organisation in an inclusive process. This approach encourages sustainable health gains.  Data, poverty and inequality exist in complex co-dependency: less data exist on the health of the poor than the rich, raising important questions about the relationship between material and data poverty. In settings where health systems are fragile and under-resourced, where new burdens of disease are rapidly emerging, and where large and diverse populations are excluded from access to health care, innovative approaches that connect the registration of vital events to health care systems in a people-centred approach are needed.    The approach employs a bottom up philosophy connecting with population data at source. In the longer term, it is envisaged that the method will contribute to more rigorous health data at population level in an inclusive process that can affect sustainable health gains through better data and improved capacity for evaluation.   The work will be conducted in an research centre in rural South Africa established for over 20 years. The extent of data available and the richness of experience in health research allows us to develop a method with partners who enact a broader commitment to registration of all individuals within a population.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The central aim of the proposed work is to develop a method to integrate cause-of-death (COD) findings from Verbal Autopsy (VA) with community assessments of care. The method will assess health needs, identify priorities and develop actionable plans for positive change.   The approach taken is consistent with a people-centred health systems research paradigm. The main objective is to develop an approach that connects interdisciplinary health surveillance to service organisation in an inclusive process that can affect sustainable health gains through better data and improved capacity for evaluation. Fulfilling this aim will generate better knowledge on complex health problems, more effective actions and improved outcomes.   The specific objectives are to: 1. Develop biosocial classifications of cause of death (COD) for routine health systems use: Secondary analyses of three census rounds of the 2012 WHO VA in an established health and demographic surveillance site (HDSS) in rural South Africa (approximately 3,000 deaths) will be conducted. Information on medical causes will be combined with new indicators on social and health systems determinants to develop a generalisable system for use sub-district/district level to routinely capture the social and health systems determinants of unregistered deaths. 2. Develop a process to collect routine data on relational aspects of health systems: Here we will develop and explore a Participatory Action Research (PAR) process with local service users and providers in the same location to review and further amplify the extended COD classifications with local knowledge. Through collective analysis we will develop additional data on causes, priorities for local services, and consider the potential for co-benefits related to empowerment and social inclusion. This objective will explore the explanatory potential of routine participatory adjuncts for health and demographic surveillance.  3. Assess the utility and feasibility of the VA-PAR process as scalable option for health information systems. In the final phase we will develop an initial understanding of the requirements for scaling to an ongoing process at higher levels of the health system (provincial/national). Achieving this objective will develop an understanding taking knowledge and action derived from the method &apos;beyond the local&apos;.   The specific objectives are sequential and contribute to the overall objective in a stepwise fashion. The VA-PAR method will bring together explanatory insights of complete mortality registration with community views on lived experiences of health and illness in an approach connected to the health system at different levels. The main output is a practical and integrated method based on core standards that is contextually relevant at health systems level and provides improved data and capacity for evaluation. The Development Grant research will also produce evidence of practical use for the study setting.   The research responds to WHO&apos;s current effort to develop vital statistics systems in low and middle income countries (LMICs) and to the growing recognition of the importance of vital registration and mortality surveillance. Related to a broader commitment to detailed, ongoing registration of all individuals within a population, this information is critical for people-centred public health planning, budgeting and resource allocation.   The proposed research will also provide the researchers with insights into how to combine VA and PAR, and how to develop an integrated people-centred health systems strengthening approach capable of generating evidence of practical relevance research method for health systems application. Achievement of this will enable the researchers to formulate a competitive full-scale proposal to further apply and evaluate the VA-PAR method in other HDSSs to further apply and evaluate the method in terms of costs, contextual relevance, sustainability and scalability.</narrative>
