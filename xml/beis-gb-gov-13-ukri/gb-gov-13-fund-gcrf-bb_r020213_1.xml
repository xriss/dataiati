   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Livestock are a major component of agricultural economies which typically predominate in low and middle income
countries. Infectious diseases of livestock have the potential to cause severe hardship among farmers and maintaining
healthy animals has a key role in poverty reduction through improving the profitability of livestock keeping. Vaccination is a
crucial weapon in the fight against infectious diseases including transboundary animal diseases that have often been
controlled in much of the developed world but still cause great human and animal hardship in developing countries.
Livestock vaccines often represent significant costs in disease control programmes but their quality can be variable and
they are often poorly evaluated leading to uncertainty over their effectiveness. Vaccines and vaccination programmes
designed in the developed world are often adopted as control measures in developing countries where they may or may
not be fully effective for a wide variety of reasons.
There is no substitute for local research to understand why vaccines work or fail in a particular setting and to ensure that
scarce resources are not wasted on ineffective control measures. Techniques required for this type of research already
exist; many are not resource intensive and are suitable for countries with limited funding. However, a much broader
translation of this existing knowledge into practical ground-level research that directly informs disease control strategies is
needed. This represents a significant gap which the current sporadic and expensive training courses do not fill.
Advancement in these areas has potential to make a real impact on optimising disease control policy and the allocation of scarce resources.
The partnership between Pirbright, EuFMD and SACIDS is well established, based on joint training and research projects.
This project aims to use Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) as an example of a transboundary animal disease that has been
prioritised for control due to a large global impact and because control has the potential to benefit livestock development
and trade, and to alleviate poverty. A bespoke package of interactive e-learning material will be developed by Pirbright and
EuFMD to raise awareness of the importance of research for developing, implementing and monitoring vaccines and
vaccination programmes. The course will cover the full spectrum of research activities undertaken to understand the
performance of FMD vaccines and vaccination. Despite the focus on FMD, the generic concepts and skills related to
vaccination effectiveness and field-based research methods will be equally applicable to other diseases and hence this
sustainable resource will be of global value with the potential to reach large numbers of scientists.
Eight hours of interactive e-learning material will be combined with existing webinars and assignments leading to a tutorsupported
course of approximately 30 hours. This will be delivered by EuFMD in Year One to 60 PhD students,
Postdoctoral Researchers and State Veterinarians identified in Eastern and Southern Africa by SACIDS and EuFMD.
Feedback from participants will enable the partners to improve content and delivery. In Year Two, the partners will hold a 2-
week skills school in Africa, hosted by SACIDS and with additional academic input from the RVC. This will provide face-toface
support for 35 selected individuals, reviewing and validating the impact of the e-learning and further encouraging its
translation into the planning and conduct of research studies. The partnership will continue to support training participants
through its extensive networks, promoting research implementation by matching researchers with expertise and funding
sources. Annual courses from Year Two onwards will be expanded to include other developing countries including North,
West and Central Africa, Eurasia, Middle East, South Asia, with a possible translation of material to other priority
languages.</narrative>
