   <narrative xml:lang="EN">PATHWAYS brings together a multidisciplinary team crossing technology, systems thinking and society to aid the understanding of water quality. The project undertakes fundamental research, through to end-user delivery. We will develop new insights, approaches and technologies that support the needs of end-users to provide protection for communities and ecosystems using co-designed and appropriately applied technologies. We will do this, by developing improved, validated decision support tools to address the requirements for the protection and enhancement of natural water quality. This will inform end-user decisions made by environmental regulators and policymakers, engineering consultants and water utilities.  The proposed study will employ a range of novel fundamental research approaches, including laboratory and field tracer studies, data interpretation and simulations, to ascertain the pathways and evolution of pollutants within a range of flow domains. In order to do so, the programme will investigate water quality characteristics paying special attention to the relationship between a number of critical parameters including physical, chemical and biological variables. The characteristics of the microbial communities in river water and sediments (microbial diversity) and their pollutant-degrading potential will be assessed and how they are affected by physical and chemical controls such as: boundary (biofilm and permeability), shape (cross-section and planform), and nutrients (reactive nitrogen and phosphorous) in four flow domains: rivers, lakes and wetlands and near-shore in the Ulhas River / Thame Creek Catchment (Mumbai Metropolitan Region, India). This will elucidate how direct discharge and diffuse scenarios affect interactions between physical controlling effects, microbial community composition and pollutant biodegradation rates.  Our approach is unique in that the design and implementation of the technology is informed through understanding of local community, where an appropriate solution or systems structure is not presumed. The accessibility of robust low-powered sensors, communication technologies is providing great opportunities for locally orientated data collection focussed on community concerns. Using a citizen science approach, these advances can be used to develop efficient, user-friendly water monitoring strategies and systems based on innovative technologies, providing authorities, communities and other end-users real-time data.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="The overall aims of this proposal are to improve the understanding and descriptions of the key physico-chemical processes in the Thane Creek &amp; Ulhas river catchment, with particular emphasis on those processes impacting on water quality and public health issues.  The research will take systematic evidence based methodologies that will entail in situ seasonal field work experiments, combined with physical model experiments to provide new knowledge of the interactions between the physical controlling effects, microbial community composition and pollutant biodegradation rates through interpretation of unique velocity, chemical biodegradation in water-sediment system and tracer measurements.  Algorithms will be developed and validated to describe the pathways and evolution throughout the catchment. &apos;The project therefore has six main key objectives:  1. Develop novel instrumentation (using hyporheic exchange principles across the sediment-water interface) to obtain data that will provide essential understanding of the integrated dispersion coefficients at key locations across the field study region.   2. To undertake a comprehensive in-situ field based catchment study local to our Indian counterparts at the Indian Institute of Technology of Bombay.   3. Perform turbulent velocity, momentum transport and solute dispersion measurements (using combined LDA, PIV &amp; PLIF techniques) to obtain a comprehensive data set under representative field flow conditions in laboratory flumes, and interpret and quantify the mixing processes under a range of flow conditions and bathymetries.  4. Quantify &amp; understand the interactions, PATHWAYS and evolution of pollutants, specifically in terms of independent variables such shape, boundary, free surface, light, degradation &amp; sorption to develop and disseminate algorithms to predict the magnitude of dispersion coefficients, and chemical longevity.   5. Derive algorithms describing the solute dispersion in terms of the physical parameters, and biodegradation rates suitable for inclusion in numerical water quality models.  6. To propose management and governance solutions that are appropriate for the Indian bodies across all levels of government, including presentation of decision support management technology solutions to an Indian audience, using the UT catchment, to increase the effectiveness of decision-making and informing our end users about water quality risks through effective dissemination routes."></capital-spend>
