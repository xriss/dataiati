   <narrative xml:lang="EN">We aim to provide scientists in Southeast Asia a tool -- phage technology -- to help address the antibiotic resistance crisis. This global health issue is expected to cause 10 million deaths annually by 2050 - more than 5 times the number of deaths caused by HIV during the worst year of that crisis [1]. Unfortunately, almost 90% of the deaths from antibiotic resistant infections will occur in developing countries in Asia and Africa. Indeed, earlier this year the Chief Medical Officer of the UK, Dame Sally Davies, stated that antibiotic resistance &quot;could kill us before climate change does&quot; [2].
Phages (also known as bacteriophages) are inexpensive, naturally occurring antibiotic alternatives that can kill antibiotic-resistant bacteria [3]. Phages have been used against problem bacteria for &gt;100 years in certain regions, but they have not been applied in Asia. In fact, few scientists in Asia have any knowledge about phages. To fill this gap, we are partnering with the Asian Institute of Medicine, Science and Technology (AIMST) in Malaysia, Yale University, and the charity organisation Phages for Global Health to deliver a 2-week hands-on workshop to teach scientists how to develop phage products from local resources. The workshop will be hosted at AIMST during November 2020, and researchers from throughout Southeast Asia will be invited to apply.
Over the past 2 years we have delivered 3 similar workshops in East &amp; West Africa, but this will be our first in Asia [4]. From previous workshops we have found that for every scientist we trained, they have taught phage biology to 10 or more others through their home institutions. And for every &#xA3;1 we have spent in delivering a workshop, the participants have won more than &#xA3;10 in grants to fund their phage product development. Thus, this practical knowledge can be quickly amplified through a region such as Southeast Asia. Our goal is to empower this local network of scientists to deliver phages that could be used to kill bacteria in food, water, livestock and people -- potentially saving thousands of lives.</narrative>
