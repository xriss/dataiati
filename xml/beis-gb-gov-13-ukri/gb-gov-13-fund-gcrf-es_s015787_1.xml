   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Sustaining Power: Women&apos;s struggles against contemporary backlash in South Asia</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Our research aims to generate theoretical and empirical understanding of the perennial struggle for women&apos;s rights, focusing on iterative episodes of contention. We seek to understand the interaction between new sites and forms of backlash created by regressive economic, political and social forces, and the strategies used by women&apos;s struggles to retain power despite increasingly vigorous backlash. We are critically concerned with how women sustain these gains by securing systemic changes in economic, political and social spheres, so that they are more resistant to future threats.   We examine these concerns through cases of women&apos;s struggles that are seeking change within one of four institutional spaces of struggle: family, community, market and the state. Our main objectives are to: a) Identify how new and multiple forms of backlash are created through the interaction of contemporary macro level economic, social and political factors. This is especially pertinent to capture in South Asia, a context with deeply patriarchal structures and persistent gender inequalities that has seen rapid urbanisation, rising employment precarity, shrinking civic space, growth of religious fundamentalism, and rapid spread of digital technology and social media;  b) Provide empirical understanding of dynamics of how women&apos;s struggles are facing down and fighting off backlash;  c) Conceptualise and explore the mechanisms and strategies that matter most for women being able to defend and embed gains within specific spaces of struggle despite resurgence of regressive forces;  d) Capture subjective encounters of women&apos;s experience of power and struggle and how their conceptualisation of these notions change throughout the processes of contestations and with intersectional identities;  e) Produce systematic evidence on how, when and why women&apos;s power struggles in one space over a specific issue connect to and reinforce power struggles in other spaces and on other issues; and how this affects the robustness of gains; f) Understand the ways in which grassroots women&apos;s struggles link up to regional and national levels and movements to affect more systemic change. g) Identify the configuration of contextual and struggle-specific factors that determine what works to defend women&apos;s rights across the world.    We examine 16 cases of women&apos;s movements across four countries: Bangladesh, India, Nepal &amp; Pakistan. Some indicative case studies include: Bharat Muslim Women&apos;s Andolan in India working to affect change in personal law (family space); the women&apos;s movement against violence in Nepal (community space); Garment workers movement in Bangladesh (market space); and women councilors organizing to claim greater space within a disenfranchising system in Pakistan (state space). We aim to develop an innovative, mixed-methods approach that combines historical and causal process-tracing and deep contextual analysis generated by Gendered Political Economy Analysis with cross-case comparisons and Qualitative Comparative Analysis. Each case study will provide rich empirical material that will be relevant to groups active in the struggle for women&apos;s equal rights in South Asia and beyond.  This project aims to build capacity of researchers through a carefully crafted team that brings together a mix of well-established and early career researchers across countries and institutions, who interact regularly through mentor teams, training workshops, on-site guidance and learning opportunities for analysis, writing and presentations. We aim to privilege women&apos;s own understandings of their power and struggles, and seek to deliver impact by building their capacity and co-constructing knowledge using reflective processes. These will contribute to an interdisciplinary understanding of struggles and strengthen a feminist research-practice community across disciplines, drawing from political science, geography, history, sociology, anthropology and development studies.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Women in South Asia have struggled for many decades to improve their lives within their families, in their communities, for securing their livelihoods, and in getting their voices heard as citizens by the state, with women&apos;s movements being critical in advancing their rights. However, contemporary social, economic and political changes have created new and multiple forms of backlash and contestations. How do women defend their rights, and secure their gains against these regressive forces and backlash? This question leads our research on the strategies and mechanisms that women use to retain power and sustain gains in women&apos;s rights. This research is particularly interested in how different groups of women understanding power and struggle, and how these change over time. We aim to assess what works to defend women&apos;s rights, and explain why some struggles are more successful than others in sustaining gains. We think that success of women&apos;s struggles depends on a) the types of strategies they use to counter different types of backlash; b) the ways in which struggles include voices and perspectives of different groups of women; and c) the ways in which struggles connect to other movements and groups across local, regional and national levels. The central research question therefore is: When, how, and why do women&apos;s power struggles succeed in retaining power and sustaining their gains against backlash?   South Asia provides a valuable opportunity to investigate women&apos;s struggles. The region has witnessed rapid and large changes over the last decade, including urbanization, rising employment precarity, new electoral laws and regime changes, shifts in social norms, and the spread of digital technology. We aim to examine how these changes create new and multiple forms of backlash; and how women&apos;s struggles for power are variously challenged, opened up or are closed down by these changes. We are interested in unraveling the similarities and differences in processes and strategies used by different women&apos;s movements to retain power in the face of backlash; and in women&apos;s own experiences and interpretations of their struggles as these evolve and adapt over time.   We will select 16 cases of women&apos;s struggles in four countries that represent the largest populations of South Asia: Bangladesh, India, Nepal and Pakistan. Within each country, we will select on-going and contentious cases of struggle in one of four arenas within which gains in women&apos;s rights are being sought: family, community, market and the state. This research will use a variety of methods including:  a) identifying and analyzing the types of backlash created by processes of contemporary change; b) mapping critical players and what shapes their motivations for action;   c) tracing the struggles, nature and trajectory of each movement to counter backlash - through oral history methods, reflective and participatory techniques, qualitative interviews and archival research;  d) undertaking comparative analysis to compare how different movements may have triggered, galvanized or been strengthened by power struggles across different arenas; and  e) identifying and systematizing which combinations of mechanisms and strategies work to defend women&apos;s rights in South Asia and beyond.   This is a collaborative research project that draws together a multi-disciplinary research team with deep in-country and conceptual expertise on women&apos;s rights and contemporary power struggles in South Asia. This project includes strong capacity building initiatives and opportunities for learning through reflective processes with women&apos;s movements and research partners. This research is ambitious in its scope and we hope that our findings that will be grounded in real life experiences of women, will be relevant and useful for feminist scholars, activists and policy actors to set their future course of action to defend women&apos;s rights across the world.</narrative>
