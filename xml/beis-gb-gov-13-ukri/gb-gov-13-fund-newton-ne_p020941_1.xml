   <narrative xml:lang="EN">RCUK-SEA - High Density Air Quality Monitoring in the Klang Valley (Malaysia) - A New High Resolution Observational Capability.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">South East (SE) Asia is one of the most densely populated regions in the world with widespread rapid industrialisation and population growth (with an urban shift). In air quality (AQ) terms, pollutant emissions and exposed populations are both increasing. In addition, regional land use change, deforestation and biomass burning are all occurring within an atmospherically turbulent and energetic region.   AQ monitoring is needed on a spectrum of scales ranging from street to regional if distributions and levels are to be understood and modelled effectively and policy most efficiently designed and implemented. The emergence of new low-cost miniaturised sensor technologies in the environmental sciences has led to a huge increase in both available data and a potential for collecting new data. AQ observational studies can therefore be undertaken at higher resolutions and be coupled with numerical models resolving at finer scales.  Existing AQ monitoring at national levels is undertaken using networks of static pollution monitoring sites which due to their cost, size and logistical requirements tend to be relatively sparse. The Greater Klang Valley (GKV) area includes the city of Kuala Lumpur (KL) as well as the surrounding municipal areas. It has a population of approximately 7 million and contains significant industrial activity as well as a number of ground, sea and air transport hubs including one major international airport.  An emerging and important opportunity in the UK and globally is how to merge emerging low-cost sensing technologies with existing high resolution networks. Studies are needed to establish the scales (time and space) of measurements needed to fundamentally understand the distributions of pollutants in and around urban areas in the context of the Energy-Food-Environment nexus. Fine scale distributions of pollutants are not well studied in the horizontal with even larger uncertainties in the vertical. As new sensor technologies are deployed, models need to adapt to use high resolution multi capability sensing to optimise the information content derived from adding high density network data.  KL is an established regional megacity with a regional emissions footprint and its successful economic and growth pattern is being replicated across SE Asia. Understanding AQ distribution in KL and defining best practice for AQ monitoring and modelling in KL will have broad implications across SE Asia. The lessons learnt will be valuable in applying these technologies and methodologies across SE Asia which has shown to be routinely affected by episodes of very poor air quality as well as in the UK and developing economies.  This project will use low-cost miniaturised sensors to augment and expand existing relatively sparse monitoring networks. They will be deployed in a case study in Malaysia, specifically in KL and the surrounding GKV area. The results will be analysed using dispersion modelling tools widely used by regulatory bodies.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project will allow effective development of mitigation policy guidelines based on the addition of cutting-edge autonomous small sensor networks to existing sensing infrastructures and the modelling of these results. This will better constrain levels and distribution of Air Quality (AQ) species by expanding monitoring coverage and density and improving modelling capability based on this new type of network data.    Specific research aims are:   -   To demonstrate the feasibility and value of adding emerging low-cost sensing  instruments to existing relatively sparse AQ monitoring to extend capability.   -   To better constrain emissions and transport of key air quality and climate species from the food and energy sectors in the GKV as well as outflow and inflow over the region based on monitoring.   -   To undertake dispersion modelling of AQ species at very fine scales based on high density network data to produce distribution maps at current levels of pollution as well as predictive products based on &quot;business as usual&quot; and &quot;reduction action&quot; case studies.   -   To investigate impacts of palm monoculture (food sector) emissions when combined with high levels of urban (energy sector) emissions and the effect on formation of organic aerosol.  -   To undertake additional targeted PTRms sampling alongside those being made at a selected station to investigate use of air quality network data as a proxy for other species.  -   Plan and carry out a workshop in Malaysia on UK Environment Agency compliance monitoring techniques.  -   To prepare a short discussion document on advice for potential future policy approaches based on use and integration of emerging AQ sensing into effective compliance monitoring.</narrative>
