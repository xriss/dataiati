   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Enhancing essential oil feedstocks and high-value products from Mentha species for local Ugandan economies.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Several aromatic oil compounds (essential oils) of high commercial value are produced naturally by the leaves of mint plants (Mentha). Mint oil extracts are promoted for their health benefits and are used to flavour drinks, ice cream, chewing gum, as well as in cosmetics and personal care products such as toothpaste and shower gel. Menthol is a key component of mint essential oils, particularly those isolated from peppermint Mentha x piperita, and has a large international market with a value of around $800m p.a. Another chemical component, nepetalactone, a potent natural insect repellent normally found in catnip, has recently been identified in the pineapple mint species Mentha suaveolens. As part of a previous collaborative project, the potential for mint as a non-food crop for Ugandan farmers has been explored, a mint garden with selected varieties established near Kampala, and pilot-scale distillation equipment constructed to extract oil from a harvested spearmint crop. This suggests that wide-scale commercial cultivation of mint crops in Uganda could represent a viable resource for globally competitive production of mint essential oils. This project aims to develop novel mint varieties for cultivation in Uganda to produce high yields of essential oils containing menthol or nepetalactone which will be used to develop locally-produced products for the benefit of the rural Ugandan economy. This application, involving partnerships between Cardiff (Wales) and Makerere (Uganda) Universities, seeks to maximise the production of selected essential oils using two parallel strategies. Firstly, we will screen a range of mint varieties to identify those with naturally high yields of menthol or nepetalactone using biochemical analysis (chromatography) of extracted oils, and those with the largest abundance of oil-bearing glandular leaf hairs (trichomes) by microscopic analysis of the leaf surface. The second strategy will be to manipulate key genes involved in the biosynthesis of essential oils in the leaf, with the aim of creating new &apos;elite&apos; mint varieties by up-regulating the production of menthol. Such genetic modifications are feasible, due to recent advances in scientific understanding of the biochemical pathway leading to menthol production in mint oil. The most promising mint varieties will be selected for subsequent field trials to determine their viability for growth under potentially conditions of water availability, shading and soil type, in three regions of Uganda. Together with our partners in Uganda, we will create local Community Enterprise (CE) groups to propagate and distribute plant material to farmers, and provide the necessary training to cultivate/harvest the crop, ensuring agricultural best practice. In turn, this will improve local systems of agricultural production, harvesting and extraction technology and result in substantive up-skilling of the local rural population. In addition, we will devise agro-economic models of mint crop production, and develop business plans and marketing strategies to guide emerging local business ventures. This project will ensure that sustainable financial benefits accrue principally to local communities in Uganda, via CE groups set up to grow, harvest and exploit new mint crops. The project will explore the development of products for sale in collaboration with local-based partners, enabling rural populations in Uganda to benefit sustainably from science-based enhanced production of mint essential oils.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Several essential oils of high market value are produced naturally by the leaves of various plant species of the genus Mentha, a member of the Lamiaceae (mint) family. In particular, the monoterpenoid menthol, primarily isolated from the peppermint Mentha x piperita, is a commercially important compound for a variety of consumer products in the food and healthcare industries, while the potent insect repellent compound nepetalactone has recently been found to be produced in the pineapple mint Mentha suaveolens in our preliminary studies leading to this proposal. Several Mentha species and varieties are endemic to sub-Saharan Africa, suggesting that commercial cultivation of mints could represent an excellent resource for globally-competitive production of mint essential oils. This project seeks to maximise the production and usage of the essential oils menthol and nepetalactone, involving partnerships between Cardiff (Wales) and Makerere (Uganda) Universities that will enable local rural Ugandan farming communities to cultivate and extract mint essential oils to develop new products for commercial exploitation and benefit the local economy. This project will develop new elite mint varieties for cultivation in Uganda to produce high yields of essential oils containing menthol or nepetalactone. To achieve this aim, we will adopt parallel strategies exploiting natural variation/ diversity within the Mentha genus together with metabolic engineering using established genetic modification technologies, followed by growth trials for cultivation optimisation in Uganda and essential oil extraction using existing local facilities. The following objectives are linked to specific outputs from Work Packages (WPs) detailed in the Case for Support. Objectives: 1) Identification of Mentha varieties with highest levels of menthol or nepetalactone (WP1) - Naturally occurring Mentha varieties will be subjected to biochemical profiling by GC-MS and GC-FID to identify those with the highest levels of menthol or nepetalactone 2) Metabolic engineering of enhanced menthol production in Mentha using genetic modification (WP2) - Mentha lines producing high levels of menthol will be produced by genetic modification using a combination of approaches involving overexpression of geranyl diphosphate synthase (GPPS) and limonene synthase (LimS), and downregulation of menthofuran synthase and the trichome-specific transcription factor MsYABBY5 by RNAi. 3) Assay natural and GM varieties for cultivation suitability in Ugandan conditions and ease of oil extraction by conducting field trials and pilot oil distillation extractions (WP3) - Field trails will be conducted by our partners in Uganda to identify natural Mentha varieties (WP1) best able to grow in Ugandan field conditions. GM lines (WP2) will also be subjected to field trials for performance evaluation. 4) Determine effectiveness of Mentha-derived nepetalactone as a mosquito repellent (WP4) - Mentha suaveolens-derived nepetalactone will be tested for effectiveness in mosquito repellence compared to the commercially available repellent DEET using an olfactometer in accordance with WHO protocols. 5) Knowledge exchange and commercialisation activities with CEMPOP (WP5) - training of Ugandan scientists and farmers and development of products containing menthol or nepetalactone in collaboration with Ugandan academics to benefit local Ugandan rural economy - Creation of community enterprise groups involving local Ugandan farmers and local rural population/ workforce with our partner organisation CEMPOP, who will also devise plans for commercial exploitation via business plans and marketing strategies. Development of food/beverage products containing menthol, and non-food uses of menthol in cosmetic and personal care products. Development of insect-repellence products using M. suaveolens-derived nepetalactone.</narrative>
