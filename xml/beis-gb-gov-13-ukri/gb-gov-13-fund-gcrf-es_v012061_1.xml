   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Climate change is a wicked problem that cannot be addressed by a single discipline, nor by science alone. Instead building resilience requires multiple disciplines to be brought together in transdisciplinary research and practice partnerships (networks) that are rooted in the practicalities of decision-making in order for research to have societal relevance. This requires a strong partnership and knowledge sharing between academia/research and non-academic partners such as practitioners and policy makers. However, researchers are not always accustomed to working with non-academic partners, who have different priorities, incentive systems and ways of working. The intermediary role of knowledge manager will provide the support required to enable effective partnerships and communication and ensure that the findings of research are relevant and accessible to decision-makers who can use them to improve resilience. The UCT-Kulima team incorporates a unique mix of accomplished academic and practitioner team members who are sympathetic to the demands of the academic environment while also recognising the crucial need for societal relevance. We are exceptionally well connected and have a positive track record from many projects in transdisciplinary partnerships, cross-project and programme synthesis and learning, and actionable knowledge for impact.

Our aim is to add value to the CRNs such that we can augment their achievements in two main ways: (i) support to the networks, and (ii) filling the gaps to enable synthesis, comparison, and learning from process. To this end we will unobtrusively facilitate inclusive stakeholder engagement and support establishment of the necessary relationships with the other (primarily non-academic) actors with whom they are likely to collaborate in the research process; and translate research into actionable knowledge and communicate it effectively for impact. To ensure the total outcomes is more than the sum of the parts of the CRNs, we will proactively identify and capitalise on opportunities for synergistic knowledge products for research impact, building on our linkages with multiple national, regional and international networks in research, policy and practice; and facilitate monitoring, evaluation and learning through a reflective process that assesses and documents process and outputs (taking into account the growing interest in modalities of knowledge management as a programme function). 

We will undertake our role as the knowledge manager based on co-ownership with the CRNs and ensure their needs are met without causing undue burden on them in terms of time. At the start we will collaborate with the CRNs to develop plans for stakeholder engagement, network building and communicating research for impact; as well as developing a programme wide MEL plan and learning agenda that will guide our subsequent activities. Throughout the programme implementation, we will keep regular contact with each of the CRNs through dedicated liaisons assigned to each CRN. We will also host sympathetically facilitated virtual and face to face learning, reflection and capacity building events in order to maximise network building within and across the CRNs. 

As a result of these processes, tangible outputs will include papers for peer-reviewed journals, briefs, blogs, webinars, multimedia and social media as required, which will be effectively communicated to relevant academic, policy and practice audiences at national, regional and international level, building on our extensive knowledge of, and engagement in, relevant networks. Less tangible outputs, but considered equally important, will include enhanced networking amongst members of each of the CRNs, a network of early career researchers and enhanced capacity to access research funding as well as implement principles of sound research (such as gender equality andsocial inclusion, ethical processes and inclusive stakeholder engagement).</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The main aim of our role as an external knowledge manager is to enhance and add value to the climate resilience networks (CRNs), and thereby contribute to better and actionable knowledge around how to achieve climate resilience. This will take place through (i) individual support to each network, and (ii) identifying opportunities for maximising learning between networks and with complementary initiatives. This will ensure that the total of outcomes from the CRNs is more than the sum of the parts.
 
To achieve our aim, our specific objectives are as follows:
1. Building trusted relationships for collaboration with the CRNs and adding value to networks
Ensuring that the CRNs see us as allies is critical for our success, and we are committed to building trusted relationships that enable effective collaboration and co-ownership of the knowledge management process. This will be informed by the research and practice literature on collaboration and our own extensive experience of building equitable and inclusive partnerships, and will underpin the success of subsequent objectives.

2. Providing support to the networks as they progress through their work plans
As part of the trusted and collaborative relationship with CRNs, we will provide three roles:
(a) supporting stakeholder engagement through identifying and brokering relationships with stakeholders for involvement in the research process
(b) supporting network building and strengthening, capitalising on our widespread awareness and existing involvement in many research, policy and practice networks at global, regional and national level, and
(c) translating research into actionable knowledge and communicating it for impact, informed by analysis of opportunities for uptake of research results and providing tailored and targeted communications as appropriate (which may include blogs, briefs, guidance notes, reports and multimedia (e.g. video clips) etc).
 
3. Providing synthesis across networks for programme-wide value add
In addition to supporting CRNs to achieve impact in their own geographical/sectoral areas, we will fill the gaps and ensure that the value of the programme as a whole is greater than the sum of the CRNs. This will involve:
(a) ensuring effective management and brokering of knowledge for impact of synthesis and comparative findings
(b) monitoring, evaluation and learning (MEL) and application of a learning agenda that will address the process of social learning across and between the CRNs and the knowledge manager, and the effectiveness of engagements for impact.

4. Building capacity of the CRNs
We will support network and capacity building of established and early career researchers (ECRs) in our thematic areas (stakeholder engagement, network building, communication for impact, MEL) and other fields identified by CRNs that are essential to maximise impact and work effectively in transdisciplinary partnerships.</narrative>
