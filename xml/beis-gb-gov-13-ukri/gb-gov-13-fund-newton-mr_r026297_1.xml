   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Malaria, a mosquito-borne disease caused by Plasmodium parasites, is an important public health problem causing an estimated 212 million cases and 429,000 deaths annually. In the WHO Western Pacific Region, 10 out of 37 countries, including Viet Nam, are endemic for malaria. In Viet Nam, there is heterogeneity in malaria prevalence, with the Southern and Central regions with the highest morbidity (7% of population with &gt;1 case per 1000 people). After successfully reducing the malaria burden to pre-elimination levels over the past two decades, the National Malaria Control Programme (NMCP) has recently switched from control to elimination by 2030. Whilst the number of confirmed cases has more than halved between 2012 and 2016 to ~4,200 (P. falciparum 56%, P. vivax 42%), there is now evidence that P. falciparum malaria parasites resistant to frontline treatments have spread to five Vietnamese provinces. Very little data is available for P. vivax drug resistance. The imminent spread of drug-resistant parasites can undermine progress made towards elimination.   Drug resistance is caused by mutations in the parasite genomes. Therefore to provide biological insights, we propose to characterise the genetic profiles of ~1,000 Pf and Pv samples sourced from endemic provinces in Viet Nam using cutting edge whole genome sequencing (WGS) technologies. We will investigate genetic differences between samples, within province, across time, and detect known and potentially novel drug resistance markers. Our findings will provide data to the NMCP on drug resistant parasites to assist policy development, and inform the development of diagnostics, vaccines and treatments for malaria. The work will lead to new insights into the genomes of Vietnamese malaria parasites, as well as establish a publically available genetic data resource to facilitate future malaria research. Further, the application of WGS technologies in Viet Nam will build capacity for future genomic investigations.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="Whilst Viet Nam has achieved remarkable success in reducing the number of malaria cases, the imminent spread of Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) that are resistant to frontline artemisinin combination treatments in the Greater Mekong Sub-region (GMS) can undermine progress made. Drug resistance is driven by genetic mutations in malaria parasite genomes, and there is a need to monitor for the presence of known associated mutations, but also identify the polymorphisms underlying some established and new forms of resistance. In particular, very little is known about drug resistance in P. vivax (Pv). In Viet Nam, Pf and Pv cause 56% and 42% of the malaria cases, respectively. Most cases of malaria are uncomplicated, leading to challenges in obtaining sufficient high-quality biological material from infected individuals for genetic characterisation in whole genome sequencing (WGS) studies. For the proposed work, we will use historical and prospectively collected samples of Pf and Pv sourced from five provinces that are highly endemic for malaria and exposed to potentially sweeping GMS drug resistance. We will apply cutting-edge DNA amplification, WGS and analytical approaches to inform on the genome-wide diversity of malaria parasites, including within the potential drug resistance genes, and identify genetic loci that may be under selective pressure from drug resistance. Specifically, we will:   1. Generate WGS data from Pf and Pv amplified DNA samples sourced from Vietnamese provinces undergoing both passive and active surveillance; 2. Deliver a curation of the genetic variation in the Pf and Pv parasites following bioinformatics analysis; and 3. Compare the genetic diversity in important drug resistance genes, assess population structure between the geographical regions across time, identify genomic loci under selective pressure, and perform comparative Pf and Pv species analysis; all using population genetic approaches.  In addition, the proposed work has the added benefit of training the next generation of Vietnamese researchers in genomics studies and big data analysis as part of our capacity building activities. All outputs, including genetic data, a drug resistance mutation database, web-tools, algorithms, methods and findings will be published and made available to the research community."></capital-spend>
