   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Towards transdisciplinary understanding of inherited soil surveys: an exploratory case study in Zambia.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Sustainable agriculture must preserve the soil so that it can be used agriculturally in the long term. Communities adapt their farming practices to face environmental, economic and social challenges. This process of adaptation can be supported by research, but only if we understand the soil, how its properties, potential and limitations vary in space and how communities have adapted their farming practices in the past. Soil survey has conventionally been a way to generate knowledge about the variation of the soil and how it is used.   At present the development of sustainable agriculture is a challenge in many countries, particularly in the global south, not least because of climate change. Tackling these problems requires collaboration between different specialists. Whether a technical solution will succeed will always depend, at least in part, on social factors. Is an innovation compatible with practices, values and traditions of a community?  Does it affect how agricultural labour is divided over time, between social groups, between adults and children and between genders?  Studies of farming systems also show that these have rarely been fixed, but have changed over time, in response to different social and environmental factors. This suggests that a historical perspective on sustainable agriculture could be just as important as the perspective of the natural and social sciences in developing robust, equitable and effective solutions to contemporary problems in food security. We contend that collaborative study of the processes and products of soil survey from the colonial era (1930s in southern Sub-Saharan Africa, SSA) until the late 20th century, would provide a context in which natural scientists, social scientists and historians could develop an integrated approach to understanding sustainable agriculture. It would also address a very pressing practical problem.  This problem is the scarcity of information on the soil and its variation in space over most of SSA. Collecting soil data is costly, and few people have the expertise to do it. Yet, the soil surveys produced in Africa in the past, have rarely been mobilised to address contemporary problems. We contend that these sources provide a unique window into past decisions and assumptions about the soil, whose effects are still felt today. In these soil surveys are embedded a rich set of observations and interpretations, along with hard data (soil analyses) and maps.   However, old surveys cannot just be dusted off and used as if new. First, there is the technical challenge of determining whether the analyses are still reliable. Furthermore, the survey was commissioned in a particular historical context to address particular problems. Farming was done by communities with particular structures and power relations, and some perspectives will have influenced surveyors more than others. In short, the soil scientist, historian and social scientist all have a critical role in the process of appraising an inherited survey and identifying its possible strengths and weakness when used to support contemporary decisions about farming and the land.   Through the proposed cross disciplinary UK-Zambia partnership, we will critically interrogate a number of inherited soil surveys created in Zambia, from the colonial period to the present, developing a theoretical framework for their appraisal. Our intention throughout is to show how triangulating perspectives from the history, social science and soil science can develop a shared evaluation of these surveys. An evaluation, furthermore, that can be applied to pressing current problems relating to soil quality in the region. To this end, we will engage with policy makers, agricultural advisors, NGOs and farmer groups to plan further funded work so that inherited soil surveys in Zambia, and elsewhere (SSA and beyond), can best be used to develop sustainable agriculture as a basis for food security into the future.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">We start from the observation that smallholder farmers in Zambia (and elsewhere in Sub-Saharan African: SSA) face substantial challenges in providing secure supplies of safe and nutritious food, given environmental, social and economic constraints. The soil is a key factor in any attempt to address these challenges as it integrates environmental factors (susceptibility to drought, contamination and micronutrient supply) and social and political constraints (access to land and water). However, over most of SSA the availability of information about the soil and its use is a constraint to the achievement of sustainable development goals. Paradoxically, many countries in the region have an inheritance of soil surveys from the colonial period and subsequent to independence. We think that the reasons this inherited information is not used pertain to both technical issues, and critically, to the historical and social context in which the original surveys were framed, commissioned and conducted.  Our aim is to build a partnership between soil scientists, historians and social scientists at the University of Nottingham, University College London and University of Zambia, in order to develop a novel transdisciplinary approach for the appraisal and deployment of inherited soil surveys. We will examine collaboratively how soil surveys were produced in Zambia, and evaluate their potential, and limitations, as an enabling resource for contemporary development of sustainable agriculture. We focus initially on Zambia, with the ultimate aim of deploying our methodology elsewhere in SSA and beyond.   We therefore have the following key objectives.  1. To review the inherited soil surveys in Zambia, identifying a subset for initial appraisal. The subset will be selected to cover a range of environmental conditions, to cover different periods of Zambian history since 1930, to cover a range of survey scales and to include locations where there is potential for immediate impact (e.g. Copperbelt province where management of hazards from mining waste is an obstacle to sustainable agriculture).  2. To complete an initial close reading of the first set of selected surveys within each of the project working groups: history, social sciences and pedology.  3. Through dialogue, to develop from the provisional readings by all three WGs, a transdisciplinary approach by which all three perspectives on inherited information can be interleaved into a single approach in which the social and historical perspectives are informed by understanding the survey process, and vice versa, culminating in a project workshop. To initiate a close reading of additional inherited surveys, post-workshop, on which interdisciplinary teams will collaborate de novo. These readings will be made available as documents to a target community of potential users (policy makers, extension workers, donors, NGOs and the private sector) with whom project partners are already engaged and with whom we shall engage further through project workshops.  4. To produce a targeted proposal for a project that will encompass the development of an archive of inherited soil surveys, with linked evaluations, to be developed at national or regional scale. Key to the development of this proposal would be systematic engagement with key stakeholders in Zambia (Government, extension services, NGO, donors and private sector representatives).  5. Either integrated with the proposal at (4), or separately, to produce a proposal for further funding focused on the use of inherited surveys (notably the traverse records of C.G. Trapnell) as a baseline for the examination of local communities&apos; understanding of the constraints and adaptations made by farmers to environmental, socio-economic and political changes in Zambia, and the socio-cultural and historical memory of communities concerning food and agricultural systems. This approach would be based on &quot;walking survey&quot; methodology.</narrative>
