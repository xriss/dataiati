   <narrative xml:lang="EN">HIV is a significant health issue in the Philippines. In May 2015 the Philippines Department of Health (PDOH) Aids Registry reported 22,684 people living with HIV/AIDS. 86% of the HIV+ population are men who have sex with men (MSM) of which 36% engage in heterosexual activities with women. There are two major issues with the current diagnosis system. According to observations by the PDOH, high risk groups, tend not to come forward for testing, and the two week time period between testing and diagnosis in the current system leads to few returns for treatment and care. This and several other factors are leading to the Philippines having the fastest growing HIV epidemic in the world. There is a clear need to address the current diagnosis system and run targeted interventions. As adolescents make up a high proportion of the hard to reach high risk group, this project seeks to: improve treatment seeking behaviour and compliance through a digital gaming intervention; and improve access to testing and speed of diagnosis through rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs). The study will be undertaken in Metro Manila which has HIV prevalence of 5.3-6.7%. Two intervention clinics in the Metro Manila area and 4 control clinics will be included. A step wedge study design will be followed for game evaluation. The current laboratory-based ELISA and western blot testing algorithm for HIV testing and counselling (HTC), will be replaced by a Rapid Diagnostic Algorithm (RDA) intervention. This will be rolled out for 24 months in 2 intervention clinics and the game introduced after 12 months in a stepped process to provide three arms of evaluation for the two interventions: current practices, RDA only and RDA in combination with gaming intervention. The pilot study will indicate whether the numbers of people seeking HIV services at intervention clinics, compared to control facilities have increased. It will also generate a better understanding of motivational factors for seeking diagnosis, especially from the at risk groups. This will provide valuable information for possible expansion of interventions nationally.  The UK-based research team will provide expertise and guidance, ensuring the transfer of skills and knowledge to the Philippines to plan, strengthen capacity within the HIV health system, roll out, monitor and evaluate the value of the two proposed interventions.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project objective is to explore whether a combination of an Rapid Diagnostic Algorithm (RDA) and a digital game for HIV advocacy will improve HIV health seeking behaviour and treatment compliance.  The study design will allow us to establish in chronological order the impact of the two interventions: Intervention 1. RDA (24 month study, using controls) 1.1. Determine HIV health system strengthening requirements, and the feasibility and acceptability of the new intervention in selected health clinics.  1.2. Strengthen capacity among researchers and clinic staff to identify and address gaps and strengthen the systems in intervention and control clinics to support the pilot roll out of the RDA. Ensure controls clinics have the capacity to administer project questionnaires.  1.3. Quantitatively determine if there has been an increase in people seeking diagnosis, counselling and treatment compared to non-intervention facilities. 1.4. Explore the motivation factors using qualitative methods, which have facilitated health seeking behaviour, counselling and treatment. 1.5. Communicate research outcomes to PDOH and wider HIV stakeholders in the Philippines. Intervention 2. Digital Advocacy Game (6/12 month study, using stepped wedge design) 2.1. Determine appropriate game design, platform and roll out strategy through situation analysis of the target users (at-risk demographic).   2.2. Determine appropriate scope for digital game through consultation with Department of Health and other HIV stakeholders within the Philippines. 2.3. Develop a digital advocacy tool through partnership with the ETCH Team, professional game developers and Philippine project partners.  2.4. Quantitatively determine if there has been an increase in people seeking diagnosis, counselling and treatment compared to non-intervention facilities. 2.5. Explore the motivation factors using qualitative methods, that have facilitated health seeking behaviour, counselling and treatment. 2.6. Develop capacity within the Philippine HIV program and the wider public health community to incorporate digital gaming into public health advocacy, communication and learning.</narrative>
