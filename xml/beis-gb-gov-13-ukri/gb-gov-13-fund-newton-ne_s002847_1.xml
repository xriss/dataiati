   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Layperson Summary (4000 characters max.) The world&apos;s major river deltas are hotspots of agricultural production that support rural livelihoods and feed much of the global population, but as &apos;climate change hot spots&apos; deltas are facing a major sustainability crisis. Specifically, there are concerns that many deltas may in the coming decades be &apos;drowned&apos; by rising sea levels as the oceans warm (up to 20% of land is projected to be lost in the major deltas of south and southeast Asia alone). The process of delta &apos;drowning&apos; is a slow onset hazard where relative sea-level rise progressively exacerbates fluvial and coastal flood risk while simultaneously enhancing saline intrusion. However, progressive environmental change is punctuated by the occurrence of extreme weather events such as droughts or extreme rainfall and climate models project that these will occur more frequently. The co-occurrence of slow onset hazards with extreme events creates a &apos;perfect storm&apos; that makes agriculture ever more challenging, but we have almost no insight into how slow onset changes interact with extreme events. A key question is the extent (much like a boxer &apos;softening up&apos; her opponent with repeated body blows before landing the knockout punch) to which, in systems facing progressive reductions in resilience as a result of ongoing change, the additional burdens caused by occasional but damaging climatic extremes may cause a &apos;tipping point&apos; to be crossed which makes it difficult for agricultural production to recover after severe episodes of drought or flooding. This is a critical issue because if we cannot correctly attribute the cause of major change we run the risk that &apos;solutions&apos; will also be applied incorrectly.   In this project we will develop a new model to examine how agricultural production and livelihoods are affected by combinations of progressive environmental change punctuated by extreme weather events. In particular we will focus on episodes of drought and flooding. Flooding is the most dangerous and costly of natural hazards, accounting for over 500,000 fatalities and economic losses of more than $1 trillion since 1980. Their low lying nature, alongside their location at the interface between coastal and fluvial environments means that deltas are disproportionately exposed to these risks. However, in the developing world, where agricultural production forms the mainstay of national economies and is central to livelihoods, drought can be a key driver of water and food (in)security, but we know significantly less about how droughts develop, persist and recover. We will further our understanding of the vulnerability of delta systems to extreme events by exploring how crop production and livelihoods are affected by the interplay between episodes of drought and flooding and ongoing environmental stress linked to upstream catchment management and climate change.   Our project is focused on the world&apos;s third largest delta, the Mekong. The Mekong delta is SE Asia&apos;s rice basket and home to almost 20 million people, but it is exposed to severe environmental risks as a result of climate change and rapid economic development. We will collaborate with our Vietnamese partners, including in key government agencies, to bring UK expertise in (i) the modelling of droughts and floods; (ii) agricultural livelihoods; (iii) participatory stakeholder engagement processes and (iv) social-ecological systems dynamics to bear on this challenge. We will define policy relevant scenarios of future change and quantify the links between drought and flooding and agricultural livelihoods, delivering an integrated assessment of the factors driving changes to livelihoods and explore the effects that adaptations could make to help make the Mekong delta more resilient to climatic extremes. This will be done within a globally significant, iconic, delta, providing a template for similar analyses in other vulnerable deltas of the Global South.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="Our overall aim is to understand how agricultural resilience to hydrometeorological extremes can be enhanced through improved predictive capacity and aligned policy and governance, using the Vietnamese Mekong delta (VMD) as a representative exemplar delta. We will achieve this by developing and applying new modelling tools to explore key research questions (defined below) to explore how crop production and livelihoods are affected by the interplay between episodes of drought and flooding and ongoing environmental stress linked to upstream catchment management and climate change. We will also explore whether and how alternative water management and other adaptations (e.g., crop management) allow for more sustainable outcomes in the face of such environmental stresses. Our specific objectives are to:   O1 Develop a stakeholder engagement strategy that will (i) identify the governance framework (including barriers to effective governance) and (ii) generate policy relevant scenarios for the Mekong delta&apos;s agricultural systems in relation to future (i) climate change; (ii) upstream catchment management (damming), and; (iii) local-scale adaptations to water and flood management practice. O2 Use climate and hydrological data to identify historical episodes of drought, quantify indices of drought severity and risk and identify the relationship between drought severity and crop production, the latter using empirical crop production data and satellite remote sensing.  O3 Bring UK and Vietnamese expertise together to develop a new multi-scalar model for predicting water fluxes through the delta by combining high-resolution catchment hydrological models with delta-wide hydraulic models, the latter capable of simulating the impacts of environmental change on soil salinization. We will apply the models under future scenarios of environmental change (upstream damming; climate change with a focus on shifts in climate extremes; sea-level rise) to evaluate the impacts on flood risk, soil moisture, and surface water availability for irrigation during low flows, and salinization. O4 Incorporate the model outputs from O2 and O3 into our Systems Dynamics Model (SDM) framework to deliver a new integrated SDM that interlinks governance frameworks, upstream catchment (damming) and in-delta (dykes and sluices) water management infrastructure and climate-driven changes in water availability (floods, soil moisture, availability of surface water for irrigation) and salinization with crop production and agricultural livelihoods. O5 Apply the new SDM from O4 to explore the specific Research Questions as defined below. O6 Under the auspices of our Pathways to Impact, apply the SDM to simulate the policy-relevant scenarios established in O1 to help identify adaptation measures that could help ensure that the delta&apos;s inhabitants have a climate resilient future.  The Key Research Questions to be addressed by O5 are as follows:  1) Is the increasing frequency and severity of floods more damaging to crop production and livelihoods than episodes of drought and saline intrusion? 2) What is the scale of the potential compounding aspects of such hazards and how is this affected by event sequencing? For example, is a flood followed by a drought more damaging than the combined impacts of the individual events? 3) How does the episodic occurrence of hydrometeorological extremes interact with progressive environmental change to affect overall system resilience? Do such interactions make it more or less likely for key &apos;tipping points&apos; to be crossed? 4) What are the drivers for drought and flood management policies, and have these created conflicts between provinces and communities? What are the risks to livelihoods in communities? Are these addressed by drought and flood management?  5) What implications are there for the optimal management of hydraulic infrastructure in the delta, to help build greater resilience to hydrometeorological hazards?"></capital-spend>
