   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Virtual Reality of Medieval Culture: Collaborative Network for Cultural-Feed Virtual Heritage (CfVH) platforms of medieval Cairo</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Theme: &quot;The Digital World: Opportunities and Challenges&quot;.   Iconic heritage is globally threatened by terror, climate change, rampant commercialisation, and overexploitation by tourism; and in the case of Egypt, significant disinvestment. Lack of responsible planning, maintenance and preservation strategies have equally caused unmitigated dereliction and irreversible damage to many heritage sites and cultural traditions in the medieval city in Cairo.  Instability across the MENA region has prompted calls for the protection of culture and archaeological heritage as a political, economic and global challenge. With the increasing rate of destruction of heritage sites, digital preservation of historic artefacts and cultural heritage has arisen as an international priority. With tourism industry contributing 11% to Egypt&apos;s GDP and Non-governmental organisations, charity foundations and private sector enterprises are dramatically growing, technical and community support to this industry has become at the forefront of sustainable economy and social welfare of local populations. Yet, there are strategies, practices, skills and technologies that can protect, develop and sustain these places, in other forms of reproduction; such as digital modelling, immersive virtual and augmented reality, and cinematography and Audio-visual archives.   Digitisation of heritage through customs, photo archives, film footage, oral history documentaries has become central for the preservation of national identity and effective tool in strategies of undermining radical ideologies in marginalised communities. The use of online platforms, virtual exhibitions and digitization of heritage is ever increasing and the virtual reality models of historic sites are becoming a main tool to engage with distant and remote heritage locations, yet stretch audience outreach and contribute to online income generating activities. Virtual environments which embed cultural heritage through digital media are often categorized as &apos;virtual heritage&apos;. Such new media and technology platforms offer the possibility to experience virtually reconstructed historic sites or heritage sites as visitors, travellers or even as a resident.   The proposed Cultural-feed Virtual Heritage CfVH collaborative network will develop projects, forums of exchange and activities that focus on undertaking creative and practice-led research on Imaging Cultural heritage in virtual environments. It will support young researchers, entrepreneurs to engage with innovative technological industry and inform policy makers and online tourism on the advantages and reward of engaging with digital platforms of virtual heritage. This project aims to help participants, academic and none-academic, to take part in the development, design and planning of virtual heritage platforms using latest technology (CAVE &amp; Virtual HoloDeck) and develop practice-led workshops.   Young professionals and graduates will acquire creative and technical skills that support self-development as entrepreneurs and offer venues for networking with UK-based experts and researchers. The collaboration is designed to train a catalyst group of 30-40 Egyptians to acquire, learn, practice and promote the digital production of Virtual heritage and support their future research projects of cultural and archaeological heritage, both in Egypt and in the UK. Participants will be trained for an average of 60-80 hours on research, production and business planning to help develop private enterprises and engage with local communities and school children. The collaborative network anticipates supporting 4-6 start-ups and research projects in the two years following its conclusion and will initiate graduate courses in Heritage Digitisation at Egyptian Universities and at the University of Wolverhampton with prospected 60-80 graduates over 5 years.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This Network aims to develop a series of collaborative events, training activities and fact-finding research into the possibility and opportunities for digitising the socio-cultural heritage of Old Cairo&apos;s hawaris&apos; (local alleyways) everyday life through virtual modelling of its physical settings supplemented by archival data, digital contents mined from cinema productions, televised reports and visualisation of cultural heritage. It envisages building a platform for collaboration between specialist researchers and entrepreneurs from architecture, sociology, virtual modelling, data-mining, and visualization and multi-media production to generate innovative and interactive digital models of medieval culture in Cairo. It is designed to achieve the following objectives:   OBJ-1: Building a network of effective partnerships and database of expertise and projects in the field of Virtual modelling of medieval cities&apos; built and cultural heritage. This network will in effect support future projects, collaborative programmes of research and knowledge exchange activities between Egyptian and British Institutions and private sector enterprises.    OBJ-2: Identifying best-practice platforms of digital and virtual modelling of historic sites in Old Cairo that support the incorporation and representation of cultural data and Historic material. This objective not only tackles the physical traces of history but also gives equal emphasis to the visual representation of cultural patterns and memories that are embedded in everyday life and reproduces them through virtual media.  Exchange of experiences between researchers and media specialists will help to identify progressive methods of digital productions that are customised for the peculiarity of genuine heritage material.     OBJ-3: Identifying suitable interdisciplinary methodologies that offer inventive opportunities for visualising medieval cultural productions and bring cultural traditions, values and ideology (religious/ non-religious) into life on virtual and augmented reality platforms. This objective underlines the interdisciplinary nature of methods of documentation and visualisation of historic accounts and recorded media.    OBJ-4: Disseminating the necessity of innovative platforms of heritage preservation in light of the political and security instability in the region and endangered heritage sites. This objective highlights the need for engagement with stakeholders, policy makers and lobbying for private and international investment in areas of digital heritage and advanced virtual heritage modelling systems.</narrative>
