   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Development and evaluation of an integrated early childhood development and violence prevention teacher-training intervention in Jamaican preschools</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">1) We have a cohort of 229 Jamaican preschool teachers who have been trained in the &apos;Irie Classroom Toolbox&apos;: a universal violence prevention programme which aims to i) reduce violence against children by teachers and, ii) prevent the development of early antisocial behaviour in young children. We now plan to develop, implement and evaluate an intervention to promote children&apos;s language and school readiness skills with a subsample of this cohort of teachers. The Toolbox currently consists of four modules: i) promoting an emotionally supportive classroom environment, ii) managing child behaviour, iii) promoting children&apos;s social-emotional skills and, iv) individual and class-wide behaviour planning.  This intervention will form an additional module in the Toolbox and includes training on how to improve children&apos;s higher order thinking and cognition, how to provide feedback to expand child learning and understanding and how to facilitate children&apos;s language development. The module will include training teachers in how to use the strategies in: i) structured shared book reading activities (which will be scripted and hence provide extensive scaffolding for teachers in their use of the strategies) and ii) in everyday teaching and learning activities (to ensure teachers generalise their use of the strategies to other lessons). The new module will be evaluated in a cluster randomised trial in 20 preschools (10 intervention, 10 control).  2)  The primary outcome is structured observations of teachers&apos; use of the strategies during i) book sharing activities and ii) regular teaching and learning activities. The secondary outcomes are child school readiness and language skills measured through direct testing. We will also measure teachers&apos; use of violence against children during the structured observations and child behaviour difficulties through teacher report to ensure that the additional training does not reduce the effectiveness of the previous training in behaviour management.  3) We will conduct an on-going process evaluation involving:    a) During workshop sessions, facilitators will document teachers&apos; engagement with the material including i) teachers&apos; response to the new material, ii) difficulties teachers show in understanding and using the skills taught and iii) teachers&apos; feedback on their use of strategies.     b) After each in-class support session, facilitators will document the strengths and needs of each individual teacher and barriers and enablers to implementation based on her own observations and her discussions with the teacher.    4) We will investigate the extent to which teachers utilise the structured book sharing sessions and the extent to which they generalise their use of the strategies to regular teaching and learning activities. Teachers will keep an on-going log of their use of the structured book sharing sessions. Semi-structured interviews will be conducted with each intervention teacher to ascertain the extent to which they were able to use the strategies across the school day. This information will be supplemented by the data from the structured observations of teachers&apos; behaviour and will be used to determine the optimal balance between unstructured and structured activities in future training.  5) The information from the impact and process evaluation will be used to refine the intervention and to support the development of the intervention manuals for use in a larger trial. The manuals will include materials for the teacher and materials for trainers. Teacher materials include: i) a tools book which provides a short description of each strategy and ii) an activity book giving outlines for structured book reading sessions and ideas on how to integrate the strategies into everyday learning activities. The training materials include i) a training manual on how to conduct the teacher training workshops and ii) an in-class coaching manual on how to conduct the in-class support sessions.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The &apos;Irie Classroom Toolbox&apos; is a universal violence prevention programme, developed for use in low and middle-income countries (LMIC), which involves training preschool teachers in classroom behaviour management and in how to promote young children&apos;s social-emotional competence.  We recently conducted a study in Jamaica in which 76 preschools were randomly assigned to either receive training in the &apos;Irie Classroom Toolbox&apos; (38 schools, 115 teachers) or to receive the training at a later date (38 schools, 114 teachers). We found that teachers trained in the &apos;Irie Classroom Toolbox&apos; used 67% less violence against children (including physical punishment, verbal abuse and intimidation) than teachers who did not receive the training. Furthermore, the training led to significant improvements to the emotional and organisational climate of the classroom, and to observations of children&apos;s class-wide prosocial skills. A random sample of children was evaluated (n=865) and benefits of intervention were found for children&apos;s inhibitory control and for the proportion of children with clinical level behaviour difficulties.  Although significant benefits were also found to the instructional support offered by intervention teachers; the scores for both intervention and control teachers were low (&lt;2 on a 7-point scale); indicating that cognitive and language stimulation was inadequate.  To maximise the effectiveness of the &apos;Irie Classroom Toolbox&apos; to promote children&apos;s development across the cognitive and language domains in addition to the social and emotional domains, teachers need additional training. In this study, we plan to evaluate a module on instructional support which will include include i) how to promote children&apos;s higher order thinking and cognition, ii) how to provide feedback to expand child learning and understanding and iii) how to facilitate children&apos;s language development.   20 preschools who been trained in the &apos;Irie Classroom Toolbox&apos; will be randomly assigned to a group in which teachers receive training in instructional support (10 schools, 30 classrooms) or a second group that will receive no additional training (10 schools, 30 classrooms). A random sample of 5 children per class will also be evaluated (300 children; 150 in each group). The intervention involves 2 full-day training workshops and 4 in-class support sessions (once a month for four months).  We will evaluate the effect of the intervention on teachers&apos; use of the instructional strategies during teaching and learning activities. We will also evaluate the selected children&apos;s school readiness and language skills. To monitor that this additional training does not reduce teachers&apos; behaviour management skills, we will measure teachers&apos; use of violence against children and child behaviour difficulties in both groups. We will document factors relating to the implementation of the intervention on an on-going basis including teachers&apos; engagement with the material, their strengths and needs in implementing the strategies and barriers and enablers to implementation.  Through this study we will investigate the acceptability, feasibility and effectiveness of the intervention and we will use the data to develop intervention manuals that are suitable for national dissemination including materials for teachers (e.g. activity guides) and materials for trainers (e.g. training manuals). The enhanced &apos;Irie Classroom Toolbox&apos; produced through this study will be a teacher-training programme to i) prevent violence against children by teachers, ii) prevent the early development of antisocial behaviour and iii) promote children&apos;s social, emotional cognitive and language skills in early childhood classrooms. The intervention will be suitable for use with poorly trained teachers, working in poorly resourced settings in LMIC. The outputs of this study will make a strong contribution to the global agenda on violence prevention and the global goal of improved child development.</narrative>
