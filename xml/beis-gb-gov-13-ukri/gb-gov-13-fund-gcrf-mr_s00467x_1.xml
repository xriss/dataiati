   <narrative xml:lang="EN">MICA: New combination therapy against MDR TB targeting the respiratory chain</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The respiratory chain of Mtb is an essential bioenergetic pathway with two terminal oxidases, cytochrome bcc and cytochrome bd, operating cooperatively during disease pathogenesis.  Targeting these components, as well as key electron donating components (ndh2) and H+-pumping complexes (ATP-synthase), offers a unique opportunity to target both actively replicating and slow growing bacilli, the latter which have been shown to be responsible for phenotypic drug resistance (persistence) and long treatment duration.  In addition, because there is no known pre-existing resistance due to mutations in genes encoding respiratory chain components, drugs targeting these enzymes would be effective against MDR-TB.  As described in the Case for Support, targeting single components of the respiratory chain, besides ATP synthase, has been shown to have limited utility. Although supporting evidence indicates that multiple targeting of respiratory components enhances efficacy, including for inhibitors of ATP synthase, there are significant knowledge gaps that need to be addressed before this strategy is tractable for onward drug development.  We have assembled key academic and industry partners possessing the domain expertise, technical platforms and proprietary compound libraries to successfully execute this programme of activities - no other group(s) would have the necessary skills and resources to undertake this validation programme.    Aim &amp; Objectives The primary aim of this award will be to undertake a comprehensive validation of the respiratory chain of Mtb as a target for combination therapy.  This aim will be met by addressing the following objectives:  (i)  To determine which set of targeted respiratory components result in the most significant enhancement in antitubercular efficacy, using compounds that selectively inhibit individual respiratory components, tested using in vitro and in vivo (mouse) models.    (ii) To determine whether enhancement of antitubercular activity is predicted to lead to clinically measurable benefits using pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD)-based modelling of in vitro and in vivo data.  (iii)  To determine whether enhancement of antitubercular activity via combination of respiratory inhibitors, is predicted to lead to clinically-relevant reduction in the emergence of de novo resistance to each individual compound, and, using diarylquinolines as a case study, to determine whether low-level resistance to an individual compound can be overcome by dosing within a synergistic compound pair</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Tuberculosis (TB) is the main cause of deaths related to antimicrobial resistance.  In 2016, there were an estimated 10.4 million new TB cases worldwide, and 1.7 million TB-associated deaths.  Multi -drug-resistant (MDR) TB is on the rise and globally, the average cure rate for MDR-TB is only 54% and only 30% for extensively drug resistant TB (XDR-TB). TB is a disease of poverty and presently, 95 % of the TB-related deaths occur in LMICs.  The proposed activities are primarily and directly relevant to the health needs of LMIC and therefore ODA compliant  New combination therapies that can overcome current resistance mechanisms are urgently required.  Here, we wish to validate an exciting new therapeutic approach of targeting multiple respiratory chain components of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative pathogen of TB.  The co-investigators, assembled from both academia and the pharmaceutical industry, are uniquely placed to exploit this strategy possessing (i) extensive domain expertise, (ii) proprietary compound libraries containing selective inhibitors of 4 key respiratory chain components, (iii) access to validated in vitro and in vivo models for assessment of efficacy for drug combinations and (iv) background intellectual property (IP) to both inhibitors and the combinatorial approach.  Our objective is to gain validation of this approach using gold-standard in vitro and vivo disease models of TB and to identify the combination of targets eliciting the optimal antitubercular effect which are most likely to be of value in the clinic. In addition, we will also investigate the potential of inhibitor combinations, in reducing the emergence of new drug resistance, thus potentially extending the lifetime of any new therapeutic solution.  The resulting information will inform and aid in prioritization of drug discovery and development programs that aim to identify inhibitors of respiratory chain components that, when used together, should contribute sterilizing activity to novel drug regimens for MDR-TB, resulting in shorter treatment times for patients. Ongoing discovery programs that will directly benefit from the research output include our own and those of our industrial partner; in addition, we expect the data generated to inspire additional TB discovery and development programs in the wider TB community.</narrative>
