   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Expand our ongoing programme of research work into the biological basis of mental health disorders in females  Run a dedicated summer school on The Female Brain and Behaviour. To be held at INeC  in Ribeirao Preto and open to post graduate students and early career research workers from Brazil and UK, this will provide training in the special approaches, techniques that are needed to design and carry out research programmes focusing on female behavior and animal models of psychiatric disease.  Fund two 6 months exchange visits between postgraduate students/early career research workers from institutions in the UK and Brazil to enable the most talented and motivated individuals to participate in our ongoing joint research programme.  Develop a public education programme on brain function for Portuguese speakers based on Good Brain Bad Brain, our (in English) current Massive Open Online Course (MOOC).</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Poverty is associated with poor mental health: the incidence is highest in socio-economic classes C and D and mental health issues are more prevalent in women than men.  Poor mental health impacts on the welfare of afflicted individuals as well as the social and economic development of societies.  Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is one of the most common mental health disturbances in women. The peri-menopause is another time in women&apos;s lives that is characterised by psychological distress. Depressive illness also has a high prevalence in women. Despite the female bias in mental health disorders, the vast majority of basic research into psychiatric diseases and development of new drug treatments continues to be carried out almost exclusively using male animal models.   Our programme of research has been designed to educate th public about mental health issues specifically related to women. We also aim to improve training got young research workers in order to strengthen the research base in the field of female mental health. There are three main objectives:   1.to consolidate and expand an existing collaboration between research groups in the UK and Brazil working on female mental health disorders 2. to set up training programme for young scientists on the special approaches required for research on females  3. to develop an educational programme to stimulate public engagement and understanding of mental health issues.</narrative>
