   <narrative xml:lang="EN">MaDiH: Mapping Digital Cultural Heritage in Jordan, will contribute to the long-term sustainable development of Jordan&apos;s digital cultural heritage, identifying key systems, datasets, standards, and policies, and aligning them to government digital infrastructure capabilities and strategies. Defining a robust technical and operational architecture for digital cultural heritage will assist the Department of Antiquities in their planning processes, help product development teams develop their systems, facilitate the aggregation of valuable datasets held in disparate repositories, and ensure data generated from research activity is properly stored and widely accessible. Analysis will also result in the identification of infrastructural gaps and opportunities for further development, including system development, data aggregation, and online learning. Practical prototyping will ensure analysis and lessons learned are cost-effective and aligned to real-world scenarios, and a series of workshops with stakeholders from the cultural heritage, research, government, and technology sectors, will ensure the project fulfils the needs of the local community. A hackathon, led by the Jordanian Open Source Association will ensure analysis and lessons learned are aligned to educational and commercial opportunities. Key outputs from MaDiH, which will be made available online, will include:  - A policy white paper, identifying relevant national and international policies, frameworks, and standards and making recommendations for their future adoption and/or implementation. - A technical white paper, listing requirements for improvements to existing infrastructure, systems, and tools and make recommendations for their future implementation. - A prototype National Data Catalogue, listing the datasets found over the course of the project. - A prototype National Heritage Portal, indicating the potential for future systems development and data aggregation. - Training in Research Software Engineering, delivered by King&apos;s Digital Lab (King&apos;s College London).</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="MaDiH will research and analyse Jordanian digital cultural heritage infrastructure, assets, tools, and systems, to prepare the ground for a subsequent phase of infrastructure and systems development, expand the Jordanian digital cultural heritage community, and transfer knowledge to the United Kingdom cultural heritage and research sectors. Objectives, in order of priority, are:  1. Identify relevant national and international policies, frameworks, and standards and make recommendations for their future development and/or implementation in a policy white paper. 2. Identify necessary improvements to existing infrastructure, systems, and tools and make recommendations for their future development in a technical white paper. 3. Identify existing online and offline datasets, and list them in a publicly available prototype national data catalogue. 4.     Produce a prototype national heritage portal. 5.     Transfer knowledge about Research Software Engineering (RSE) from King&apos;s Digital Lab to Jordan, and transfer knowledge about Jordanian computer science and digital cultural heritage from Jordan to the United          Kingdom. 6. Enable Jordan&apos;s digital cultural heritage community through a series of events involving government, university, and technology sector stakeholders. 7. Disseminate knowledge gained from the project via a basic website."></capital-spend>
