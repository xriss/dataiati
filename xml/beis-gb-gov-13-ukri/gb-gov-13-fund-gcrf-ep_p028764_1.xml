   <narrative xml:lang="EN">DARE: Distributed Autonomous and Resilient Emergency Management System</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Critical infrastructures serve as the pillars for the nation&apos;s economy, security and health programmes and include assets, systems, and networks spanning a significant breadth of the its geographical area. In the event of a potential destruction to these infrastructures by either man-made or natural disasters, it is of paramount importance to implement an appropriate emergency management system (EMS) capable of handling or preventing such catastrophes. A key feature in an EMS is an effective and efficient critical communication platform that provides situational awareness and coordination. However, the current communication platforms for EMS are susceptible to being incapacitated or destroyed by the disaster or the network congestion that arise as a result of such disaster. Furthermore, current platforms are human-in-the-loop based, requiring substantial human resources and cost for surveillance, preparation and actuation in case of emergencies.   In the light of this, the aim of the project is to conduct advanced research into a new Distributed Autonomous and Resilient EMS; referred here as DARE. The DARE architecture will support all phases of the EMS and will be founded upon three main communication platforms that are Wireless Sensor networks (WSNs), Ad-hoc networks and Future cellular networks (5G and beyond).   As part of this research project, we will incorporate an autonomous i.e. self-governed, self-healing disaster/network failure detection mechanism to reduce the cost of control signalling traffic associated with the traditional disaster/network failure detection mechanisms which require frequent network probes and network alarms. Investigators from the University of Surrey, University of Glasgow, Kingston University and the University of Malaya, Malaysia will work with leading communications and critical solutions provider like Ubitech Ltd, BT, Telefonica and Huawei to ensure that maximum impact arises from this program.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The strategic objectives of the proposal are 1) To investigate the technical requirements of a ubiquitous critical communication platform for all phases of EMS based on user input. Develop a novel EMS based on the identified requirements. 2) To develop a highly resilient EMS measured by quality of resilience (QoR) metrics. Notably, investigate the suitability of current routing approaches for the context aware DARE critical communication platform. Define a novel and wireless sensor network (WSN) routing architecture, for robust, efficient and effective critical communications. Incorporate other resilience building approaches such as multi-hop mesh network and cross platform resilience support. Investigate the interplay between the QoR achieved and cost with a specific emphasis on stringent quality of service (QoS) constraints in terms of delay, jitter, energy efficiency and other related KPIs. 3) To develop distributed autonomous solutions for a novel EMS. This entails incorporating self-organisation and self-governing functionalities, i.e., self-configuration, self-optimisation and self-healing, into the EMS. Ensure a robust coverage solution while operating with the distributed settings.  4) To verify the distributed, resilient and autonomous designs through simulations and real-world testbed implementations using existing open source (ns-2/3, OMNeT++, Cooja) and in-house bespoke simulators/emulators. Measure the achieved KPIs and compare them to the requirements identified at the beginning of the project.</narrative>
