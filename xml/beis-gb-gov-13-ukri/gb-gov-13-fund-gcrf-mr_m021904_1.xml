   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Every year, 2.2 million children die of malnutrition. Many more have their life chances restricted because of the effects of malnutrition on their health and intellect. Different programmes have been tried to combat malnutrition in children. These include distributing food directly; giving children micronutrients (eg vitamins and zinc); employing community workers to give nutritional advice; and health interventions which protect children against the consequences of malnutrition (eg immunisation against measles). Research by bodies such as the World Health Organisation (WHO) has shown that these strategies can lead to better nourished children. However, when these approaches are used in a large scale (eg a whole country) they sometimes fail to reach those most in need (those living in extreme poverty). To help the greatest number of children, we must choose approaches which are cost effective and which can be sustained in the long term.  We are a group of community workers, scientists, economists and doctors. Our partners are the Centre for Promoting Sustainable Livelihood (CPSL) - which is a non-governmental organisation in India: a UK charity (Rojiroti UK); Patna Medical College India; and two UK academic partners (the University of Nottingham and the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine). Our team have experience of helping very poor people in rural areas of India to fight poverty. Our community workers encourage people in poor hamlets or &quot;tolas&quot; in northern India to form self help groups (SHGs). Most SHGs are formed by women. They are asked to save a little money regularly, initially Rs2.5 (3 pence) per week. If they save regularly, their savings entitle them to a loan. These loans start small - Rs50 (50 pence). Women in the group can receive external loans (from CPSL) of Rs500 (&#xA3;5) after 3 months and Rs3,000 (&#xA3;30) after 6 months (if credit is good). Loans may be used for emergencies (eg medical expenses); to allow women access existing government support schemes (eg money to travel to subsidised food shops); or to invest in livestock or agricultural equipment. Using these loans helps women avoid local money lenders (who charge much higher interest) and avoid emergency sales of their property (at knock down prices). We call this programme Rojiroti (which translates as &quot;Livelihood&quot;).   We want to see if we can test whether Rojiroti improves children&apos;s health, using a test called a &quot;cluster randomised controlled trial&quot;. We don&apos;t yet have all the information we need to design such a trial so we will first do a feasibility and pilot study. We will start by checking the feasibility of things like consent, weighing and measuring children, collecting data accurately and keeping track of participants in the trial. We will run a small version of the trial (called a pilot study) so that we have some preliminary data on children&apos;s nutrition. We think a key measure of the effectiveness of Rojiroti will be the children&apos;s weight corrected for height. This is called the weight for height Z score (WHZ). However, we will also record other measures of nutrition. We need preliminary data to work out how many tolas we will need for the definitive trial to test the effect (if any) of Rojiroti on children&apos;s nutrition. In our pilot study, half the tolas will get Rojiroti immediately and half will get it after 18 months. Which group gets Rojiroti immediately will be decided at random. We will weigh and measure children at the beginning and again after 18 months. We will compare the two groups to see if Rojiroti makes a difference to children&apos;s nutrition. We do not expect to be able to show a difference in our pilot study. However, once we have done the pilot study, we will know how many tolas we would need for a full trial which would answer the question. This means we can work out how many staff we will need and what the trial will cost. We can then make a funding application which will have all the necessary details.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="This study will evaluate the feasibility of a cluster randomised trial of the Rojiroti microfinance intervention, amongst very poor women in the Indian State of Bihar. The unit of randomisation will be the &quot;tola&quot; (a hamlet of around 100 people). Poor health is linked to poverty and it is plausible that a microfinance intervention, which improves family wealth, will also improve the health of young children in poor communities. Nutrition is one of the simplest measures of the health of children under five years and we will measure a number of nutritional indices this study. Rojiroti (http://www.rojiroti.org) is an innovative microfinance scheme, aimed at the very poor, which is delivered by the Centre for Promoting Sustainable Livelihood (CPSL). Women form self-help groups (SHGs) and contribute their own savings - initially Rs2.5 (3p) per week. They must attend at least four, weekly meetings before their savings entitle them to a loan. These loans are usually small - Rs50 (50p). Women in the group are entitled to receive external loans (from CPSL) of Rs500 (&#xA3;5) after 3 months and Rs3,000 (&#xA3;30) after 6 months (provided credit is good). Smaller amounts are general purpose loans and larger sums are for emergency loans. CPSL has been highly successful in delivering Rojiroti microfinance schemes amongst the very poor in Northern India since 2001. By 2011, there were around 50,000 Rojiroti members (almost all women) in 4,100 SHGs. SHG members can avoid village money lenders (high interest) and forced asset sales (for knock-down prices) in emergencies. Small sums may also allow them to access government subsidised stores. However, there is, as yet, little robust evidence that Rojiroti microfinance has a beneficial effect on child nutrition. Our likely primary outcome measure for a definitive trial is the weight for height Z score (WHZ). Where a child has a low WHZ, this is termed &quot;wasting&quot;. Globally, 55 million children are wasted. Children who are wasted (WHZ -3 to -2) have a 3-fold increased risk of death and those who are severely wasted (WHZ &lt;-3) have a 9-fold increased risk. WHZ changes rapidly with nutritional interventions and so it should be a sensitive outcome measure, reflecting nutritional improvement. Study Objectives in order of priority: 1. To determine whether it is feasible to recruit women in tolas into the cluster randomised trial described above. This will include evaluating: our novel approach to consent; retention of women in tolas; feasibility and accuracy of data collection; processes for data transfer and addressing data queries. 2. To determine the feasibility of measuring weight for height Z score (WHZ) in tola children at baseline, 9 and 18 months. To assess retention of children in the study and any loss to follow up through migration or drop out. 3. To collect WHZ data, stratified by age, to inform a power calculation for a definitive trial. 4. To determine the effect size (if any) of WHZ in the intervention and control tolas.  5. To collect data on other anthropometric variables which may be secondary outcomes in a future trial: weight for age Z score (WAZ), height for age Z score (HAZ), and mid upper arm circumference (MUAC). 6. To determine the % of children who are wasted, underweight and stunted in the tola population. 7. To measure the % of tola children whose mothers are part of an SHG and the % who are not and to see if any nutritional benefits are also seen when mothers are not participants. 8. To explore the feasibility of using other outcome measures, such as: under 5 mortality; indirect measures of children&apos;s wellbeing (eg immunisation &amp; school attendance); and other social and economic effects on tola dwellers (including harms, such as indebtedness). 9. To collect preliminary qualitative data, using questionnaires at baseline, 9 and 18 months - to investigate the mechanism of any nutritional effects in the tola children."></capital-spend>
