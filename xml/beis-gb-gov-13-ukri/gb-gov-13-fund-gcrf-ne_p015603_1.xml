   <narrative xml:lang="EN">With growing land-use pressures and consequent severe soil erosion, many East African socio-ecological systems are at a tipping point. Continued and accelerating soil erosion presents a credible threat to community and ecological resilience to future climate change shocks.  Soil erosion and downstream siltation problems challenge water, food and energy security, with growing threat from climate change. Even under &apos;normal&apos; climatic conditions, soil erosion reduces water and nutrient retention, biodiversity and plant primary productivity on agricultural land putting stress on food production, notwithstanding ecosystem and water resource/power generation impacts downstream. This undermines the resilience of communities that depend on soil and water resources, and shocks are often amplified by physical and socio-cultural positive feedback mechanisms. Shocks can, however, lead to a learning experience that propels a system to a qualitatively different pathway. This can support greater-than-previous levels of resilience (sometimes termed &apos;bounce back&apos;). Co-production of sustainable land management practises will help enable agrarian and pastoral communities to (1) withstand shock of future extreme hydro-climatic events and (2) recover from prior environmental impacts to a resilience level beyond the prior state through restoration/enhancement of degraded landscapes.  Facilitating a step change in land management practice to reduce complex soil erosion impacts is a fundamental target within the UN Sustainable Development Goals, a challenge that requires an interdisciplinary approach. To bring about urgently needed change in land management practice behaviour, evidence is required to demonstrate how social resilience is intrinsically linked to landscape/ecological resilience through the coupled co-evolution of natural resource systems and dependent rural communities.  The East African Rift System (EARS) region has the highest catchment sediment yields of sub-Saharan Africa linked in part to topography and rainfall but also to recent and historic land conversion to agriculture and, in particular, increasing livestock numbers on grasslands. Extreme drought and rainfall events, which are already a characteristic feature of tropical climatology (e.g., linked to ENSO), are widely accepted to increase in magnitude and/or frequency with global climate change. There is a real risk that, in the absence of community-owned soil management programmes, recent land use change will amplify hydro-climatic and consequent societal impacts. This is exacerbated by socio-cultural lock-ins such as power and esteem gained by owning livestock, putting pressure on fragile ecosystems and ecosystem services, with repercussions for economic and human health.  Experts in soil erosion and land degradation problem identification are not necessarily experts in socio-economic and socio-cultural solutions. To tackle this challenge, we propose an interdisciplinary approach to designing sustainable land management practices that would enable rural communities affected by soil erosion to overcome post-erosion shocks and achieve a higher level of resilience than previously. Through novel integration of environmental science, arts and humanities and social science evidence, this project will map out potential behavioural changes and how these can be embedded in the design and implementation of soil conservation and restoration strategies. The interdisciplinary approach in this foundation-building programme will develop knowledge of complex interlinkages between soil degradation, climate change, and community resilience in the EARS region, as well as to explore pathways to possible solutions. Interdisciplinary evidence of the problem will be explored against complex socio-cultural community concerns and needs, and potential solutions will be considered with stakeholder groups to identify and underpin future behavioural change in land management.</narrative>

We aim to develop knowledge of complex inter-linkages between soil degradation, climate change, and community resilience in the East African Rift System (EARS) region, as well as to explore pathways to possible solutions. Evidence of the problem will be explored against complex socio-cultural community concerns and needs, and potential solutions will be considered with stakeholder groups to identify and underpin future behavioural change in land management. Through novel integration of environmental science (soil and water), arts and humanities (art &amp; design, culture and human geography) and social science (psychology and human geography) evidence, this project will map out potential behavioural changes and how these can be embedded in the design and implementation of culturally- and environmentally-sensitive soil conservation/restoration strategies.  The Lake Manyara catchment, Tanzania, represents a natural &apos;socio-ecological laboratory&apos; typical of EARS catchments supporting vulnerable pastoral and agricultural communities. We will test and implement our approach within the Moduli District Council (MDC) region working with stakeholders from multiple spatial levels including the District Council; village communities that combine subsistence and commercial farming; traditional Maasai pastoralists; wildlife conservation organisations and tourism representatives. This ambitious aim will be tackled using interdisciplinary objectives developed in collaboration with MDC and the Nelson Mandela African Institution of Science and Technology (NM-AIST):  Objective 1: to derive a timeline of past soil erosion response to anthropogenic land-use change and climatic events (e.g. El Nino) over the past 100 years using a combination of (a) swamp/floodplain stratigraphic records and (b) historic archival information from colonial and post-colonial periods, contextualised by (c) archaeological evidence of traditional pre-colonial land and water management practices in Northern Tanzania (e.g. at Engaruka) (analogues of the past);  Objective 2: to (a) undertake a systematic evaluation of land degradation in Monduli area, using established survey tools and artistic media, and (b) learn from rehabilitated gully sites (through existing Horizon 2020 project network) restored into a poly-culture system to develop wider income generation potential for fragile subsistence communities (showing how restored landscapes can support greater resilience levels than existed before erosion &apos;shock&apos;).   Objective 3: to identify economic, structural, socio-political, socio-cultural and social psychological factors and associated lock-ins and path dependencies that affect community resilience, in the context of land degradation, across the key rural sectors in the Moduli District.   Objective 4: to integrate the interdisciplinary evidence bases within a conceptual process model that (a) outlines interconnections and feedbacks between community resilience and soil erosion shocks in the Monduli socio-ecological system, and (b) through showing main predictors of desirable behavioural choices and the relationships between these, identifies key pathways to sustainable change in land management practice.  Objective 5: to evaluate within structured stakeholder workshops the challenges and opportunities for using the land management-resilience model as a framework within which to engage stakeholders to improve future practice. Specifically, to evaluate its potential in (a) exploring and explicating the complex inter-relationships between past and present community activities and soil erosion and (b) developing a pathway to design of a community-owned management plan/decision support system for future test and evaluation."></capital-spend>
