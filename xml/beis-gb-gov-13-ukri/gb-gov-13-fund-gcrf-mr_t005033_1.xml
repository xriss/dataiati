   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Azithromycin and cefixime combination versus azithromycin alone for the out-patient treatment of typhoid in South Asia; a randomised controlled trial</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The primary objective of the Azithromycin vs Combination Azithromycin and Cefixime typhoid treatment trial in South Asia (ACT-South Asia) is:   To determine if the combination of azithromycin and cefixime for seven days results in significantly fewer treatment failures when compared with the current standard regimen of azithromycin alone for seven days in the out-patient treatment of children and adults with uncomplicated typhoid fever (infection due to Salmonella Typhi and Salmonella Paratyphi A) in South Asia. A composite outcome of treatment failure by the 28th day after the initiation of treatment will be defined by the occurrence of any one of the following events: 1.Clinical failure, defined as any one of the following: Persistence of fever on day 7 (168 h) post treatment initiation; The need for rescue treatment as judged by the Trial Clinician; The development of any complication (e.g., clinically significant bleeding, fall in the Glasgow Coma Scale score, perforation of the gastrointestinal tract); Syndromic enteric fever relapse within 28 days of initiation of treatment. 2.Microbiological failure, defined as any one  of the following : A positive blood-culture for S. Typhi or S. Paratyphi on day 7 of treatment regardless of the presence of fever (microbiological failure); Blood culture-confirmed typhoid fever relapse within 28 days of initiation of treatment. Additional key endpoints measured in this randomised intervention will be: 1. The fever clearance time, 2. The time to a clinical or microbiological confirmed treatment failure,  3. The time to a clinical or microbiological confirmed relapse of infection 4. The rate of adverse events occurring during treatment, 5. Clearance of Salmonella faecal carriage in patients with microbiological (blood culture positive) confirmed typhoid fever at one month and three months after the initiation of treatment.  We will also carry out the following key sub-studies to evaluate: 1. The cost effectiveness of the interventions, 2.  The effect of each treatment intervention on a) nasal carriage of penicillin or azithromycin resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, and b) faecal carriage of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae at one month and 3 months following initiation of treatment (1 and 2 have been costed in the application). 3. An evaluation of new diagnostic assays for typhoid and alternative infections causing a typhoid-like illness. (Funded  by Gates) 4  The pharmacokinetics of these antimicrobials in uncomplicated typhoid fever (with additional funding).</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Typhoid fever is characterized by fever and abdominal symptoms. It affects more than 14 million children and adults globally each year. Between one and two million of these patients may progress to severe and life-threatening complications including intestinal bleeding, intestinal puncture (perforation) with surrounding inflammation (peritonitis) and a syndrome of somnolence and coma (encephalopathy). Up to 1% of patients who get typhoid may die of the disease. A typhoid illness can be followed by a relapse 2-3 weeks later and lead to a prolonged period of ill health and catastrophic financial cost to the family with a resulting burden on the health system and society. In South Asia, which is the largest typhoid hub in the world, the annual burden of disease is estimated at seven million.  Effective antimicrobial treatment leads to a resolution of the patient illness in 4 to 6 days and reduces risk of progression to life-threatening complications. If started early in the disease a 7 to 10-day course of treatment with a single oral antimicrobial treatment can be given in an out-patient setting without the need for expensive hospitalization. In the last 20 years fluoroquinolones, such as ciprofloxacin, have been successfully used. However antimicrobial resistance in the bacteria that cause typhoid fever has now become common in Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. In South Asia resistance to ciprofloxacin in typhoid is widespread. Resistance limits the choice of effective antimicrobials and increases the risk of patients developing severe disease. Because of these concerns Salmonella has been recently listed in the &apos;Priority 2: HIGH on the WHO Priority Pathogens List.  A number of experts have called for the use of antimicrobial combinations in typhoid fever to improve the efficacy of treatment and mitigate the problems of resistance. This suggestion is not backed up by good quality evidence. A current standard regimen, recommended by the World Health Organization, is a 7-day course of the oral antimicrobial azithromycin. Emerging evidence from small studies suggests that a combination of azithromycin and cefixime may achieve a better cure than azithromycin alone. The ACT-South Asia study aims to answer the question whether a combination of azithromycin and cefixime is more effective than azithromycin alone in the outpatient treatment of uncomplicated typhoid fever. In this trial we will recruit 1500 patients across four sites in typhoid-endemic areas of Bangladesh, India, Nepal and Pakistan. We will use a placebo (sugar pill) instead of cefixime in the single drug arm so that neither the patient nor the study team know which patient is receiving which treatment. Our aim is to assess whether treatment outcomes are better with the combination regime at completion of the one week of treatment and again at follow-up one and three months after treatment was started. Both of these antimicrobials are widely used and have an excellent safety profiles, but we will carefully monitor for side effects. We will additionally investigate the financial implications for families and the health system.  The recent emergence and spread of a particularly resistant typhoid strain in Pakistan adds urgency to this question. If the combination treatment is better than the single antibiotic treatment, the involvement of four countries in the study will allow generalization of the results across South Asia and other typhoid endemic areas. Considering the high burden of typhoid fever in this region even small improvements in the treatment success will translate into a benefit for many individuals and families and the health system as a whole. For example, a reduction in treatment failures in the 7 million patients with typhoid fever in South Asia from 15 % (with azithromycin alone) to 10 % using the antimicrobial combination, will mean at least 350,000 patients will experience a faster cure, fewer hospital admissions with less financial impact.</narrative>
