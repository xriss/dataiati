   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Within the tropics mangrove forests are seen as one of the most sustainable solutions to coastal climate adaptation and mitigation as a coastal wave buffer and carbon storage yet they are also threatened by accelerated sea level rise, sediment starvation and increased storm frequency and intensity. Particularly in vulnerable regions of Southeast-Asia changes in mangrove extend have implications with societal and economic relevance. There is an incomplete understanding of the factors causing tipping points resulting in mangroves switching to a fast rate of retreat or outgrowth at the border between mangroves and tidal flats. While quantification of the true economic value of the ecosystem system services (e.g., coastal protection, fisheries, carbon storage, biodiversity and wood products) provided by mangroves and their link to mangrove extent is also limited and is important for understanding the full business case for mangroves in the wider system. This project aims to understand the factors controlling such non-linear mangrove dynamics and to quantify the rate of lateral mangrove dynamics and associated change in ecosystem services in Vietnam and Indonesia. This project will further develop a satellite based remote sensing monitoring system in combination with field and mesocosm experiments, modelling to elucidate tipping points in lateral mangrove dynamics and quantifying the economic value of mangroves restoration and loss. These will provide national monitoring allowing changes to be understood and anticipated, key areas for restoration identified and the economic value and its temporal dynamics to be assessed. Furthermore, national and local governments, NGOs and coastal communities will benefit through the provision of evidence and methods for quantifying the value of mangroves and mangrove restoration.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="The MOMENTS project aims to differentiate between short term variability and real long term trends of mangrove cover change in Vietnam and Indonesia, this will further elucidate the uncertainties this creates for long term ecosystem service provisioning (Fig. 1). To achieve this aim the following four objectives will be met:  Objective 1 (O-1): Understand the tipping points to lateral mangrove dynamics through growth experiments controlling for physical disturbance frequency and magnitude. Disturbance thresholds to seedling establishment (Windows of Opportunity) and sapling stability thresholds will be tested in controlled mesocosm and erosion greenhouse experiments. The results will be used to parameterize the mangrove dynamics model.  Objective 2 (O-2): Create a mechanistic tipping point model with real physical forcing to anticipate sudden transitions in lateral mangrove dynamics.    Objective 3 (O-3): Find the national (Vietnam and Indonesia) hotspots of lateral mangrove change, through satellite remote sensing by developing near real-time monitoring system by extending the existing the Global Mangrove Watch (GMW) system. The drivers of change at these sites will also be established and short term variability will be separated from long-term trends.   Objective 4 (O-4): Create a model for the ecosystem services provided by mangrove forests and quantify their economic value related to mangrove extent and spatio-temporal dynamics. Through this model the financial case for restoration can be made within increased certainty.   Following the completion of this project new knowledge on the hotspots of change in mangroves extent in Indonesia and Vietnam will be gained, along with new understanding of the temporal dynamics, drivers and modelling of tipping points in mangrove ecosystems will be achieved. The value of the ecosystem services provided by mangroves along with their non-linear dynamics will be quantified to an improved level of accuracy and a total value of the ecosystem services provided by mangroves in Indonesia and Vietnam will be defined. Finally, a satellite base near real-time monitoring system will have been created, automatically providing monthly updates of mangrove extent, mud flats and health."></capital-spend>
