   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Guernica Remakings, North with South: research into the practice of cross-cultural translation through making, impact and engagement.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Post-apartheid South Africa (1994) and post-colonial Mauritius (1968) both have a socio-political legacy of oppression within their respective histories. Access to the arts was denied to the majority of South Africans prior to 1994 and stark imbalances still remain. In Mauritius the legacy of slavery and indentured servitude are still found at the root cause of societal divisions. This history is described in the Mauritian Truth and Justice Commission Report published in 2011 as &quot;still open wounds that may fester if deliberate measures are not taken for national reconciliation&quot;(31). In line with arts and culture policy in both countries there is an emphasis placed on the promotion of the arts and culture to address social injustice. Notably after years of neglect within mainstream trade and industry policy the creative industries are also now being recognised as an important growth area for the economies of Low and Middle income countries, including South Africa and Mauritius. It is within this context and in line with arts and culture policy in both countries this project focuses on art practice in sustainable development: encouraging creative excellence, empowering creative individuals and promoting and developing international networks in the arts. This will be realised through a tour of the exhibition Guernica Remakings, the formation of a Learning Lab that accompanies the exhibition and the distribution of the video documentation of the exhibition and the Lab.  The Learning Lab consciously creates a democratic environment that will foster discussion on art and social change, support the development of professional art practice through peer to peer collaboration and exchange with artists in residence, and expand the artistic networks of participating artists and Project Partners. Insights and best practice will permeate beyond participants to peers and related organisations; beneficiaries will grow exponentially through the dissemination of the documentary videos of the Learning Lab and the Guernica Remakings exhibition.   This project, Guernica Remakings, North with South, builds upon the AHRC funded research: Guernica Remakings, South Africa and continues work with the Project Partner the Keiskamma Art Project. Located in the Eastern Cape, in the poorest region of South Africa, the Art Project has remade Guernica four times since 2010. Their translation of Picasso&apos;s iconic anti-fascist artwork transforms its geography, time and narrative from: Spain to South Africa, from the early 20th century to the beginning of the 21st century, from anti-fascism to the HIV/AIDS crisis. The research project focused upon this process of cross-cultural translation through the creation of a fifth Keiskamma Guernica and asked why Guernica? Captured in the 12 part video documentary are some of the supportive, collaborative art making practices developed through the Art Project. Consequently the aims of this follow-on project include:  1.To transfer learning about key empowering collaborative activist art practices through the effective cross-cultural translation of Guernica. 2.To reach new audiences beyond conventional gallery visitors. 3.To develop deep and mutual partnerships with artist led organisations to co-produce knowledge and understanding of the role of art in sustainable international development to inform best practice. 4.To co-create a resource to inform best practice regarding the role of art in sustainable international development.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Through the successful AHRC GCRF funded project Guernica Remakings, South Africa, it has been identified that the practice of cross-cultural translation through making can be implemented further, and thus the impact expanded, in the following ways:  1.Tour the Guernica Remakings exhibition to: The Working Class Movement Library in Salford, UK (30 Jan - 20 Mar 2019), The Plaza in Rose Hill in   Mauritius (1 Apr - 14 Apr 2019), and The National Poetry Library in London in the UK (26 Jul - 3 Oct 2019).   2.Invite participation that involves the co-creation of new collaborative and individual displays in each of the three Guernica Remakings exhibition sites to foster artistic engagement and display collective socio-historical memory that relates directly to each of the exhibition locations.  3.Run a Learning Lab alongside each of the three exhibitions forming a democratic environment that will foster discussion on art and social change, support the development of professional art practice through peer to peer collaboration and exchange with artists in residence, and expand the artistic networks of participating artists and Project Partners. The Learning Lab activities across all three sites will be open to the general public. School children will be engaged through age appropriate children&apos;s trails at each of the exhibition sites. In Mauritius and in London school age children will further engage with empowering collaborative art practices through the participation in the Kids Guernica peace painting workshop. Artists from the ODA Project Partner organisation Keiskamma Art Project will participate in the Learning Lab in Mauritius and join the two week long international artist workshop led by Project Partner pARTage (pan-Indian Ocean Island artist led organisation). Approximately 25 artists will participate in the pARTage workshop and the Lab in Mauritius.   4.Produce a video documentary (circa 50 mins in length) of the three Learning Labs and exhibition sites as a record and a resource for participants and Project Partners, plus a video trailer. Insights and best practice will permeate beyond participants to peers and related organisations; beneficiaries will grow exponentially through the dissemination of the documentary videos of the Learning Lab and the Guernica Remakings exhibition.</narrative>
