  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">During the last decade,  many initiatives have been undertaken to make progress in disaster risk reduction (DRR) and response. However the  progress in disaster risk reduction has been limited by the failure to acknowledge and address the development processes as the root causes of disasters. Previous initiatives have concentrated on reducing existing risks, rather than on how risks are generated and accumulated in the first place through development projects that are taking place as a part of the reconstruction phase after a disaster or in response to the demand of urban sprawl. Furthermore, work on resilience has attracted criticism for its failure to involve vulnerable communities and address the issue of equity and power. As a result,  the Sustainable Development Goals which call for &quot;reduced inequalities&quot;, &quot;inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable cities&quot; and &quot;partnerships for goals&quot; and the Sendai Priority 4 that calls for build-back better in recovery, rehabilitation and reconstruction, are hard to achieve due to a lack of research knowledge, current practices and policies. One of the explanations for increasing risks is that the development and disaster risk reduction decision-making processes occur in silos, conducted by different agencies, institutions and other actors with differing priorities, perspectives and time horizons.  Therefore, there is an urgent need to transform current development practices that increase or create risks, as well as unfairly distributing risks to vulnerable communities, to a new form of development practice that is equitable and resilient.  This project consortium believe such a transformation can be achieved by enabling cross-organisational collaboration, openness, adaptability, learning, impartiality, power sharing and public participation.  The project aims to investigate processes, governance structures, policies and technology that can enable a transition towards a more risk-sensitive and transformative urban development approach. More specifically,  the project aims to investigate the nature of a  sociotechnical system, enabled by a collaborative foresight and consensus building virtual workspace, which can promote collaborative  governance approach across relevant organisations and support the transparent and democratic involvement of all the relevant stakeholders (including experts from local authorities, disaster management authorities, developers, poor and vulnerable communities, and humanitarian organisations) to analyse, forecast, visualize and debate disaster-risk trade-offs and to choose development plans that ensure sustainability and equitable resilience, giving considerations to climate change adaptation.    The key research questions that the project is aiming to address are:  What type of formal and informal collaborative partnerships need to be established to alleviate long-standing tensions between development and DRR and progress towards more risk-sensitive and transformative urban development? What changes are required within the current urban planning process to facilitate risk-sensitive urban development, giving consideration to natural disasters and their impact on the environment, economy and vulnerable communities?  What are the type of narratives that need to be developed, presented and discussed to establish a comprehensive understanding of the impact of the proposed developments on the community, economy and environment ? What are the vulnerabilities that need to be considered within the local context? How can we make participatory planning more accessible to a range of communities? Three countries (Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Malaysia) from the Asia-Pacific region have been selected for this research since the Asia-Pacific region continues to be the world&apos;s most disaster prone region. These countries are frequently affected by a multitude of natural hazards including floods, landslides, cyclones and droughts.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The aim of the TRANSCEND project is to investigate the nature of a  sociotechnical system, enabled by a collaborative foresight and    consensus building virtual workspace, which can promote an adaptive governance approach across relevant organisations and support the    transparent and democratic involvement of all the relevant stakeholders (including experts from local authorities, disaster management    authorities, developers, poor and vulnerable communities, and humanitarian organisations) to analyse, forecast, visualize and debate    disaster-risk trade-offs and to choose development plans that ensure sustainability and equitable resilience, giving considerations to climate    change adaptation.   A systemic approach that explores the various system &quot;views&quot; of this sociotechnical system will be adopted in achieving    this aim.  Objectives:  1. To investigate the system conditions of the sociotechnical system necessary for establishing an adaptive government approach for           transforming &quot;silo&quot; based approach to &quot;participatory&quot; urban development approach that accommodate the  transparent and democratic           involvement of all the relevant stakeholders  that promotes equitable resilience.  These system conditions will be analysed and validated          through a set of system views such as :  partnership view; planning process view; stakeholders&apos; narratives view; simulation model view;          presentation view and transformational learning view.  2. To investigate the nature of a sociotechnical system that can be effective in facilitating learning, in encouraging local knowledge creation,           ownership and active participation by vulnerable communities in influencing their local development plans for an equitable future.           The system views that will be analysed and validated under this objective are: community resilient view and community capacity view.  3. To design and implement a collaborative foresight and consensus building virtual workspace that can support the experimentation and           validation of the system views identified in objective 1 &amp; 2. This objective will also consider two further views: data governance view and           system architecture view.  4. To establish three Living Labs Sri Lanka, Pakistan and Malaysia as an &quot;Experimentation and Learning Environment&quot;, involving the local          organisations and vulnerable communities,  to co-design and  validate the above system views for establishing an adaptive governance          approach for urban development which is equitable and resilient.</narrative>
