   <narrative xml:lang="EN">A Step Change in LMIC Prosthetics Provision through Computer Aided Design, Actimetry and Database Technologies</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Approximately 100M people worldwide need prosthetic and orthotic (P&amp;O) devices [1]. Low-cost, robust devices are only half the story; an estimated 80-90% do not have access to P&amp;O services &quot;due to a shortage of personnel, service units and health rehabilitation infrastructures&quot; [2]. All three barriers could be addressed by data, so we propose research into novel tools to enhance P&amp;O data.  Access is particularly poor for people in Lower and Middle Income Countries (LMICs) such as Cambodia with its landmine legacy, who are typically young and live longer lives of more physical work than in the developed world, for whom most prosthetics technology has been developed. LMICs have higher levels traumatic amputation from accidents, conflict and landmine injuries, and humanitarian crises present particular access challenges [3]. Services are set up primarily for trauma injuries but by 2035 it is estimate diabetes may affect over 500M people, and is growing fastest in LMICs [4].  Through the International Society for Prosthetics and Orthotics (ISPO), substantial improvements have been made in P&amp;O design and training for LMICs [2,5]. An overwhelming patient:clinician ratio remains and &quot;the development of the sector is too slow ... to meet existing needs or keep pace with the growing populations of people with disabilities&quot; [2]. Even with ISPO accredited training, in South East Asian LMICs it is estimated that three times the current number of clinician is required for the current amputee population [6].  We will conduct two data-technology research studies, to develop tools to improve P&amp;O service access, train clinicians and improve efficiency of service funding use. With a team of expert clinicians, academics and policy makers in Cambodia, we will investigate: 1) digital measurement tools to assess a user&apos;s residual limb anatomy, biomechanics of gait, typical daily prosthetic limb use, and health status; and 2) the architecture for a portable digital patient casenote system: a robust and secure IT network for travelling prosthetists to visit provincial areas to provide evidence-based treatment for those in remote communities who cannot afford to travel.  Beside these scientific challenges, the context makes this work highly ambitious. Experience shows that care must be taken in applying P&amp;O from Western countries directly in LMICs. As well as users&apos; different needs, their relationship with clinicians and prosthetics are different for complex cultural, social and environmental reasons. We frame our scientific research using a first-of-kind ethnographic study of P&amp;O service providers and users to ensure the developed technologies are practical. We will also conduct business modelling research, producing tools to ensure the technologies are cost effective and can be implemented sustainably.  These technologies have the potential to transform the quality of life of prosthetic limb users worldwide and are required today. A more portable P&amp;O service would enable people to access provision, fitting, adjustment and repair of their prosthetics with reduced time off work - essential where an agricultural worker spends their day&apos;s earnings on the same day&apos;s food. Prosthetists would access and update casenotes for their patients, provide a repository for clinician training, and enable users to access information regarding their progress and report problems to obtain critical treatment.  Longer term the project results will enable a valuable database to become established. The data will enable selection of technology that delivers greatest quality of life benefit, making best use of limited budgets [7]. It will support academics and trainee healthcare providers in research and education. We have a network of Asia&apos;s most influential clinicians, educators and policymakers to help achieve these ambitious benefits. Finally, the research will return benefits to the UK - we do not yet have a unified P&amp;O digital record system and database.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">At its World Congress in May 2017 the International Society for Prosthetics and Orthotics (ISPO) agreed that one development is needed above all else to enhance prosthetics and orthotics (P&amp;O) service provision: data.  The proposed programme of research focuses on Lower and Middle Income Country (LMIC) user-defined technology to transform P&amp;O service provision by enabling the remote collection of data rich measures. Combining novel web science and biomedical engineering, we will perform fundamental research to enable development of: 1) a suite of digital assessment tools to enhance patient records through biomechanical and health status measurements, e.g. 3D residual limb scanning, actimetry, video and culture-specific functional and quality-of-life outcome measures; and 2) a portable, asynchronous digital patient record and data collection system to enable these data to be accessed and collected remotely, allowing healthcare professionals to deliver P&amp;O services in rural and isolated communities. These tools will enable researchers and clinicians to create a data foundation, to design and evaluate their practice and future research, ensure the most appropriate technologies are used and that the most effective use is made of limited healthcare resources.  We have defined the following objectives, ranked in order of priority. These include: 1) a critical and user-informed analysis of the clinical, biomechanical, quality of life and cost effectiveness data required for prosthetic limb provision in Cambodia; 2) to investigate digital tools to collect anatomical (3D shape and colour scanning), biomechanical (actimetry and video gait analysis), and health status data (function and quality of life measures), specific to Cambodian healthcare providers and service users; 3) to conceive a first-of-kind asynchronously connected distributed database architecture, with associated data security measures, to enable digital patient casenotes to be collected in remote or isolated communities; 4) to establish what is the minimal conventional casenote dataset with digital artefacts from the aforementioned measurement tools; 5) to define data interpretation methods to extract relevant prosthetic assessment, design and functional use information for clinicians; and 6) to produce a value-based implementation plan based on business modelling principles, both as this project&apos;s pathway to impact and as a toolset to help translate these technologies into other LMICs, and for future use supporting the implementation of other GCRF prosthetics and orthotics research.</narrative>
