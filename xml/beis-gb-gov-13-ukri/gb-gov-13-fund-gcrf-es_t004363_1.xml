   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Illegible/invisibilised protracted rural displacements: slavery and forced internal migration in Mali</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Descent-based slavery and its legacies continue to prevail in most communities of the west and south of Mali today. Because of the lack of protecting legal framework, populations victims of slavery-related violence often have little choice but to escape to more &apos;hospitable&apos; areas, having been systematically barred from land access in their home village by the local elite. Those populations with ascribed slave status are the poorest and the most vulnerable populations in the Sahel. In many cases though, those displaced, mostly agricultural populations continue to live in precarious conditions because of continuing marginalization and stigmatization in new host communities, with risks of new forms of servitude strongly overlapping with the legacies of historical slavery. Slavery-related displacements in West Africa have been largely overlooked in the development and humanitarian practice and reporting. This is certainly a major omission in view of the Sustainable Development Goals Our project looks at the most invisibilised historical and contemporary slavery-related internal displacements, those taking place within the rural areas in the Kayes region and which concern in their vast majority women and children because men of those communities are migrants elsewhere in cities and abroad. In such crisis situation as the one prevailing today in Mali, working with populations who are considered of &apos;slave descent&apos; is thus an urgent equitable development issue. Our research programme aims not only to analyse and map the long history of slavery-related protracted displacements in the Kayes region, but more importantly we propose concrete measures to redress this unacknowledged long-term crisis situation by sensitising the local and national government in Mali at every level to anticipate and efficiently manage those &apos;fugitive&apos; displacements of people with ascribed slave status.  Our project team brings together a unique combination of expertise and methods in African history, comparative literature, law, social anthropology and political sciences, which are less common in development approaches. It aims at constructing a synergistic approach with transformative and catalyst effect by exploring both affordable and upscalable solutions for sustainable livelihoods and proposing directly actionable recommendations for the surveyed communities (and beyond). The transformative aspect of this research relies on bridging the gaps between practitioners and scholars in and with the surveyed communities through a website, policy papers, documentary films, teaching material, trainings, research dissemination and advocacy at appropriate policy-making levels, facilitated by two Malian partner NGOs, Donkosira and TEMEDT.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project aims to uncover the complex intersections of protracted displacements and internal slavery in the Kayes region (Mali) from a longue-dur&#xE9;e perspective. The longue-dur&#xE9;e perspective will allow us to better understand under which socio, economic and political circumstances such crises may occur, how and why despite their regular occurrences in the past 100 years, those &apos;fugitive&apos; displacement to escape slavery have been largely invisibilised, thus preventing any government&apos;s anticipation, efficient management and possible prevention until today, and reinforcing the economic and social marginalisation of those forcedly displaced communities whose unrecognised situation continues to limit their access to essential resources, notably land, and thus prevents them from living sustainable lives.  Bringing together a unique combination of expertise in African history, comparative literature, law, social anthropology and political sciences, the project will offer a synergistic approach with transformative and catalyst effect on development initiatives in the concerned communities, through: - providing a better understanding of how the legal environment can be used, changed and shaped to provide slavery-related displaced populations with legal protections and solutions, with a special focus on women and land access;  - the examination of the complexity of those slavery-related displacement trajectories from a gender perspective to provide those populations, especially women and children, with equitable development solutions based on their own experiences and needs for sustainable livelihoods, usually based on agri- and horticulture; - the creation of communication bridges and platforms between those forcedly displaced groups and local communities, as well as with local and national authorities, to enable collaboration, integration and acceptance; - the systematic assessment of the potential for replicability and up-scaling of project strategies across contexts; make these visible at the national and international levels and open windows and opportunities for diverse sustainable and equitable development pathways.  In-depth and grounded research will contribute to render those historical and contemporary protracted displacements not only visible, but also legible and intelligible for sustainable solutions. The project moves beyond the analysis of protracted fugitive displacement as a crisis-related quantitative event, and instead focuses on forced displacements as a duress-inspired, qualitative continuum of events and cumulated experiences in both time and space, thus spanning several generations of the most marginalised populations in West African rural settings. The transformative aspect of this research relies on both raising legal and civil rights awareness and support for those communities, and exploring affordable and upscalable solutions for sustainable livelihoods. It will allow girls and women in particular to escape further risks of exploitation by re-appropriating their role as valuable economic agents and contributors to the development of their own community. The project seeks to bridge gaps between research and development practitioners, by engaging with local authorities, NGOs, and key stakeholders throughout the course of the project trainings, research dissemination and advocacy at appropriate policy-making levels.  It will maximise impact by building on the PI, Co-Is and Malian partners (Donkosira and TEMEDT) long-standing research and engagement with the region under study. The project will produce the following key outputs:  - One edited volume with a peer-reviewed selection of the final conference papers - One co- authored journal article volume drawing together key findings - One website - Two 20-min videos - One school toolkit - Policy papers - One paralegal training curriculum</narrative>
