   <narrative xml:lang="EN">PARAMO - Provisioning of ecosystem services And cultuRAl values in the MOntane tropics</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The tropics harbour more species than anywhere else on Earth. This biodiversity supports a number of ecosystem services -- benefits that humankind derives from the natural environment, including water, nutrient-rich soils and pest-control by predatory birds and insects -- that are essential for human well-being, and it also underpins many cultural attachments that people have with nature. However, the disturbance of natural habitats and their conversion for other uses, such as farming, are driving a global extinction crisis. This project takes an innovative approach to understand the links between biodiversity and ecosystem services and cultural provision using the Colombian Andes as a case study.   The Colombian Andes are one of the most biodiversity rich places on Earth, their soils contain carbon-rich peats, ecosystem services are derived for the majority of Colombia&apos;s human population, and these are rich in cultural values on both a personal and community level. In spite of this tremendous wealth, hostilities in Colombia have long hampered research to understand eco-cultural relationships. The reduction in hostilities creates a policy window to impact the development of a sustainable bioeconomy, i.e. the economic exploitation of its biological resources, underpinned by Colombia&apos;s high biodiversity. There are inherent environmental and cultural risks of capitalising upon biodiversity, which could drive negative outcomes for conservation or society. Our multidisciplinary programme will answer the major, unanswered question of how best to incorporate and optimise the combination of biodiversity, ecosystem service, and cultural values within natural resource management. In doing so, we will transform the role of cultural heritage and human-environmental experiential knowledge within the design of conservation programmes.   Our study will answer this key overarching question by fulfilling four main Objectives that will: (1) define  the impacts of habitat conversion and disturbance on biodiversity; (2) resolve how ecosystem service provisioning and resilience is affected by habitat conversion and disturbance, focusing specifically on carbon stocking, nutrient recycling, soil nutrient and water retention, and landslide prevention; (3) understand how local communities perceive and attach cultural value to biodiversity and ecosystem services, via a program of story-telling workshops; and (4) integrate environmental and cultural values to co-design natural resource management, and translate these findings to core stakeholders, from local communities, to NGOs and relevant government departments. This research will thus enable our multidisciplinary team of experts to support Colombia in developing its economy in a manner that continues to protect biodiversity, ecosystem services and cultural values and beliefs.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Using DNA metabarcoding and e-DNA, fine-scale field measurements of biodiversity and ecosystem services, and co-creation of Service Design and Applied Storytelling, this project will the focus on the p&#xE1;ramo-cloudforest of Boyac&#xE1; and Cundinamarca. Our multidisciplinary programme will answer the major, unanswered question of how best to incorporate and optimise the combination of biodiversity, ecosystem service, and cultural values within natural resource management. In doing so, we will transform the role of cultural heritage and human-environmental experiential knowledge within the design of land management and conservation programmes.   We will achieve this via a novel trans-disciplinary approach focusing on four specific Objectives, under which we will embed core research activities. These Objectives are:  OBJECTIVE 1) Define the impacts of land-use change and habitat disturbance across altitudinal scales on biodiversity, focusing above ground on birds and dung beetles (model taxa that play core functional roles, incl. seed dispersal and nutrient recycling), and below ground on earthworms and soil micro-fauna/flora (foundations of terrestrial food-webs, with core roles in nutrient recycling, soil functioning and soil health).  OBJECTIVE 2)  Resolve ecosystem service provisioning and their resilience to habitat and biodiversity perturbation over p&#xE1;ramo-cloudforest altitudinal transects, focusing specifically on carbon stocking, nutrient recycling, soil nutrient and water retention, and landslide prevention. We will achieve this using both observational and experimental approaches.   OBJECTIVE 3) Understand how local communities perceive and attach cultural value to biodiversity and ecosystem services, via a program of storytelling and community co-design workshops along p&#xE1;ramo-cloudforest altitudinal transects.  OBJECTIVE 4)  Integrate environmental and cultural values for co-designed natural resource management, using statistical modelling frameworks not previously applied within the Arts and Humanities to cross numeric cultural values (Objective 3) with biodiversity (Objective 1) and ecosystem service (Objective 2) values, and translate findings via stakeholder engagement.  In meeting these Objectives, we will provide the first unified assessment of how above- and below-ground biodiversity links to ecosystem service and cultural values. With direct relevance to the NERC Societal Challenges of &apos;Managing environmental change&apos; and &apos;Benefiting from natural resources&apos;, this project will meet core strategic aims of the call including (but not limited to): (i) developing a baseline of Colombian biodiversity, structure, and function; (ii) exploring the linkage between biodiversity and function, and the value of that biodiversity; and (iii) achieving a much improved understanding of human/nature relationships and the benefits that community engagement with nature brings to human well-being in the tropics.</narrative>
