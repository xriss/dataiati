   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Tuning the immune response in tuberculosis</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The overarching aim of my fellowship is to extend our understanding of host factors that calibrate a favourable immune response, and consequently clinical outcome in tuberculosis (TB). I will combine studies using the tractable zebrafish mycobacterial infection model, with molecular profiling of in vivo human responses to the tuberculin skin test (TST) in patients with active TB to test the hypothesis that interleukin (IL)10 responses in TB exhibit a u-shaped relationship with pathology. In addition, I aim to discover novel host factors that may be responsible for different clinical outcomes of TB by identifying the molecular determinants of variable human immune responses in the TST and validating their function in the zebrafish model. Firstly, I will test the hypothesis that inadequate or excessive interleukin (IL)10 activity increases pathogenicity in Mycobacterium marinum (Mm) infection of zebrafish. I will investigate whether aberrant IL10 levels lead to dysregulated inflammatory responses and unfavourable outcomes after Mm infection. To do this I will compare wild type, IL10 deficient and IL10 over expressing zebrafish using systems level characterisation of immune responses by RNAseq transcriptomics, combined with quantitative intravital imaging assessments of cellular recruitment, granuloma formation, and mycobacterial load. In parallel with the zebrafish studies, I will test the hypothesis that the IL10 response in the TST reveals a u-shaped relationship with disease severity in human TB. The TST faithfully reflects all of the variability in molecular changes at the site of disease and is therefore an excellent model of active TB. I will quantify IL10 and tumour necrosis factor (TNF) alpha inducible gene signatures within TST transcriptomes from people with active pulmonary TB to test the hypothesis that the balance of regulatory IL10 activity and pro-inflammatory TNF alpha activity within the TST correlates with disease severity. Secondly, I will adopt an innovative genome-wide discovery approach to identify and validate novel regulators of variable immune responses in active TB on the basis that variance in the immune response leads to differences in pathogenesis. I will cross-reference TST response genes whose expression varies most between individuals with active TB, to a network of putative genetic interactions defined by functional genomic data called an interactome, to identify pivotal genes that are likely to regulate this variability. Subsequently, I will evaluate the consequences of candidate master-regulator gene deficiency and over expression on anti-mycobacterial immune responses in the zebrafish Mm infection model. In addition to consolidating my existing technical and bioinformatic experience, this fellowship provides outstanding opportunities to develop valuable new expertise across a broad repertoire of advanced experimental techniques, including RNAseq transcriptomics and specialised in vivo imaging of immune responses in the zebrafish Mm model as well as cutting-edge functional genomics and genetic engineering strategies. Combined with the vibrant research environment and first-class facilities at UCL and collaborations with two world leaders in the field of zebrafish models of immune responses, this will allow me to fulfil my objective to become an independent investigator and future world leader in translational research focussed on understanding immune responses in TB and respiratory tract inflammation. I aim to disseminate my findings widely throughout the scientific community via high impact publications in peer reviewed journals and presentations at national and international meetings. In addition to strengthening current collaborations I will also seek to develop new links with other academics within this field. Ultimately, I hope that this will pave the way to obtaining further funding through a Senior Clinical Fellowship.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Tuberculosis (TB) is an important infectious disease which affects nine million people and causes two million deaths every year. The human immune system can protect against TB but is also responsible for causing the tissue damage that may result from TB disease. I aim to increase our understanding of the parts of the immune system that influence the balance of beneficial and harmful responses to TB infection in order to identify new targets for more effective treatments and vaccines. To do this I will combine experiments in a fish model that closely resembles human TB with experiments in patients with active TB disease. Initially, I will focus on the role of a specific part of the immune system called interleukin (IL)10 because this is a key mediator that controls the immune system during its response to infections. Thus far the role of IL10 in TB has almost exclusively been evaluated in mouse models that provide incomplete information because they do not accurately reflect human TB disease. In addition, I will take advantage of the massive increase in genetic data that has become available, in order to discover new components of immune responses to TB which vary most between people. I postulate that variable immune responses cause differences in outcome of TB infection. I will test this theory by investigating the effects of deficiency or excess of potential new regulatory factors that I identify in people with TB, using the fish model of TB infection. I hope to gain new insights that help to develop novel interventions that will significantly shorten the length of anti-TB treatment, which will be important to reduce spread of TB and minimise development of drug resistance. I anticipate that my work may also lead to design of new vaccines that prevent TB disease altogether.</narrative>
