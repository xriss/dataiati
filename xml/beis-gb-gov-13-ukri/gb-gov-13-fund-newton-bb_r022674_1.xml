   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Overcoming insecticide resistance using diverse fungal pathogens and variable agricultural landscapes</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Successful agriculture requires crop defence against insects. Brazil&apos;s agricultural economy suffers annual yield losses of 14.7 billion US$ from insect pests. Indeed, insects consume 10-20% of all global crops whilst growing or in storage. Agriculture relies on widespread chemical insecticide application. Despite extensive research on insecticide application regimes, insecticidal compounds and genetically modified crops, insects continue to evolve resistance against control agents with predictable regularity. The vast scale of Brazilian agriculture and the levels of insecticide use required for pest control have driven resistance evolution in several significant insect pests. Our pump-priming project assesses how &apos;biopesticide&apos; fungi that naturally kill insects can be used to sustainably control a major new pest of many Brazilian crops, the invasive cotton bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera.   The logic for our project comes from evolutionary science and the particular features of host-pathogen interactions. Insecticide resistance evolution occurs when a single control agent is applied over a broad area, then consistent evolutionary pressures drive previously-rare resistance genes to spread rapidly through the pest population. To prevent this, our project studies how multiple fungal pathogen strains can be used in a spatial matrix across agricultural landscapes, so that selection for resistance varies in different locations, preventing a uniform evolutionary response. On its own, this approach may not be sufficient because of cross resistance: genes making pests resistant to one fungal strain could also confer resistance to others. However, in host-pathogen systems, the optimum genotype to defend against one pathogen is often highly sensitive to the organism&apos;s environment. Simultaneous manipulation of an environmental landscape variable (the type of crop grown by farmers) will substantially decrease the consistency of selection: we predict this will prevent resistance evolution.   To develop a pest control system using these principles, our pump priming project integrates research in Brazil and the UK to:   1. Quantify the extent to which genes making cotton bollworm resistant under one combination of fungal pathogen and crop plant make them susceptible in another pathogen-crop combination. We will measure these genetic relationships in a large lab experiment, taking many pest genotypes, allowing each to feed on one of three crops, then exposing them to different fungal strains.   2. Establish that multiple fungal pathogen strains can kill cotton bollworm larvae and have desirable pest control properties: e.g. rapid kill rate, feeding suppression, and negative effects on adult survivors. We will do this by testing larval responses to many fungal isolates in the lab.   3. Show that fungal pest control qualities are maintained under temperature and humidity conditions commonly occurring in Brazilian fields. Lab infection experiments will manipulate environmental variables and assess larval mortality. Then we will spray spores onto crops in the field and test how viability and pest pathogenicity degrade over time.   After this pump priming phase, our future work will assess: spatial scales for deploying crop types and fungal biopesticides to block resistance evolution; details of potential evolutionary responses in pests; and economics of implementation.   The whole project will generate a suite of fungal pathogens and recommendations for their application in managed agricultural landscapes comprising multiple crop species to block resistance evolution. With these outputs and our industry/NGO partners we will commercialise a cost effective, practical and evolution-proof pest control system for Brazil.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The high level goal of our project is to develop a sustainable, evolution-proof fungal biopesticide system to control insect crop pests in Brazil. We will investigate how multiple fungal biopesticide strains can be applied in concert with strategic variation in crop type, thereby presenting a heterogeneous adaptive landscape to insect pests that mimics the stability of naturally coevolving host-pathogen associations and blocks insecticide resistance evolution. Whilst the principals of our research could be applied to many insect pests, our project focusses on an especially pernicious generalist crop pest, the cotton bollworm Helicoverpa armigera, that presents urgent novel challenges for Brazilian agriculture in terms of crop damage and insecticide resistance.  In order to achieve this ambition, we have subdivided our specific aims into two groups corresponding to Phase I (the pump priming phase as described in this proposal) and Phase II (to be developed in the follow-on application based on the results of Phase I), respectively.  In the pump-priming Phase I of our project, we have three specific and complementary aims:  1A) To assess how combining multiple fungal isolates with crop diversity can make resistance-selection inconsistent, and thereby prevent resistance evolving. The outcome of this experiment will be a quantification of how the relative fitness of pest genotypes changes across different pesticide-crop combinations, and whether this genetic covariance is sufficiently low to block resistance evolution.  1B) To select a suite of fungal pathogen isolates with appropriate virulence as pesticides to kill H. armigera and negatively affect life history. The outcome will be a series of isolate-specific measures of how fungi affect survival, larval and pupal weight, adult fecundity, and sex ratio.  1C) To demonstrate that our fungal isolates can work to control pests in the field in Brazil. The outcome will be a series of isolate-specific measures of how fungal infection of H. armigera is influenced by a range of temperatures and humidities representative of Brazilian field conditions, as well as assessment of field spore viability on crops at an experimental farm.  Having fulfilled these aims in Phase I, we will apply for funding for the second phase of our project to answer key questions related to the implementation of our solution in Brazil.  We anticipate four key objectives in Phase II:  2A) First, we will use simulations (parameterised with real measures of genetic associations from Phase I and estimates of H. armigera dispersal) to model how the spatial scale of heterogeneity in fungal isolate application and crop plant cultivation affects variation in the selection landscape for resistance to fungal pathogens; this will determine the correct deployment scales to achieve long-term, sustainable, evolution-proof pest control.   2B) The modelling in 2A will inform experiments addressing the second objective in Phase II: to obtain on-farm estimates of how selection for resistance is influenced by crop species and fungal isolate heterogeneity in the field; this will quantify the benefits of our system in a Brazilian context, relative to standard monocultures with homogenous biopesticide application.   2C) We will assess the potential for resistance selection to break down genetic associations across fungal - crop environments over time; this will quantify whether and how quickly the genetic architecture of pests responds to selection imposed by a variable suite of pathogens and host plants.   2D) Finally, to inform future users of the system about the potential costs and benefits of increasing heterogeneity, we will also quantify the economic consequences of increased levels of agricultural crop landscape complexity (in terms of efficiency and yield) for Brazilian farmers, relative to traditional monoculture.</narrative>
