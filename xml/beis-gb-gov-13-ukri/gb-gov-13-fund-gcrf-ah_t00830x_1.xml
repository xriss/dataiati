   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Sus_NET: Sustainable Making for Feminist Action</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Sus_NET brings together a network of feminist activists and makers using technologies and materials that are recycled, low-cost and low-energy. Each node of the network will facilitate a workshop based on their own local and contextual practices to respond creatively and practically to local issues of gender and equality. These workshops will form the core of the network, spiralling outwards to NGOs and Universities across Latin America (see letters of support), which will, in the second year, develop and learn from the findings, resources and outputs generated in year one.  Together, the network will develop new methods, technologies, schematics and toolkits that are sustainable in their design and documentation. As researchers in the UK we will learn about the environmentally and socially sustainable technology activism that is taking place in Latin America. We intend for this to lead develop significant collaborations that lead on to further funded projects. We explicitly engage with the sustainable development goal of reduced inequality through a focus on digital technology and sustainability. Our workshops in Latin America are led by local facilitators who work with marginalised communities using reusable and sustainable materials to create low-cost technologies in response to a political or environmental need. This means that we engage with the sustainable development goals #7 in terms of using and prioritising sustainable reliable and  affordable energy and technology and sustainable development goal #12 of responsible consumption and production, not only through the materials and resources we use within the workshops, but also by bringing together issues of technology with issues of sustainability and cost. In so doing, we are reconceptualising technology-not as pervasive, &apos;big&apos; or global; but instead as something that is low-cost, low-energy and low-fi. Using a range of Arts and Humanities methods and approaches including design, performance, art, music and action research; co-production (crowd source/public knowledge projects, hacking/repair projects), pilot technology and code projects (build, design, activist projects), we will facilitate a network that is based on practice and community work, expanding outwards to learn from shared good practice.  We have two key aims: 1) to develop a network of organisations addressing issues of equality and sustainability through developing low-cost digital technologies. The network will bring together activist and voluntary organisations that operate on very limited budgets in rural locations with more established NGOs and community facing centres within Universities. These latter organisations focus on education and policy initiatives and while some methods for engagement overlap (co-created and practice-led workshops, working within not outside communities, using digital technologies and creative methods to engage); there is much to learn from the smaller organisations in terms of issues of sustainability (methodological sustainability, organizational sustainability, environmental sustainability).  2) to engage with issues of gender and inequality through the central lens of sustainability. Within the field of digital technology this is urgent if we are to reduce the digital divide not least because for the majority of the people we will work with, technology is not rapid, &apos;big&apos;, smart or ubiquitous: it is low cost, unreliable and low-energy. We need to rethink technology from the perspective of marginalized communities who use it if we are to implement useful policy or infrastructural change that is inclusive in the future. In keeping with this, we will also build a network based on creative and technological practice, building our findings on tangible outcomes from creative and practice led workshops.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">sus_NET engages with issues of gender, equalities, diversity and inclusion in international development through both the organisations that we are working with - their ethos, approach and methods; and the focus of the workshops and overall network on issues on gender, sustainability and technology. We will work directly with activists and political organisations that engage with issues of gender and inequality through their remit and approach, and we will widen the scope of the network in year two to HEIs and NGOs, taking forward the lessons learnt, best practice and the prototypes we have developed in order to impact as widely as possible not only within and across the communities we directly work with, but also into the education and policy sectors. Many of these groups are women-led and work on projects related to inequality and inclusion in digital technology. Through their community engagement they have developed unique practices and methods for working with a diverse range of participants from different backgrounds, age-groups and locations. The focus of the network is on the responsible production and consumption of digital technologies (SDG12).  By responsible production we mean the sustainable development of hackable, open source and modular technologies and using recycled and reused everyday objects, but it is also considered in terms of the social and cultural implications of technologies for environmental monitoring and feminist activism. These production approaches speak to issues of consumption, where we will also prioritise working with recycled and low-energy technologies addressing aspects of SD7: Clean and Affordable Energy. We are directly addressing issues of gender, equalities and inclusion within the broader scope of environmental sustainability and digital technology.   Developing countries across the globe are undergoing rapid and widespread digital technological change. This change is set within, rather than external to, existing cultural, social and economic inequalities, infrastructures and politics. This means that despite widespread goals of reducing inequalities and increasing sustainability,  emerging digitally-driven forms and cultures can address or exacerbate these issues. Given this, one objective is to address SDG#5 of reducing inequality by seeking to understand, through community creative projects, the impact of, and potential for, technology on everyday lives. Unless we better understand what communities are diversely and unevenly doing, what they wish to do with digital technologies, how they are doing this (with what? When? How?) we are unable to develop useful interventions. At the same time, we want to do more than understand: we want to co-design and co-curate with communities to identify and realize their needs or desires, and this also means that welfare and economic development emerges from processes of engagement rather than determining them.   Part of our engagement work is to understand the extent to which &apos;having technology&apos; can or should be looked to as a measurement of success, as well as what kinds of digital media technologies emerge through our engagement. Our partner organizations in year one for example, do not work with fast, intuitive, dynamic technologies and systems: they work with low-cost, low energy, sustainable tech that has been built for particular social or political goals from reusable, recycled materials. This notion of technology is very different from that cited in media, government or policy documents. As researchers in the UK we will learn from and engage with the environmentally and socially sustainable technology activism that is taking place in Latin America. We intend for this to lead develop significant collaborations that lead on to further funded projects.</narrative>
