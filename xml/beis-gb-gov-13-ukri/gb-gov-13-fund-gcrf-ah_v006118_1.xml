   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Media freedom and access to information are fundamental rights at the heart of open societies. They are also important enablers of sustainable development: media freedom helps to reduce corruption, hold governments to account, and increase social inclusion. In 2020, these crucial rights are under attack. Governments around the world are harassing and attacking journalists, attempting to discredit their work and intimidate them into silence. There has been a sharp, global decline in press freedom since 2016. The COVID-19 pandemic has only compounded the situation, with many states using the crisis as an excuse to crack down on journalism and free speech.  This research project is an urgent, real-time study of a major new international campaign that is working to reverse these trends, prevent attacks on journalists and promote media freedom. In 2019, the UK government announced that media freedom would become its number one foreign policy issue. Then Foreign Secretary, Jeremy Hunt, launched the Media Freedom Campaign (MFC) and appointed Amal Clooney as the UK&apos;s Special Envoy on Media Freedom. The MFC includes: 1. A coalition of 35 member states that have pledged to lobby against those who harm journalists. The coalition is co-chaired by Canada and the UK.  2.   A High-Level Panel of Legal Experts developing tools to promote media freedom. 3.   An annual Global Media Freedom conference. 4.    A task force that helps countries develop National Action Plans to promote Media Freedom. 5.   A Global Media Defence Fund administered by UNESCO.   The MFC is an important departure from previous work to support media freedom because it is state-led. This raises a number of immediate and important questions. Will the MFC duplicate the existing work of the wide range of NGOs and multilateral organisations, which have been working on media freedom issues for decades? Given that MFC&apos;s current co-chairs, UK and Canada, have major trading partners that attack and harass journalists, will this create tensions that constrain the work of the MFC? How is the campaign perceived by those it seeks to help? Historical attempts to support media freedom have been embedded in wider ideological struggles, and closely tied to the self-interest of the states that initiate them. Therefore, we also ask; do Global South stakeholders perceive the MFC as a form of media imperialism?   This research project evaluates the work of the MFC using semi-structured interviews with all of its key members; ethnographic observations; and document analysis. This research is conducted by an international research team spanning the UK, Sudan and the Philippines. Its primary objective is to support the work of the MFC and enhance the inclusiveness and effectiveness of its actions. Specifically, it explores the extent to which the MFC includes and prioritises the needs of Global South stakeholders. It then feeds these insights back to the MFC to help the Coalition develop their future programming. Its second, related goal, is to identify best practice for media freedom initiatives more generally. Finally, it contributes to academic knowledge about foreign policy and media imperialism.   The project will directly benefit a range of aid-recipient countries that are grappling with Media Freedom issues. &apos;Ensuring public access to information and protecting fundamental freedoms&apos; through media freedom is a development outcome itself (UN Sustainable Development Goal 16:10), but it also directly contributes to other development outcomes. Indeed, a free and independent media correlates in most countries with lower corruption, stronger civil society, more accountable politicians, better provision of public services, and societies which are more inclusive of women and minorities.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="This urgent, challenge-led research examines a major international campaign attempting to protect journalists and promote media freedom - the Media Freedom Campaign (MFC). The project studies the MFC during the crucial first 12 months of its operations, using in-depth semi-structured interviews, ethnographic observations and document analysis.   We have negotiated unique research access with the UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) who will be co-chair of the Campaign for the next 6 months. To make the most of this research and impact opportunity, it is vital that we begin this research as soon as possible. Although this project coincides with the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, the core work of the MFC continues largely un-interrupted and we have developed clear contingency plans to mitigate potential disruption.  The project&apos;s first objective is to support the work of the MFC and enhance the inclusiveness and effectiveness of its actions. Specifically, it examines the extent to which the Campaign incorporates the prioritises and values of Global South stakeholders. It then feeds these insights back to the MFC at key moments, to help it develop its future programming. In their letter of support, the FCO describe this project as, &apos;an excellent opportunity to have independent researchers monitor and evaluate the Campaign... we would welcome their input when we next update the UK Foreign Affairs Committee on the Global Campaign for Media Freedom&apos;.    The second, related objective, is to identify best practice for media freedom initiatives more generally. The research will do this by examining the perspective of stakeholders on the work of the MFC, and where they see its success and limitations. This will be done through interviews and observation in London and Geneva, where key MFC programming is based; and through extensive fieldwork in two country case-studies: Sudan and the Philippines. These findings will be published as a policy-focused report and distributed internationally.  The third objective is to contribute to academic knowledge about: (1) media development, including debates about media imperialism and the ways in which the MFC might reproduce, or challenge, western notions of media freedom and the implications of this. (2) political processes of international campaigning, contributing to knowledge on the role that states can play as &apos;norm entrepreneurs&apos; through their foreign policy campaigns and (3) celebrity involvement in human rights campaigns, examining the role of civil society within international campaigns, including the UK&apos;s special envoy for media freedom Amal Clooney, who we have explicit access to interview (see letter of support, International Bar Association&apos;s Human Rights Institute). Our initial conversations with stakeholders suggest she has made a significant contribution to the design and work of the MFC.  This project will support the career development of multiple research academics including researchers in Sudan, the Philippines and the UK, who receive time and resources to conduct this cutting-edge research, build international research networks, and work on high quality research publications. For early career researchers involved in the project, there is mentoring and support built into the work schedule, and full and equitable opportunities to work on research publications.   Our objectives regarding outputs are to: 1) Publish a major policy-focussed report summarising our key findings and recommendations. 2) Publish two further case study-specific reports, relating to Sudan and the Philippines. 3) Host three &apos;Stakeholder Summit&apos; dissemination events in the UK, Sudan and the Philippines. 4) Publish a short interim report, based on our written submission to the UK Foreign Affairs Committee. 5) Publish at least three high quality co-authored peer-reviewed journal articles, after the award period. 6) Present our work at three different academic conferences, after the award per"></capital-spend>
