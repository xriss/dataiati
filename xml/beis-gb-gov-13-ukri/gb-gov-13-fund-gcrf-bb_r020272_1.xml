   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The second UN Sustainable Development Goal 2 of zero hunger could not be clearer or more challenging. In Africa, where
demographic and climate change will impose additional burdens, meeting this Goal will require significant improvements in
agricultural productivity.
The shared, long-term vision of our Alliance is secure and resilient food systems in sub-Saharan Africa underpinned by
improvements in crop productivity. To realise this vision, our mission is to accelerate the genetic improvement of crops in
the region. Whilst the availability of genomic technologies and data is growing fast in Africa, a bottleneck has emerged,
caused by a shortage of human capacity and capability in data management and bioinformatics. Led by our African
partners, and informed by extensive in-country demand mapping, our aim in this project is to effect a step change in the
capacity and capability of African science to reap the benefits of genomic data. Our objectives are therefore:
1. To build a cadre of high-quality bioinformaticians in sub-Saharan Africa
Experience has shown us that short-training courses do not always have a transformative impact. We have therefore
agreed with the BMGF-DFID supported African Biosciences Challenge Fund (ABCF) to make a significant co-investment in
a 26-week, residential training programme in which we will transform the capability of 12 bioinformaticians from the African
national agricultural research systems and academic partners. The programme has been designed in response to a
demand mapping exercise undertaken by BecA-ILRI. Our expectation is that, by the end of the 26-week programme, the 12
carefully selected individuals will have the skills and knowledge to operate as global leaders in bioinformatics from within
Africa. This build phase has already been developed and we do not seek BBSRC funding for this programme.
2. To empower that cadre to deploy their skills and knowledge effectively
Clearly, to achieve the step change we desire, the 12 individuals will each need to have significant impact on many projects
and on many other researchers within Africa. We therefore propose an 8-week extension to the above programme in which
we will train and certify them as qualified bioinformatics instructors and allow them to apply their new skills through
analysing real-world experimental data generated by African scientists visiting the BecA-ILRI Hub. We also propose a 1-
week research leadership workshop in areas such as proposal development, project management, tools and techniques for
preparing and sharing data for publication, presentation and writing skills. We seek BBSRC funding for this empower
phase.
3. To amplify the impact of that cadre across sub-Saharan Africa
During their training, we will work with fellows to collaboratively develop online, open-access (GitHub) training modules for
future reference and to support continued bioinformatics training at their local institutions. We will identify gaps in current
resources and adapt material for the African context, making this material locally-relevant and ensuring maximum impact
and best use of funds. In year two, we propose that the 12 alumni of the programme organise and lead regional
bioinformatics training workshops which will be supported by the project partners. We seek BBSRC funding for this amplify
phase.
This project leverages investments from multiple partners to fund the initial programme to build the cadre of high-quality
bioinformaticians. With GCRF-STARS funding, we seek to empower this cadre to deploy their skills and knowledge and to
amplify their impact across sub-Saharan Africa. We believe that this project will lead to a step change in the capacity and
capability of African agricultural science to reap the benefits of genomic data.</narrative>
