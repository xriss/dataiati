   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a type of cancer that occurs at the back of the nose. It is unusually common in some parts of the world, including countries like Malaysia where it constitutes a very significant health problem. NPC can be cured, but in many cases the cancer comes back and this is usually fatal. Furthermore, patients who do survive are often left with significant long-term side effects caused by the toxic treatments. Therefore, new treatments are needed to reduce deaths from NPC and improve the quality of life for survivors. All patients with NPC have a virus, known as the Epstein-Barr virus, or EBV for short, in their tumour cells. We have developed a vaccine that can recognise EBV with the aim of boosting the patients&apos; own immune response to the tumour. Early tests of our vaccine in people show that it is safe and that it can boost immunity against the virus. In this proposal we want to understand more about immunity to EBV in patients with NPC so that we can modify how we deliver our vaccine and eventually combine it with other drugs to improve its therapeutic effects. To do this we will be using new sequencing technologies to probe how patient&apos;s T cells, the body&apos;s main weapon against virus-infected cells, respond to EBV, for example before and after treatment, enabling us to &apos;track&apos; individual T cell responses over time. At the same time, we will explore the nature of potential inhibitory pathways present in the tumour so that we might eventually target these in combination with our vaccine making it more effective.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="The successful application of T-cell based immunotherapies for patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) will require a deeper understanding, not only of the nature of T cell responses and how these vary during the course of disease, but also of the inhibitory mechanisms that could limit the effectiveness of these approaches. In this proposal we will:  1. Characterise the immune micro-environment of NPC, including the expression of immune checkpoints.  2. Investigate the inhibitory effects of these immune checkpoints on relevant EBV-specific T cell responses.  3. Describe how T cell receptor specificities, including those against defined tumour antigens, vary in the blood of NPC patients during the course of disease, and how they compare to those we identify in the tumour tissues."></capital-spend>
