   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Palliative care involves the prevention and relief of physical, emotional, social, and spiritual suffering associated with any chronic or life-threatening illness, beginning from the time of diagnosis. In sub-Saharan Africa, palliative care has historically focused on supporting patients with HIV/AIDS. However, increasing numbers of both cancer cases and cancer deaths mean that palliative care services urgently need to adapt to support affected patients and their caregivers. Around 80% of cancers are incurable at the time of detection and diagnosis. It is crucial to invest in and develop palliative cancer care to support the quality of life of patients in the later stages of their illness.   Palliative cancer care will remain an essential component of healthcare delivery in sub-Saharan Africa, independent of efforts to improve cancer prevention and treatments. Through research, our team have been developing approaches to gathering data that can help shape provision of palliative care for cancer patients and their caregivers. This has involved developing measures for accurately and systematically capturing information about a patient&apos;s needs for support and their outcomes following palliative care intervention (e.g. pain medication). In order to extend this work, we need to explore tools for easily and securely capturing and sharing this information to guide palliative care service development. Our team have identified widespread use of mobile phones by patients and health professionals across palliative care services in the region. This includes a World Health Organization (WHO) pilot project capturing information via mobile phones from caregivers of palliative care patients in Uganda, Zimbabwe and India (called &apos;mPalliative&apos;). Our team are supporting delivery and evaluation of this project for the sub-Saharan Africa sites. Clear potential for using mobile phones for capturing information has been demonstrated. However, it is essential to now undertake research to understand the best ways to collect data using mobile phones to make sure it is relevant to needs of patients, caregivers, health professionals and policymakers; this work is not planned and has not been undertaken previously.  Pump-priming funding will enable the team to create a consortium that will work together to guide the development of mobile phone-based approaches in palliative cancer care in sub-Saharan Africa. The consortium will include researchers, policymakers, non-governmental organisations and leading technology partners. We will also undertake interviews to understand how mobile phone-based approaches can be used as part of service delivery to capture data that can directly inform development of palliative cancer care. We will gather patient and caregiver perspectives on how mobile phones can be used in an acceptable and sustainable way to support information collection and communication with health professionals. For health professionals, we will identify how patient-level data reflecting experience and outcomes (obtained using mobile phones) can directly influence their clinical practice and inform the development of current service provision. For policymakers, we will understand what data would be useful to gather (in what format and why), to inform decision making and commissioning around palliative cancer care. These perspectives, from across the health system, will provide strong foundations on which to pursue substantive funding to undertake the development and evaluation of mobile phone-based interventions to develop palliative cancer care in sub-Saharan Africa.   Research activities linked to this pump-priming award will occur in Uganda and Zimbabwe. Both countries currently lead efforts to develop palliative care services across sub-Saharan Africa and have demonstrated capacity to support research activities making them both ideal partner countries. There will be multiple opportunities for sharing our findings across other countries.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="This pump-priming funding will support engagement with key stakeholders across the health system to define optimal mechanisms through which patient-level data, captured via mHealth (i.e. the practice of medicine and public health supported by mobile devices), can be used in the development of palliative cancer care in sub-Saharan Africa. Pump-priming funding will provide essential preliminary data to guide the development of mHealth approaches which can be piloted and evaluated through future substantive grant applications.   The objectives of the pump-priming funding are to:   1. Establish a consortium of academic researchers (from Uganda, the UK and Zimbabwe) including our research team, non-governmental organisations, palliative care providers, policymakers and mHealth development and implementation expertise, to catalyse mHealth research and generate evidence that can guide palliative cancer care development across sub-Saharan Africa  2. Understand the acceptability and optimal implementation of patient-level data collection (e.g. patient-reported outcome measures and patient-reported experience measures) using mHealth approaches in Uganda and Zimbabwe through patient and caregiver engagement  3. Determine information needs and pathways for leveraging evidence generated from mHealth approaches in service development in Uganda and Zimbabwe through health professional and service manager engagement  4. Determine information needs and pathways for leveraging evidence generated from mHealth approaches in policymaking in Uganda and Zimbabwe through policymaker engagement  5. Define the mechanisms for implementation of mHealth approaches to support development of palliative cancer care in SSA   These activities will provide the preliminary data needed to develop mHealth approaches and build the evidence base underpinning current palliative care provision for patients with cancer and their caregivers in Uganda and Zimbabwe initially. At a service delivery level, mHealth approaches can support extension of limited palliative care provision, particularly for patients based in remote regions where mobile networks are available, enabling greater access to palliative care services for patients with cancer currently experiencing advanced disease without any intervention. Alongside increasing access to the many people with cancer requiring palliative care, mHealth approaches present opportunities to augment existing palliative care provision across hospital and community settings. For example, routine monitoring and assessment of patients supported by mHealth approaches can reduce the cost and time burden of travel to health facilities for patients and increase information available to health professionals to inform their clinical decision making. Whilst the primary focus of the proposal is the development of data and information sharing mediated by mHealth approaches, we will also discuss alternative approaches to gathering patient-level data with patients and caregivers that do not involve mobile phones. This will support a broader understanding of the parameters of mobile phones as tools for developing the evidence base for palliative cancer care and follow-on funding will explore multiple modes of gathering and sharing patient-level data to ensure wide representation of service users across sub-Saharan Africa."></capital-spend>
