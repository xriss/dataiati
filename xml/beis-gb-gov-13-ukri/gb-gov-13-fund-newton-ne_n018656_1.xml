   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Sustainable gas pathways for Brazil; from microcosm to macrocosm</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Both in Brazil and globally, gas is at a crossroads.  On one hand it is abundant, has an increasing share in global energy supply, is relatively clean-burning and is often an economically competitive fuel.  On the other hand the gas supply chain and its combustion emit carbon dioxide and methane, which lead to global climate change.  Alongside this, gas production, distribution and use have non-trivial life cycle interactions with natural capital and ecosystem services.  For gas to have a sustainable future role arguably the principal challenge is in enabling its continued production and use .  Brazil could greatly expand domestic gas production from two sources.  First, it has the world&apos;s second largest bio-fuel industry (and is the largest exporter), and bio-ethanol production by-products can be used to produce decarbonised gas.  Second, large natural gas reserves have recently been found in offshore deep water pre-salt.  Yet Brazil faces complex challenges in making the most of its gas resource potential; key among these is a limited national distribution infrastructure, concerns over the environmental impacts of gas production and supply chain choices on unique ecosystems, and questions over the distribution of socio-economic benefits flowing from sugarcane-energy resource exploitation.  There are also issues to be addressed to ensure that gas-related developments in Brazil continue to bolster social, as well as economic, objectives, and foster inclusive as well as environmentally-sound economic growth.  The key technical opportunities for gas in Brazil are twofold:  (1) The first is in the decarbonisation of gas, given that Brazil has a substantial bio-ethanol industry (worth US$33billion in value added annually), which produces vast quantities of bagasse and other wastes.  These waste products can be used to produce biogas/biomethane.  In 2015 Brazil produced 7Mt of bagasse, and this is projected to rise to 26Mt by 2030, which could produce up to 1.9bcm methane per year.  (2) The second technical opportunity is the use of significant pre-salt reserves (potentially combined with the bio-methane) in power generation to counter seasonal fluctuations in natural flow hydro electricity output. The technical challenges to capitalising on these opportunities are in technology performance and cost for low carbon gas production, creating a comprehensive infrastructure to support the distribution of gas, and determining the most beneficial use of the significant pre-salt offshore reserves.  This project will investigate these opportunities via an interdisciplinary approach, encompassing process engineering, socio-economics, ecosystem impacts, and energy systems modelling: (1) Process engineering simulation and optimisation will be developed for sugarcane ethanol production, including investigation of how this process needs to be adapted in order to use the waste products (e.g. bagasse) to co-produce biogas and/or biomethane alongside the ethanol. (2) Investigation of the socio-economic implications of bio-methane from bio-ethanol bioproducts, drawing on the engineering process characterisation, in order to identify the ways in which it can contribute to livelihoods, growth, and other development objectives. (3) the ecological consequences of increased use of natural gas in Brazil will be considered. This will translate gas development scenarios into land use projections, and estimate the impact of the land use change on the carbon cycle, water quality and provisioning of drinking water to population centres. (4) The project will culminate in the production of self-consistent quantitative scenarios of gas development in Brazil to 2050.  These will be produced via a qualitative narrative scenario development followed by application of a state-of-the-art energy transition simulation modelling to provide quantitative estimates of the role of gas in Brazil.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The objective of this project is to comprehensively assess the most challenging issues concerning a future sustainable role of gas in the Brazilian energy system.  We will develop understanding on this in an interdisciplinary context, covering the technical, environmental and socio-economic factors that underpin the sustainable production and use of gas in Brazil to 2050.  The research will be multi-scale in nature, considering gas futures at both the technology/process/community level (i.e. the microcosm) and at the national &apos;whole systems&apos; systems level (i.e. the macrocosm).   As a guiding rule we take the view that for gas to play a sustainable role in Brazil it; (a) must enable containment of aggregate Brazilian greenhouse gas emissions consistent with global climate change mitigation, (b) not have a significantly adverse effect on Brazilian natural capital or ecosystem services, and (c) must have a positive influence on the Brazilian economy and society.  At the MICROCOSM level, we will focus on one form of sustainable gas form that is highly relevant to Brazil; the potential for production of biogas and biomethane associated with the Brazilian bioethanol industry. To date biogas/biomethane has not yet been incorporated into the process schemes of the sugar industry and very little information is available in the literature on biogas production from either bagasse or whole cane plants. Our objective in this research is to develop and apply models of bio-refinery processes that produce biogas and biomethane from bio-ethanol production waste streams.  Given the size of this industry in Brazil, and its expected growth over coming years, this is a unique area of interest for Brazilian stakeholders.  The research will lead to an improved understanding of the processes surrounding the relevant waste streams, and will aid understanding of the technology requirements for biogas and bio-methane production in these facilities. The technical analysis will be complemented by an assessment of the socio-economic outcomes of bio-methane pathways, in order to understand how this energy source may contribute to economic development and social welfare in Brazil.   At the MACROCOSM level we intend to link the microcosm-level view of bio-methane technology with the broader systems view, building up to national level integrating with other gas opportunities (e.g. pre-salt reserve development) and analyse opportunities when gas competes and/or supports other energy vectors.  The objectives of the macrocosm research are to improve the state-of-the-art on modelling of gas infrastructures and apply them to understand the best options for gas infrastructure in Brazil, develop and apply whole-system energy transition simulation modelling to Brazil, and understand the ecosystem services impact of the Brazilian gas pathways produced.  This will give the broader view with respect to a sustainable role for gas, and ultimately providing an integrated view of gas in Brazil to 2050.</narrative>
