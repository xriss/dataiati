   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Helicobacter pylori infection is one of the most common bacterial infections in the world: infection rates range from 25-50% in developed countries to 70-90% in the third world. It is well recognised that H. pylori infection causes upper gastrointestinal diseases; however, understanding how the bacteria causes disease has been challenging, because the disease risk likely depends on complex interactions between both human host human and bacterial genes, as well as dietary and other environmental factors. Until recently, most studies on host-H. pylori interactions were performed in developed countries and have focused on host or bacterial genetic factors in isolation. These studies have failed to explain the high variability in the likelihood to suffer from gastrointestinal disease seen in different individuals and populations following H. pylori infection.  H. pylori has been evolving in concert with humans since their early origins in Africa and migrations out-of Africa. As a consequence, the genomes of the bacteria are genetically differentiated in a similar way as the host genomes among human populations. This has limited past studies to specific host-pathogen combinations. The ideal experiment to understand interactions between human hosts and bacteria would be to expose individuals to random strains of H. pylori and observe disease outcomes.   Recently admixed populations, i.e. populations that derive their genetic ancestry from multiple continents, offer unique opportunities to perform such type of studies, since the mixing process most likely brought together assorted human and H. pylori genomes which are not present in the parental non-admixed populations. The main aim of this project is to characterise the complex host-pathogen-environment interactions that underlie susceptibility to H. pylori infection in the admixed population of Cape Verde. This previously uninhabited archipelago, located 450 km off the coast of Senegal, was discovered by the Portuguese in the mid-15th century and was initially populated with European immigrants and slaves from the neighbouring African mainland. As a consequence of this settlement pattern, extensive genetic admixture occurred between the African and European ancestral populations during the last few centuries. Due to the high admixture in Cape Verde and cross-infection between unrelated individuals, we expect to find not only some correlation in the European/African individual ancestry proportions between the human hosts and the bacteria, as well as individuals who have high African ancestry but are infected by H. pylori that is largely European in origin and vice versa. Specific host-bacteria combinations that are over-represented among the cases offer clues to identify host and pathogen genetic regions that underlie susceptibility to H. pylori infection.  To accomplish our main goal, we will: a) screen H. pylori infection in Cape Verde volunteers, collect DNA samples from 700 individuals and their associated bacteria, and obtain measurements of the degree of the individuals&apos; gastric mucosa damage caused by infection. Our rationale for recruiting volunteers is that a large proportion of the affected individuals may be asymptomatic or un-diagnosed; recruiting volunteers from the general population allows unbiased assessment of both the infection rate and pattern of genetic diversities. b) To examine the association between the genetic diversity and individual ancestry of human host and H. pylori and disease outcomes.   This project establishes a unique and valuable resource for elucidating host-pathogen interactions in gastrointestinal diseases. The study also has significant public health impact, representing a first effort in assessing the infection rate and the correlation between combinations of human and H. pylori genomes and disease outcomes in Cape Verde.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="The overarching goal of this research is to characterise the complex host-pathogen-environment interactions that underlie the large heterogeneity in disease susceptibility to Helicobacter pylori infection among and within populations, using a combination of genomics and computational approaches. A major obstacle in this effort is that, because H. pylori has co-evolved with humans through history, in most human populations, co-occurrence of specific human-H. pylori variants often reflects parallel ancestral lineages and not biological interactions. To overcome this problem, we aim to establish a cohort in the African-European admixed population of Cape Verde. We hypothesise that its unique population history makes Cape Verde an ideal setting for discovering human-bacterial interactions that potentially influence disease risk, because the admixing process would have generated novel human-bacterial ancestry combinations that are absent in non-admixed populations and, thus, resembles a natural experiment that randomly exposes human genomes to multiple bacterial strains. Using Cape Verde as a population model to study human-H. pylori interactions, we will focus on the following objectives which we list in order of priority: 1) to screen H. pylori infection in Cape Verdean volunteers, to collect DNA samples from 700 infected individuals and their associated bacteria and to measure the degree of the individuals&apos; gastric mucosa damage caused by the infection; 2) to characterise the genomic variation of infected individuals and bacteria; 3) to determine the individual genomic ancestry and admixture structure of the infected individuals and associated bacteria in Cape Verde, and to assess the association between host-pathogen ancestry combinations and disease susceptibility; 4) to perform a preliminary analysis of the genetic architecture underlying susceptibility to H. pylori infection through a genome-wide association scan."></capital-spend>
