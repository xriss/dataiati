   <narrative xml:lang="EN">HEALTHY URBAN LIVING AND AGEING IN PLACE: PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, BUILT ENVIRONMENT AND KNOWLEDGE EXCHANGE IN BRAZILIAN CITIES (HULAP)</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Brazil has one of the most rapidly ageing populations in the world and non-communicable diseases are emerging as the main national public health priority. These include increasing levels of obesity and other conditions associated with a lack of PA. There is emerging evidence on the impact of increased PA on health, particularly amongst older adults, although this is not as well developed as for other demographic groups, despite them being the least active and most sedentary. It is also becoming clear that, set within a wider ecological model, the form of the built urban environment can influence levels of PA, suggesting that interventions in this area could provide a useful role in supporting long-term strategies for public health. There are very few studies on PA amongst older adults in Brazil, although there is some evidence that suggests it is associated with improved quality of life and health, irrespective of age, education and socio-economic status. Therefore, an enhanced understanding of PA behaviour of older adults in Brazil, the role of urban design in facilitating this and improved policy effectiveness will benefit the economic development and well-being in Brazil, through healthier ageing in place, reduction in future health burdens and enhanced institutional capacity.    The project integrates three themes highlighted in the call specification related to: Urban Design/Planning/Housing/Infrastructure; Health/Inequalities/Justice; and Leadership/Governance/Institutions.     This project will develop policy tools, partnerships and evidence for increasing PA levels of older adults in Brazilian cities, by bringing together a multi-disciplinary team of Brazilian/UK researchers drawn from public health, geography, planning and management studies, as well as a range of key stakeholders that are central to promoting this policy agenda in Brazil, the UK and Europe. We take a comparative Brazil-UK approach that builds on research previously funded by the ESRC, CAPES, CNPq and others. We aim to capture the PA of a sample of older adults in Curitiba (Brazil) and Belfast (UK) and measure a range of attributes of the built environment which may influence this. We will develop and test new methodologies and protocols for doing this, which will contribute to new methodological approaches of wider international relevance, including IPEN protocols and tools for rapidly evaluating the built environment for its walkability. We will investigate the associations between objective and perceived environmental measures with the physical functioning of older adults. We will also comparatively map the Brazil and UK institutional and governance contexts involved in ageing and walkable environments, evaluate the capacity of this to assimilate evidence and bring together examples of innovative practice. The project will result in a range of policy guidance and toolkits to enhance future policy approaches. Key project partners include Embarq (Brazil) and Belfast Healthy Cities (UK), who will coordinate input to the project&apos;s Impact Advisory Groups from a wider range of stakeholders involved in the healthy ageing arenas in Brazil and the UK. This will involve joint Brazil-UK impact workshops, will ensure that the project remains focused on delivering valuable societal impact and in turn will influence future approaches to research in this field to create a virtuous circle of research-implementation-feedback-research.     The project aims to deliver a wide range of bi-lingual outputs which will include: project website, video content and social media; peer-reviewed papers; presentations to local policy networks and conferences in Brazil and the UK; working papers and lay summaries, policy briefing papers; a revised protocol for capturing older adults PA data; a new knowledge translation self-assessment tool; revised tools for auditing the built environment and an Older-Adults Walkability Toolkit.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The overall aim is to enhance the conceptual and empirical understanding of the influence of built environment on physical activity (PA) of older adults and to develop evidence and policy tools for increasing PA  and well-being of older adults in Brazilian cities through built environment interventions, enhanced policy effectiveness and improved institutional collaboration.  The project will address this aim through a series of seven work packages (Figs 1&amp;2), drawing together three themes:   (i) Urban Design, Planning, Housing and Infrastructure: examining the role of the built environment, at different geographic scales, in facilitating or impeding the PA of older adults in Brazilian cities. (ii) Health Inequalities and Justice: addressing the challenges of healthy ageing, which are currently poorly acknowledged in the context of Brazilian cities. Here we refer to healthy ageing as relating to the opportunities for improving the well-being of older adults so they can continue to enjoy independence, a high quality of life and make an active contribution to society. (iii) Leadership, Governance and Institutions: exploring the governance context for healthy ageing in Brazil and the UK, examining the capacity of institutions to respond and identify the key stakeholders involved in this policy arena. It will focus on the effectiveness of knowledge-policy interactions focused on improving opportunities for PA  for older people in Brazilian cities.  The findings from each of the above themes will be synthesised and translated, guided by non-academic partners, into outputs that can be directly used by local government, advocacy groups and other stakeholders for healthy ageing in Brazilian cities and beyond. The project takes an explicit comparative approach to research, which will primarily be focused on two case study cities: Curitiba in Brazil and Belfast in the UK, chosen because of the level of existing datasets and strong partnerships with key non-academic partners. The specific objectives for the research are organised under these linked research questions:  1: How does the objectively measured walkability vary within and between Brazilian and UK cities? 2: Is it possible to use development such as Google Street View to capture a range of other built environment attributes relevant to PA of older adults? What are its limitations and how do we overcome them? 3: How effective is the objective walkability index in capturing the associations for measuring effectiveness for older adults and the urban context of Brazil and can these be improved by using other built environment attributes? 4: What are the patterns of PA and sedentary behaviour amongst a sample of older adults in Brazil and the UK? 5: What are the associations and moderating effects of objective and perceived environment measures with physical functioning, BMI and other specific age-related attributes of older adults in Brazil and the UK? 6: What are the wider economic and social contexts for healthy ageing in the UK and Brazil? 7: What are the key policy actors, institutions, programmes, staff and resources involved in ageing and walkable environments in Brazil and the UK? 8: How effective are the evidence-policy interactions and opportunities for knowledge exchange around healthy ageing in Brazil and the UK? 9: What are the main opportunities for increasing PA for older people in Brazilian cities? 10: What projects, programmes and areas of institutional reform need to be in place to best enhance the opportunities for healthy &apos;ageing in place&apos; in Brazilian cities?  In answering these, the project will enhance the capacity of researchers and other stakeholders in Brazil/UK and will deliver a wide range of research and policy-relevant outputs that include policy briefing papers, toolkits, audit tools, research protocols, academic conferences and presentations to local policy networks.</narrative>
