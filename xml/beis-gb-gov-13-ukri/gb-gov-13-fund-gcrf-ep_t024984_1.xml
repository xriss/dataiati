   <narrative xml:lang="EN">1. Stage 1 (Month 1-6): We will conduct a series of evidence synthesis activities in which we will reflect on the insights and experiences from across the activities of ongoing GCRF investments in East Africa and consider, discuss and where possible harmonise perspectives on ABU and the systems in which ABU takes place. 2. Stage 2 (Month 7-12): We will hold a series of workshops that will:          a. Develop a model of processes and practices in East Africa describing how an essential information package might be used by individuals, dispensers and health care workers to optimise ABU;           b. Consider what the constituent materials of an essential information package for optimising community ABU might be, respecting how differing cultural and linguistic differences within and between countries must shape the                  materials in different communities;          c. Define the system in which the package will be situated and propose how to enable information flow.                    The essential information package will ultimately, in a second stage award aim to enable access to ABU guidance in locally understandable ways that are impactful both for the immediate health of end users and their animals,  and for reducing pressure on microbial communities. At this stage, content will be co-defined with community members using antibiotic users, health workers and policymakers and regulators, through participatory research  approaches and is likely to focus on presenting information about what specific antibiotics are for and how to use them.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Recently, there has been an increasing awareness of the global threat to human and animal health that is presented by the failure of germs, specifically bacteria, to respond to treatment with medicines which formerly killed them, a phenomenon known as Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR). Many approaches are being explored to ameliorate this problem, including the critical need to make better use of antibiotics. Optimal use of antibiotics must ensure both that people unwell with bacterial infections continue to have access to medicines that they need and bacteria do not have the opportunity to develop resistance to these &quot;magic bullets&quot;. Huge investments have been made in improved laboratory capacity, which permits us to detect and describe AMR and report this problem through surveillance networks to governments and international agencies. These investments in laboratory surveillance have not been matched by enhanced surveillance of or interventions to improve antibiotic use (ABU), particularly in low income countries. We propose to bring together four Global Challenges Research Fund (GCRF) investments in the field of AMR in East Africa into a GCRF cluster. We will collectively take responsibility for reviewing and &quot;synthesising&quot; all of our ABU research findings from the East African context from across human and animal health. We will work together to co-design &quot;an essential information package&quot; to optimise ABU in the East African context and to define an intervention using this package to change ABU behaviours in communities and health systems.</narrative>
