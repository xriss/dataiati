   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This proposal will be implemented through a partnership between the Federal University of Sergipe and the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine (LSTM), UK.    Professors Gurgel and Cuevas have maintained more than 15 years collaborations on research on infectious diseases, including diarrhoea, respiratory infections and tuberculosis.   This award will provide an opportunity for their institutes to develop new research interests in chronic non-communicable diseases, which are increasingly recognised as emerging diseases in Brazil.    The partnership proposed, will expand the expertise of the applicants and provide an opportunity to initiate research in chronic diseases within a different context to the UK.   We will combine our research expertise with nutritional expertise at the University of Sergipe and on health inequalities within the Department of Public Health, University of Liverpool (UoL), who have accepted to support the implementation of this proposal.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="Recent reports suggest children missing breakfast are more likely to have markers associated with type II diabetes than children regularly taking breakfast.   Although diabetes is perceived as a problem of affluence, lifestyle changes in all sectors of society and the low cost of high calorie foods would suggest that the disease is also likely to be associated with poverty.  We aim to establish 1. The proportion of children residing in low (slum) and affluent areas of Aracaju, Sergipe, who regularly miss their breakfast 2. The prevalence of abnormal blood lipids, insulin, glucose and glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) among children  3. The association between breakfast patterns and abnormal metabolic risk markers of type II diabetes. 4. The prevalence of type II diabetes among parents of children participating in the study."></capital-spend>
