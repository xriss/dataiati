   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed multi-disciplinary project aims to making South Indian artisanal fishers&apos; livelihoods more secure and sustainable by improving safety at sea.  Bringing together these small-scale fishers with weather forecasters and government agencies, it will devise, test and promote effective means for the co-production and communication of accurate weather forecasts, thus increasing resilience of the fishers amidst a trend of extreme and hazardous weather conditions in a changing climate. Moreover, the project will devise an &quot;action template&quot; of practical methods and a road-map for co-producing and communicating accessible and effective weather forecasts to artisanal fishers elsewhere in India and beyond. It will also contribute to academic debates concerning: the understanding and response to environmental risks; the role of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) in disseminating information and warnings to diverse and vulnerable populations; and the knowledge, practices and livelihoods of fishing communities in Asia.    The main objective of the proposed project is to close  the gap between what marine weather forecasters produce and disseminate, and what artisanal fishers recognize as relevant and actionable inputs for decision-making.  Access to trusted and actionable forecasts helps fishers make informed decisions to go to sea or not under hazardous weather conditions, thus reducing risk of potentially life-threatening accidents at sea, diminishing the loss of gear and boats, and, more generally, building resilience against hazardous weather conditions. Such weather-resilient pathways will contribute to promoting more secure and sustainable livelihoods for artisanal fishers in India and elsewhere in the Global South.  This project will be part of a larger effort called the Sussex Sustainability Research Programme (SSRP) to provide science relevant for implementing the SDGs in seventeen low and medium income countries.   Drawing on the expertise of a multi-disciplinary research team--comprising anthropologists, geographers, atmospheric and marine scientists, and ICT and media experts - the proposed project combines complementary methodological approaches.  It utilizes ethnographic methods to study the wider social, economic and cultural practices underpinning artisanal fishing, as well as to gauge fishers&apos; forecast usage and uptake.  It uses satellite and in-situ weather observations to gain insights into changing hazard patterns and forecast challenges, as well as to acquire the necessary data to co-produce area-specific weather forecasts with fishers,  forecasters and other stakeholders.  It will employ participatory approaches and technologies developed in the fields of human-computer interaction and ICT4D to co-produce and test effective, culturally appropriate communication platforms to disseminate weather forecast and provide feedback on the same. To account for variations in fishing techniques and technologies, and in the socio-economic organization of fishing, as well as different forms of social organization and cultural orientations the field-research will take place in three different fishing communities.  These will be located, respectively, in Kanyakumari, Thiruvananthapuram and Kollam districts in South India, a stretch of coast with one of the densest concentrations of artisanal fishers in Asia, using diverse craft, gear and fishing methods in a geographically diverse setting.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="The proposed project&apos;s main objective is to make South Indian artisanal fishers&apos; livelihoods more secure and sustainable by improving safety at sea.  It aims to do so by addressing  an urgent practical and intellectual problem, namely, how to close the apparent gap between the scientific knowledge weather forecasters produce and disseminate, and the information artisanal fishers require to fish safely under variable or prohibitive weather conditions.    To tackle this problem and thus to achieve its main objective, the project has seven related, and thus equally important objectives:  1-to determine the extent and impact of weather-related hazards faced by artisanal fishers in three different communities, and to establish fishers&apos; cultural understanding of and attitudes to weather-related risks. 2-to gather robust evidence on how and to what extent fishers access and use existing marine weather forecasts.  3-to engage with fishers and forecasters to co-produce weather bulletins tailored to the social, cultural and economic needs of fishers, but also responsive to the priorities of weather forecasters and government agencies.  4-to devise and test effective and easily accessible offshore/onshore communication tools in collaboration with fishers, government agencies and forecasters. 5-to work with users-fishing communities and local community and civil society organizations--to foster the establishment of local support networks (boundary organizations) devoted to promoting decision-making behaviours informed by co-produced weather forecast, and thus conducive to safe fishing.   6-to deliver practical methods and a road-map for replicating co-production of locally relevant marine weather forecasts in India and beyond via production of an &quot;action template&quot;, consisting of a toolkit adaptable to different geographical, technical and cultural contexts. 7-to transfer results of the project worldwide to enhance resilience of fishers and farmers in other low and medium income countries."></capital-spend>
