  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Although peatlands cover less than 3% of the Earth&apos;s surface they contain twice as much carbon as all the world&apos;s forests. However, greenhouse gas emissions from drained or burned peatlands account for 5% of the global carbon budget, with the majority of these emissions coming from tropical peatlands. Peatland degradation is both a cause and effect of climate change, and interacts with climate risks to threaten the livelihoods of some of the world&apos;s most remote and impoverished communities. Improving the governance of tropical peatlands to manage these risks is complicated by limited awareness of peatland extent and condition and resistance from stakeholders with competing interests. The majority of research to date has focused on natural science assessments of climate risks in tropical peatlands, and there is limited understanding of cross-sectoral social, economic and institutional challenges and opportunities, or the experience and management of risk from the perspective of the most affected populations.

AIM

This project will develop a researcher-practitioner-policy maker network to inform and identify governance actions that increase the resilience of poor and marginalised groups to cope with climate risks, while enabling the conservation, restoration and sustainable management of tropical peatlands. 


RESEARCH AND IMPACT OBJECTIVES

To achieve this aim, we will build a new tropical peatland climate resilience network for researchers, practitioners and policy makers, scope future research in Republic of Congo, Democratic Republic of Congo, Indonesia and Peru and conduct preliminary research in Peru and Indonesia. Collectively these countries represent the majority of the area and emissions associated with tropical peatlands globally. 

WP1: Build a new researcher-practitioner-policy maker network to enhance institutional capacity for decision-making across risk domains by: 
1.1	Building: a) knowledge and skills in environmental governance; b) capacity for identifying and engaging relevant stakeholders in preliminary research as part of this project and future peatland governance research, policy and practice; c) access to social and financial capital for network members; d) capacity for joint resolution reporting between international policy organisations
1.2	Characterising the relative interest, influence and impact of network actors from policy, business and local communities, including the identification of vulnerable and hard-to-reach groups, who have a stake in ensuring protection and responsible management of tropical peatlands, and can be engaged in preliminary research (as part of this project) and future projects 
1.3	Co-producing a climate resilience research agenda in the peatlands of Indonesia, Republic of Congo, Democratic Republic of Congo and Peru, leading to a Network+ bid and other funding proposals

WP2: Co-produce an analysis of system behaviours and responses with local partners by:
2.1	Critically evaluating a broad range of governance actions, including public-private (&quot;blended&quot;) finance mechanisms, to reduce climate risks through peatland restoration and protection whilst enhancing livelihoods through desk-based research, preliminary research in Indonesia and Peru, and new data from ongoing tropical peatland projects 
2.2	Assessing the vulnerability of peatlands in all four study countries to complex risks arising from the interaction between climate change and governance of tropical peatlands</narrative>
