   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Football plays a key role in the experience of Latin America and of Latin Americans, be this as a daily practice, as a means of constructing communities or as a mode of engagement with local initiatives or national narratives. Such issues have received increased amounts of academic attention in recent years, while recent sporting mega-events in Brazil that involved football (2013 Confederations Cup, 2014 men&apos;s World Cup and 2016 Olympic Games) ensured unprecedented levels of coverage for the region in the mass media. Overwhelmingly, however, the focus has been on men&apos;s football and on football as a male domain. This project will explore (obstacles to) women&apos;s and girls&apos; participation in football, as players and spectators, as well as the ways in which that participation is mediated via gendered written and visual texts. As a result, it will provide new understandings of the role that football (and sport more widely) plays for all citizens of Latin America, especially in relation to development issues around inequality, inclusion and agency.     At the heart of the network&apos;s research is analysis of the experience of women and girls through football, drawing on expertise in anthropology and ethnography (led by Moreira) and the history of sport (led by Goellner).  At the same time, a study of textual and visual representations of their participation, as well as the frameworks within which these are represented to national and international audiences, will draw on expertise in cultural history and textual analysis (led by Goellner and Wood). In addition to these academic perspectives, leaders of football-based social development projects and football museums will be integral participants in the network&apos;s research activities. By combining interdisciplinary and multi-directional approaches, this research will develop new understandings that drive at questions of gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls (Sustainable Development Goal 5), the reduction of inequality (SDG 10), as well as good health and well-being (SDG 3). This will be achieved through an international partnership that brings together actors from a range of sectors (SDG 17).   The relationship between football and international development has blossomed since the United Nations declared 2005 to be the International Year of Sport and Physical Education, the same year seeing a statement from the UK government&apos;s Minister for Culture, Media and Sport that affirmed that &apos;sport can be used to tackle many of the problems afflicting the developing world&apos;. The appointment in 2008 of Wilfried Lemke as Special Adviser to the UN Secretary General on Sport for Development and Peace generated further momentum in this field, and the important role of sport in international development was confirmed at the 70th session of the United Nations General Assembly (September 2015), which set forth the outcomes for adoption of the post-2015 development agenda and identified the position of sport as a means to achieving the sustainable development goals.  This project will be the first to undertake research into the ways in which this convergence manifests itself in Latin America, with broader implications for other regions.    The outcomes of this research will have benefits for women and girls in terms of highlighting obstacles to their equal engagement with football as an important  site for personal well-being and for inclusion in (or exclusion from) national narratives around cultural citizenship. Findings of the research will result in outputs to include recommendations for local and national sports organisations with a view to improving equality of opportunity and of representation for women and girls, in football as more broadly across the nations involved in the network.  While these will be most immediately applicable to the countries in which the research will be based, they have considerable potential to be more widely applicable in Latin America and beyond.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="The research objectives of the project are to address three central questions:   What are the barriers to participation in football for women and girls and what development benefits are achieved when these barriers are overcome?    How does the representation of women and girls through football conform to or challenge patterns of gender inequality and what impact does this have in broader terms of cultural norms?    Why, until recently, have women been absent from histories of football in the region and what are the keys to understanding and constructing histories of women&apos;s participation in football?   The main objectives of the network are as follows:  To hold a series of workshops that will achieve the research objectives above by bringing together for the first time academic researchers from the UK with their equivalents in Argentina, Brazil and Colombia, and to bring together these researchers with non-academic stakeholders (leaders of social development projects and the Museu do Futebol) in the field of f&#xFA;tbol femenino/ futebol femenino.  By sharing findings from a range of contexts, the network will develop awareness of the ways in which the participation of women and girls in, and representation through, football contributes to development goals. In particular, the focus will be on the SDGs that relate to achieving gender equality, to reducing inequality among countries, to promoting inclusive societies, and to revitalizing the global partnership for sustainable development. This will generate new understandings of the &apos;footballisation of society&apos; (Bromberger, 1998) based on the inclusion of women and girls and on development goals, driving up knowledge of successful strategies for addressing the challenges that the research identifies;  To explore the ways in which Arts and Humanities research and its methodologies can inform other disciplinary areas (notably anthropology, sociology and physical education sciences), thereby developing new understandings of women&apos;s participation in football (and of sport more widely) as a growing research field hitherto dominated in Latin America by methodologies and perspectives from the Social Sciences.  Within this field, to bring together established and senior academics with ECRs, postgraduate students and non-academic stakeholders, thereby building capacity at all levels while developing a network with potential for longevity and collaboration across geographical and disciplinary borders;  To produce inter-disciplinary outputs that will be influential in moving forward the field of women and girls in sport within and beyond Latin America, including academic publications (two volumes of essays and a journal special issue) and public engagement interventions (notably S&#xE3;o Paulo&apos;s Museu do Futebol).  As an output with public policy impact, a key objective is to produce a Manifiesto de Futbol Femenino/ Manifesto do Futebol Femenino/ Manifesto for Women&apos;s Football. This will identify challenges and contain recommendations for local, national and international agencies (governmental and non-governmental) that will capture best practice to increase equality of access to - and representation in - football for women and girls. This will thereby contribute to increasing their presence in a key symbolic domain and to driving up equality of opportunity in other public domains;  To address and challenge inequality in the access (practical and symbolic) of women and girls to sport.  Football in particular is understood as a central dimension of cultural citizenship in the nations on which the project will focus and, as such, an important means of inclusion (practical and symbolic) within broader development goals;  To explore the feasibility of larger-scale research projects around women&apos;s participation in sport and the UN sustainable development goals across a wider range of Latin American countries with a view to future research projects based on this collaboration."></capital-spend>
