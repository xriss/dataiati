   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The role of heartwater (Ehrlichia ruminantium infection) and other tick-borne pathogens in Acute Camel Death Syndrome in Kenya</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Dromedary camels are important food-producing animals in northern Kenya and vital for the economy, food security and well-being of pastoralist communities. Their population is steadily increasing year-on-year and stood at over 3.2 million in 2016. The Kenyan camel meat and milk industry is worth approximately US$11 million annually. Acute Camel Death Syndrome (ACDS) is an emerging disease of unknown cause affecting camel herds in parts of northern Kenya. Up to 100% of affected adult camels can die without treatment. Unlike other camel diseases that are well-recognised by local pastoralists, ACDS is a new disease for which Kenyan camel keepers have no vernacular name. Clinical and post-mortem signs show strong similarities to heartwater, a tick-borne disease of sheep, goats and cattle that is endemic throughout sub-Saharan Africa, but has only been described in camels in other parts of Africa on three occasions in the past 60 years. Affected camel herds may be heavily infested with ticks, and the causative agent of heartwater, the intracellular bacterium Ehrlichia ruminantium, has been detected in ticks removed from camels affected by ACDS. However this does not prove that ACDS is a manifestation of heartwater in camels; other tick-borne pathogens (TBP) may be involved in the syndrome.  It is essential to identify the causative agent of ACDS so that effective preventive and/or control measures can be implemented.  To investigate the role of heartwater and other TPB in ACDS, we propose to carry out a broad-spectrum survey of camels, sheep that graze alongside them, and ticks infesting both species, in areas where ACDS outbreaks have occurred. As controls, we will similarly sample camels, sheep and ticks in areas where ACDS has not been reported. We will interview camel keepers to determine their prior knowledge of ACDS and how it is distinct from other camel diseases with which they are familiar, and to establish disease incidence, symptoms, post mortem signs and concurrent levels of tick infestation that they have observed during outbreaks. We will collect blood and serum samples and ticks from camels and co-grazing sheep; blood samples will be screened for presence of E. ruminantium and other TBP indicating current infection and serum samples will be tested for antibodies to E. ruminantium and other TBP indicating previous exposure. Ticks will be screened for infection with E. ruminantium and other TBP to determine the range of pathogens circulating in the sample areas. We will attempt to isolate strains of the different pathogens by culturing them in bovine and tick cell lines; gene sequences of isolated novel strains will be compared with those of known strains from other hosts to look for differences that might explain the emergence of ACDS as a new camel disease.   If there is an outbreak of ACDS in any of our study areas during the project, we will collect clinical and post-mortem samples from affected camels and process them in the same way as the survey samples. We will bank aliquots of the camel and tick samples in cryostorage, thereby creating a resource for use in future studies on ACDS and by scientists researching other factors affecting camel health.  An important element of our project will be capacity-building relating to ACDS and more generally to camel health in Kenya. Using the knowledge gained from our field and laboratory studies, we will formulate protocols for diagnosis, treatment and control of ACDS, including hands-on training in appropriate sampling techniques and proper storage and transport of samples to the laboratory. In addition, we will provide the opportunity and support for a Kenyan MSc student to carry out their research project focussing on a particular aspect of our proposed study.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Dromedary camels are important food-producing animals in northern Kenya. Their population is steadily increasing year-on-year and stood at over 3.2 million in 2016. The Kenyan camel meat and milk industry is worth approximately US$11 million annually. Outbreaks of severe disease in camels, characterised by sudden onset, lethargy, extreme respiratory distress, occasional nervous signs and mortality of close to 100% in adult animals in the absence of antibiotic treatment, have been recorded in northern Kenya since 2015. The disease, designated acute camel death syndrome (ACDS), appears to be novel; clinical and postmortem findings indicate that heartwater (Ehrlichia ruminantium infection) is a likely candidate for the causative agent of ACDS or at least to play a role in the syndrome. There is an urgent need to pinpoint the cause of ACDS, to enable development of appropriate protocols for diagnosis, treatment, control and prevention of this emerging disease. This proposal, combining the expertise of the UK and Kenyan partners in heartwater, other tick-borne pathogens (TBP), ticks, camels, disease epidemiology and pastoralist livestock health, will determine the role of E. ruminantium and/or other TBP in ACDS. More widely, it will reveal the incidence and prevalence of TBP in Kenyan camels and the ticks infesting them; this information will inform development of strategies and protocols for camel disease diagnosis and control for future use by veterinarians and livestock managers.   We will establish a collaborative link between the UK and Kenyan partners to enhance capacity building and sharing of knowledge and expertise on Ehrlichia-tick host biology and the potential role of ticks and tick-borne diseases in the health of camelids and other livestock in Northern Kenya. Specifically, we will use a combination of participatory epidemiology, classical parasitology, molecular biology and cell culture techniques to determine the incidence and prevalence of E. ruminantium and other candidate TBP in ACDS-exposed and unexposed camels and co-grazing sheep with the following objectives:  1) To study the epidemiology of E. ruminantium (Er) and/or other closely-related Ehrlichia spp. (possibly novel) as the causative agents of the heartwater-like disease ACDS in Kenyan dromedary camels. 2) To screen Kenyan camels and co-grazing sheep, and ticks removed from them, for Ehrlichia and other TBP (including Anaplasma spp., Rickettsia spp., Coxiella spp., Babesia spp., Theileria spp.) of which the camels may act as reservoir host and to investigate the potential involvement of these pathogens in clinical disease of camels and as a source of zoonotic infections. 3) In the event of an outbreak of ACDS during the project, to determine (by microscopy and PCR)  the incidence of E. ruminantium, other Ehrlichia spp. and/or other TBP in clinical samples collected from diseased camels both ante- and post-mortem, and to store aseptically-collected blood samples in liquid nitrogen for future experimental study of ACDS. 4) To build capacity for improved diagnosis and control of ACDS and, more widely, TBP in camels, by developing appropriate recommendations and effective, applicable protocols, including hands-on training, for veterinarians and livestock managers, and by providing the opportunity and supervision for a Kenyan MSc student to carry out their research project on a particular aspect of our study.  5) To create awareness and empower smallholder pastoralists by holding a public engagement and research dissemination workshop in northern Kenya on ACDS disease and vector identification, control and management.</narrative>
