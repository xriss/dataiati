   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Lack of adequate nutrition in Malawi is a critical concern and without intervention, the provision of adequate food is an unachievable outcome. Malawi also faces significant challenges in establishing and operating a food and nutrition security programme. Our innovative solution is to establish production of a high-protein, micronutrient rich crop (Moringa oleifera), which will be locally grown by smallholder farmers, and processed on-site to supply Malawi&apos;s proposed scaled-up nutrition programmes. This project will not only contribute towards nutritional security for the poorest and most vulnerable in Malawi, but will deliver recognised additional economic benefits through two commercialisation opportunities; provision of functional plant-based protein isolates as an increasingly desirable food ingredient for local and export markets and scientifically-evaluated fair-trade products to enter the growing international market for nutraceuticals. We have partnered with Africa Growing plc who have provided significant investment in proof-of-concept Moringa plantations in Malawi since 2011. Strong networks and collaboration agreements are in place with the National Farmers&apos; Association (100,000 members), which will help sustain local economies. Contract growing by smallholder farmers ensures the benefits cascade down to the rural population, providing a product grown in Malawi, processed in Malawi for the people of Malawi.   Moringa is widely regarded as a &apos;miracle tree&apos; it has been described by many as &apos;a nutritional and medicinal cornucopia&apos; and all parts of the plant are edible. Our preliminary data has shown that Moringa leaves, which can be repeatedly and sustainably and cropped are high in protein (28%) and fibre (14%). The commercial source analysed was found to be extremely rich in beneficial bioactive constituents considered to contribute towards prevention of life-style-related diseases (type-2-diabetes, cardiovascular disease and cancer), as well as important micronutrients. Moringa performs well in less-fertile soils and being drought resistant and perennial is likely to be more resistant to climatic change. Additionally, sequestration of CO2 will contribute to climate change mitigation. This proposal will evaluate the nutritional and economic value of Moringa grown in Malawi. We will assess the nutritional composition, grown across several sites in terms of its potential to contribute towards meeting the nutritional requirements of vulnerable groups. With 47% of children stunted, infant mortality at 11.2% (live births under five) and maternal mortality (675 per 100,000 births) one of the highest in the world, young children and expectant mothers are an important target group. HIV/AIDS sufferers also benefit from improved nutrition, as efficacy of current anti-retro viral drugs require a nutritious and balanced diet. We will compare Moringa to the supplemental formula adopted by the World Food Programme, which is currently imported from multinational chemical companies. This will be evaluated in human dietary intervention, providing evidence beyond that of product labelling. The project will identify additional economic opportunities for Malawi by exploring the development of novel GM-free, protein-rich functional food products and fair-trade scientifically evaluated nutraceuticals, both of which are highly desirable in growing international food and health markets. This will lead to greater empowerment of the country, enabling it to influence its own nutritional and economic future. There is also potential to expand the project into other LMICs where severe malnutrition is a concern. Additionally, it will strengthen the UK research base, allowing researchers working in nutrition and food formulation to benefit from working in a socioeconomic setting, identifying barriers to effective translation and establishing connections with academics, government and non-government organisations in Malawi.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="Major Project Aims:   This project will place cutting edge research in food analysis, food formulation and heath in a socio-economic setting within a LMIC aiming to enhance nutritional security for the poorest and most vulnerable in Malawi, as well as additional economic benefits. By establishing effective production of a high-protein, micronutrient rich crop (Moringa oleifera), we will deliver a significant contribution to meeting the nutritional needs of the people of Malawi, while reducing import costs. Through two commercialisation opportunities; we will develop functional plant-based protein isolates as an increasingly desirable food ingredient for local and export markets, provide scientifically-evaluated fair-trade products to enter the growing international market for nutraceuticals, strengthen the UK research base and their connections with academics, government and non-government organisations in Malawi. This will lead to economic growth, reinvestment in nutritional programmes, as well as greater empowerment of the country, enabling the people of Malawi to influence their own nutritional and economic future. Hypothesis: Moringa can provide a source of protein and essential micronutrients for vulnerable groups in Malawi, it can contribute towards replacing imported chemical micronutrient mixes and being grown by smallholder farmers, the economic benefits will reside in Malawi, it can be harvested as a valuable source of protein isolates for both local and export markets, as well as a nutraceutical product to supply increasing international sales.   Objectives:  1. Evaluation of the nutritional composition of Moringa (across several sites) in terms of macronutrient (protein and fibre), micronutrient (vitamins and minerals) and non-nutrient bioactive phytochemicals considered to contribute towards preventing disorders such as type-2-diabetes, cardiovascular disease and cancer. This will contribute to understanding the complex relationship between nutrition in health in different cultural/environmental settings. It will inform Objectives 2-5 and through active dissemination, towards raising public awareness of the importance of increasing plant-based protein in the diet for both health and environmental benefit, helping to diversify the reliance on protein away from an increasingly limited number of crops  2. Comparison of Moringa with the standard imported nutrient substrate adopted by the World Food Programme to evaluate the potential of Moringa to supply Malawi&apos;s proposed scaled-up nutrition programmes. Though an adequately powered human dietary intervention comparing Moringa and the imported nutrient substrate to evaluate the bioavailability of key nutrients and bioactives providing information beyond package labelling. This will facilitate adoption of crop production and technology transfer as well as strengthen connections within Malawi to facilitate a move-towards self-production.   3. Development of novel commercially-viable protein isolates with unique functional properties as valuable food ingredients to be utilized locally, but with potential to enter the wider food supply chain. These high protein plant-based components will also be GM-free and are an increasingly desirable commodity.   4. Composition of a dossier with detailed information on bioacives to support the supply of fair-trade products to enter the growing international market for nutraceuticals. This will be presented to European Food Standards Agency for evaluation and will stimulate future funding targeting non-communicable diseases.  5. Economic appraisal by cost-benefit analysis of nutrient comparison of Moringa relative to imported nutrient substrate and consideration of barriers to translation and impact, which will be shared with the wider community. This will strengthen the UK and Malawian research bases by framing nutrition and food formulation research in terms of relevant socio-economic challenges."></capital-spend>
