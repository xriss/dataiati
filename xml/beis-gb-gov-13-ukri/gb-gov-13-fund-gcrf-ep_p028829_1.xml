   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Lack of safe and clean water is a long-standing challenges in much of Africa, and especially in Ethiopia and Kenya. Around 50 million people in Ethiopia lack access to safe water, and the country is currently suffering from its worst drought for 50 years, leaving some 18 million people in need of urgent aid. Similarly, only 41% out of the Kenyan population of ~ 47 million have access to safe water.   Despite substantial undeveloped renewable resources, both Ethiopia and Kenya are energy poor. Ethiopia has around 2 GW of electricity generation capacity, meeting only 10% of national electricity demand, and reaching only 12% of the population. Kenya, with an installed electricity capacity around only 2.2 GW, has better grid connectivity, reaching about 55% of its households, but is still plagued by frequent, lengthy outages. In both countries, geothermal energy is vastly under-utilised and represents an exciting opportunity of addressing energy challenges, alleviating poverty, and promoting economic development.   The Combi-Gen project aims to develop a novel geothermally sourced-combined power and freshwater generation technology, which promises to initiate a genuinely innovative shift in the engineering response to the twin challenges of energy shortage and water-scarcity in Ethiopia and Kenya. The research will provide a novel technology that can significantly improve the utilisation of the precious geothermal resources in Ethiopia and Kenya, and can produce both power and freshwater simultaneous to address the long-standing twin challenge of water and energy shortage in both countries and others of this kind. Once the developed Combi-Gen system is widely installed, it will contribute to sustainable development through reliable renewable energy and freshwater generation, and a reduction in poverty through promoting economic development and employment growth.   Combi-Gen tackles a number of key priorities for development identified by the GRCF that relate to challenges of health, clean energy, safe water, sustainable agriculture, and foundations for inclusive growth. The core of the project is to tackle challenges associated with &apos;Sustainable infrastructure development&apos;. The geothermal focus is strategically aligned with the government energy policy priorities on developing renewable and sustainable energy to meet power demand in both countries.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">We propose to develop and demonstrate a novel, geothermally-sourced combined power and freshwater generation technology, named &apos;Combi-Gen&apos;. The proposed research seeks to provide a disruptive technology to significantly increase the efficiency of geothermal resources in Ethiopia and Kenya, while producing freshwater - simultaneously addressing the long-standing twin challenges of combatting water and energy shortages in eastern Africa and similar countries. The objectives are:  1.We will develop a distributed-parameter model to simulate and design the Combi-Gen system.       2.We will develop advanced CFD modelling methodologies to simulate and design the proposed novel thermal chimney-driven, air-cooled condenser.  3.We will develop prototypes to demonstrate the novel thermal chimney-driven air-cooled condenser technology.   4.We will develop an advanced CFD modelling methodology to simulate and design the two-phase flow turbines, facilitating significant improvements in their efficiencies.       5.We will build and demonstrate two designs for developing high efficiency two-phase flow turbines.    6.We will collect and analyse the characteristics of geothermal resources in Ethiopia and Kenya, and hence identify candidate geothermal fields appropriate for future, pilot Combi-Gen technology implementation.      7.We will develop suitable water management strategies to maximise the benefits of produced freshwater for human consumption and agriculture in the East Africa Rift Valley region.   8.Engage with local communities to attain a thorough understanding of human-environmental relationships and local perceptions / attitudes towards future geothermal development.   9.Based on all of the above, we will design, build and test a prototype to prove and demonstrate the integrated overall novel Combi-Gen concept.</narrative>
