   <narrative xml:lang="EN">THE PURPOSE of the Impact and Engagement for Development Project is to expand the impact of the GCRF AHRC funded research on use of deadly force by the UN Stabilisation Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH), to engage similarly affected communities in Brazil.   BACKGROUND In addition to peer reviewed academic articles, the AHRC project AH/N00793X/1, produced a film using participatory practices, &apos;It Stays With You: Use of Force by UN Peacekeepers in Haiti&apos; (www.itstayswithyou.com/film) which presents testimonies of survivors whose loved ones were killed or injured by MINUSTAH during heavily militarised law enforcement operations targeted at gang violence. The film has been shown internationally (see www.itstayswithyou.com for details). It was screened as a side event at the Human Rights Council session in July 2018 and has been selected for the Amnesty International Film Festival, France, 2019. On 26 June 2018, we received an email from Under Secretary-General for Peacekeeping, Jean-Pierre Lacroix, in response to nine months of  emails to him and a visit by us to MINUJUSTH (the UN mission in Haiti that replaced MINUSTAH) seeking an investigation. Lacroix thanked us for drawing his attention to the issues raised in the film, assured us that the United Nations (UN) is taking the issue seriously and that he will respond with further details in due course. We believe it is important to continue to raise awareness and press for an investigation up until the UN provides a public response that addresses the concerns of those affected. Therefore, we plan to expand our impact and engagement activities internationally, focusing in particular on Brazil because militarised law enforcement operations similar to ones conducted by MINUSTAH in Haiti have recently been undertaken in Brazil&apos;s favelas and refugee camps leading to deaths and injuries - and to a perceived lack of accountability for the actions of the armed forces.  THE PORT-AU-PRINCE RIO CONNECTION Brazil contributed the commanders and most of the troops to the UN mission in Haiti. It has been argued that MINUSTAH provided the opportunity for &apos;acquisition and/or improvement of skills and knowledge related to social control and pacification, which could be adapted and executed in any other (urban) context&apos;.&apos; http://www.opeu.org.br/2018/05/25/as-licoes-do-haiti/. The Vila Cruzeiro operation in 2010 is one example of a law enforcement operation in which dozens of bystanders were killed. The commander, General Sardenberg, served in the first Brazilian contingent and more than half of the 800 members of the Brigada de Infantaria Paraquedista were Haiti veterans (Harig, 2015.) The issue is topical due to the sharp increase in militarised law enforcement operations in 2018 following a decree by President Temer in February putting the military in charge of security operations in Rio. In June a child was killed in an army operation in the Mare favela: reportedly ambulances were initially denied access.   GCRF FoF PROJECT We will work with our project collaborators to screen the film, discuss the issues it raises with communities affected by similar operations, and work with them and our contacts in Geneva and New York to a) seek investigations into deaths and injuries as result of such operations in both Brazil and Haiti and b) pressure the UN to promulgate standards designed to ensure that both the UN and its member states comply with human rights standards in all militarised law enforcement operations.  Using participatory practices, we will expand our website www.itstayswithyou.com with filmed testimonies from Brazil, focusing on survivors and medical professionals.  We will undertake a literature review of the links between militarised policing operations in Haiti and Brazil, and build on it to write reports on the situation and the need for these issues to be addressed at UN level. We aim to publish in the international and Brazilian press/social media and peer reviewed journals.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="Project AH/N00793X/1, &apos;Community Experience of conflict in Haiti,&apos;  brought to light the need for an investigation into scores of deaths as a result of militarised law enforcement operations in Haiti, and the need for a review of standards and accountability. The aim of this GCRF FoF project is to build the impact of this research in Brazil.  MAIN OBJECTIVES Our objective is to raise awareness and build connections with local communities in Brazil that have experienced &apos;collateral damage&apos; losses akin to those of the Haitian participants who gave their testimonies in the AHRC funded film &apos;It Stays With You: Use of Force by UN Peacekeepers in Haiti&apos; (ISWY) available at http://www.itstayswithyou.com/film  Working with our project collaborators, the Brazilian Association of Judges, Prosecutors and Public Defenders (ABMP) and Memorial da Resistencia, and their asssociates, we will screen the film, discuss the issues it raises with communities affected by militarised law enforcement operations in Brazil&apos;s favelas and refugee camps, and work with them to secure:  a) explicit commitments to uphold human rights standards in all militarised law enforcement operations, to be addressed and promulgated at UN levels, in Geneva and New York.  b) independent and transparent investigations into deaths and injuries as result of such operations in both Brazil and Haiti.   RATIONALE The deaths and injuries in Brazil&apos;s favelas arising from heavily militarized policing operations have recently become topical because of the significant increase in these over the last four months, as a result of a decree by President Temer putting the military in charge of security in Rio. Franciscans International - whom we met at the screening of ISWY at the Human Rights Council session in Geneva - informed us that similar militarised operations are also being conducted in Brazil&apos;s refugee camps with tragic results. There are clear synergies between militarised policing in Haiti and Brazil. The UN peacekeeping mission in Haiti (2004-2013) was Brazilian commanded throughout and Brazil contributed most of the troops. Many of the troops that served in Haiti went on to conduct similar operations in Brazil. As Finazzi commented in Observatorio Politico Estados Unidos (2018) &apos;based on the &quot;Haitian experience&quot;, it is assumed that there was acquisition and/or improvement of skills and knowledge related to social control and pacification, which could be adapted and executed in any other (urban) context similar to that found mainly in the city of Port-au-Prince, as is the case in Rio de Janeiro.&apos; http://www.opeu.org.br/2018/05/25/as-licoes-do-haiti/   SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES 1) We will screen the film with panel discussions at the Memorial da Resistencia, Cinemas USP Cine Club and Mudanca du Cena in Sau Paulo; the Laborat&#xF3;rio de An&#xE1;lise da Violencia in Rio; and in community venues in favelas and a refugee camp. 2) Using participatory practices, we will expand our website www.itstayswithyou.com with filmed testimonies from Brazil, focusing on survivors and medical professionals and the challenges they face in responding to the effects of heavily militarised law enforcement operations.  3) Working with a Portuguese speaking research assistant we will undertake a literature review of the links between militarised policing operations in Haiti and Brazil.  4) Working with Conectas (a Brazilian NGO associate of Franciscan International that has UN consultative status) and our contacts in Geneva that also have consultative status, including the International Federation of Human Rights Leagues (which screened the film ISWY as a side event at the Human Rights Council on 3 July 2018), Franciscans International and the International Association of Democratic Lawyers, we will press the UN for investigations and reform utilising international and national press; social media; academic reports, debates, articles. 5) We will write at least one peer reviewed journal article."></capital-spend>
