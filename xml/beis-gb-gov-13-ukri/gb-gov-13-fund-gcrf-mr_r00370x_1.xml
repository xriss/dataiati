   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Understanding health system linkages: Formative research to develop strategies to support quality improvement in treatment in the private sector</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Prompt antibiotic therapy for an infected patient can make the difference between cure and death or long-term disability. Unfortunately, all around the world, some infections are becoming resistant to the antibiotic medicines used to treat them. This could lead to a future scenario in which illnesses last longer, deaths increase, and the cost of treatment rises. Under this scenario, the greatest impacts are likely to be felt in low-income countries where infectious diseases are most common and many families lack financial security. Antibiotic resistance is now considered to be one of the biggest threats to global health. The World Health Organization has called for urgent action, research and investment to counter this threat, through the development of new antimicrobial drugs and through more responsible use of existing drugs. In September 2016, global leaders met at the UN General Assembly - only the fourth time in the history of the UN that a health topic was discussed at the General Assembly -  to call for concerted action by every national government to limit the development and spread of drug resistance.  Poor prescription practices by health workers, such as overuse of drugs, sale of partial doses, or non-adherence by patients to the full treatment course, all create situations which are conducive to the selection and spread of resistant mutations. Health workers and pharmacists can help tackle resistance by only dispensing antibiotic drugs when they are truly needed; and by prescribing the right drug in the right quantities to treat the illness. Improving the use of antibiotic medicines thus ultimately involves guiding the treatment decisions made by health workers and patients to discourage indiscriminate use. Therefore, if effective intervention strategies are to be developed, better knowledge and understanding of the factors that influence the prescribing practices of health workers will be essential.  The private sector plays an important role in provision of health care in many African countries, with many patients seeking care from private clinics and drug shops, and cannot be overlooked in strategies to control misuse of antibiotics. Neither can treatment practices and standards be addressed by focusing on one sector in isolation. The private sector interacts with, and is shaped by the organisation and performance of the public sector, demand from patients and regulatory controls. Poor practices in one sector can easily undermine or disincentivize behavioural change in another. Yet regulation of the private sector is an acknowledged weakness of the health system in many low income countries.   The proposed research aims to address this challenge. We shall investigate the situations, norms, experiences, and motivations that affect health care practices in private clinics and drug shops in rural Uganda, including the influence of interactions between private providers, government health workers and public health officials, in order to generate improved understandings of how the health system can more effectively control treatment practices, and improve the quality of care that patients receive from private providers.   We intend to use the knowledge and insights gained from this research to develop a comprehensive intervention strategy to improve patient care and combat irresponsible use of antibiotics in private clinics and drug shops in Uganda. This intervention strategy will be tested in future studies. We hope that our findings will also be of value to Ministries of Health and national governments in other low-income countries, and can be used to help inform the development of national plans to counter the threat of antimicrobial resistance.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The overall aim of the proposed research is to generate new policy-relevant evidence of immediate local relevance to inform the development of health system strategies and regulatory approaches that (i) support quality improvement in the private sector and (ii) promote responsible use of antimicrobial medicines in Uganda and other low income settings.   Specific Objectives:  1)  To characterize the type and extent of current linkages and interrelationships between small-and-medium-sized private providers (SMPPs) and other parts of the health system in rural Uganda  2)  To identify existing health system factors and linkages which support and incentivize good treatment practice* in SMPPs, and understand why and how these effects operate  3)  To identify the health system factors and linkages that disincentivize good practice in SMPPs or permit poor treatment practices to persist, and understand why and how these effects operate  4)  To develop new intervention strategies to support quality improvement in treatment practices with regard to antibiotic prescription and use in SMPPs in Uganda  5)  To provide timely and policy-relevant evidence to inform the Uganda National Plan to Counter Antimicrobial Resistance  (*Note: Good treatment practice will be defined as: up-to-date knowledge of national guidelines on antimicrobial use, responsible use of antibiotics (as evidenced by adherence to treatment guidelines, sale of recommended drug in the correct dose, and information given to patient to promote adherence to the full course of treatment) and timely referral of patients to higher-level care, where necessary)  Through a specific focus on antibiotic treatment and use, the proposed study aims to shed light on the broader processes affecting quality of care in private clinics and drug shops in Uganda. By gaining an improved understanding of how specific health system factors can be instrumental in shaping treatment practices in the private sector, the research proposed will generate novel insights to inform intervention strategy; and identify opportunities to utilise health system levers more effectively to improve quality of care in the private sector, and promote responsible prescribing and use of antibiotics. This information will be highly-relevant and timely for current strategic planning by the Ministry to Health to develop its national plan to counter antimicrobial resistance. The study will also identify opportunities to build synergy across sectors, inform current debates on the role of the private sector in healthcare provision in Uganda, and help shape models for future implementation.  In summary, the research aims to generate evidence of relevance to strategy development in four main areas: 1)  Regulation of SMPPs, along with improved understandings of the opportunities, challenges, and consequences for the health system. 2)  Design of complex interventions to improve quality of care in SMPPs (such as: provider training, continuing professional development, accreditation of drug shops and clinics, social franchising) 3)  Strengthening of linkages between private providers and other health workers, public health officials and regulators, which can foster and support partnership, oversight and knowledge exchange in a way that will help promote responsible antimicrobial stewardship and timely referral of patients. 4)  Refinement of Uganda&apos;s first National Action Plan for Antimicrobial Resistance, and development of specific policies and interventions deriving from the Action Plan.   We intend to use the knowledge generated and engage with local stakeholders to co-design a comprehensive strategy to promote responsible prescribing and use of antimicrobials, curb overuse, and support quality improvement in health care services in SMPPs in Uganda. Evaluation of this intervention strategy will form the basis of a future grant application.</narrative>
