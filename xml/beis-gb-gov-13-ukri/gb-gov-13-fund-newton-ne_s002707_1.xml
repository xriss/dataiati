   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In a warmer climate, the amount of precipitation is expected to increase, as warmer air can hold more water. At the regional level - where impacts are felt - patterns of change are less well understood due to uncertainty in the circulation response to warming. In addition to these changes in mean precipitation, increases in precipitation extremes may be considerable, and are expected to increase at around 7% per degree Celsius of warming.  Extreme events frequently cause the greatest damage, making understanding the nature of changes in both the frequency and magnitude of such extremes a critical issue given their impact on society.  In Peninsular Malaysia, the majority of the annual total precipitation is produced by a relatively small number of intense events. These extreme precipitation events have been increasing in recent decades. They can lead to considerable damage through flooding, which can be enhanced by changes in land use. Annual, average annual flood losses are currently around RM 915 million in Malaysia. In a warmer climate, a shift to a more intense wet season (which is expected), with increased frequency of the most extreme events, may have significant implications for the hydrology of Peninsular Malaysia and associated impacts on society.  In this project, we will investigate the dynamical features (e.g. tropical storms) that lead to extreme precipitation in Malaysia. We will study both their present-day behaviour and likely changes in the future. In doing so, we will achieve a dynamically constrained understanding of future extreme precipitation events. This represents a considerable advance on our current understanding of future changes in extreme precipitation in Malaysia. We will then use this information to run a hydrological model to estimate future changes in streamflow, flood magnitudes and flood return periods. This model will include estimates of land use change which will also be developed as part of the project. Through this, information of unprecedented detail will be available to Malaysian government and society of the risks and impacts of future changes in extreme precipitation and associated changes in river flow. We will also use this information to assess current intervention strategies and to develop a model of flood management which takes into account our improved understanding of flood risk. This information will be disseminated to a wide array of actors across government and civil society to ensure it has maximum impact. Ensuring that future infrastructural, societal and agricultural development in Malaysia is informed by prospective changes in key climate events is critical if we are to successfully adapt to a warmer climate, whilst mitigating the impact of any changes on society and the economy of Malaysia. This project has the capacity to make a significant contribution to that aim.  The techniques developed as part of this project could be readily applied in other river basins and countries, such that the impact and longevity of this work could be far broader than the scope currently envisaged. The project partners intend to work with other collaborators to ensure that these broader benefits are realised.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="IMPRESS will combine novel storm compositing techniques developed at Exeter and Reading with land use and hydrological modelling developed at USM to provide detailed and physically based assessments of future flood and drought risk in Malaysia. These science outputs will then be employed to inform intervention strategies based on a greatly enhanced understanding of hydro-meteorological extremes in Malaysia&apos;s future climate.   The key, over-arching objective of IMPRESS is to deliver a step-change in our understanding of hydro-meteorological extremes in Malaysia, their impacts and the strategies available to adapt to these changes. In pursuit of this, we will produce research which satisfies the following, inter-related, objectives:  (1) To apply storm compositing techniques to derive a detailed, dynamically constrained understanding of the ability of state-of-the-art climate models to represent the key events which generate extreme precipitation in Peninsular Malaysia. (2) To derive projections of changes in those events from future climate scenarios using those climate models. (3) To apply that output, combined with detailed land use change projections that will be developed as part of IMPRESS, to drive a hydrological model (SWAT) and to provide estimates of future changes in streamflow in two Malaysian river basins. This information will provide information of unprecedented detail to key stakeholders, and the wider public, on future risk associated with changes in hydro-meteorological extremes. (4) To use this information to assess current intervention strategies for hydro-meteorological extremes and to generate a comprehensive model of flood management which takes into account future change in river flow and precipitation. (5) To engage with key stakeholders in the Malaysian government, civil society, academic community and wider society to communicate the outcomes of this research and to provide relevant data produced by IMPRESS to those stakeholders."></capital-spend>
