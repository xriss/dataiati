   <narrative xml:lang="EN">&quot;International&quot;.  Jali Ardhi [Care for the Land] project: Realising land management change in degraded Maasai grazing lands.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">&apos;Jali Ardhi&apos; means &apos;Care for the Land&apos; in Swahili. This is the short project name for the interdisciplinary Global Challenges Research Fund project &quot;Socio-ecological resilience to soil erosion driven by extreme events: past, present and future challenges in East Africa&quot; upon which this innovation proposal is based. Soil erosion and downstream siltation problems challenge water, food and energy (i.e. HEP) security with growing threats from climate change. Even under &apos;normal&apos; climatic conditions, soil erosion by water reduces water and nutrient retention, biodiversity and plant primary productivity on agricultural land putting stress on food production, notwithstanding ecosystem and water resource damage downstream. This undermines the environmental and economic resilience of communities that depend on soil and water resources, and shocks are often amplified by physical and socio-cultural positive feedback mechanisms. At community level, soil erosion has severe impacts through undermining food and water security and curtailing mobility between communities, resources and markets in fragmented landscapes. Environmental shocks can, however, lead to a learning experience that propels a system to a qualitatively different pathway and can support greater-than-previous levels of resilience (sometimes termed &apos;bounce back&apos;). Co-design of sustainable land management practices and implementation of appropriate community-focussed legislation will enable rural communities to (1) recover from environmental impacts to a resilience level beyond the prior state through restoration/enhancement of degraded landscapes and (2) withstand shock of future extreme climatic events with longer-term sustainability and socio-economic benefits. This Innovation follow-on grant proposal draws on in-depth evidence of soil erosion causes, processes and impacts in rural Tanzania, specifically Maasai communities that are in a fragile state of transition from pastoralism to more sedentary and mixed agri-pastoral livelihoods. It builds on proven and interdisciplinary stakeholder engagement to deliver a new action framework for the development of bottom-up policy instruments (byelaws) to achieve credible change in land management practice with long-term socio-economic benefits for these impoverished rural communities.  The Innovation programme will build on the resulting research evidence base of the problem and potential pathways to land management change that, in turn, underpin specific and tangible outcomes for the end-user communities such as diversification of agricultural activity, adoption of conservation agriculture/grazing approaches and alternative, sustainable livelihood development. Facilitating a step change in land management practice to reduce complex soil erosion impacts is a fundamental target within the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) (e.g. SDG15, target 3 reducing land degradation while enabling communities to become more resilient e.g. SDG13), a challenge that requires the interdisciplinary approach developed and proven by our team. Working with key partners in local government, a soil conservation NGO, specialists in participatory approaches and end-user communities (with whom we have a close working relationship from prior research), our proposed innovation activities will provide an exemplar for how land management change can be realised from research evidence. While this small innovation project offers an opportunity to demonstrate a new evidence-based, bottom-up approach with communities, scaling up the impact of the Jali Ardhi approach to the East African region remains our wider ambition.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The key ingredients of this innovation programme are embedded in primary research outcomes from Global Challenges Research Fund (2016-2017) research in Tanzania. The objectives comprise a series of translational and knowledge exchange activities with key stakeholders e.g. conservation NGOs, District Council officials. These link from the research evidence base to tangible innovation outcomes and benefits to the end-user Maasai and agricultural communities of Northern Tanzania. Translational and knowledge exchange activities to be implemented are: (1) Set up and maintain, with cooperation of Village Leaders, demonstration livestock-exclusion plots, re-seeded with local grasses, to demonstrate landscape recovery is possible.  (2) Arrange and facilitate Maasai community visits to local sustainable agriculture smallholdings for knowledge exchange with local conservation agriculture champions (who are also from the Maasai community). (3) Facilitate local stakeholder workshops to develop and deliver infographic materials that can be used to disseminate the scientific evidence base to local communities (working in collaboration with a professional designer and photojournalist with UNEP infographic development experience). (4) Organise and facilitate participatory stakeholder workshops to support the development of community-specific land management action plans and byelaws with District Council Partners. The key deliverables from these activities will be: (a) Public commitment to new forms of land management and development of new behavioural norms with a conservation agenda. (b) Community educational infographic posters and pamphlets on soil erosion causes and co-designed solutions. (c) Co-designed land management action plans for the range of observed erosion challenges. (d) Submission of proposed land management byelaws to the local District Council by communities affected by soil erosion in the study area. Benefits from these actions will include reduced soil erosion i.e. conservation of the precious resource on which these communities survive, targeted landscape restoration and diversification of agricultural produce and hence income, livelihood diversification, and improved community and landscape resilience to hydrometeorological shocks. The success story that we hope will emerge from this innovation grant will (1) be shared through our international networks (e.g. UN FAO/IAEA, NGOs, East Africa Community) to reach policy makers at regional, national and international level and (2) underpin future GCRF proposals to address soil erosion challenges across the wider East Africa Rift System region and beyond.</narrative>
