   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Enhancing collaboration between state, civil society and community in the face of crime and chronic violence in Mexico</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Objectives:  We aim to improve security policy and practice in Mexico by experimenting with collaboration between state, civil society and communities, informed by the findings of 2 Newton projects, and the experience of new academic and non-academic partners.  In our previous projects, Stack and Maldonado used ethnography to track existing collaboration like local security councils, while Pearce&apos;s team experimented in co-producing Human Security Agendas with marginal communities. That research will inform new processes of collaboration agreed with our partners, and monitored throughout the project, allowing us to articulate principles for collaboration and develop and evaluate a repertoire of strategies for collaboration that make good on these principles.  To ensure the principles and strategies are flexible, we will extend the project to the states of Jalisco and Veraruz, similarly affected by crime and violence but with different state-civil society-communities relations.    Key deliverables and anticipated outputs:   The principles and strategies for state-civil society-communities collaboration identified in our Newton projects will be debated through a first round of forums with 21 new academic and non-academic partners, together with state actors and incorporating community voices, deciding new modes of collaboration to be attempted, setting objectives for them.  The agreed new modes will be monitored by the Facilitators and Lead Team, and evaluated through a further round of forums and stakeholder interviews (which will also provide shareable research data). Key deliverables will be those collaborative processes that prove most effective and sustainable, and the principles and strategies they entail.  Evaluating the collaboration will allow us, through 2 final rounds of interviews and forums, to synthesize the lessons learned in a Security Collaboration Manual, our primary output, addressed to officials, organizations and communities across Mexico, whose use and impact will be monitored.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">We will build on the findings of 2 previous Newton projects, one led by UK and Mexico leads Stack and Maldonado and the other by partner Pearce, to enhance collaboration between state, civil society and communities in security policy and practice, with a view to counteracting the tendency across Mexico for violence, already exacerbated by crime, to become &quot;chronic&quot; (Pearce) in every sphere of life.  In August, Silvano Aureoles, head of the state governors&apos; body, and governor of Michoac&#xE1;n, where both teams conducted fieldwork, pledged to respond to unabated violence by &quot;reinforcing the strategies of capture of criminal objectives and the dismantling of their structures&quot;, emphasizing inter-institutional collaboration. Aureoles did not mention that the dismantling of a criminal organization in Michoac&#xE1;n in 2014 was followed by further violence, lasting through our research in 2016-19, despite improving inter-institutional collaboration. Aureoles has also called for civil society and communities to collaborate with government, but he has fallen back on models that, our projects showed, fail to generate the effective collaboration that can reduce crime and violence. Similarly, President L&#xF3;pez Obrador&apos;s team hosted Peace and Reconciliation Forums in 2018, but these largely failed to engage communities, and he is now accused of reproducing old models of security policy.  Our Newton projects studied diverse collaborative processes in Michoac&#xE1;n, enabling us now to enhance those processes through knowledge exchange with local and national partners, and where appropriate to initiate new ones. We will extend the impact to 2 other afflicted states, Jalisco and Veracruz, where we have new academic and non-academic partners with complementary expertise. We will articulate flexible principles and strategies for collaboration suited to regional contexts, which can thus be applied across Mexico, helping to achieve security policy and practice that is fit for context and purpose.</narrative>
