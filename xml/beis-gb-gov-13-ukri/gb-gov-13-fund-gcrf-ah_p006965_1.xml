  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Aim To develop a theoretical and practical understanding of the relationship between reparations, responsibility and victimhood in transitional societies.  Objectives 1. To examine a range of five cross-cutting themes on the relationship between reparations, responsibility and victimhood in Colombia, Guatemala, Nepal, Northern Ireland, Peru and Uganda, including Eligibility and Complex Victimhood; Reparations, Acknowledgement and Truth Recovery; Victim Ownership, Mobilisation and Participation; Responsibility, Accountability and the State/Non-State Axis; and Finance, Feasibility and Development. 2. To develop a research instrument structured around the themes identified above and to conduct semi-structured interviews with 20 key stakeholders in each jurisdiction including relevant government officials, civil society organisations, victim groups, ex-combatants, legal and political figures. 3. To conduct a review of the scholarly and policy literature across all of the disciplines noted in the Case for Support that touch upon the five project themes.  4. To partake in scholarly dissemination of the research findings through: a fully theorised monograph; five articles in peer-reviewed international journals or book chapters in scholarly collections (lead authorship rotating for career development including the PDRF);  presentations at national and international conferences; and the development of an on-line database on reparation laws, programmes and case law linked to project website (see below).  5. To implement a strategy designed to maximise the impact of the project, both in the local jurisdictions being studied and internationally. Specifically this will entail:  a) Writing and disseminating two bespoke policy outputs per jurisdiction translated into local languages based on themes identified by engagement with local stake-holders.  b) Hosting two international facing workshops in New York and Geneva. These sites have been selected as the main base of operations for key reparations international organisations (i.e. the International Centre for Transitional Justice and UN in New York and in Geneva the International Organisation for Migration, Office High Commissioner for Human Rights, Geneva Call and International Committee of the Red Cross). Three international facing outputs will be produced from these workshops, translated into the five principal languages of the UN. These will include: detailed guidelines on how to develop and implement reparation programmes in transitional societies; a handbook specifically designed for non-state armed groups and how they can contribute to reparations, with another handbook focused on strategies for civil society groups to engage with foreign donors on reparations.   c) To organise a major international conference in Belfast involving participants on each jurisdiction as well as spokespersons from international institutions. The conference will also serve as a platform to launch the guidelines and disseminate the research findings. d) A social media strategy for dissemination of information on the project and its outputs which will include: a project website; a project twitter account; and five project blogs.  e) To write a range of print media op-eds. and opinion pieces for local newspapers in each jurisdiction (12 in total, 2 per case study).</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Context Reparations have long been a legal and political tool of making amends for past wrongs in post conflict and transitional societies. In essence, reparations aim to restore what is owed, compensate for loss, acknowledge wrongs and remedy the injured. Over the past 60 years, there has been a proliferation of reparations programmes from Germany&apos;s reparations to victims of the Holocaust (80 billion DM) and the UN Claims Commission set up for the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait ($55 billion). More recently, individual perpetrators at the International Criminal Court have been ordered to provide reparations to their victims. International bodies, local courts and truth commissions have also recognised victims&apos; right to reparations. Despite these developments, fundamental theoretical and policy questions concerning how to remedy mass violations of human rights remain.    Aims and Objectives This project will seek to develop a theoretical and practical understanding of the relationship between reparations, responsibility and victimhood in transitional societies.   To achieve this it will:  - Examine five cross-cutting themes in Colombia, Guatemala, Nepal, Northern Ireland, Peru and Uganda of:  (1) Eligibility and Complex Victimhood; (2) Reparations, Acknowledgement and Truth Recovery; (3) Victim Ownership, Mobilisation and Participation; (4) Responsibility, Accountability and the State/Non-State Axis; and (5) Finance, Feasibility and Development; - Develop a research instrument structured around the themes above and conduct 20 semi-structured interviews in each jurisdiction with key government officials, civil society organisations, victim groups, ex-combatants, legal and political figures; and - Conduct a review of the relevant scholarly and policy literature across a range of relevant disciplines that illuminate the five project themes.  Potential Applications and Benefits  This project will be of value to academics, civil society and international organisations. Academically, the project will help develop a thicker understanding of the relationship between reparations, responsibility and victimhood in transitional societies. These broader theoretical considerations will be explored and disseminated through a scholarly monograph, at least five journal articles or book chapters and over a dozen conference presentations.  At the level of policy and practice, this project will inform domestic debates on reparations in each of the six case studies with two bespoke reports for each jurisdiction (translated into local languages), two handbooks, and one guidelines on reparations in transitional societies. This research will also be highly relevant to international organisations like the UN, the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, the International Criminal Court, and the International Organisation for Migration, as well as policymakers and donors, international and regional courts and transnational civil society actors, which are involved in developing or adjudicating reparations around the world.  &apos;Fit&apos; with Global Challenges Research Fund (GCRF) This project aligns with the goals of the GCRF with its focus on conflict reconciliation, transitional justice and cohesive communities, and a &apos;human-centred&apos; approach to conflict reconciliation. Given the focus of the research on reparations in Low/Middle Income countries and the broad range of outputs targeted at divided or marginalised populations (i.e. handbooks for civil society groups and non-state armed groups) as well as guidelines for International Organisations to aid the design of reparations programmes, we believe that this project is Official Development Assistance (ODA) compliant. Given the links between post-conflict stability, sustainable economic and societal development this research addresses an evidenced need, the primary beneficiaries of this highly impactful project will be disadvantaged populations.</narrative>
