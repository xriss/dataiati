   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The &quot;Irie Classrooms Toolbox&quot;: a cluster randomised trial of a universal violence prevention programme in Jamaican preschools.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">1. We plan to implement and evaluate, through a cluster randomised design, a school-based, behavioural intervention for 3-5 year old Jamaican children designed to reduce the levels of aggression among children in school and reduce violence against children by teachers. The intervention also aims to enhance child and teacher competencies by increasing child social skills and training teachers to provide an emotionally supportive classroom environment. Through the intervention, teachers will be trained to: i) use appropriate child behaviour modification strategies and ii) deliver a curriculum unit on social and emotional skills.  2. We will evaluate the effect of the intervention on the following primary outcomes:  a. Observations of violence against children by teachers  b. Observed levels of children&apos;s classroom aggression  The following secondary measures will be measured: c. The emotional, organisational and instructional climate of the classroom  d. Observed levels of children&apos;s prosocial behaviour e. Teacher self-reports of burn-out, teaching self-efficacy and depression f. Teacher reports of child mental health  g.    Direct tests of children&apos;s self regulation h.  Child reports of teachers use of violence against children i. Child attendance   3. We will conduct a process evaluation to measure the quality and dosage of the training provided to the teachers and the quality and dosage of teachers&apos; use of specific behaviour management strategies and curricular activities to promote child social-emotional competence. We will use this data to determine which factors (at the level of the facilitator, the school, the classroom and the teacher) best predict the quality of implementation and to investigate how implementation quality is related to intervention outcomes.  4. To identify factors that promote effective implementation, a qualitative evaluation will be undertaken of the specific implementation issues including: a. The strategies in the toolbox that are the most easy to use, relevant, effective and flexible versus strategies that are more challenging  b. The aspects of the training that are most helpful versus least helpful  c. Factors within their classroom and school that facilitate or hinder teachers&apos; use of the strategies in the toolbox.  5. The results of the quantitative evaluation will feed into an economic evaluation of the costs of training compared to the estimated gains from teachers being able to devote more time to instruction as well as the improvement in attendance, self-regulation and mental health.   6. The results from the quantitative, qualitative and economic evaluation will be used to identify the critical elements of the intervention, to increase ease of use for implementation at scale and develop adaptation guidelines for use in other countries/contexts.  7. When post-test measurements are complete, teachers in the control schools will be trained in the intervention and all classrooms and teachers will be reassessed in the summer term of following school year. We will use this phase of the work to: a. Continue to study how dosage and quality of implementation affect outcomes. b. Assess whether the benefits of the intervention to teacher and classroom outcomes are maintained at one-year follow-up in intervention schools.  8. We will investigate the effects of teacher burn-out, self-efficacy and depression on their use of violence against children and the levels of child aggression and examine whether changes in these teacher characteristics mediate the effect of intervention on these primary outcomes.  9. We will investigate whether benefits of intervention to teachers&apos; use of violence against children, levels of classroom aggression, levels of prosocial behaviour and the quality of the emotional climate of the classroom mediate intervention effects on child attendance, child self-regulation and child mental health.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Violence is a leading worldwide public health problem with a very high prevalence in Jamaica. Interventions in early childhood are an important component in the primary prevention of violence. Training young children&apos;s caregivers in behavioural strategies to reduce child aggression and promote child social skills can 1) prevent the early development of antisocial behaviour in children and 2) reduce violence against children by caregivers. Corporal punishment is widely used in schools across Jamaica despite efforts by the Ministry of Education to eliminate it. Although banned by law in early childhood institutions, corporal punishment is still common in Jamaican preschools. The prevalence of conduct problems in young Jamaican children has not been accurately determined but estimates suggest it is between 12%-21%. Preschool teachers report child behaviour problems as a major concern and feel ill equipped to deal with them. We have shown that teachers trained to use evidence-based child behaviour management strategies provide a more emotionally supportive classroom environment and use less corporal punishment. This translates to improvements in class-wide child behaviour; reductions in high-risk children&apos;s conduct problems and increases in their social skills at school and at home. Through several years working with preschool teachers in Jamaica, we have developed an intervention that involves guiding teachers in the use of  a &quot;toolbox&quot; of key behaviour management strategies that are relevant, easy to use, effective and flexible. The intervention is delivered through participatory and practical methods and has been specifically designed to be scalable, low cost and suitable for use in low resource settings with teachers with limited formal teacher training.  We now plan to evaluate this intervention in 76 preschools (228 classrooms) to determine if benefits are obtained when the training is disseminated on a large scale. The preschools will be randomly assigned to a group in which all teachers receive the intervention in year 1 (38 preschools, 114 classrooms) and a second group that will receive the intervention a year later (38 preschools, 114 classrooms). The intervention will involve 5 full-day workshops, monthly in-class support and weekly text messages over the course of a school year. We will evaluate the effect of the intervention on class-wide measures of child aggression and teachers&apos; use of corporal punishment and verbal abuse. We will also evaluate whether the intervention benefits the quality of the classroom environment, class-wide measures of children&apos;s prosocial behaviour, teachers&apos; mental health and children&apos;s self-regulation, mental health and attendance. We will examine issues surrounding implementation of the intervention including measuring the degree to which teachers adopt the strategies in the classroom, factors affecting teachers&apos; uptake of the intervention and teachers&apos; views on the components of the toolbox and the training. This will help us to refine the toolbox to ensure its&apos; suitability for implementation at scale. An economic evaluation will be conducted to ascertain the costs associated with delivering the intervention to teachers and the ratio of costs to the benefits obtained. This study has the potential to make an enormous public health impact in Jamaica with benefits to reduced aggression and improved child mental health at the population level. We have close links with the government agencies and training institutions responsible for early childhood education in Jamaica and are confident that, if this study shows positive results, the intervention will be integrated into on-going teacher training initiatives. Furthermore, the intervention would be suitable for use at the preschool and early primary school level in other low and middle-income countries with potential to be an important component of global initiatives to prevent violence against children and to promote child mental health.</narrative>
