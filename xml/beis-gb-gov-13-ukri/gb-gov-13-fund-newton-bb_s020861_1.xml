   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This collaborative project aims at improving sustainable agriculture in China with positive impacts on farming communities, specifically a continuous increase of crop yield productivity (and associated farmer&apos;s wealth) with reduced use of water, and agrochemicals (nitrogen fertilisers, and pesticides), therefore improving farm workers safety. With the advent of Global Warming, semi-arid regions from Asia and the Middle East are forecasted to receive less rainfall making the use of such films a necessity for the production of arable food crops. The project will develop cost competitive agricultural mulch films for arable crops that will perform during use but degrade thereafter and have no negative impact in terms of producing micro-plastics. Agriculture plastics are used in China to improved grain crop yield and water use efficiency through conserving water, maintaining soil moisture, suppressing losses due to weeds/birds, increasing temperature and improving cold tolerance. Their use has led to a 20-35% increase in grain crop yield and a 20-60% increase in cash crop yield. Maize, wheat, cotton and potato yields have increased by 33.7%, 33.2%, 26.1% and 36.7%, respectively, while their corresponding water use efficiency levels have increased by 38.9%, 30.2%, 30.2% and 37.8%. The typical application time of agricultural plastics mulches in agriculture lasts only a few months and can be reduced even further when exposed to extreme weather events such as hail and storms due to physical fragmentation and chemical ageing processes. These generate significant amounts of non-degradable, hardly recyclable waste, which pollute the environment either through incineration emissions, landfill leaching or microplastic residues. If not removed from the field, plastic waste accumulates in the environment where it may pose a considerable threat to terrestrial and aquatic wildlife when taken up in the food chain. This project focuses on novel plastic films that will maintain benefits related to increased crop productivity but will eliminate microplastic pollution in land, an unfortunate consequence of the agri-plastic mulch use, by being soil degradable. Negative impacts of microplastic pollution of oceans are well described and recent research has shown that where plastic mulches have been used and ploughed back into fields repeatedly, microplastic residue ranges from 72 kg/ha to 260 kg/ha. Plant growth is inhibited at these levels, and the accumulated plastic residue may affect soil moisture, nutrient transport, and secondary salinization. Compostable polyester mulch films have been introduced in the EU/US market, but these are expensive and can be used in high-value horticultural production. This collaborative project will design polymeric films that will be cost-competitive and could be used in arable crops (wheat, maize) will be stable during use, coupled with an end-of-life scenarios where they will be eaten by soil micro-organisms. The initial degradation will be catalyzed by oxodegradable additives, that will fragment the material, and specific enzymes/ micro-organisms with suitable formulation will then metabolize the remaining material. Credible science data to evaluate the behaviour of high performance agricultural polymeric materials will back-up the claims made on the products A major consortium to deliver the above include Wells Plastic, currently exporting oxo-biodegradable resins and join knowhow developed by academic partners CAAS and Bangor Uni. CASS is the main academic institution in China involved in investigating plastics in agriculture, and Bangor University has bee working on bioplastics (for food applications) but has also unique collections of microorganisms collected over years (both from marine, and forestry sources).</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="This project aims at new degradable mulch films for the production of arable food crops in China. It stems from the fact that a) agricultural plastics can increase crop yields and improve water management in semi-arid areas of the country, where they are used in the production of arable staple food crops (wheat, maize, potatoes) b) Petroleum derived polymers, currently used in the manufacture of such mulch films (which are difficult to recycle due to contamination with pesticides and soil) degrade due to UV light, resulting in microplastics. c) Their build-up is reported to reach a level that will make soil unfertile, and d) current compostable plastics, currently developed in Europe and the US, are too expensive and are used mostly in the production of high-value horticultural crops. This collaborative project will produce credible scientific data to evaluate the dual behavior of high performance agricultural polymeric materials, which will be stable during use, coupled with an end-of-life of in-soil biodegradation that will back-up the claims made on the products. This will support preemptive action against agricultural film generated micro-plastics, by creating a standard that subscribes to a relevant risk assessment could help to avert a potential agricultural soil crisis similar to the one facing the marine environment."></capital-spend>
