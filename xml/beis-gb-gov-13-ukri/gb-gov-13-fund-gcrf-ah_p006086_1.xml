   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Poorly planned cities in developing countries create dangerous traffic environments and traffic congestion is growing in many of these rapidly growing conurbations. There is a need for plans and policies that ensure a more equitable appropriation of space for different types of travel modes, from the standpoint of equity, accessibility, safety and environmental protection. Inclusive travel options to allow access within cities to education, healthcare and employment is a critical component of sustainable urbanization; however, of the annual 1.25 million road traffic fatalities globally, 90% are in low and middle-income countries such as those in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Africa has the joint highest road crash fatality rate of all global regions and transport-related deaths are growing and overtaking some major diseases such as tuberculosis, cholera, leprosy, hepatitis and malaria. Over half of all fatalities are among vulnerable groups (e.g. pedestrians, cyclists and public transport users) and death and injury burdens are heavily skewed towards lower income groups.  The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) call for inclusive and sustainable urbanization including increasing the capacity for participatory, integrated and sustainable human settlement planning and management. There is a specific request for improving road safety incorporating local level planning reform to ensure clean and safe mobility within urban systems. Creative methods (e.g. the use of arts interventions, including drama, participatory map making, storytelling, creative writing, photography, etc.) have a particular contribution to make in revealing vulnerable peoples&apos; needs and desires for urban mobility. They have demonstrated value in effectively communicating these needs between stakeholders addressing the need for inclusion in planning processes irrespective of age, gender, religion, origin or economic status. The arts and humanities have a role to play in bringing forward new viewpoints and generating novel solutions by providing a discussion space to explore these key issues. Sometimes providing a counterpoint or challenge to existing bureaucratic and technical knowledge and power processes. This project will build a network of UK arts and humanities academics with their counterparts from East Africa alongside local urban planners, designers, NGOs, civil society groups and urban decision makers. The UK participants have experience of a range of creative approaches used to reveal different groups problems (in relation to mobility and travel); but methods that are also useful in helping identify novel solutions co-designed with these groups themselves. The network will identify how these approaches could be developed and used in East Africa to help address issues around sustainable travel options for all residents of the regions rapidly growing cities contributing to the delivery of the SDGs.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The aim of this proposal is to assemble a network of UK and East African academics, planners, NGOs and designers to identify whether creative methods, primarily developed in UK or European contexts, could be usefully adapted and migrated to African city settings. Could these methods reveal new insights on the everyday realities of mobility for a cross-section (based on age, gender and ethnic origins) of urban residents. Could creative methods make a novel contribution to both identifying problems for these different groups but also help co-design original solutions that would usefully address issues of equitable development in line with the aims of the relevant UN Sustainable Development Goals? To achieve this objective this grant will assemble and connect a group of UK arts and humanities academics who have developed and utilized relevant creative methods in a range of RCUK (including AHRC) funded projects with East African counterparts including academics but critically road safety experts, urban designers, land use planners, local decision makers and NGOs. The methods for discussion within the proposed network have been selected due to their applicability for:  - Promoting inclusive participatory decision making and service co-design - Social and cultural innovation to support participatory development - Uncovering hidden narratives - Co-design of services in the context of rapid urbanisation and sustainable development The network participants will undertake three interlinked activities during the virtual and face-to-face meetings: 1. Identifying knowledge gaps for local EA stakeholders on this issue that relate to delivering the relevant SDG goals;  2. Participate in two-way knowledge exchange activities including a workshop in Nairobi investigating how creative methods might be used to address these gaps;  3. Identify how information that could be generated through creative approaches could best be delivered to decision makers and the public to influence behaviour and planning choices to ultimately deliver change for residents of East Africa&apos;s growing cities.  The network will meet virtually using video and audio conferencing to identify current gaps in knowledge related to the relevant SDGs. The virtual meetings will also discuss possible creative methods that would address these deficits in knowledge. In addition, up to 26 local participants and 5 UK academics from the network will meet during a face-to-face 5 day workshop in Nairobi. This workshop will also include contributions from additional UK academics made remotely. Outputs from the meetings and workshop will include briefing material on the knowledge gaps and descriptions of the contribution different creative methods could make in this context. A website will be developed and kept up to date with news and information on project activities particularly with briefing material that will ultimately form a Toolkit on how creative methods could address SDG goals around road safety (goal 3.6); enable women&apos;s effective participation in decision making (goal 5.5); help design resilient, sustainable and inclusive urban infrastructure (goal 9.1); enhance participation in the development of safe transport networks (goals 11.2 and 11.3). We will develop briefing notes, aimed at relevant stakeholder groups, to disseminate key findings from the workshop event.   The ultimate objective for the network would be to seek external project funds to address these SDGs and local development needs integrating these locally modified creative methods and their distinct contributions in the suite of approaches employed.</narrative>
