   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Newton Fund - Rapid Earthquake Risk Assessment and Post-Earthquake Disaster Management Framework for Substandard Buildings in Turkey</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">As a consequence of population growth and urbanisation, our exposure to the seismic hazard is increasing, with the greatest risk arising from substandard constructions. Substandard reinforced concrete (RC) structures account for a large proportion of the existing building stock in urban and suburban regions of Turkey. Such structures are known to be highly vulnerable and have experienced catastrophic damage during past earthquakes (Kocaeli 1999, Duzce 1999, and Van 2011) leading to inexcusably extensive human, economic and societal losses given that the Turkish Seismic Design Code (1997) was revised in 2007 to introduce more stringent requirements for seismic design and mitigate vulnerability. However, the benefits of modern codes and more stringent code enforcement and inspection during design and construction will only benefit society in the future, whilst the current stock remains highly vulnerable. Consequently, there is an urgent need for reliable vulnerability assessments, appropriate seismic risk management strategies and fast rapid post-disaster response to significantly reduce potential losses in future severe earthquakes. The aim of this collaboration is to synergise complementary expertise of leading institutions in Turkey and the UK in the field of Earthquake Engineering and Seismic Risk Assessment and Crisis Management so as to develop, an innovative, integrated and efficient framework for multi-hazard seismic risk assessment and disaster mitigation in Turkey. Rapid earthquake risk assessment and post-earthquake disaster intelligence obtained from real-time data from smart devices will be coupled for the first time. This synergy will contribute to the coordination of post-earthquake search and rescue actions, enhance situational awareness and to validate earthquake risk assessment predictions. A new methodology for rapid assessment of structures will be created considering all components of primary/secondary earthquake hazards (e.g. landslides and liquefaction), structural vulnerability and financial/economic aspects. A previously developed comprehensive rapid risk assessment framework for substandard buildings will be used  to provide a benchmark for calibration and optimisation of the developed framework. Pre/post-earthquake inventory data collected from substandard buildings in Turkey (region of Marmara) and high-quality seismological information from in-field measurements will be used in the calibration/optimisation process.   The project will also address communication and knowledge modelling for crisis management, thus ensuring an efficient use of the data obtained from the high-level earthquake risk assessment. An innovative approach will be used to combine field/experimental observations and real-time data from mobile devices and advanced apps widely used for social networking. Such real-time data will be used to further calibrate the developed framework, to coordinate search/rescue actions and to increase situational awareness around the crisis. The use of social media data analysis for post-crisis management of stress, trauma and recovery will help create a more resilience society in Turkey.   The new framework will be used to provide optimal mitigation strategies to reduce economic losses and manage the social impacts of earthquakes in Turkey, and the framework can be extended to the rest of the world.Recommendations for social/disaster management and efficient communication of risk mitigation strategies will be provided to people/government before severe earthquakes.</narrative>

The framework will be used to provide optimal mitigation strategies to reduce human and economic losses and manage the social impacts of earthquakes in Turkey. A framework for rapid earthquake risk assessment and post-earthquake disaster mitigation for substandard buildings, which relies on the readily available information and real-time data from smart devices will be developed for the first time. It will contribute to the coordination of post-earthquake search and rescue actions, enhance situational awareness and to validate ERA predictions. The region of Marmara, one of the economic hubs of Turkey, will be used as a case study. The project objectives are to: 1. Enhancing the GTU rapid assessment tools 2. Classify the building stock in Marmara region  3. Develop vulnerability relationships for key substandard building classes 4. Apply the probabilistic ERA framework for the region of Marmara 5. Extend the ERA framework to cover the landslides and liquefaction 6. Develop, calibrate and optimise a Rapid Assessment Methodology to be used for both pre and post earthquake evaluations. 7. Develop vulnerability mitigation strategies based in seismic retrofit 8. Develop optimal  risk mitigation strategies 9. Validate selected strengthening solutions  10. Develop innovative disaster management capability for monitoring, processing, aggregating and analysing earthquake-related data from social media sources and specific smart devices for crisis management through an Earthquake Information Processing and Analysis Centre (EIPAC) 11. Develop a Mobile Application for Earthquake Management 12. Develop a Post-Earthquake Control Centre Dashboard (PECCD) 13. Integrate the post-earthquake social/disaster management framework with the ERA framework  14. Validate the integrated frameworks using scenario simulation</narrative>
