   <narrative xml:lang="EN">IT INDIAN HERITAGE PLATFORM: Enhancing cultural resilience in India by applying digital technologies to the Indian tangible and intangible heritage</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Overall Aim  Our main aim is to enhance the cultural resilience of the Indian tangible and intangible cultural heritage, challenged by rapid urbanization, by exploiting the potential of digital technologies applied to the heritage.  Research questions, issues and problems that we intend to address We aim at addressing the issue of a lack of knowledge and awareness about the tangible and intangible Indian heritage, challenged by rapid urbanization and migration flows associated with internal and external movement of population. This phenomenon is undermining the local identity and could result in the extinction of the heritage and its socio- economic values. Specific Objectives  1. Develop a website allowing the wider public to access the dataset on the tangible and intangible heritage of Surat (month 12) 2. Collect and systematize through Building Information Modelling techniques (BIM) 10 exemplar buildings in Surat (month 18)  3. Complement the BIM dataset with further data on the intangible assets in Surat pursued through a participatory approach (month 18) 4. Create the UK-India Center Of Excellence (COE) on BIM and heritage to upscale the tested approach to other regions/ cities (month 18)  5. Contribute to the reinforcement of the local identity challenged by rapid urbanization and migration, by disseminating the research findings (workshops) (months 2 and 20)  6. Develop and make accessible to the wider public an integrated dataset of the tangible and intangible heritage of Surat (month 24)  7. Raise awareness and exploit the tourist potential of the tangible and intangible heritage of Surat by implementing digital technologies (month 24)</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The research consists in exploiting the potential of digital technologies in raising awareness on the extraordinary cultural value of the tangible and intangible Indian heritage, currently under threat because of a variety of challenges, including rapid urbanisation and demographic changes associated with the flow of new population moving from different areas of the country. Surat is a major metropolitan area experiencing dramatic migration flows and therefore its cultural identity is challenged by new uses and meanings given to the traditional cultural heritage. This research allows making available to the wider public through a website information including a sample of 10 exemplar heritage buildings. It will be possible for the website users to navigate the buildings through 3D models, including information on constructive techniques and state of conservation. The data on the buildings will be complemented with further information reflecting the less visible but equally important cultural assets, for example, folklore, traditions, uses and stories associated to the buildings and related environment. These will include: storytelling from the locals, short videos on the relevant traditional events.  Although the website and associated dataset is the main outcome of this research, partner institutions from India and UK will continue working jointly beyond the project through a Center of Excellence. This will be internet based and will offer support to all those authorities, willing to implement the same approach.</narrative>
