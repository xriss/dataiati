   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Smart Urban Resilience: Enabling Citizen Action in Disaster Risk Reduction and Emergency Response</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Natural hazards in Mexico are a significant source of human suffering and economic loss. With earthquakes, hurricanes and floods, amongst others, generating estimated annual average losses of $2.9b USD, identifying novel, integrated and shared forms of disaster risk reduction (DRR) and emergency response is a national priority. Such need is particularly salient for medium-sized cities, which are home to the majority of the world&apos;s urban population yet poorly understood. Previous studies have identified that Mexican cities, given their broad diversity of geomorphological and hydro-meteorological conditions as well as the current changing climate, are likely to experience more frequent and extreme weather events. Out of the 87.7 million Mexicans living in areas exposed to various natural hazards, 70% live in urban and 10% in peri-urban areas.  Responding directly to these challenges, this project focuses on the intersection between smart/digital urbanism practices, disaster risk reduction (DRR) and emergency response to determine how the smart city (and associated technologies) can enable (or disable) citizen action in planning for and responding to disasters and emergencies. It draws on the objectives established by the New Urban Agenda (UN Habitat 2017) and the &apos;Urban Sustainable Development Goal&apos; (United Nations 2015), including the need to adopt and implement DRR practices and foster participatory approaches in the making of cities, thus examining the possibility of digital technologies contributing to urban resilience in Mexico. Resilience studies and literature have shown that building resilience requires not only hard effective and efficient infrastructure and technological advances, but also capable and functioning &apos;soft infrastructure&apos; including social networks and institutional capacity and coordination (Susskind 2010). Our project recognizes, seeks to capitalize on, and find ways to strengthen the already significant role that civil society has historically played in DRR and emergency response in Mexico, through examining pathways for smart city approaches towards DRR and emergency response.  While smart city narratives and digital urban technologies are undoubtedly having a profound impact on the contemporary configuration of the city, their potential for transforming the governance of DRR and emergencies in cities remains largely unexplored. This project&apos;s main aim is to understand how smart city and urban digital technologies play a role in building urban resilience through changing the ways in which citizens prepare and respond to natural disasters and emergencies, thereby empirically testing whether and how citizen engagement is important for realising the potential of smart urban technologies in DRR. The project looks at existing practice of and future potential for a range of smart city interventions (such as open data platforms, civic hacking, smart urban planning and others) altering the role of different social actors in DRR and emergency response. Geographically, the project focuses on medium-sized cities, given the potential of exacerbated future risks in these locations resulting from rapid and unplanned growth, urban sprawl and poverty. Globally, most urban residents live in small- or medium-sized cities, yet research concentrates on large- and mega-cities. Medium-sized cities bring their own challenges in governance, resource and capacity, and these challenges directly affect their ways of engaging with DRR and emergency response. The project has selected the cities of Queretaro, Puebla and Acapulco as the main locations for its case study, given the diversity of hazards and ecosystems represented within these 3 cities.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project focuses on the intersection between smart/digital urbanism practices and disaster risk reduction (DRR) and emergency response to determine how the smart city (and associated technologies) can enable (or disable) citizen action in planning for and responding to disasters and emergencies. The project aims to understand how smart city and urban digital technologies play a role in building urban resilience through changing the ways in which citizens prepare and respond to natural disasters and emergencies, empirically testing whether and how citizen engagement is important for realising the potential of smart urban technologies in DRR. Focusing on medium-sized cities, the project examines existing practice and future potential of a range of smart city interventions (such as open data platforms, civic hacking, smart urban planning and others) for altering the role of different social actors in DRR and emergency response. Considering both issues of DRR and citizen participation, the project simultaneously responds to two of the themes of the CONACYT-ESRC Newton Call for research on Smart Cities: resilience and environmental sustainability and the politics of the smart city.  The project&apos;s objectives are: 1. To critically evaluate the ways in which smart city and digital urban technologies enable or disable citizen participation in DRR and emergency response [WP1]. 2. To explore the interrelationships between smart city approaches, digital urban technologies, and DRR/emergency response, focusing within this space on the current and potential roles of civil society actors (e.g., civic organizations, social movements and activists) [WP 2, 3 and 4]. 3. To develop an integrated governance framework and roadmap for the involvement of civil society actors in DRR and emergency response through smart city technologies [WP1]. 4. To support the creation of resilience in Mexican cities against disasters associated with natural hazards (e.g., earthquakes, flooding, landslides), by developing an in-depth understanding of the potential modes of smart city intervention that would enhance the capacity of civil society actors to engage in DRR and emergency response [all WPs], and by opening spaces for key stakeholder interaction and capacity building in this regard [WP5].</narrative>
