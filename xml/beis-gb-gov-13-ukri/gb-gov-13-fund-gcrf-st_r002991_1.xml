   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Robotics &amp; Remote Sensing for HMA &amp; ERW Survey: Southeast Asia Feasibility Study with LMIC Collaborator Engagement</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">To build international collaborations in LMIC countries contaminated by landmines and explosive remnants of war (ERW) to determine how; robotics, space, aerial and ground-based sensing can help improve the land-release process, increase productivity and provide better safety for the survey and eventual clean-up of environments contaminated by explosive hazards. To also help educate representatives from LMIC countries regarding benefits provided by autonomous &amp; semi-autonomous robotics, both airborne and ground-based. Building collaborations, staging a workshop and completing a feasibility study is expected to lead to large scale, follow on project developing systems and field testing techniques aimed at helping deal with deadly contamination that has plagued Southeast Asia for decades.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">a.            To advance the uptake in use of; ground and aerial robotics, remote sensing, and associated software to assist the land release process in post-conflict environments contaminated by landmines and ERW. b.            To create collaborations between technology and data solutions providers in forming a UK consortium available for a full-scale robotics and remote sensing project, including; technology development, system design, sensor integration, field trials, capacity building, and data processing. c.             To create collaborations and establish a working relationship with national authorities from LMIC recipient countries. d.            To gain permissions and technical support to conduct in-country field trials to create practical, robust, flexible, cost-saving systems as part of a larger, follow-on project. e.            To facilitate two-way knowledge transfer between the UK consortium and representatives from LMIC national authorities - so researchers gain a better understanding of challenges, the operating environment and deployment requirements.  Also to educate LMIC representatives regarding advantages and the potential impact that next-generation robotics and remote sensing can have in addressing challenges faced from explosive hazards. f.             To find other academic and specialist collaborators to join the UK consortium as part of a large, follow-on project involving the development of technology, software, systems and processes, progressing all the way through to field trials over subsequent years.</narrative>
