   <narrative xml:lang="EN">(Re)Connect the Nexus: Young Brazilians&apos; experiences of and learning about food-water-energy</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Recent research about the food-water-energy nexus has tended to focus on flows (e.g. between producers and consumers) and ways of governing the nexus. However, there is a real need to examine how people (especially young people) understand, learn about and participate in the nexus, in their everyday lives. Only by doing so can we address crucial concerns - such as persistently high levels of poverty amongst Brazil&apos;s children, their unequal access to nexus resources, their resilience to nexus threats, and the role of education in addressing the those threats in the future. In Brazil, as in similar countries, young people are a hugely important group, demographically and socially. In Brazil, young people (aged 0-24) make up 42% of the population. Moreover, we already know that in diverse global contexts, young people are instrumental in terms of securing access to resources (including nexus resources), economic productivity, societal resilience, and community life. In addition, young people are often the main recipients of education programmes - especially Education for Sustainability (EfS) - that attempt to address nexus threats and sustainable development goals. However, there is scant research - either in Brazil or globally - that focuses on young people and their interactions with the nexus. This unique, collaborative research will address these important gaps. This project&apos;s main aim is to examine young people&apos;s (aged 10-24) understandings, experiences and participation in the nexus in Brazil. It focuses on this age group as older children/young adults are a key target group for EfS, and research shows that they are likely to have greater capacities for reflection on the nexus than younger children. In achieving this aim, the project will address three core research questions (with several sub-questions). 1: What are young people&apos;s (aged 10-24) understandings, experiences and participation in the nexus in Brazil?  Focussing on the Metropolitan Region of Paraiba do Sul River Basin and Sao Paulo State North Shore (Sao Paulo State) as a case study, how do these experiences vary in terms of young people&apos;s diverse geographical (urban, suburban, rural) and socio-economic positioning (focussing on age, gender, class and ethnicity )? Amidst the complexities of the food-water-energy nexus, what are the key priorities for young people, their families and communities? How are young people included or (not) in accessing parts of the nexus? 2: What is the role of &apos;(re)connection&apos; in young people&apos;s engagements with the nexus?  What are the everyday choices that young people - with adult others - must make in, for instance, choosing between the food, water or energy that fuel their bodies, homes and public services? What does it mean for young people to have &apos;closer&apos; or more &apos;distant&apos; connections with food in a Brazilian context - and does the principle of &apos;reconnection&apos;, so important to EfS and other programmes for sustainable development have salience there? To what extent do young people&apos;s experiences challenge (perhaps Minority World) assumptions about what constitutes &apos;food&apos;, &apos;water&apos; and &apos;energy&apos;? 3: How does EfS in Brazil address the nexus?  Given that EfS is present, but not compulsory, in Brazil&apos;s National Education Plan, to what extent does learning about the nexus currently support young people&apos;s understandings of food-water-energy? How can EfS in Brazil be developed to support greater societal resilience against nexus threats? The research questions will be addressed by producing both a baseline survey of ca. 5,000 young people and detailed, multi-method, qualitative research with 100 young people. The project will be undertaken by an established, inter-disciplinary team of UK and Brazilian social scientists and engineers, building on the work of a Newton Research Partnerships Grant. Such collaboration is vital to achieving a step-change in research and societal impacts on (young) people and the nexus.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Recent research on food-water-energy - especially that examining urban metabolisms - has tended to focus upon nexus governance and larger-scale flows of food, water and fuel between and within cities. It has tended to overlook the important ways in which diverse social groups understand, experience and participate in the nexus in their everyday lives. Moreover, recent debates about the food-water-energy nexus have neglected both the role of young people (globally), and particular manifestations of the nexus amongst diverse social groups in Brazil. We know from previous social-scientific research that young people play crucial - if often ignored - roles in securing food, water and energy, in community cohesion and resilience, and in social reproduction. In few contexts is this truer than in Brazil, which is a significant producer of both food and energy for local and global markets, where 42% of the population are aged 0-24, and where young people are still disproportionately affected by poverty and unequal access to nexus resources. Young Brazilians are - and will be - at the forefront of efforts to learn about and negotiate the nexus. Therefore, this research is well-placed to explore the experiences, tensions and opportunities of the nexus in Brazil. In the above light, the main aim of this research is to examine young people&apos;s (aged 10-24) understandings, experiences and participation in the &apos;food-water-energy&apos; nexus in Brazil. Working with young people from diverse social and geographical communities, it will examine how they engage with the nexus, particularly with a view to the ways in which they offer potentially resilent solutions to nexus threats. Within this broader remit, the project will also explore whether and how Education for Sustainability (EfS) - which is featured but not compulsory in the Brazilian National Education Plan - might address inequalities, social tensions and social mobility in terms of access to nexus resources. The project will have five key research objectives, as follows. O1:      To conduct a large-scale baseline survey of young people&apos;s understandings, experiences and participation in the &apos;food-water-energy&apos; nexus in Brazil. O2:      To examine everyday connections between people and the nexus through qualitative research with diverse young people. O3:      To critically evaluate the landscape of EfS in Brazil, through the lens of the &apos;food-water-energy&apos; nexus. O4:      To situate the Brazilian context within a critical evaluation of education for sustainability, globally. O5:      To develop a set of evidence-based resources for EfS strategies that could address the &apos;food-water-energy&apos; nexus in Brazil. In addition to the virtually unique focus on young people, the project adopts an innovative approach to researching the food-water-energy nexus in two ways. First, it will be truly interdisciplinary, combining experts in childhood/youth studies, education, engineering, sustainable urbanism, and geographies of food. A further objective, cutting across the five key research objectives above, will therefore be to assess how social scientists can work together with those tasked to provide education and design solutions to the nexus, to produce integrated knowledge that is surely fundamental to addressing the complexities of the nexus. The second innovative component of this research will be to continually question the terms of the nexus itself, and their applicability to the everyday contexts of (especially young) Brazilians. In particular, our research questions seek to critically evaluate discourses of &apos;reconnection&apos; (e.g. between people and the source of their food, water or energy) across diverse social and geographical communities in Brazil. Doing so will enable critical reflection amongst academics, policy-makers and practitioners (especially educators) about how the nexus is framed, governed, resourced and experienced - particularly in ways that are socially equitable.</narrative>
