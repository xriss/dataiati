   <narrative xml:lang="EN">1. Link TAMSAT rainfall data and GLOWORM-FL bio-models to generate parasite transmission risk assessments in real time across Africa, and assess their accuracy; 2. Extend TAMSAT to estimate forage availability and compare with remotely sensed vegetation indices and ground measures across extension sites; 3. Co-produce and deliver a web-tool for decision support via an accessible user interface and demonstrate its application in the field; 4. Instil capacity to establish and extend use of the tool within sustainable integrated parasite management systems in the target countries.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Goats are crucial to livelihoods across rural Africa. They are widely used as a source of food, income, and provide a safety net in the face of crop failure. Climate change is increasing variation in growing conditions, and goats especially have a key role to play in building resilience in rural communities, while enhancing soil fertility and enabling sustainable use of sensitive environments. Ability to realise these benefits is strongly constrained by disease. Endemic parasite infections that debilitate animals and undermine survival and productivity are ubiquitous, but symptoms can be predicted and mitigated. The availability of tools to predict outbreaks of parasitic disease is currently limited and regular whole-herd antiparasitic drug treatments are logistically and financially out of reach for most small farmers. Similarly, drug interventions are prone to failure through drug resistance, and chemistries used have known off-target ecological impact.  The current application aims to combine state-of-the-art remotely sensed rainfall data with climate-driven models of parasite biology to generate disease risk forecasts, and to transform them into effective decision support tools for farmers and supporting organisations. This will enable proactive assessment of regional livestock disease and nutritional risks to support livelihoods and resilience to climate change.  The main outcome will be a disease forecasting tool to help alert farmers to period of high risk and stimulate timely application of targeted treatment approaches and nutritional intervention. Projections of epidemiological risks and benefits across Africa and how they are changing will inform policy makers of areas at risk and help them to focus efforts appropriately and provide good advice. As a result of this project, tools will be created for rapid evaluation of and adaptation to disease and nutrition threats throughout Africa, to support sustainable production and food security in the poorest areas.</narrative>
