   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Antibiotics and Activity Spaces: An Exploratory Study of Behaviour, Marginalisation, and Knowledge Diffusion</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a global health threat that endangers the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals, especially Goal 3 on &quot;Good Health and Well-Being.&quot; Leading UK and global strategy papers aiming at improving people&apos;s antibiotic usage to fight and prevent AMR thereby focus exclusively on awareness-raising campaigns, but this narrow approach suffers from conceptual, methodological, and empirical weaknesses. In response, our study intends to improve the understanding of patients&apos; antibiotic-related health behaviour to inspire more targeted and unconventional interventions in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Speaking to the themes of &quot;awareness and engagement&quot; and &quot;informal markets and access to antibiotics,&quot; we will investigate three research questions: RQ1. What are the manifestations and determinants of problematic antibiotic use in patients&apos; healthcare-seeking pathways? RQ2. Will people&apos;s exposure to a behavioural health systems intervention diffuse or dissipate within a network of competing healthcare practices? RQ3. Which proxy indicators facilitate the detection of problematic antibiotic behaviours across and within communities? Our interdisciplinary approach frames behaviour within a shared activity space. By drawing on theories and tools from public health, medical anthropology, sociology, and development economics, and by focusing on vulnerable rural dwellers in the DAC countries Thailand and Laos, we will be able to generate innovative and unprecedentedly detailed open-access survey data on antibiotic-related behaviour and its social, economic, and spatial determinants. We aim to maximise complementarities with other ongoing projects in the region that (1) implement biomarker testing and education campaigns in clinical settings, (2) generate mixed-method evidence on cross-cultural patterns of antibiotic use, and (3) engage with the general public to improve global health awareness. We will apply a rigorous three-stage stratified cluster random sampling design to produce district-level representative survey data of the antibiotic use of 2,400 villagers; and we will carry out social network censuses in four communities with a total of 2,400 villagers. Using satellite imagery and digital data collection tools, we can realise these sample sizes at 75% of the cost of conventional survey approaches. Pursuant to our research questions, we will generate novel insights into the nature and variability of Thai and Lao antibiotic usage and health behaviours using the following methods: We will (1) use event sequence analysis and multilevel regression to investigate the impact of technology and digital media as well as economic, social, and spatial characteristics of patients on adverse antibiotic usage, (2) apply social network analysis to understand how knowledge and practice diffuse from clinical interventions into village communities, and (3) use latent class analysis to detect problematic conditions for antibiotic use through easy-to-collect proxy indicators. Under the umbrella of the Oxford Tropical Network-an inspiring and enabling research environment-this project will be made possible through collaboration across world-leading researchers and groups in health behaviour research (KEMRI Wellcome Trust Research Programme; Kenya), health economics and public engagement (Mahidol Oxford Tropical Medicine Research Unit in Thailand; LOMWRU in Laos), evidence-based antibiotic policy (Oxford University Clinical Research Unit; Viet Nam), social network analysis (CABDyN Complexity Centre; Oxford), development economics (Technology and Management Centre for Development; Oxford), and global health training (Centre for Tropical Medicine and Global Health; Oxford). ODA relevance follows from our partnerships, capacity building activities, and research interest in vulnerable groups in LMICs. We apply for &#xA3;249,804 from 1 January 2017 - 31 October 2018 for this pump-priming research.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Overarching objective: To improve the understanding of patients&apos; antibiotic-related behaviour to support creative thinking about targeted and unconventional antimicrobial resistance (AMR) interventions in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).  Primary goals (in order of priority): P1 Generate novel insights on AMR &quot;Awareness and Engagement&quot; and &quot;Informal Markets and Access to Antibiotics&quot; from a patient behaviour perspective by answering 3 research questions: (1) what are the nature and determinants of problematic antibiotic use, (2) how does new knowledge diffuse in a system of existing practices, and (3) can we detect problematic conditions and behaviours using simple proxy indicators? P2 Publish a unique open-access data set of antibiotic-related health behaviour from rural Thailand &amp; Laos P3 Inform behaviour-focused antibiotic policies and AMR interventions in Southeast Asia and beyond P4 Develop local social science research capacity in public health at our partner institutions in Thailand &amp; Laos P5 Inspire academic interest in novel methodological (sequence analysis) and theoretical approaches (activity spaces) to behavioural AMR research  Secondary goals (in order of priority): S1 Facilitate research uptake by relevant antibiotic policy actors in Southeast Asia and World Health Organization S2 Publish in high-ranking journals on antibiotic-related behaviour in at least 3 disciplines (e.g. tropical medicine, medical sociology, development economics, development studies) S3 Present project findings on antibiotic-related behaviour to the academic community at 6 conferences in at least 3 disciplines S4 Complete 4 student placement projects and 4 internships with candidates from LMICs S5 Deposit open-access data set by January 2019 (3 months after project completion) S6 Involve junior team members in policy discourse, public engagement, and academic knowledge exchange S7 Involve local &amp; global public in research through engagement activities  Activities to achieve goals: - Rural antibiotic-related health behaviour surveys, using innovative survey instruments to generate data on (1) representative health and AMR-related behaviour of 2,400 adults in 60 villages across Thailand and Laos; and (2) social networks of 2,400 adults across 4 villages in rural Thailand and Laos (2 to be exposed to AMR awareness intervention) (P1,2,3; S2,3,5) - Data management through Mahidol Oxford Tropical Medicine Research Unit (MORU), Bangkok (P2; S5) - 2x half-day policy &amp; research workshops based at MORU at project start and end (P1,3,5; S1,6) - 5x bespoke meetings with antibiotic policy makers and stakeholders in Europe (1x) and Southeast Asia (4x) (P1,3; S1,6) - 4x 8-week student placement projects in cooperation with Oxford MSc International Health and Tropical Medicine (IHTM) at University of Oxford (P3; S2,3,4,6,7) - 4x 3-month research internships for MSc IHTM graduates and local candidates (P3,4; S2,3,4,6) - Public engagement activities involving science caf&#xE9;s, science drama, and infographics for site population and general public in Thailand and Laos (P3; S6,7) - 1x Oxford-based (80hrs) and 1x Bangkok-based (18 month) research assistant (RA) (P4; S2,3,6) - 5x National Centre for Research Methods (NCRM) training courses for junior team members and RAs in cognitive interviewing, questionnaire design, multilevel analysis, and social network analysis; participation at 2018 NCRM Research Methods Festival (P1,4; S2,3,6) - Collaborative &amp; interdisciplinary journal publications; spearheaded by senior team members, supported by junior members, project students, and RAs (P1,5; S2,6) - Academic conference participation, encouraged esp. for junior members, project students, and RAs (P1,5; S2,6)  We will achieve these goals through an exciting interdisciplinary team of world-leading clinical researchers, social scientists, survey experts, trainers of future global health leaders, and public engagement specialists.</narrative>
