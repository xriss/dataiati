   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Understanding and measuring pregnancy-related anxiety in low- and middle-income contexts: A pilot study in northern Ghana</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Background  Women&apos;s anxiety during pregnancy is widespread and has been associated with poor mental and physical health outcomes for both mothers and their children. One type of anxiety which seems to be particularly problematic is anxiety about the pregnancy itself. We know little about this type of anxiety in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). However, what we do know suggests that pregnancy-related anxiety may differ for women in LMICs as compared to women in high-income countries: women in LMICs are more concerned about healthcare access, disease, and maternal mortality. Despite these differences in pregnancy-related anxiety between high-income and LMIC contexts, no measures of this construct have been validated in any LMIC. Together, this suggests that: 1) maternal mortality may be more important to the pregnancy-related anxiety of women in LMICs, 2) there is variation in domains of pregnancy-related anxiety in different contexts, and 3) the scales which are developed to measure pregnancy-related anxiety in pregnant women in high-income countries may not be effective in measuring this anxiety in women in LMICs because they may not be capturing all locally-relevant components of this anxiety.    Objectives  The proposed project will address this through the following research questions:  1. How do levels of pregnancy-related anxiety differ by region and by maternal and neonatal mortality rates? 2. How is pregnancy-related anxiety conceptualized in the northern Ghanaian context? 3. How can we effectively measure pregnancy-related anxiety in the Northern Region of Ghana?  To answer these questions, we will first systematically review research on prenatal anxiety. This will allow us to get a clear overview of levels of pregnancy-related anxiety, including clarifying geographic gaps in our knowledge and understanding its links with mortality. We will then apply a bottom-up approach, using focus group discussions with 150 women to investigate the domains of pregnancy-related anxiety in Ghanaian women. We will use this enhanced understanding to inform the adaptation of the Pregnancy-Related Anxiety Scale. We will adapt this measure to context and then validate it using a survey study of 575 pregnant women in northern Ghana. This culturally-adapted measure will allow for more accurate and reliable screening for pregnancy-related anxiety in Ghanaian women.   We will use Northern Region of Ghana as an exemplar in addressing Objectives 2 and 3. We have chosen this location because:  1) Symptoms of anxiety are common among pregnant Ghanaian women, with 11% having a generalized anxiety disorder. 2) Rates of maternal and neonatal mortality are high in this Region. Understanding - and ultimately, addressing - their mental health during pregnancy has the potential lead to reductions in these rates. 3) 97.7% of women in the Northern Region receive antenatal care. Interventions to reduce pregnancy-related anxiety are commonly conducted in healthcare settings, and so this Region is well-suited for future intervention work. 4) Our study team have a number of collaborations together in this Region, and thus are well-placed to deliver this project.   Significance  The outcome of this project will be a clearer understanding what underlies pregnancy-related anxiety and how to accurately measure it in LMIC contexts. Without a clear understanding of what underlies this anxiety, we cannot develop effective interventions, and without good measures of this anxiety, we cannot test whether those interventions are effective. This project directly addresses both of those issues and thus will pave the way for future work promoting mental health and wellbeing during pregnancy and reducing associated maternal mortality and morbidity. It is clearly aligned with the UN Sustainable Development Goal #3 of promoting health and wellbeing.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">While the generalized anxiety research during pregnancy is relatively robust, there is much less information on anxiety specific to pregnancy. Pregnancy-related anxiety is a distinct type of anxiety during pregnancy which is characterised by &quot;nervousness and fear about the baby&apos;s health, the mother&apos;s health and appearance, experience with the health care system, social and financial issues in the context of pregnancy, childbirth, and parenting that are accompanied by excessive worry and somatic symptoms.&quot; Pregnancy-related anxiety is associated with a range of negative outcomes for women and their children, including adverse birth outcomes, poorer maternal mental health after pregnancy, and children&apos;s poorer behavioural, cognitive, and biological development.  There is limited research on pregnancy-related anxiety in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). However, the available work suggests that there are differences in the domains of this construct in high-income v. low- and middle-income contexts. Women in high-income countries focus on their own health and the possibility of postpartum depression, but women in LMICs are anxious about their own survival, disease, and the lack of transport to healthcare facilities in the case of a complication during childbirth. This suggests that: 1) concerns about maternal mortality may be more salient to women in LMICs, 2) there is variation in domains of pregnancy-related anxiety in different contexts, and 3) tools which are developed to measure pregnancy-related anxiety in pregnant women in high-income countries may not be effective in measuring this anxiety in women in LMICs because they may not be capturing all locally-relevant components of this anxiety.    We will address these three issues through the following objectives, which are of equal priority:   Aim 1: To conduct a systematic review to assess what is known about the levels of pregnancy-related anxiety worldwide. We will examine how maternal anxiety during pregnancy differs between countries and regions, dependent on local rates of maternal and neonatal mortality. We will examine what is known about levels of pregnancy-related anxiety worldwide, to look for geographic gaps in our knowledge and to compare how this anxiety is measured across contexts. Anxiety about mortality has been identified as a dimension of pregnancy-related anxiety for women in LMICs, but this link has not been empirically tested; this systematic review will thus compare levels of pregnancy-related anxiety to reports and data on national and sub-national maternal and neonatal mortality.  Aim 2: To understand how pregnancy-related anxiety is conceptualized in a Ghanaian context, and to further elucidate aspects of pregnancy-related anxiety which may be specific to women in LMICs. We will do this through a series of 10 focus groups with pregnant women in Mion, Savelugu-Nanton, and the Tamale Metropolitan District (n = 100). The goal of these focus groups is to understand what underlies pregnancy-related anxiety in northern Ghana. This data will be analysed using inductive thematic analysis, and will feed into Aim 3. In the future, this data can also be used to develop targeted interventions.   Aim 3: To adapt and validate the Pregnancy-Related Anxiety Scale (PRAS) for use with women in Ghana. The PRAS was developed and validated in Australia and is thus unlikely to measure all locally-relevant domains of pregnancy-related anxiety. To adapt and validate this measure, we will consult with a local advisory committee, conduct 5 focus groups (n = 50) about this measure, and collect survey data from 575 women receiving antenatal care in a range of healthcare facilities the Northern Region. We will validate this adapted measure through exploratory factor analysis. We will establish convergent validity with related constructs (distress, depression, fear of childbirth), face validity through the advisory committee, and test-retest reliability.</narrative>
