   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Reducing land degradation and carbon loss from Ethiopia&apos;s soils to strengthen livelihoods and resilience (RALENTIR)</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Land and soil degradation is a major problem in Ethiopia as in many countries in Sub-Saharan Africa.  Restoring degraded common lands through the establishment of &quot;exclosure&quot; areas where traditional community access is restricted is common in Ethiopia. Both degradation and measures to restore land are inherently unequally distributed in time and space. Hence, aspects of justice and equity need to be taken into account for soil restoration measures to be sustainable in the long run.   Using several case study areas in Ethiopia, this project aims to improve the design of measures to combat land degradation to enhance local benefits, particularly to marginal population groups, in ways which are seen as equitable and just by the community.  The project will develop recommendations for improving frameworks to planning land degradation measures that are better aligned to communities&apos; aspirations and values.     The project will develop and apply frameworks for the analysis of equity within the case study areas to design specific interventions to  - Train and provide access to exclosures to selected eligible landless youth and women to enable them to undertake new productive activities in beekeeping or livestock management.  - Demonstrate and train local farmers in simple measures to address gully formation  Through a range of participatory, communication, and survey methods the project will explore  - the impact of the interventions on the participants in terms of their attitudes, changes in behaviour, livelihoods etc - the influence of process characteristics, power relationships and communication practices on people&apos;s responses to these interventions - what worked/what didn&apos;t, how it compared to expectations  - the impact of the changing knowledge and experience of the interventions on wider attitudes and community preferences for local natural resource governance.   Using data from soil, hydrology and other physical measurements, combined with socio-economic data on behaviour and modelling, the project will evaluate the potential long-term physical effects on local land degradation of the interventions, and the trade-offs between improvements in land degradation and equity and livelihoods of the community, associated with different physical conservation measures.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Land degradation is a major problem in Ethiopia. Recent estimates put the size of degraded land in Ethiopia at more than one-quarter of the entire country, which affects nearly a third of the population. Land degradation takes many forms and has many different effects, with the most adverse impacts on poor people, who depend heavily on natural resources. Forests, soils, water, biodiversity, and economic and social services derived from the ecosystems are all affected.  Climate change and extreme weather events, such as the recent El Ni&#xF1;o effect, significantly increase the risk of soil erosion, and losses of soil nutrients.   The impact of degradation and measures to restore land are inherently unequally distributed across the population in time and space. Restoring degraded common lands through the establishment of &quot;exclosure&quot; areas where traditional community access is restricted is widely used in Ethiopia. These restrictions particularly affect those without access to other sources of firewood and grazing. Such inequalities and local perceptions of justice need to be taken into account if soil restoration is to be sustainable in the long run.    This project aims to improve the design of measures to combat land degradation while considering equity and justice, strengthening risk management and benefits for communities, particularly poor and marginal groups, increasing the capacity of local people to adapt and improve their lives.     The project draws on an interdisciplinary approach covering anthropology, agricultural and forestry science, economics, environmental modelling, hydrology, sociology, and soil science.  In case study areas within the Southern Nations, Nationalities and Peoples&apos; Region in Ethiopia (SNNPR) covering different agricultural and climatic zones, the project will design interventions with the Ethiopian Bureau of Agriculture to - Train and provide access to exclosures to selected eligible landless youth and women to enable them to undertake new productive activities in 1) beekeeping or 2) livestock management.  - Demonstrate and train local farmers in simple measures to address gully formation  The research aims to find out the impact of the new interventions on the participants, how the interventions were communicated and promoted within the communities, how they were experienced by different groups, and their impact on preferences and attitudes to natural resource management within the community.    The project will collect soil, hydrology and socio-economic data.  This will be used with environmental and economic modelling to measure the impacts of the interventions on the direct participants, and preferences for natural resource management in the wider community, and the potential long-term effects on land degradation, thus helping to improve the design local natural resource management.   With local and regional practitioners, development agents and representatives of local communities, the project will draw together all the results of the research to develop recommendations for improving frameworks to planning land degradation measures aligned to communities&apos; aspirations, values and notions of justice.</narrative>
