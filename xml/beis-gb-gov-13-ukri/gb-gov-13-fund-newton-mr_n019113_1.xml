   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Structure Elucidation and Characterization of the Venus Kinase Receptors of a Philippine Isolate of Schistosoma japonicum</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The overall objective of the study is to identify Venus Kinase Receptor (VKR) inhibitors, employing both in vitro and in silico approches. This proposal is multi-disciplinary in nature, bringing together experts in the fields of biochemistry, parasitology, molecular biology, structural biology, computational chemistry, and computational biophysics. To identify specific VKR inhibitors, ligand docking experiments will be done in combination with rational drug design. In order to accomplish the above objective, structure elucidation of VKR proteins will be employed using X-ray cystallography. We will attempt to co-crystallize VKR proteins with their putative ligands and identified possible inhibitors. X-ray crystallographic studies of VKR proteins will need ample amount of purified sample of the recombinant VKR proteins. We will express the whole transmembrane protein using Bacullovirus vector in an insect cell expression system. 1.  We aim to clone and express the VKR proteins and their soluble parts both in pro- and eukaryotic expression systems. This approach addresses the potential post-translational modification that may be applied to VKR proteins. These expression systems are optimized both in UK PI&apos;s laboratory and in the University of the Philippines Diliman. To probe the native conformation of recombinant VKR proteins, we will try to characterise the binding of the putative ligands to these proteins using Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC), Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) spectroscopy and Electronspray Ionization-Mass Spectrometry . 2. High-resolution structure of the VKR proteins is key to the understanding of VKR ligand binding recognition. We will try to crystallize the whole VKR proteins and their soluble parts with and without their putative ligands. As presented in the summary, VKR proteins are activated by different ligands, L-arginine and calcium ions.  3. We aim to study the conformational dynamics of VKR proteins using in silico approach. VKR proteins are bilobate which close upon ligand binding. This mechanism will be probed in details using molecular dynamics simulations of the whole VKR proteins and their soluble parts making use of the crystall structure generated from the study. 4. Using molecular docking experiments, we will try to screen small molecule organic compounds as VKR inhibitors. Lead compounds will be synthesized in the laboratory of Dr. P. M. Sabido, these compounds will be tested for binding to VKR proteins using ITC and SPR spectroscopy. We will also assess their ability to inhibit their kinase activity. 5. We will determine the crystal structure of VKRs in complex with any putative inhibitors identified in this study.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Worldwide, millions of people suffer from the parasitic disease called schistosomiasis. This disease is caused by the digenetic trematode of the genus Schistosoma. The disease is endemic in the Philippines. Schistosomiasis is a parasitic disease caused by blood dwelling worms. This disease is spread by freshwater snails infected with the human infective stage of the parasite called schistosome cercariae. The disease is characterized by morbidities like inflammation of the liver and the spleen. Schistosomiasis is endemic in the Philippines. Due to its morbidities, economic loss amount to millions of Philippine Peso per year. Two and a half million people have active infections, posing 12 million individuals at risk of infection. In the Philippines, S. japonicum is the only causative agent of schistosomiasis. The disease is widespread in 12 Regions, corresponding to 28 Provinces. Schistosomiasis control program in the Philippines include mass drug administration. Endemic places with high disease prevalence rates are treated with a single drug, praziquantel. A single dose is given once annually or biannually. However, resistance to the drug poses legitimate fear. Under laboratory conditions, S. mansoni worms treated with subcurative drug concentration developed resistance against praziquantel. Moreover, in Senegal (1988), mass drug administration of praziquantel failed to meet the expected  parasitological cure rate of 70-90%. The disease pathologies are caused by schistosome eggs deposited in different organs in the human host. Schistosome eggs are the causative agents of schistosomiasis. As such, interventions of schistosome egg production may lead to reduction of disease burden and transmission control. In recent years, the discovery of Venus Kinase Receptors (VKRs) in S. mansoni opened new directions in schistosomiasis research. It has been found that VKRs are directly involved in egg production. Thus, inhibition of VKR proteins can be exploited to develop anti-schistosomiasis therapeutics. In order to develop new drugs active against schistosome worms, molecular understanding of VKR proteins will be needed. This proposal aims to undertake this complex task by employing cutting edge science and technology in the field of proteomics, drug design and membrane protein crystallography. We will express and purify the recombinant form of VKR proteins in either E. coli, S. cerivisiae or Bacullovirus expression systems. We will employ both experimental and computational approches to charcaterize VKR proteins in terms of their dimerization potential, ligand binding, and inhibitor interactions. Important to VKR inhibitor development is high resolution structure of VKR proteins. We will attempt to crystallize VKR proteins with  and without their putative liagnds and inhibitors. The VKR structure will be used to screen small molecule VKR inhibitors, and will be tested for binding to VKR proteins and phosphorylase activity. The impact of anti-schistosomiasis drug development takes years to deliver to end users. But, this proposal is a huge leap towards its realization. The immediate beneficiaries of study outcomes will be the academic groups, allowing them to access free data of the 3D structure of VKR proteins. With VKR coordinates available, simultaneous work on the development of anti-schistosomiasis drugs worldwide will be facilitated. Lead compounds identified in the study can be exploited by pharmaceutical companies to speed up delivery of impact to suffering individiduals due to schistosomiasis.</narrative>
