   <narrative xml:lang="EN">From displacement to development: arts education as a means to build cultural resilience and community-led arts production in the Marshall Islands</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The objective of this interdisciplinary research project (involving a team of social scientists, artists, and arts/humanities scholars) is to use a series of participatory arts workshops to generate new understandings of the unique historical trajectories and community development needs of Marshall Islanders who have been forcibly displaced from their ancestral homelands from the Second World War to the present day. By involving Marshallese children, their extended families, and trainee schoolteachers, the project will investigate a range of experiences and perspectives, from survivors of the Cold-War nuclear testing era to young people whose families have migrated to urban centres in search of a better standard of living. Core aims/objectives include the following:  (1) To use an arts-based, interdisciplinary methodology to better understand the nuances of the Marshallese experience of displacement, and to explore the potential of the expressive arts to promote wellbeing and cultural &apos;resilience&apos; (McCubbin et al.). The project will use an innovative combination of arts and social science perspectives to make an important intervention into academic and public debates on forced displacement. The participatory arts-based methodology adopted during the workshops will serve to: (i) yield a deeper and more nuanced understanding of the Marshallese experience of displacement through an inductive process which involves participants from a variety of demographic backgrounds. The inclusion of Marshallese living in Hawaii introduces an important comparative dimension to the project. (ii) provide a range of data for qualitative analysis, via interviews undertaken during the workshops, and the circulation of questionnaires afterwards. These will yield qualitative data on the socio-cultural determinants of wellbeing among Marshall Islanders, and assess the potential of creative expression to enhance wellbeing.  (iii) produce a variety of creative outputs that also comprise a form of social history, bearing witness to the trauma of displacement; promoting the dignity of Marshallese; and countering their stigmatisation as a needy migrant minority. (2) To build research/teaching capacity within the Marshallese education system. The project team will offer training workshops on arts education, creative writing and visual literacy to Marshallese teachers, and develop resource packs based around creative outputs from the project for dissemination to schools throughout the Marshall Islands. A Marshallese research assistant will be recruited and trained in qualitative analytical methods; will participate in fieldwork; and will assist with the dissemination of analytical results to Marshallese participants so they have a stake in the knowledge produced about them. (3) To build capacity within the Marshallese creative economy  Samoan artist Albert Wendt has argued that &apos;self-expression is a prerequisite for self-respect&apos;, and the project aims to support and develop the fledgling indigenous creative economy in the RMI by commissioning new creative works (poetry and a graphic novel); by giving Marshallese schoolchildren experience of working with artistic role models, including a local poet and a renowned native Hawaiian artist; and by making creative outputs available to a wider Pacific/international audience (via the project website).   (4) To yield insights on displacement, wellbeing and cultural resilience to share with Marshallese policy-makers, and with scholars researching other displaced communities The project team will produce a range of analytical outputs, including reports for circulation to the RMI Ministry of Education and Department of Health (for potential use in policymaking), as well as academic outputs offering insights relevant to other regional/global contexts of displacement (e.g. Pacific and Caribbean islands affected by rising sea levels and mineral extraction, or the refugee crisis in Europe).</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This is a participatory arts education project involving a series of workshops conducted with schoolchildren; members of their extended families; and trainee schoolteachers in the Marshall Islands and Hawaii. The workshops will include activities in creative writing, the visual arts, and photography, and will result in creative outputs (by Marshallese children, trainee teachers, and artists involved in the project) and academic outputs (produced by the project team) exploring the Marshallese experience of displacement as a result of: i) US nuclear testing during the Cold War ii) The appropriation and continued use of Kwajalein island for US ballistic missile testing iii) Resulting conditions of poverty necessitating migration to Hawaii and other parts of the US in search of a better quality of life.  The Marshall Islands experienced five centuries of colonisation under Spain, Germany, Japan and finally the US, and during the twentieth century, global wars and US military expansion led to the forcible (and often permanent) displacement of much of the population. During the Second World War, Marshallese were forcibly evacuated from Kwajalein island to make way for Japanese, then US military installations, and during the Cold War, many more Marshallese were forced to leave northern atolls (such as Bikini and Enewetak) to make way for US nuclear testing. The Bikinians were told their displacement would be temporary, but contamination from nuclear radiation has rendered their homeland uninhabitable for an estimated 30,000 years, as well as afflicting Marshallese exposed to fallout with a range of serious health problems (including cancers and birth defects) which are still manifesting in descendants born generations later. Nuclear refugees were forced to settle on southern islands such as Majuro and Ebeye, and were joined by remaining islanders from Kwajalein forced to relocate when the US established a ballistic missile testing base on Kwajalein during the Cold War.  The Marshall Islands became self-governing in 1979, and signed a Compact of Free Association with the US (in 1986) which granted islanders the right to work and settle in the US, and included a one-off settlement for nuclear compensation claims. However, the settlement fund is far too limited to address the immense environmental and health damage caused by the tests, and many impoverished Marshallese have migrated to neighbouring US states (such as Hawaii) in search of a better standard of living, only to discover that many entitlements (such as the right to vote or to apply to national healthcare schemes) are only extended to US-born Marshallese. This has exacerbated existing conditions of poverty, and in addition, migrants have become stigmatised in US media and public discourse as a drain on public resources (including health and welfare systems).  This project aims to better understand the Marshallese experience of displacement, and to explore how strategies of resilience that remain within the community might be deployed to build educational and socioeconomic capacity in the future. Arts movements elsewhere in the Pacific have demonstrated the potential for creative work to bear witness to, and aid recovery from, the traumas of displacement and dispossession under colonialism. There is a robust network of professional indigenous artists and arts educators extending throughout much of Oceania, and the project aims to explore potential for the Marshall Islands to join this creative community, building on incipient moves in this direction (such as the recent revival of Marshallese jake-ed (clothing mat) weaving through a series of workshops held at the Marshall Islands branch of the University of the South Pacific). In addition to a number of creative outputs, the project will deliver sustainable arts education training to Marshallese schoolteachers, and produce policy documents for circulation to the Marshallese government and other stakeholders.</narrative>
