   <narrative xml:lang="EN">BBSRC Embrapa - Understanding the importance of the wheat root microbiome for sustainable crop production.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Problem to be addressed: Systems need to be developed for the sustainable intensification of crops that include utilising beneficial interactions between the soil microbiome and the host crop. Overview:  The root microbiome can have beneficial impacts on plant health and resulting crop yields. Furthermore, preliminary work at Rothamsted Research has shown that fertilisation regimes affect the wheat root microbiome structure, crop yield and root biomass. However, the influences of wheat cultivars, as well as the interaction between cultivar and fertilisation regime on the root microbiome, and in turn, the effect of the root microbiome on plant health and yield are poorly understood.   At Rothamsted Research, field trials have been established to compare the performance of heritage wheat cultivars with modern short straw cultivars. This unique resource can be used to assess the extent to which the wheat genotype influences the composition of the root microbiome, and the use of the resource is the subject of this pump-priming award application. Further work, to form the basis of the full proposal, will investigate the interplay between fertilisation regime, cultivar, root microbiome assembly and plant yield to develop optimum systems for sustainable increases in wheat yield.  Objectives: 1. Determine how different wheat cultivars influence the root microbiome and if particular microbial assemblages are associated with low or high wheat grain yield and biomass. 2. Determine if modern wheat breeding practices are preventing beneficial microbial associations from forming with plants. 3. Identify systems that utilise the soil microbiome to increase wheat yield.  Expected results:  1. A core wheat root microbiome will be identified, and discreet microbial consortia will be associated with high yielding cultivars and their closest relatives. 2. Modern short straw wheat cultivars will support a simpler community than long straw varieties, and candidate microbes will be identified in the more complex community that could positively influence crop performance.  3. Results will guide the experimental design for the main proposal to determine a range of fertilisation regimes in combination with selected contrasting cultivars to sustainably increase wheat yields.  Scientific approaches and methodologies:  1. Rhizosphere soil of 40 field-grown heritage and modern wheat cultivars will be collected.   2. Wheat cultivar growth characteristics will be determined in field and pot experiments. 3. Microbial populations in rhizosphere soil DNA will be determined by performing 16S and 18S rRNA amplicon sequencing.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The UK team will be comprised of 3 Rothamsted based scientists: Dr. Tim Mauchline (UK Principal Investigator), Prof. Penny Hirsch and Mr. Ian Clark. The Brazilian team from Embrapa environment is composed of three scientists: Dr. Rodrigo Mendes (Brazil Principal Investigator), Dr. Vanessa Nessner and Dr. Maike Rossmann. The complete team have complementary and overlapping skill sets necessary to perform rhizosphere metagenomics and wheat microcosm experiments.  UK team Dr. Mauchline is a microbiologist with expertise in rhizosphere microbiology and microcosms of various crops including wheat. Prof. Hirsch is a soil microbiologist with a wealth of experience in soil nutrient cycling. Mr. Ian Clark is a microbiologist with bioinformatics skills.   Brazil team Dr. Mendes is a molecular microbiologist with skills in metagenomics of agricultural systems. Dr. Nessner is a molecular biologist with bioinformatics skills. Dr. Maike Rossman a soil microbiologist with experience of wheat cultivation.  This pump-priming proposal aims to continue the collaborative links established by the visit of Dr. Tim Mauchline to Dr. Rodrigo Mendes&apos; laboratory at Embrapa Environment for three weeks in May 2014, funded by an ISIS award. Dr. Mauchline&apos;s visit proved very useful as it allowed him to become embedded within the Embrapa group. Many discussions were held between Dr. Mauchline and Dr. Mendes, as well with other members of the unit, to determine future directions of microbiome research in the rhizosphere with respect to wheat yields. As a direct result of the visit, a post-doctoral scientist based at Embrapa Environment, Dr. Vanessa Nessner, has joined the Rothamsted team for a period of five months (Dec- May 2015) to work on the wheat microbiome in healthy and diseased plants, and her work will provide a platform for the pump-priming research. Additionally, Dr. Maike Rossmann, who spent a one year post-doctoral position with the Rothamsted team, is now based in Dr. Mendes&apos; laboratory at Embrapa environment working on the metagenomics of the wheat rhizosphere in different soil types. As such, we have developed a functioning team unit between the Rothamsted and Embrapa environment microbiology labs, with complementary skills, which this proposal hopes to build on.  The main field experiment has already been setup at Rothamsted, and will require no extra costs as permission has been granted to sample it. The research costs are for soil DNA extractions kits, amplicon sequencing and a comparative pot experiment. Please see the JoR for more information. Wheat sampling, soil DNA extractions and pot study analyses will be a collaborative effort as the visiting Embrapa Brazilian scientists and the Rothamsted team will conduct these together in the Rothamsted field trial and labs during their one month visit to the UK.   The main costs requested will be for partners to travel between Brazil and the UK. Dr. Mendes, Dr. Rossmann and Dr. Nessner will travel to the UK to discuss and write the full grant proposal, in addition to performing the collaborative field and lab work described above. We will also invite a further three scientists to provide advice (Prof. Phil Poole and Dr. Gary Bending from the UK, and Dr. Fernando Andreote from Brazil) in a small-scale workshop. It is proposed that Dr. Mauchline, Prof. Penny Hirsch and Mr. Ian Clark from the Rothamsted team will also travel to Embrapa environment in order to further discussions, and to draft a manuscript from the preliminary data with the Brazil team.</narrative>
