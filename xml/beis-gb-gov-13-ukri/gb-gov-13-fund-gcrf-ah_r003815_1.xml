   <narrative xml:lang="EN">CONCH is a research network that will bring together stakeholders in the built heritage of the East African, or Swahili, coast. It will create sustainable network for skills sharing and the co-production of knowledge between researchers, heritage professionals, and community groups. This is a region with a rich tradition of vernacular architecture, centred on the &apos;stonetowns&apos; that were founded along the Indian Ocean coast from the 11th century onwards. Many still thrive today, and the inhabitants are rightly proud of their heritage, which includes UNESCO World Heritage sites at Kilwa Kisiwani, Songo Mnara, Zanzibar, and Lamu. All are still home to Swahili groups, and the coast retains a distinctive culture based on urban living, Islam, coastal economies, and the Swahili language. Yet the Swahili coast is also economically underdeveloped, marginalised within the nation states of Kenya and Tanzania, themselves some of the poorest countries in the world. Tanzania is listed as one of the world&apos;s &apos;Least Developed Countries&apos; by the ODA. Tourism features prominently in the economy, based on natural landscapes and wildlife, rather than on cultural heritage. Tourists are often unaware of the region&apos;s illustrious past, and a lack of education among residents makes it difficult for cultural heritage sites to be presented to their full potential. This network will strive to counter some of these problems, raising awareness of Tanzania&apos;s cultural heritage and bringing local communities into that discussion. It will take advantage of existing heritage expertise in Tanzanian and Kenyan universities, to build a dialogue between scholars, heritage organisations, and communities. This will be achieved through developing a model of best practice at Pangani, a town on the northern Tanzanian coast with a rich built heritage of the later Swahili period, and an existing infrastructure of tourist facilities and community groups. A workshop that brings together scholars and non-academic stakeholders will discuss priorities and challenges for Tanzanian coastal heritage. This will be followed by a &apos;field school&apos; at Pangani, training local scholars in techniques of mapping and documenting built spaces. Community groups, including schools, will be incorporated into this training, and encouraged to participate in finding out about the region&apos;s past. This approach is designed to foster co-production of knowledge, building on existing understandings and uses of the town&apos;s history. The field school will also offer training in the heritage of the region for local business owners such as hoteliers and small crafts producers, allowing them to build cultural heritage tourism through informed activities in the future. Community focus groups will tell their stories of the town&apos;s heritage, and these will be incorporated into a display at the existing cultural centre run by Uzikwasa, a local NGO. All activities, academic and community-led, will become part of a website and smartphone resources, to present Pangani&apos;s past to a wider audience of scholars and potential tourists.  Another key feature of the network will be the creation of channels of communication between different stakeholders in the region. All activities in Pangani will also be participated in by representatives from Kilwa, on the southern Tanzanian coast. Despite a phenomenal cultural resource at Kilwa, the infrastructure of heritage participation and tourist information is much less well developed there. A second field school will then bring the network to Kilwa, establishing modes of best practice and building a display for the Antiquities Office. The network will therefore build a new participatory mode of engagement for cultural heritage in the region, bring together scholars and stakeholders in new and mutually beneficial ways, and create a model of democratic heritage practice that will be of interest to scholars worldwide</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="Co-Production Networks for Community Heritage in Tanzania (CONCH) is a research network that directly targets some of the AHRC&apos;s objectives for the Highlight Notice for International Development.  The overall aim of the network is to create a structure for engaging all stakeholders in the cultural heritage of the eastern African coast. A preliminary workshop will bring international, national, and local stakeholders together to discuss the challenges and priorities for cultural heritage in the region. Two field schools in Pangani and Kilwa will act as locations for skills-sharing, dialogue, and establishing best practice in community settings. The network is informed by a philosophy of co-production, as a model for best practice in the arts and humanities generally, and the East African region specifically. The specific objectives are therefore as follows:  1) Create a structure for engagement of local communities in cultural heritage on the eastern African coast.  2) Build capacity among heritage professionals, local NGO groups, and local businesses to sustain and enhance heritage resources.  3) Increase local understanding of the context and potential of eastern Africa&apos;s rich record of architectural and archaeological heritage.  4) Involve local school groups and educational professionals in conversations about heritage and the past.  5) Boost local economy through development of tourist infrastructure and small businesses.  6) Develop a network of shared skills across professionals in the region, for sharing best practice.  7) Create an example of best practice in the co-production of sustainable heritage in community contexts."></capital-spend>
