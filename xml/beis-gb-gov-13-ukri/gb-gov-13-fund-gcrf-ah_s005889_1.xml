  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">&apos;Creative Writing and Translation for Peace&apos; is a collaboration between the University of Bristol and Bakwa, a Yaound&#xE9;-based literary non-profit organisation founded in 2011 with the mission to open new spaces for the promotion of Cameroonian culture and arts. Working against the context of the &apos;Anglophone problem&apos; in Cameroon, it seeks to engage young Cameroonian writers, translators and educators in the production of a bilingual anthology and study guide, with the aim of forging cross-boundary empathy and inter-lingual, inter-cultural and inter-ethnic solidarities.  This project extends impacts and research innovation developed through the AHRC/ESRC GCRF/PaCCS: Inter-Disciplinary Research Innovation Awards on Conflict and International Development funded project, &apos;Ugandan Youth and Creative Writing: New Perspectives on Conflict and Development&apos;. It seeks to expand the findings of that project from a post-conflict situation to one in which conflict is ongoing; to move from monolingual to multilingual methods; and to build educational and creative capacity through literary translation. &apos;Creative Writing and Translation for Peace&apos; will deliver social and cultural impact to Cameroon, currently listed as a LMIC on the DAC list of ODA recipients, contributing to SDGs 4, 10, 16 and 17.    The project&apos;s key beneficiaries will be young writers and translators in Cameroon; educational practitioners based in Cameroon; literary and cultural initiatives, particularly those interested in creative writing and translation and policy makers and third sector organisations in Cameroon. Young people from Cameroon&apos;s Anglophone and Francophone regions will be trained and mentored through the process of producing short fictional stories about everyday life in Cameroon under conflict. These stories will then be used as the basis for training and mentoring emerging literary translators, leveraging knowledge exchange and collaboration with a newly-constituted literary translation advisory network. Educators and educational charities will be invited to a series of focus groups to develop bilingual teaching materials from these outputs, all of which will be published together by Bakwa in a new bilingual anthology of Cameroonian fiction. The anthology will be distributed to educators, practitioners and policy makers, all of whom will be invited to a grand launch in Yaound&#xE9;. The insights derived from these activities, particularly those which pertain to the use of creative methodologies as a means of promoting peace and solidarity in situations of conflict, will be published in a brief report that will be prepared with the assistance of Policy Bristol.   All aspects of the project have been developed in collaboration with key stakeholders, particularly through a process of co-design and co-production with Bakwa, based on their organisational needs. It builds on extant scoping and feasibility surveys on literary industries, training provision and translation initiatives in the country, undertaken over a period of three months and funded via the University of Bristol&apos;s GCRF pump-priming award.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">&apos;Creative Writing and Translation for Peace&apos; seeks to explore the impact of creative writing and translation as ways of promoting trans-boundary solidarity, forging new imagined communities (cf. Anderson) through the publics formed by creative practice, empowering young people and developing creative industries in an area afflicted by protracted conflict. It extends the findings of the AHRC/ESRC GCRF/PaCCS: Inter-Disciplinary Research Innovation Awards on Conflict and International Development funded project, &apos;Ugandan Youth and Creative Writing: New Perspectives on Conflict and Development&apos; in three main ways: it moves from the post-conflict context to one in which conflict remains active; it shifts from a monolingual methodology to a multilingual one; it will bolster educational attainment and literary translation capacity for social and economic impact. Its primary objectives are therefore:  1. to engage young Cameroonian writers and translators in the production of a bilingual anthology, with the aim of forging cross-boundary empathy and inter-lingual, inter-cultural and inter-ethnic solidarities.   2. to develop capacity for creative writing and translation through a collaborative partnership with Bakwa, a Yaound&#xE9;-based literary non-profit association whose chief aims are to promote and document Cameroonian culture, as well as challenge the way art and culture is produced and consumed. By so doing, it builds capacity for Bakwa&apos;s publishing and translation work, and offers new pathways for literary initiatives to engage in development and peace-building.  3. to run two creative writing workshops in Cameroon, one targeting young (defined as under-30) Francophones and one young Anglophones. These workshops will empower participants to create their own short fictional accounts of everyday life under conflict in Cameroon. Each workshop will last for one week (travel and accommodation bursaries will be provided to participants) and be followed by a two-month period of mentorship.   4. to run a two-week translation school in Yaound&#xE9;, targeting emerging literary translators from around the country to translate the short stories produced at the creative writing workshops. Sessions will focus on creative and critical skills, the mechanics and theory of translation and will be accompanied by open evening discussions and debates with the wider translation community.  5. to develop a network of literary translators drawn from translation organisations, our extant network of contacts and schools and universities across the country. This network will provide much-needed infrastructure and support for the development of literary translation in the country, which currently remains sorely lacking, forging pathways for its sustainability as a creative industry.  6. to collaborate with educators on bilingual learning materials and study guide through a series of focus groups. These focus groups will lead to the production of a bilingual study guide focussed both on language and soft skills (such as intercultural empathy) to be published along with the stories and translations produced by the three workshops.  7. to produce a bilingual anthology of short stories by young Cameroons with associated study guide   8. to produce a report on creative methodologies for understanding the experiences of young people in situations of conflict, developing more expansive imagined communities and fostering trans-boundary peace and solidarity, which will be distributed to educators, policy makers and key third sector stakeholders. The report will be written with the assistance of Policy Bristol.  9. to stage an anthology launch event in Yaound&#xE9; with key stakeholders, focus group members, workshop participants and translation network members, as well as members of the public.</narrative>
