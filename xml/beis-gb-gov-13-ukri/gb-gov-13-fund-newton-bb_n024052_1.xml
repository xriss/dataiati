   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project involves collaboration between two teams of experts at the University of Aberdeen and University of Santiago of Chile, conducting state-of-the-art research in complementary areas of fish immunology/fish vaccination.  Aquaculture is one of the fastest growing sectors that provide food to the expanding world population. It is estimated that ~50% of fish consumed worldwide are farmed, and this is projected to rise. Sustainability of fish farming relies on good management of fish health and control of diseases. Vaccination is an effective strategy to control many common diseases and many highly efficacious fish vaccines exist. However, the development of fish vaccines has been largely empirical, based on whether a formulation is effective at increasing survival post-disease challenge. This is unsatisfactory from both ethical and scientific perspectives. There is a clear need to establish methods to improve fish vaccine development.  This project will undertake studies to characterise an important immune pathway that may be of importance for future fish vaccine development. Vaccination relies on the stimulation of adaptive immunity in vertebrates, with long-term memory responses giving protection when encounter with a pathogen occurs. In mammals a key effector population driving such responses are T helper (Th) cells, that release intercellular mediators (cytokines), that initiate antimicrobial responses, including antibody production. These responses have to be tailored to the pathogen type, with viruses, parasites and extracellular bacteria requiring different immune mechanisms to give protection. Different Th subpopulations differentiate in response to these different pathogen types and host factors, and release different repertoires of cytokines to produce the most appropriate response. We know virtually nothing about these responses in fish, although many of the genes involved in mammals are now characterised or have putative homologues likely to have equivalent function. For example Th cells express CD4 on their surface, and two types of this molecule exist in teleost fish, that will likely define these cells. Here we propose to develop antibodies to the two CD4 molecules to detect, isolate and characterise the CD4 subsets (CD4- 1+, CD4-2+, CD4-1+/CD4-2+). In immunised fish, we will study their ability to express different cytokine repertoires upon restimulation in vitro with specific antigen. Sorted CD4 cell populations will be analysed. As antigen, both a bacterial and viral protein will be used in rainbow trout, an important farmed fish in both Chile and the UK. We have developed many reagents (eg primers for immune gene expression analysis) and immune proteins (eg recombinant cytokines) for use in trout, and expect the responses to be representative of those in salmonids more generally. Following the initial experiments, we will study the effect of adding different cytokines together with the specific antigen on the ensuing responses, by analysing cytokine gene expression and CD4 subset variations. We will next select the cytokines showing the most marked effects on directing these responses to link back to confirming the involvement of CD4 (putative Th) cells. This will be done by analysing cytokine gene expression in the sorted (CD4) cell subsets following antigen restimulation in vitro in the presence of recombinant cytokines. These results will go a long way towards confirming the function of Th cells in fish, and will establish if they express different cytokine repertoires in response to specific antigen and cytokines. We anticipate these responses will be of value as markers of protection in future vaccine development programmes, helping to improve the efficacy of poorly performing vaccines, and to generate vaccines to emerging diseases. They may also provide an alternative means to evaluate vaccine performance, reducing the nos of fish undergoing pathogen challenge.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="This project aims to address the following hypotheses: 1) Single and double positive CD4 T cells reside in discrete compartments within the salmonid immune system. 2) CD4-1+ and CD4-2+ T cells have different cytokine expression profiles following antigen-restimulation. 3) The responses of these cells to antigen-restimulation are influenced by the presence of different cytokines known to drive different immune responses in mammals.  To study the above hypotheses we will undertake three work programmes (WP).   WP1 aims to enumerate the numbers of CD4-1+, CD4-2+ and CD4-1+/CD4-2+ T cells in different immune tissues/compartments. WP2 will characterise the cytokine response in CD4-1+, CD4-2+ and CD4-1+/CD4-2+ cells following antigen-restimulation. Lastly, WP3 will determine whether the cytokine response seen in CD4-1+, CD4-2+ and CD4-1+/CD4-2+ cells can vary dependent upon the cytokines present at the point of antigen-restimulation.  In WP1 we will generate CD4-1 and CD4-2 monoclonal antibodies (MoAb) using a peptide immunisation approach, and characterise the MoAb in terms of their ability to bind the relevant peptides in enzyme immunoassays (ELISA), to bind the relevant recombinant proteins in ELISA, and to recognise the surface expression of these molecules in transfected CHO and/or RTG-2 (a fish fibroblast cell line) cells by flow cytometry, to verify their specificity. We will then analyse the percent of cells that express CD4-1 and CD4-2 in different immune tissues (spleen, kidney, gills, gut, blood) by flow cytometry.  In WP2 we will undertake immunisation-restimulation experiments, to allow cytokine expression profiling to be performed. Trout will be immunised with either a bacterial (eg surface layer protein VapA from Aeromonas salmonicida, the causative agent of furunculosis in salmonids) or viral (virion-associated RNA polymerase VP1 from the salmonid viral pathogen infectious pancreatic necrosis virus) antigen and two months later (the time needed to generate effective adaptive immune responses) leucocyte cell suspensions will be prepared, and the cells restimulated with the proteins in vitro, with VP1 and VapA being the negative control in the bacterial and viral experiments respectively. Following antigen restimulation cytokine profiling of adaptive immune cytokines will be undertaken in sorted CD4-1, CD4-2 and CD4-1/CD4-2 positive cells. In this way we will determine whether the different CD4 populations have different cytokine expression profiles post stimulation.  In WP3 we will undertake a further experiment using leucocytes from antigen primed fish that are restimulated in vitro with specific antigen in the presence of key cytokines known to drive the expression of different Th subsets in mammals. These will include IL-2, IL-4/13, IL-7, IL-12, IL-15, IL-21 and IL-23, chosen as cytokines important for Th differentiation and T cell memory responses. We are the world leader in terms of producing and studying fish recombinant cytokines and most of those to be used already exist in our lab. Initially we will analyse the expression of the adaptive immune cytokine genes in these cells. We will use the results to select cytokines giving the strongest manipulation of the responses to then analyse the effects in sorted CD4+ cell populations post-stimulation.  We expect these results to go a long way towards confirming the function of Th-like cells in fish, and establishing if they can express different cytokine repertoires in response to specific antigen and cytokines. We anticipate these responses will be of value as markers of protection in future vaccine development programmes, and may also provide an alternative means to evaluate vaccine performance, reducing the numbers of fish undergoing pathogen challenge."></capital-spend>
