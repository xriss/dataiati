   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Glaciers in Peru are undergoing rapid recession in response to climate change and this has helped produce numerous large glacial lakes, many of which are dammed by moraines and are likely to drain catastrophically if the moraine dams fail or are overtopped.  A major trigger of lake drainage is rock slides and debris flows into lakes from recently-exposed valley walls and unstable moraines. Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (GLOFs) from these lakes pose a significant hazard to communities and infrastructure and also impact water supplies in the region.  In Peru, outburst floods from glacial lakes have caused ~ 32,000 deaths in the 20th century, as well as destroying vital economic infrastructure, settlements and valuable arable land.   Despite the importance of these lakes, there are many unanswered questions concerning their future behaviour and the future risk of GLOFs.  For instance, we do not know how many glacial lakes there are in Peru, nor whether these are growing in size, nor whether they are becoming more or less vulnerable to rapid drainage caused by rock slides and debris flows.  We therefore do not know which lakes might cause GLOFs, nor whether the risk of GLOFs is increasing or decreasing.  As a result, this project will answer questions concerning the past, present and future development of glacial lakes and glacier hazards in Peruvian mountains. We will produce the first complete inventory of glacial lakes in all the glaciated mountain regions of Peru, assess their changes in size over time in response to past and future glacier recession and assess changes in their vulnerability to sudden drainage.  We will investigate the changing magnitude, frequency, and distribution of GLOFs under current and future global climate change; produce the first complete inventory of historical GLOFs in Peru and identify sites that have the potential to develop glacial hazards in the future. We will, for the first time, assess the risk of landslides into glacial lakes now and into the future.  We will use physically-based numerical models to simulate GLOFs at sites identified as posing a high hazard and use these simulations to make hazard and flood risk predictions that can inform decision-makers in Peru.    To do this we will focus on five main issues:  1. Glacial lake development and GLOF inventories in the past and present Using literature, remote-sensing and fieldwork, we will compile an inventory of all glacial lakes and past GLOF sites in the glaciated regions of Peru.   2. Climate modelling Use the latest generation of climate models to assess mountain areas of Peru at most risk of future warming and precipitation change.  This will enable us to identify areas of future lake drainage risk and we will develop a ranking of mountain areas for future risk of lake drainage.  3. Assessment of lake vulnerability We will identify current and likely future glacier hazards focusing on the developing landslide and debris flow risk as glaciers recede; establish the locations of potential future vulnerable lakes and potential GLOF sites.  4. Model GLOFs. We will (a) establish the physical processes that govern GLOF behaviour; (b) analyse flood hydrographs of selected former GLOFs to establish downstream impacts.   5.  Assess the socio-economic effects of GLOFs in Peru and GLOF prediction: We will (a) identify potential GLOF sites across Peru and assess potential socio-economic vulnerability; (b) reconstruct former GLOFs and their impacts; (c) conduct numerical simulations of downstream impacts for potential GLOF sites.  This proposal is ODA compliant as it will promote the economic development of Peru by providing improved risk reduction methods that can be applied to hydropower projects and high-altitude mines as well as to local communities through relevant government agencies. The GLOF risk protocols developed in this project can be applied to other DAC-listed countries where GLOF hazards exist (e.g. Argentina)</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="Widespread glacier melting in Peru has left thousands of glacial lakes, many of which are dammed by unstable moraines.  These glacial lakes are at increasing risk of producing damaging Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (GLOFs) as moraine dams fail and as mountain walls produce rockfalls and debris flows.  Our proposed research aims to better understand the impact of climate change on glacial lakes in Peru and the effects that glacier recession has on the risks associated with glacial lake drainage.  We aim to use this work to better mitigate the effects of climate change on vulnerable Peruvian communities, agriculture and infrastructure.  Our research is designed to meet two of the Challenges described in the project call.  These are: Challenge 2 (Determine how future glacial retreat will impact on the role of tropical glacier runoff providing water resources to the region); and Challenge 5 (Understanding risk of mountain hazards, including rock slope failures, glacial outburst floods and glacier avalanches).   To do this we have developed five main objectives which will be met using a number of Work Packages.  The objectives are: Objective One is to compile an inventory of all glacial lakes and past glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs) in the glaciated regions of Peru.  We will use (a) remote-sensing, (b) geomorphological mapping and (c) fieldwork to identify sites of past GLOFs around the major glaciers of Peru.     Objective Two is to use the climate projections from CMIP5 ensembles and CORDEX climate models to assess which mountain regions of Peru are likely to experience the largest changes in climate (especially temperature and precipitation indices) and therefore which areas will likely experience enhanced lake growth and therefore GLOF risk.  We will coordinate this work with Objective One.  Objective Three, is to identify current and likely future glacier hazards in Peru by focusing on the developing landslide and debris flow risk as glaciers recede.  We will establish the locations of potential future vulnerable lakes and potential GLOF sites. We will use the results from Objective One to identify GLOFs around the major glaciers of Peru. We will use these sites to identify probable physical triggers of the identified GLOFs in order to better understand the processes that impact on glacial lake systems.  Using this information we will enhance existing methods of hazard assessment (e.g. Reynolds, 2014) and identify sites at which glacial hazards are assessed as &apos;severe&apos; or &apos;very severe&apos;.   Objective Four aims to establish the physical processes that govern GLOF behaviour in Peru and identify currently developing sites where GLOFs might occur.  We will (a) establish the physical processes that govern GLOF behaviour such as moraine-dam failure, ice-dammed lake drainage and slope instability; (b) analyse flood hydrographs of selected former GLOFs to establish downstream impacts. We will undertake research to understand the physical processes that govern the development of Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (GLOFs) in Peru. From the inventory in WP1 we will then identify currently developing GLOF sites and establish the locations of potential future GLOF sites.   Objective Five, is to integrate the data collected in the preceding objectives to identify potential GLOF sites across Peru and assess potential for damage to communities and infrastructure downstream.  We will undertake a detailed analysis of the potential downstream economic and societal impacts of future GLOFS, including the impact on communities, infrastructure and agriculture.   Finally, we will make recommendations for mitigation strategies."></capital-spend>
