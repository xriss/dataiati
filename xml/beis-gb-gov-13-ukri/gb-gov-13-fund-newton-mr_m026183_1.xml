   <narrative xml:lang="EN">An MoU was signed between LSHTM, Universidade Federal da Bahia-ISC and FIOCRUZ  in 2014; a delegation from UFBA and FIOCRUZ visited the LSHTM in 2014. Mauricio Barreto (the Brazilian PI) has a LSHTM PhD, and 3 other LSHTM PhDs hold academic positions at ISC; 3 students from ISC are split or full PhD current students at LSHTM.  Mauricio was LSHTM   &quot;Heath Clarke Lecturer&quot;  in 2013  and now hold  an Honorary Professorship there. Laura Rodrigues, the UK co-PI holds a Science Without Borders Visiting Professorship (&quot;PVE&quot;) at ISC. Professors Laura and Mauricio had two major joint research projects:  &quot;BCG REVAC, a large trial of efficacy of BCG revaccination, co funded by DfID and the Ministry of Health/Tuberculosis Control Programme in Brazil and &quot;SCAALA&quot;, a  Wellcome Trust funded &quot;Centre of Excellence in Latin America&quot; dedicated to Social Change, Allergy and Asthma in Latin America and now co-funded by the Brazilian National Research Council-CNPq and FAPESB.. This collaboration resulted so far in 89 papers published in peer review journals; Several PhDs (8) and Masters (7) theses were developed as  part of these projects.  Liam Smeeth is a deputy director of the London Farr Institute, has visited ISC to present on the Farr Institute and use of routine electronic data and is a scientific advisor for the development of the 80 million Brazilians Virtual cohort.</narrative>
