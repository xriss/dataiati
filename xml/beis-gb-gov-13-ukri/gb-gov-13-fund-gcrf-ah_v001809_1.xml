   <narrative xml:lang="EN">India&apos;s just-amended citizenship laws, the groundswell of ongoing protests against these amendments and their continued brutal repression by the state signal rapid political change and the making of a humanitarian emergency that warrants urgent attention. This project aims to ethnographically research the emergent reimaginations of citizenship in India through imminent official identification of citizens and ongoing  protests against such mechanisms, By ethnographically researching the mechanisms through which people will be enumerated as citizens or excluded from the NRC, the project is an urgent response to the gap in our knowledge of official imaginations of citizenship that can only be accomplished within the next 12 months. By ethnographically researching the protests against India&apos;s amended citizenship laws as they unfold and before they are browbeaten into submission, the project is an urgent response to the limits in our understanding of oppositional imaginations of citizenship that will only be possible to achieve over the next few months. This research project provides the basis for longer-term research on the future of citizenship as democracies &apos;backslide&apos;, &apos;recede&apos; and &apos;die&apos; not only in India but elsewhere in the world.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="The project aims to research the emergent re-imaginations of citizenship in India. It will do so in the context of recent amendments to India&apos;s citizenship laws which threaten to spark the largest crisis of citizenship and statelessness ever witnessed in the world, directly threatening 200 million Muslims and indirectly threatening many millions of Dalits, Adivasis, internal circular labour migrants and poor people across the country. Two specific project objectives inform the broader aim of reimagining citizenship. Project objective 1 will focus on official narratives and practices that seek to implement the amended citizenship laws and will be delivered through the suite of activities discussed under Work Package 1 in the proposal. Project objective 2 will focus on the popular contentions against the amended citizenship laws to be delivered through the ensemble of activities discussed in the proposal under Work Package 2.  To achieve its aims, it will draw on arts and humanities research that have distinctively advanced our understandings of the ways in which people reimagine citizenship.  The project will achieve its aim of investigation the reinvention of citizenship by ethnographically analysing the contest between official narratives of (WP1) and popular feelings against (WP2) the amended citizenship laws."></capital-spend>
