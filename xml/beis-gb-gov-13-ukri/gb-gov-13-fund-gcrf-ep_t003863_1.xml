   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Our principal objective is to build a network of excellence, connecting leading academics in the three countries and UK with a diversity of other researchers, entrepreneurs, environmental professionals, community leaders, government officials and science policy diplomats to facilitate and enrich the exchange of ideas and praxis on affordable and innovative technological and sociological solutions aimed at reducing health problems related to water and soil pollution in line with the Agenda 2030 Sustainable Development Goal 3. The network has four sub-objectives:   1) Establish an interdisciplinary, open network of excellence based on a One Health approach beginning with 200 members, who will engage in a programme of innovative, collaboration and &quot;big tent&quot; activities designed to build up the interdisciplinary capacities of its members, focussed on health problems related to environmental pollution. These include country-based Knowledge Networks, round-table discussions, workshops and co-laboratories, demonstration activities and outreach events, open on-line Communities of Practice, global conferences, joint training seminars and e-learning courses and an international conference to be held in the UK.  2) Through these different activities, produce evaluations and short briefs on the latest evidence and findings about health problems related to water and soils pollution in the three countries. These materials will be used in the joint webinars and e-learning courses, and policy briefs for decision-makers in the three countries and UK.  3) Using the collaboration platform and participatory activities, develop a portfolio of ideas and praxis on affordable, innovative technologies and approaches to water and wastewater treatment processes, land and water management practices, and provision of basic services to be used by professionals, policy-makers and communities. The portfolio will draw upon the diversity of experiences through the participatory processes including workshops and co-laboratories, round-tables, Knowledge Networks and Communities of Practice.  4) Develop the skills  and capacities of academic researchers, experts and stakeholders in the three countries on how to solve challenges through collaborative and participatory methods and to lay the foundations for new collaborations and partnerships for future funding opportunities.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Summary The GCRF Health, Polluted Water and Soils Network of excellence is focused on reducing health problems relating to water and soil pollution in climate-stressed, rural and deprived urban communities in Kenya, Jamaica and Grenada. We aim to achieve this by focusing on affordable and innovative technological and sociological solutions to improve access to clean water, healthy and productive soils and safe, nutritious foods. The network is based on a One Health interdisciplinary, approach, with a growing membership drawn from academic researchers, business leaders, entrepreneurs, health and environmental professionals, government officials, science policy diplomats, community leaders, and civil society and a commitment to grow. Our goal is to build a network of committed individuals, who will work together to solve problems together and will get better at getting things done. Network members will engage in a two-year programme of innovative, interconnected activities, designed to facilitate and enrich the exchange of knowledge, ideas and praxis, build capacity, and help early and mid-career academic participants to connect with the wider community and forge long-lasting, interdisciplinary collaborations and partnerships. The activities include a series &quot;big-tent&quot; settings including: country-based Knowledge Networks in which entrepreneurs and business will be encouraged to bring new ideas and thinking about social enterprise and for-profit schemes into the network on how to deliver change;  Round-tables for diverse groups to &quot;think out of my box&quot; and develop pathways for realising solutions;  on-line Communities of Practice to enable everyone to gain a strong understanding of the issues, evidence and potential solutions through moderated conversations;  Workshops and co-laboratories, that will give members and stakeholders the opportunity to co-design innovative ways to improve health through affordable and innovative technological and sociological solutions and improved access to clean water and soils;  Demonstration activities and Outreach in local communities to heighten awareness of impacts on health from polluted water and soils and solutions;  two Global Digital Conferences which will include on-line presentations, chat groups, interactive sessions, and hackathons, to give network members the opportunity to demonstrate how different issues are being tackled;  open access e-learning courses and training webinars on key issues leading to University certification; and an International conference to be held at the Eden Centre, UK to present the outcomes and ideas from the network, consolidate new collaborations and future actions.  Some of the measurable outcomes will include improved health in selected communities Grenada, Jamaica and Kenya through greater access to clean water, soils and safe, nutritious foods; lasting partnerships and interdisciplinary collaborations able to exploit opportunities for joint research proposals, business propositions and social enterprise; and increased skills and capacities to solve challenges linked to health, climate change and pollution through collaborative and participatory methods. The results of the network&apos;s activities will be disseminated widely through the network&apos;s website, social media and academic publications, and shared in detail with the UKRI and the Global Challenge Leaders.  The hallmarks of success will be a network that has developed its own compass for working with complexity, enjoys &quot;big-tent settings for joined-up action&quot;, and whose membership gets better at getting things done by finding power and using it.</narrative>
