   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Development of beneficial microbiome communities to increase the resistance against abiotic stress in Carica papaya and Capsicum annuum</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In their latest report the FAO underlined the significance of abiotic stresses in jeopardizing crop productivity and food security. This situation will worsen under the climate change and increase the demand for crops with improved abiotic stress tolerance. Mexico is one of the main producers of Carica papaya (papaya) and Capsicum annuum (bell pepper), which represent the economical most important crops in Colima State. Heat and drought stress are particularly devastating for both crops (&gt;60% fruit loss a-1) and enhancing abiotic stress resilience is most critical to sustain productivity of both crops, especially under the progression of climate changes. Plants recruit microbes and, hence reshape microbiomes, to receive protection against environmental stresses. Understanding the beneficial potential of microbiomes holds a wealth of unexplored scope for agri-tech opportunities. We therefore follow a new, &quot;learning-from-nature&quot; approach based on the stress-protective ability of beneficial microbes (mutualists) associated with plant roots. The scale of potential abiotic stress tolerance that individual or combinations of mutualists can bring to papaya and bell pepper is poorly understood. Elucidating the effects of individual and combinations of mutualists to enhance papaya and bell pepper productivity is our main objective. We have defined three objectives to exploit root microbiomes as source to enhance drought and heat stress tolerance in C. papaya and C. annuum. Obj. 1: Identifying root microbiome structures and dynamics under abiotic stress  Considering the significance of microbes for plant stress protection, we will determine to what extent plant genotype (C. papaya and C. annuum) and soil type affect root microbiome composition under abiotic stress vs. non-stress conditions. In addition to revealing changes in microbiome structure, the analyses will indicate crop-specific and overlapping microbial taxa and species (OTUs) associated with C. papaya and C. annuum under abiotic stress vs. non-stress conditions. Importantly, we will analyse microbiomes over time to uncover any microbiome dynamics, which will support our efforts to identify potential synergisms between co-occurring microbial species. In addition, we will establish a culture collection as a resource for subsequent functional microbiomics. Obj. 2: Identifying microbes with abiotic stress-protecting activities  We will use our culture collection to systematically screen for microbes with abiotic stress-protecting activities in a series of biochemical assays. In addition, plant-based assays will confirm the abiotic stress-protecting activities of identified microbes.  Obj. 3: Developing and evaluating microbe-based bioprotectants against abiotic stress  To apply abiotic stress-protecting microbes in the field in the future, we will test the suitability of application techniques in collaboration with our industrial partners Caribbean Seeds Company and AltusBiopharm. These techniques will further determine to which extent a microbe mixtures can generate synergisms in crop protection.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Mexico, with Colima State as main producer, is the main exporter of Carica papaya and Capsicum annuum. Abiotic stress such as drought and heat are the major cause of fruit losses for both crops, a situation predicted to worsen under the prospect of changing climates. Enhancing crop productivity under changing climates is therefore of outermost importance to increase crop resilience against abiotic stresses. This requires new strategies that are more efficient and sustainable in protecting Carica papaya and Capsicum annuum against a broad range of abiotic stresses.  In nature, plants interact with complex microbial communities, known as microbiomes. Microbiomes include a broad spectrum of beneficial symbionts exhibiting a diversity of beneficial activities that can protect plants against environmental stresses. In fact, symbiont-mediated stress protection enabled plants to colonise land in the changing climates of the Mid-Palaeozoic era more than 400 million years ago. Ever since symbionts have been vital for stress resilience of plants in nature and developed protection mechanisms in co-evolution with plants. However, we just start to understand the true potential of microbiome members and their diverse activities in improving abiotic stress resilience in plants. It is known that plants and soil contribute to the composition of microbial communities, and that the root microbiota acts to extend the capacity of plants to deal with stress. In previous proof of concept experiments, we identified microbes from both crops with stress-protecting activities. In this project, we want to exploit the bioprotective potential of microbiomes of Carica papaya and Capsicum annuum as a currently untapped resource that can equip us with sustainable and highly effective stress resilience agents. By conducting a systematic approach, we will determine the composition of different microbiomes associated with Carica papaya and Capsicum annuum. Using a combination of different Carica papaya and Capsicum annuum varieties and abiotic stress conditions we will generate a comprehensive microbe culture collection. This collection will build a resource for determining the diverse bio-protecting activities of microbiome members using a series of defined biochemical and functional assays. In collaboration with industry partners we will develop solutions to apply our findings as a strategy to sustainably enhance abiotic stress resilience in Carica papaya and Capsicum annuum.</narrative>
