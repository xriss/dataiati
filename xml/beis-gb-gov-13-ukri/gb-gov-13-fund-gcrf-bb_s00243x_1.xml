   <narrative xml:lang="EN">An integrated approach to tackling drug resistance in livestock trypanosomes.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">African Animal Trypanosomiasis (AAT) is a major constraint on sub-Saharan African (SSA) agriculture and food security with 60 million cattle at risk. The mainstay of control is chemotherapy/prophylaxis, with 30-70 million trypanocide doses used annually. The main drugs, Isometamidium chloride (ISM - prophylactic) or Diminazene aceturate (DZ - therapeutic) were introduced &gt;50 years ago, and with few new drugs in development they will be central to AAT control for the foreseeable future. ISM resistance is reported increasingly widely, raising serious concerns about sustainability of current control methods.  There is very little understanding of resistance mechanisms or the dynamics of resistance emergence &amp; spread in AAT, despite this being a major issue in such an important livestock disease. This interdisciplinary project aims to address both of these major knowledge gaps, using integrated laboratory, field and modelling approaches, focussing on ISM and building upon the applicants&apos; previous work in all of these fields.  The applicants have a significant biobank and extensive data on AAT epidemiology in Serengeti District, Tanzania, where trypanosome challenge is high. Farmers have begun to report ISM treatment failures, prompting increased concentration/frequency of ISM use, indicative of emerging resistance. The applicants have also generated laboratory platforms to enable the analysis of drug resistance in the AAT-relevant trypanosome species Trypanosoma congolense (Tc).   Our overarching hypothesis is that management of animal trypanosomiasis in Tanzania is threatened by an emerging failure of ISM to provide adequate prophylaxis. Within this, there are 4 main research questions: (i) What are the likely mechanisms by which resistance occurs and can a marker be developed? (ii) What is the extent and causes of ISM failure in the field? (iii) What are the epidemiological consequences of ISM failure and resistance? (iv) How might resistance to trypanocides, including novel trypanocides, be prevented?  To address this, we will integrate field data and laboratory data using the clinically relevant species Tc to enable a data-led modelling approach to characterise resistance emergence and spread in Tc and AAT, and apply this model to predict epidemiology of resistance to a novel trypanocide in development by the industrial partner (GALVmed). This will be done through addressing the following objectives:  1. Identify ISM resistance mechanisms &amp; markers through comparative biochemical, molecular and genomic analyses using laboratory and field strains of Tb and Tc  2. Collect targeted field data to enable (i) quantification of trypanocide usage and clinical effectiveness; (ii) isolation of susceptible and resistant Tc; (iii) generation of epidemiological parameters for resistant and susceptible Tc  3. Investigate resistance spread &amp; dynamics by integrating field and experimental data on epidemiology and transmission of resistant and susceptible Tc in dynamic epidemiological models  4. Apply findings to new drugs for veterinary trypanosomiasis.  This project will provide an unprecedented insight into drug resistance emergence in trypanosomes in the field, identification of ISM resistance mechanisms, assessment of how resistance dynamics relate to farmer practices and ecological risk factors, and application of the developed framework to predict resistance emergence and spread in a novel trypanocide. This project has real potential to drive strategies for more sustainable development and use of trypanocides, and therefore significantly improve animal health and food security. The establishment of such an integrated approach and its outputs, particularly on drivers of resistance emergence and ecology, will have wider relevance to livestock pathogens, including in the UK.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Drug resistance is an increasing problem for many diseases worldwide. Trypanosomes are tsetse-fly transmitted single-celled organisms that cause serious disease in cattle - African Animal Trypanosomiasis (AAT), mainly in sub-Saharan Africa, where approximately 60 million cattle are at risk and AAT kills 3 million each year. The main measure farmers have to combat AAT is drug treatment, but we only have two main drugs, both of which are &gt;50 years old and widely used. Resistance to these drugs is increasingly reported, and there are very few drugs in the development pipeline, meaning the current control methods have very doubtful sustainability.  Despite being such a significant issue, we know very little about how trypanosomes resist the effect of the drug, and how AAT drug resistance emerges and spreads. Therefore we are limited in our ability to deploy informed strategies to mitigate the problem.   This project aims to generate data and resources to bridge these knowledge gaps. The applicants have been working in an area in Northern Tanzania since 2011. Recently farmers have been reporting drug treatment failure and the need to use increasing amounts of the prophylactic drug Isometamidium chloride (ISM) more frequently, suggesting emerging resistance.We already have samples from 5,000 cattle and 10,000 tsetse flies, as well as information on farmer drug use, from a cohort of farms in the area sampled between 2011 and 2017. Additionally, we have developed resources and capabilities for working on the relevant trypanosome species, Trypanosoma congolense, in the laboratory (most information derives from the human-infective Trypanosoma brucei, but it is increasingly apparent that these are very distinct organisms). This platform of preliminary data and resources will be used to answer our central hypothesis, that the management of animal trypanosomiasis in Tanzania is threatened by an emerging failure of ISM to provide adequate prophylaxis.   To test this hypothesis, we will address four main research questions: (i) what are the likely mechanisms by which resistance to ISM occurs and can we identify a marker?; (ii) what are the extent and cause of ISM failure?; (iii) what are the epidemiological consequences of ISM failure?; and (iv) how might resistance to trypanocides, including new drugs, be prevented? To achieve this we will: (1) identify ISM resistance mechanisms by generating resistant parasites in the laboratory and comparing resistant and susceptible parasites using biochemical, molecular and genomic analysis; (2) collect field data in the same area in order to assess drug use and drug quality, isolate drug resistant parasites, and assess the epidemiology of drug use and drug resistance in the field; (3) using data combined from the laboratory and the field, generate a mathematical model whose parameters are informed by both the laboratory and field data, allowing us to accurately assess how resistance emerges and spreads in AAT in the field; and (4) apply the model and predict scenarios that will inform on the selection and spread of resistance for a new trypanocidal compound in development by our industrial partners, GALVmed.   The outputs of this project would provide unprecedented and detailed insight into the epidemiology of AAT drug resistance, uncover mechanisms of drug resistance in the disease-relevant trypanosome species (including potential markers), and will develop the first application of mathematical modelling, importantly using accurate parameters, to provide insights into the dynamics of AAT drug resistance emergence and spread. As well as providing novel insights, the outputs have the potential to inform drug development and drug usage, by identifying strategies that will have the best chances of mitigating resistance, and therefore maximising the lifetime of both existing and novel drugs.</narrative>
