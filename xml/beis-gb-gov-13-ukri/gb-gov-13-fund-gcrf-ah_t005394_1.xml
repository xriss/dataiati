  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Development Award project &quot;Creating Safer Space&quot; aims to build and consolidate equitable partnerships of knowledge generation and dissemination between and among researchers and practitioners specialising in Unarmed Civilian Protection (UCP) work in two world regions-Latin America and Southeast Asia. This is with a view to contribute to the enhancement and expansion of local unarmed civilian protection practices for/with civilians in conflict regions.  To work towards this aim, it pursues five main objectives: 1. Building and/or consolidating UCP partner networks: The project activities will expand and deepen the networks between UK researchers and academic and non-academic partners in Colombia, Mexico, Myanmar and the Philippines, as well as among these partners, in order to build the trust and mechanisms necessary for equitable research and impact work relationships and to ensure that research is needs-based with regard to both UCP practitioners and beneficiary communities. (Activity strand A) 2. Scoping the state-of-the-art of knowledge on UCP: Building on existing efforts, the project will undertake comprehensive reviews of existing knowledge on UCP in the four LMIC countries as well as on a global scale-taking into account academic and grey literatures as well as other sources of information/knowledge (including photography, film, art and craft objects) and ways of knowing (e.g. indigenous knowledges and cosmologies)-to gauge knowledge synergies and gaps and as a basis for future research and practitioner analyses. (Activity strand B) 3. Enhancing capacities and procedures for responsible UCP: The project will undertake activities aimed at developing procedures and training materials for safe, ethical and inclusive research among vulnerable populations and in situations where UCP takes place (among violence-affected communities, in situations of forced displacement). Where need is identified, these activities will involve the development of procedures of due diligence and research capacity building in the four LMICs. (Activity strand C) 4. Creating communication channels for South-South learning: Based on existing efforts, the project will lay the groundwork for a digital platform that enables collaboration and exchange between and among UCP researchers and practitioners across different technological, linguistic and cultural contexts in the UK and LMIC partner countries.(Activity strand D) 5. Facilitating future UCP advocacy and impact: In order to facilitate future pathways to impact for researchers and practitioners in the field of UCP in each of the partner countries, the project will undertake a context-sensitive stakeholder mapping as basis for future stakeholder engagement. (Activity strand E)</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Development Award project &quot;Creating Safer Space&quot; works towards the vision of enhancing unarmed civilian protection practices, which create safer space for communities amidst violent conflict and help prevent displacement. According to United Nations Refugee Agency, there are now a record high of 68.5 million people forcibly displaced by violent conflict (UNHCR, 2019), and the majority of deaths in conflicts are among civilians, not armed actors. This makes the protection of civilians from physical harm in contexts of war a pressing issue of our time. While the international community has acknowledged the need for protection, the physical safety of civilians is still seen almost exclusively as a task of armed outside actors like UN blue helmets.  The originality of this project is its focus on protection provided by unarmed civilian actors and deployed at the local level of communities, be it by &quot;outside&quot; specialists, &quot;insider/local&quot; protection actors or the conflict-affected communities themselves. Specifically, the project supports the building and consolidation of equitable partnerships in the field of unarmed civilian protection (UCP) between researchers in the UK and researchers and practitioners in four Low and Middle Income countries (LMIC) in Latin America and Southeast Asia, which have witnessed long-term and/or large-scale violence and displacement of different types and have been home to a variety of local protection initiatives: Colombia, Mexico, Myanmar, and the Philippines.  The project&apos;s activities concentrate on five core objectives: (1) building and consolidating UCP partner networks that work equitably to enhance UCP work and knowledge; (2) scoping existing knowledge on UCP, including academic, non-academic and other sources (such as film, art or craft) and ways of knowing (such as indigenous knowledges and cosmologies); (3) enhancing research capacity and procedures by developing online training materials that enhance UK and partner country researchers&apos; capacity to conduct safe, ethical and inclusive research; (4) creating communication channels for South-South learning by building a digital platfom that works across technological, lingusitic and cultural divides and enables a transnational sharing of experiences, and (5) facilitating advocacy and impact through stakeholder mapping.  Through these activities the project will leave a sustainable legacy by putting in place partnerships, capacities and procedures for equitable research and impact which are of benefit to partners in their UCP work and also lay the foundations for future collaboration between UK and/or LMIC colleagues and organisations in the field of UCP. Taken together, these activities will work towards increasing the number of people benefiting from civilian protection worldwide.</narrative>
