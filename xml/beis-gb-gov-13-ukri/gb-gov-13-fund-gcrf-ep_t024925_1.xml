   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Realising the potential of bioresources to mitigate development challenges in Ethiopia, a centre of wild and domesticated plant diversity</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Our overarching strategic objective is to enhance the inherent resilience of rural communities in the Ethiopian highlands to combinations environmental, social and economic stressors. To achieve this, we aim to realise the potential of Ethiopian bioresources underpinned by biodiversity conservation to contribute to cross-cutting development challenges in Ethiopia and beyond.   Objective 1: Develop and deliver a map of Important Plant Areas for the Ethiopian Highlands. Important Plant Areas are locations of natural vegetation with a high proportion of endemic, threatened and/or socio-economically important species and habitats. These represent the highest priority for conservation and option values for future bioresource development. Concurrently, we aim to develop a working definition for Important Areas for Indigenous Agricultural Diversity.  Objective 2: Identify under-utilised crop and wild harvested plants with the potential to underpin novel pro poor value chains that enhance lives and livelihoods and demonstrate the national value of conserving Important Plant Areas. By developing three case studies (provisionally; enset, yams and noog), we will illustrate the nutritional, public health and economic benefits derived from indigenous crops. Using Kew&apos;s taxonomic expertise, we aim to predict the full potential of Ethiopia&apos;s indigenous diversity beyond our subset of case studies, for example wild-harvested resources, potential future domestication of underutilised species or bioprospecting for novel economic products.  Objective 3: Assess the local benefits of Important Plant Areas through surveying the perceived and realised ecosystem service and socio-economic consequences for communities living within or adjacent to them. In the context severe food insecurity, the short-term benefits of designating Important Plant Areas must be demonstrated, with trade-offs critically evaluated.  Objective 4: Explore the role that IPAs can play in addressing broader local and regional sustainable development challenges. IPAs have the potential to contribute to broader aspects of human security and wellbeing, offering the chances not only to enhance agriculture but also to tackle issues of environmental degradation, reduce exposure to hazards such as landslides, strengthen water security in the face of climatic change and reduce pressures that force people to migration and displacement. This role needs to be evaluated critically, with recognition of the barriers as well as enablers to such benefits, and of the socially-differentiated trade-offs that conservation management may entail for some social groups across Ethiopia.   Objective 5: Develop effective best practices for how a developing country can benefit economically from sharing its plant genetic resource through South-South collaboration, to scale up efforts to tackle global development challenges  In Stage 1, we will demonstrate progress towards these objectives and measure success based on; (1) Establishment of an Ethiopian led working group on IPAs; (2) Identification of Western Ethiopian IPAs based on a subset of threatened plant species and habitats;  (3) A conceptual framework for integration of Important Areas of Indigenous Agricultural Diversity; (4) Preliminary documentation of indigenous knowledge uses associated with Ethiopian endemic plants and a case study on nutritional profiling of variation in enset;  (5) Identification of candidate species for economic and value-chain development across the three case studies. (6) Identification of a suite of community study sites with varying proximity to initial candidate IPAs, with ranking of priority ecosystem services and baseline perception surveys; (7) Identification of key interactions (actual and potential) between the establishment and management of IPAs and broader development challenges in the areas surrounding them.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This Challenge Cluster aims to enable Ethiopia to realise the potential of its abundant and unique plant diversity to address global challenges in food security, health and nutrition, poverty and displacement. To this end, it will conduct research and capacity-building to identify and manage areas of high plant diversity, develop value chains around currently underutilised plants, and critically evaluate the roles that plant diversity can play in addressing development challenges.  Ethiopia faces multiple interacting development challenges linked to environmental change and degradation, of which food insecurity is central. Over 85% of the population depends upon rainfed agriculture, which is highly vulnerable to climatic, social and political shocks, as demonstrated by severe famine in recent decades. From a population of &gt;108 million, a third of have insufficient food to eat and a quarter live below the national poverty line. Malnutrition is causing stunting and other health problems, impacting the lives of millions of individuals. Food insecurity is also contributing to political and resource-based conflict and human displacement that affects over 2 million Ethiopians. Climate change will exacerbate these problems by reducing agricultural productivity through increased drought and heat stress, creating an urgent need to identify and develop crop varieties adapted to the new conditions.  As a hotspot for plant diversity (both wild plants and domesticated crops), Ethiopia harbours biological resources that could play important roles in solving these challenges. For example, current research within the Cluster is uncovering varieties of enset (the principal starch staple for 20 million Ethiopians) with high content of essential micronutrients zinc and iron that can potentially help to address chronic malnutrition. Further crop varieties possessing resilience to climatic stressors and other valuable traits are almost certainly waiting to be discovered by science. Likewise, wild plant diversity likely contains genetic resources that can be used in crop improvement and to develop value chains that create economic opportunities for poor rural communities.  The opportunity to apply Ethiopia&apos;s indigenous plant diversity to address development challenges is rapidly diminishing, however, as wild and domesticated plant diversity is lost to the conversion and degradation of natural habitats and the homogenisation of agricultural landscapes. Research is urgently needed to identify and manage the most important remaining hotspots of Ethiopian plant diversity, and the Ethiopian government has invited Kew to support Ethiopian scientists in this effort.  Building upon a 30+ year history of successful UK-Ethiopia collaboration, the goal of this Cluster is to realise the potential of Ethiopia&apos;s plant diversity to address poverty, food insecurity and climate change vulnerability. Toward this goal, we aim to achieve the following objectives:  Objective 1: Identify and map hotspots of Ethiopian wild and domesticated plant diversity and provide recommendations to the Government of Ethiopia for the designation and management of these areas. Objective 2: Identify and characterise bioresources with valuable traits to enable the development of value chains around currently underutilised plants in a way that benefits the poorest sectors of society. Objective 3: Evaluate the actual and perceived socio-economic impacts of areas of high wild and domesticated plant diversity to inform sustainable and equitable management of these areas. Objective 4: Critically evaluate the role that areas of high wild and domesticated plant diversity and associated plant-product value chains play in addressing broader local and regional development challenges. Objective 5: Enhance the capacity of Ethiopian and UK-based researchers to conduct research and associated activities that support the conservation and sustainable use of Ethiopian plant diversity.</narrative>
