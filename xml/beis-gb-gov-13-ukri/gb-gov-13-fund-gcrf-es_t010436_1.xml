   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Determinants of health in rural Nepal: Utilising PHASE Nepal data to investigate social inequalities in health and healthcare amongst under-5s</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The overall objective of the project is to rigorously examine the determinants of health inequalities amongst young children in rural Nepal. This will produce new academic knowledge, but can also play an important role in developing policy and practice responses to the continuing problems of health inequality in rural communities.  More specifically, the funding will enable us to achieve our objectives in the following areas:  1. Academic knowledge and resources (See also &apos;Academic Beneficiaries&apos;: 1.1 To create new academic knowledge on the relationship between various forms of inequality (gender; caste/ethnicity; geography) and i) nutrition status (a major determinant of health); ii) utilisation of healthcare services; and iii) treatment received. 1.2 To generate an important new dataset of circa 50,000 individual patient-level records drawn from 25 health centres over the last 5 years. This dataset (to be made available through UK Data Services) will enable the research team as well as other researchers to pursue further research questions that are not possible with the currently-available (aggregated) Government of Nepal data.  2. Practice recommendations: 2.1 The data analysis will generate new findings on the diagnosis of malnutrition by health workers (specifically, whether the recognition of malnutrition is affected by age, gender, ethnicity/caste and geography) which could lead to the development of new practice guidelines to reduce such disparities and improve healthcare practices. 2.2 The data analysis will generate new findings on prescribing practices - particularly in relation to antibiotic prescribing - which could again lead to new practice guidelines for health centre staff around a key contemporary healthcare issue (both globally and within Nepal). As described in the Pathways to Impact document, these findings and resultant recommendations will be shared with health centre staff through an intensive training session, and with other health system stakeholders (including the Ministry of Health and Population, other (I)NGOs, and international donors) through a dissemination event to be held in Kathmandu at the conclusion of the project, along with an associated policy and practice brief.  3. Future data collection practices: 3.1 As part of the analysis, data management experts from the University of Sheffield will work with PHASE Nepal colleagues to consider the limitations of the data currently being collected and to develop ways to address those limitations through modifying data collection protocols going forward.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project aims to increase academic understanding, and develop appropriate options for responding to, inequalities in health and healthcare amongst under-5 children in remote rural areas of Nepal. These continuing inequalities represent a significant challenge for Nepal&apos;s efforts to promote social and economic development and meet the SDG targets. Whilst it is widely known that a variety of social and geographic factors contribute to determining health outcomes (including gender, caste/ethnicity and region), the currently available data lacks the degree of granularity to enable a robust exploration of the relationships between these various forms of inequality and i) health status; ii) utilisation of health services; and iii) quality/appropriateness of treatment received.   Whilst the existing data published by the Government of Nepal is available only in an aggregated format, PHASE Nepal - a high-profile and highly-respected NGO that supports government health facilities in some of the most remote areas of the country - has circa 50,000 records of health facility visits by under-5s that have not previously been analysed as they currently exist only in paper format. The project proposed here will allow, for the first time, for the digitisation and rigorous analysis of this individual patient-level data to further understand inequalities and to address a series of Research Questions related to the country&apos;s social and geographic inequalities:  RQ1: How do geography, age, gender, ethnicity and caste affect the nutrition status of under-5 children presenting in remote health facilities of Nepal? RQ2: Is diagnosis and treatment for malnutrition affected by geography, and child&apos;s age, gender, ethnicity and caste?  RQ3: How do geography, and child&apos;s age, gender, ethnicity and caste affect health-seeking behaviours and utilisation of health services? RQ4: How do geography, and child&apos;s age, gender, ethnicity and caste affect the treatment that under-5s receive at health centres?  The project builds upon a strong existing relationship between the University of Sheffield and PHASE Nepal. A previous collaboration, funded by IAA funds, allowed for the delivery of research methods training for PHASE Nepal staff and a preliminary analysis of PHASE&apos;s data assets and data management strategies. The project proposed here - which brings together social scientists and public health experts to understand health inequalities in their social context, and to develop policy and practice recommendations - was co-designed by PHASE Nepal staff members Dr. Pohl and Dr. Baidya and the Sheffield-based members of the team, ensuring that the research will be valuable to and actionable by PHASE Nepal themselves, as well as being of value to other health system stakeholders (not least Nepal&apos;s Ministry of Health and Population) and to a wider community of academic researchers.</narrative>
