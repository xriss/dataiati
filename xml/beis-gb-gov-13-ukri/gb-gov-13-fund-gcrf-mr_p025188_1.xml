   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs) have emerged as the most important global threat to human health and wellbeing. Four major NCDs - heart disease, cancers, diabetes, respiratory diseases - cause the deaths of 38 million people every year, of whom 16 million die prematurely (under the age of 70 years). These diseases cause chronic illness and disability and are a source of suffering and financial hardship for individuals, families, communities and health systems struggling to provide continuous care for people with long-term health problems. The NCDs affect populations across the globe - and they are now the leading cause of death in many low and middle income countries.  Many of these diseases are driven by exposure to commercial products - tobacco, alcohol, highly processed foods (including the so-called &apos;junk foods&apos;) which have high levels of salt, sugar and/or trans-fats. Evidence shows that limiting exposure to these products is likely to bring health benefits, but it is often very difficult for individuals to sustain &apos;healthy behaviours&apos; over their lifetime. Evidence-informed prevention strategies most likely to bring benefit to the largest numbers of people include: regulating exposure, e.g. taxation on products known to be health-reducing, such as sugary drinks; restricting access, e.g. no sales of tobacco to children, non-smoking zones in public spaces; or reformulating products to make them less likely to cause harm, e.g. lowering the salt content of processed foods. Such strategies, when implemented well, can have a significant impact on improving population health.  However, Governments face many challenges in implementing these policies - for example, there may be resistance from strong and powerful commercial companies that have a vested interest in selling their products. Moreover, in many countries, there is little policy experience in tackling the NCDs.  In this project we propose to undertake detailed policy analyses to identify acceptable and feasible options for Governments in both low- and middle-income countries to tackle the growing burden of NCDs in their countries. Our work will focus on three policy areas - control of sugar, salt and trans-fats in processed foods. We will work with researchers in Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Iran, Nepal, Pakistan, Tunisia and Vietnam to identify how the Government in each country is currently tackling NCDs. We will then map out the influences on policy options operating in each country. Such influences are likely to include the role of powerful stakeholders such as the food producing and selling industries, the media, the medical establishment, the Ministry of trade, etc. We will also identify whether any civil society groups (in some countries this might mean, for example, groups of parents concerned about junk-food marketing to children; in other countries it will include groups of patients suffering from diet-related NCDs such as diabetes) are working on policy issues. We will conduct interviews with key stakeholders to better understand the opportunities for seeing effective policy implemented for controlling sugar, salt and/or trans-fats, as well as identifying the challenges and barriers to putting effective policy options into operation.  This kind of health analysis requires a specific skill set which is not common in many countries. As part of our project we will therefore establish and strengthen the capacity of a network of researchers from all 8 countries (including the UK), who will support each other to carry out the analyses and interpret the findings. We will foster cross-learning of policy successes between different countries. In addition, we will promote engagement and dialogue with a wide variety of stakeholders in each country throughout the lifetime of the project in order to ensure that the findings of the research carry meaning and weight in policy decisions to improve population health both in the 7 research countries and beyond.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The overall aim of our proposal is to develop a network of health policy researchers who will undertake analysis of the policy environment and options for governance of selected commercial determinants of Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs) in their countries, so as enable members to contribute to planning, legislation, implementation and evaluation of tailored policies which aim tackle NCDs with a focus on reducing sugar, salt and trans-fat consumption. The network will include researchers from Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Iran, Nepal, Pakistan, Tunisia, United Kingdom and Vietnam.  The specific goals are: 1. To develop a network in South Asia, West Asia and North Africa of health policy analysts and strengthen capacity to understand and influence legislation, planning and implementation of NCD-related governance and regulation policies 2. To understand the political and economic climate of participating countries in relation to NCD drivers;  3. To map in each of the seven countries the current policy landscape (existence of policy, levels of implementation) for NCD control, to identify policy gaps and challenges for effective control and identify positive examples of policy formulation and/or implementation (or of other pro-equity population health policies adopted);              4. To identify and map key decision-makers and decision-influencers (key stakeholders) in agenda-setting and policy formulation as they affect the control of NCD risks and explore the facilitators of and challenges to the getting the issue on the agenda and in the adoption of a sound national plan for prevention and control of NCDs, with focus on sugar, trans-fats and salt. This will include an exploration of the current levels of knowledge/understanding regarding NCD drivers and the extent to which policy formulation takes values, particularly equity and fairness, and evidence, particularly of the intersectional distribution of risk and burden of NCDs, explicitly into account;  5. To assess the acceptability, feasibility and palatability of governance and regulation options (focused on salt, sugar and trans-fats) for NCD control; and 6. To build tailored transferrable lessons across participating countries to strengthen capacity to advocate for evidence-informed NCD policies.</narrative>
