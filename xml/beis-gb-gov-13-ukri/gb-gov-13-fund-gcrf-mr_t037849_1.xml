   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Multimorbidity in Africa - Increasing Understanding of the Patient Experience and Epidemiology (MAfricaEE)</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Multimorbidity, the presence of 2 or more long-term conditions (LTCs), is an increasing global health challenge. Multimorbidity is increasingly common among younger and middle-aged as well as older people and is associated with adverse effects on health outcomes. Although multimorbidity is increasingly common in low and middle-income countries (LMICs),  we have insufficient information on patterns, trends or determinants of multimorbidity in LMICs.  Such information is crucial to inform health and social service planning across different LMIC health care systems.   Equally important is the call by the Academy of Medical Sciences to undertake research that includes &quot;studies of the experiences and preferences of patients with different types of multimorbidity&quot; in LMICs.  Living with multiple LTCs is hard work and requires people to assume an increasing workload of self-management, something referred to as &apos;Treatment Burden.&apos;  Treatment burden refers to the work that people and their wider support network have to undertake.  It covers a variety of activities ranging from: a) the work done to gain an understanding of conditions; b) the effort needed to navigate health and social care systems; c) the work of operationalising self-management such as attending appointments and taking medicines; and d) undertaking self-monitoring activities, such as checking blood sugars.  The concept of treatment burden in those with multimorbidity is yet to be investigated in Sub Saharan Africa (SSA).    People can vary in their capacity to cope with any given level of treatment burden depending on a range of factors such as socioeconomic status, health literacy, language, level of educational attainment, location, personal beliefs and physical and mental abilities. As well as personal or individual resources, it is important to consider the role of the persons&apos; wider social support network as well as healthcare organisations and health policy. Gaining an understanding of these concepts in a SSA context and enhancing understanding of the challenges faced by patients and practitioners would inform development of interventions to improve management of multimorbidity.  Treatment burden and capacity issues are important as overwhelmed patients are less likely to adhere to therapies, resulting in wasted resources and poor outcomes. This proposal addresses important evidence gaps in multimorbidity research in SSA.  Our project will involve 3 work-packages (WPs) and use data sources from 3 African nations (Malawi, Gambia and Uganda). The work represents a collaboration led by the University of Glasgow, which has particular expertise in multimorbidity research, using both data science and qualitative methods, along with partners in Malawi, the MRC Units in Gambia and Uganda and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine  Our project will address the following questions:  1. What is the prevalence and pattern of multimorbidity across different datasets in Malawi, Uganda and Gambia?  2. What is the cross-sectional relationship between demographic and lifestyle factors with prevalence and pattern of multimorbidity in Malawi, Uganda and Gambia? 3. What are the key similarities and differences in the observed findings across the 3 countries?  4. What are patients&apos; experiences of the effects of multimorbidity on the work of self-management and their capacity to cope with self-management demands?  5. What are healthcare professionals&apos; experiences of treating and managing patients with multimorbidity in each country and what do they see as the main barriers to optimal care provision? 6. What are the key targets for future research?   While this work is primarily exploratory, it will promote development of a new collaboration looking at multimorbidity in SSA and serve to highlight data gaps and opportunities that the team plans to address in future funding applications.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This proposal aims to address key evidence gaps in multimorbidity research in LMICs, that have been identified by the Academy of Medical Sciences, namely to enhance our understanding of &quot;disease clustering in defined populations/patient groups&quot; and &quot;the experiences and preferences of patients with different types of multimorbidity&quot;.  Our proposed project will involve 3 work-packages (WPs) and use data sources from 3 African nations, Gambia, Uganda and Malawi.  These three countries are on the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) list of &quot;least developed countries.&quot;  The work represents a collaboration led by the University of Glasgow (UoG), which has particular expertise in multimorbidity research, using both data science and qualitative methods, along with partners in Malawi, the MRC Units in Gambia and Uganda and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.  Aims The planned collaboration aims to build mixed methods research capacity in multimorbidity in Africa and the UK with the following objectives:   1. To explore available data sets in Malawi, Gambia and Uganda to identify and compare the prevalence and patterns of multimorbidity, including both physical and mental health conditions.   2. To use qualitative methods to explore the lived experiences of multimorbidity, with a particular focus on the concept of Treatment Burden.    3. To build institutional mixed methods research capacity, preparing a new generation of investigators in the partner institutions with an enhanced understanding of Multimorbidity and its implications in different contexts  4. To convene a forum of investigators from Malawi, Uganda, Gambia and the UK along with key stakeholders to share experiences of multimorbidity research, opportunities and key challenges.  The project will promote mixed methods collaborative work in the sphere of multimorbidity in Sub Saharan Africa (SSA) that will underpin future research into the patient experience, the design of health and social care systems, the epidemiology and economics of multimorbidity in SSA as well as underpinning mechanistic work.</narrative>
