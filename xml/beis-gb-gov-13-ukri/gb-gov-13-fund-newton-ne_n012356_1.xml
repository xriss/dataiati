   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Our overall aim is to build earthquake resilience in China by improving (a) the assessment of seismic hazard and risk from earthquakes and consequent events and (b) the communication and use of probabilistic information in the development of more proportionate and risk-based strategies for disaster risk reduction.  We will build on and extend a recently-developed historical catalogue for earthquakes, extend it for the first time to include consequent events (landslides, debris/mud-flows, outburst floods), unify this new database with modern instrumental data, use state-of the art statistical techniques to quantify the associated uncertainties, and incorporate social science-based understanding of risk communication and governance to improve policy development and implementation.  The work programme will be carried out in Si-chuan (including the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake) and Yun-nan provinces. While they are both tectonically active, and mountainous, and thus vulnerable not only to earthquakes but also to consequent hazards of earthquake-triggered landslides and flooding, Si-chuan is one of the wealthiest provinces in China, while Yun-nan is one of poorest. These differences in wealth, combined with the recency of the  devastating 2008 Wenchuan in Si-chuan compared to the more attenuated memory of the 1996 Lijiang earthquake in Yun-nan, make for a natural experiment in which to test the efficacy of improved probabilistic assessment of risk and associated uncertainty to people and property by earthquakes, and consequent event hazards, in supporting more risk-based approaches to disaster reduction.  This project will promote long-term sustainable growth in earthquake prone regions of China by improving both the assessment of earthquake hazard and consequent event risk and the communication, understanding, and use of the resulting probabilistic forecasts for disaster risk reduction by policymakers and local publics. It addresses several specific capacity gaps identified in successive Chinese national disaster risk reduction strategies. As well as engaging with policymakers at both the national and local levels to improve the effectiveness of emergency planning and building code regulation, we will also engage directly with local publics to enhance public understanding of risk and capacity to deal with it. In so doing, the project will also fulfil the UK&apos;s Official Development Assistance (ODA) commitment to promoting &quot;the economic development and welfare of developing countries&quot; by drawing on UK&apos;s science base to address a key vulnerability differentially affecting the very poorest in China.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The overarching aims of this project are to improve seismic hazard forecasting, risk mitigation and preparedness (theme three of the call) and to improve the communication and use of that risk information (theme 4).   In so doing we  will achieve the following more specific objectives and outcomes:  1. An extended and improved database of historical earthquakes for the case study regions  2. A new catalogue of consequent events in the historical record for the case study regions  3. Fully-calibrated catalogues of earthquake source seismic moment and physical parameters for consequent events, accounting for all sources of uncertainty  4. Improved ground motion prediction equations - accounting for finite source size and topography  5. Improved methodologies and decision-support tools that combine physical, statistical and expert-based approaches, taking account of the local cultural context, to quantify multi-hazards and risks in a more accurate and accessible way  6. Better understanding of the reasons for reluctance to use probabilistic information in building resilience, particularly in handling uncertainty  7. Improved methods for communicating time-independent and time-dependent hazard and risk  8. Specific policy advice based on engaging with relevant communities of practice, including handling uncertainty</narrative>
