   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Wallacea region, lying between the Borneo to the west and Papau New Guinea to the east, is one of the world&apos;s biodiversity hotspots, hosting incredibly high levels of biodiversity, much of which is unique to the region. This exceptional level of biodiversity and endemism reflects evolutionary diversification and radiation over millions of years in one of the world&apos;s most geologically complex and active regions. The region&apos;s exceptional biodiversity, however, is threatened by climate change, direct exploitation and habitat destruction and fragmentation from land use change. Continued habitat loss and fragmentation is expected to precipitate population declines, increase extinction rates, and could also lead to &apos;reverse speciation&apos; where disturbance pushes recently diverged species together, leading to increased hybridisation, genetic homogenisation, and species&apos; collapse. Already, approximately 1,300 Indonesian species have been listed as at risk of extinction, but the vast majority of the region&apos;s biodiversity has not been assessed and we lack basic information on the distribution and diversification of many groups, let alone understanding of what processes drove their diversification, how they will respond to future environmental change, and how to minimize species&apos; extinctions and losses of genetic diversity while balancing future sustainable development needs.  In response to the need for conservation and management strategies to minimize the loss of Wallacea&apos;s unique biodiversity under future environmental change and future development scenarios, we will develop ForeWall, a genetically explicit individual-based model of the origin and future of the region&apos;s biodiversity. ForeWall will integrate state-of-the-art eco-evolutionary modelling with new and existing ecological and evolutionary data for terrestrial and aquatic taxa including mammals, reptiles, amphibians, freshwater fish, snails, damselflies and soil microbes, to deliver fresh understanding of the processes responsible for the generation, diversification, and persistence of Wallacea&apos;s endemic biodiversity. After testing and calibrating ForeWall against empirical data, we will forecast biodiversity dynamics across a suite of taxa under multiple environmental change and economic development scenarios. We will develop a set of alternative plausible biodiversity management/mitigation options to assess the effectiveness of these for preserving ecological and evolutionary patterns and processes across the region, allowing for policy-makers to minimise biodiversity losses during sustainable development. Our project will thus not only provide novel understanding of how geological and evolutionary processes have interacted to generate this biodiversity hotspot, but also provide policy- and decision-makers with tools and evidence to help preserve it.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="We aim to develop the capacity of ecologists and Indonesian conservation, wildlife, forestry, and tourism groups to effectively manage and conserve Wallacea&apos;s unique biodiversity, via co-development of models of the historical, contemporary, and future drivers of Wallacea&apos;s unique biota. To achieve this aim we will: A) discover the drivers of Wallacea&apos;s patterns of biodiversity and endemism, B) forecast, develop, and evaluate strategies for preservation of Wallacea&apos;s unique biota, and C) Foster international training, collaboration, and knowledge exchange.  A)  To discover the drivers of Wallacea&apos;s patterns of biodiversity and endemism, we will:  i) Develop ForeWall, a spatially realistic simulation platform for modelling the geological, ecological and evolutionary processes contributing to diversification and extinction across the region. This platform will here be developed for simulating ecological and evolutionary processes. ii) Compile existing ecological and phylogenetic data for eukaryotic organisms and generate novel molecular genetic data and spatial data for insects and soil microbes, to quantify spatial and ecological patterns of biodiversity. iii) Gain understanding of the unique drivers of biodiversity across Sulawesi. Simulate eukaryotic and prokaryotic diversificaton dynamics across the region under alternative geological and biological models using ForeWall. Compare the derived patterns ecological and evolutionary patterns from iii to infer the geological history for the region and ecological and evolutionary processes for each taxon.  B) As a result of Wallacea&apos;s high beta-diversity, we anticipate that conservation of spatial evolutionary processes are important for preserving species&apos; integrity, particularly at contact zones, to prevent local extinctions and homogenisation of Wallacea&apos;s biota. To forecast and preserve Wallacea&apos;s unique biota, we will:  iv) Use biologically-validated ForeWall model paramaterisations to forecast future biodiversity dynamics under alternative projections for climate and land use futures.  v) Establish a working group for co-development of future biodiversity scenarios across Sulawesi. This group will involve UK and Indonesian academics, and governmental and non-governmental organisations from forestry, tourism, and conservation sectors, to promote realistic and achievable management plans.  The group will work together to assess the efficacy of plausible management options under alternative environmental changes.  vi) Co-ordinate workshops with other researchers working on biodiversity within the region (especially projects funded under this call) to extend the range of biodiversity and ecosystem data integrated into ForeWall projections.  C) The Newton Fund UK-Indonesian partnership scheme is an ideal forum to foster knowledge exchange and training. To build capacity and exchange between Indonesia and UK research groups we will:  vii) Hold stakeholder meetings in Indonesia to train local conservation groups in the use of spatial conservation and management modelling approaches.  viii) Develop academic collaborations with researchers and students at Sam Ratulangi University and LIPI.  ix) Publish our outputs in major international journals for our capstone papers to appear in top general science journals such as Nature or Science.  x) Produce a special issue for the Indonesian Society of Biologists&apos; journal, HAYATI J Biosci. BJ (Indonesian PI) is chief editor of this journal. An international contribution on a globally important topic will help to rapidly the profile and standing of Indonesian research/ers, and will facilitate uptake of our results locally.  xi) Train two PDRAs in cutting, in-demand research methods and impact activities.  xii) Disseminate our methods and findings at a series of international conferences and workshops aimed at both academic and non-academic audiences."></capital-spend>
