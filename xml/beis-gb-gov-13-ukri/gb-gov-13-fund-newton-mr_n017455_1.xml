   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Dengue vector Aedes aegypti: Microbiota and the Chemical Ecology of Oviposition sites</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Dengue is the most important arbovirus; there are an estimated 2.5 billion people in over 100 countries living at risk of infection. There are an estimated 100 million new cases of the disease each year, and 20 000 deaths. In Brazil, annually, there are more than 800,000 cases and over 200 deaths. There are a number of different vectors of Dengue, but in Brazil, the virus is largely transmitted by the Aedes aegypti mosquito. Aedes aegypti is commonly found in urban areas, where it has adapted superbly well and is able to reproduce in a wide range of man-made containers,  such as tyres, cups, tin cans and plant pots. Controlling vector mosquitoes is a key way of limiting the transmission of vector-borne diseases such as Dengue, and to do this it is important to have accurate data on the distribution and dispersal activity levels of the mosquito species in different environments, and to understand the factors which influence the reproductive success of the species. All animals pick up micro-organisms from their environment. It is well known that mosquitoes acquire their microbiota from plants as well as larval breeding sites. This microbiota is not only important to the mosquito physiology (e.g., bacteria provide nutrients to the insect) but it also affects how the mosquito responds to pathogens (becoming more susceptible or resistant to the infection). Micro-organisms can be particularly important for mosquitoes, because they are filter feeders as larvae and the make-up of the micro-organisms in their breeding water has a significant effect on the quality of food  the larvae have access to. Thus, the microbial make-up of the water in which the females lay their eggs is ultimately crucial to their survival. Here we will study how the microbiome environment influences mosquito breeding capacity and how we can manipulate these associations to provide novel means of controlling this vector of deadly diseases such as dengue, yellow fever, chikungunya and zika.  In addition, analysis of the micro-organisms picked up by individual mosquitoes can indicate where it has been. In this study, we aim to use the identity of micro-organisms found on individual mosquitoes to track their movement through the environment. Knowing how far a mosquito moves can be critical for modelling/predicting the range and rate of spread of a vector borne disease. Finally, if we can identify the odours that draw a female to an egg-laying site, we can synthesize the odour and use it as a bait for trapping systems to monitor mosquito populations, or to kill females whilst they attempt to locate egg-laying sites. These control tools could  contribute to an integrated control strategy for the vector, combining traps for the adult females with other measures aimed at controlling the immature stages to reduce populations of vectors, and thus the spread of diseases. Dengue is imposing a heavy burden on both global health and economics. A better understanding of the transmission of Dengue by Ae. aegypti can contribute to reducing the incidence of a disease that takes a heavy toll in densely populated, often poor urban environments.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This proposal will evaluate the influence of the microbiota on biological and ecological aspects of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. The major objectives of this are twofold: firstly to establish knowledge concerning the spatial distribution and movement patterns of Ae. aegypti to better understand the relationships between the vector, the host and breeding sites; and secondly to establish a bio-rational pathway to design novel mosquito control methods through a better understanding of the role of volatile products released by favoured egg laying sites in the control of oviposition behaviour of this species. Specifically, we will compare the mosquito breeding site microbiome with the internal adult mosquito microbiota; analyse the microbial volatiles in artificial containers which appear to either stimulate or repel Ae. aegypti oviposition; evaluate whether the addition of microorganisms by ovipositing females to containers affects offspring fitness; evaluate how well microbiota carried by individual mosquitoes reflects their previous movement in the urban environment, and investigate how the   the position of oviposition sites might influence female choice. Odour collections from oviposition sites will be used to develop a blend that attracts gravid Aedes mosquitoes in semi-field and field conditions, which could potentially be used to enhance the efficacy of new traps or repellents. Key data that will be produced from the project are: i. A description of the microbial volatiles from artificial containers which stimulate or repel Ae. aegypti oviposition, in relationship to the type of container, and a better understanding of the microbial ecology of the containers. ii. Data concerning the breeding site microbiome and how it relates to the adult mosquito&apos;smicrobiota. iii. An assessment  of the putative introduction of microorganisms by ovipositing females to containers to enhance offspring fitness iv. Data  on how microbiota carried by individual mosquitoes reflects their previous movement in the urban environment, to be realized in the form of a descriptive collection of the environmental sources of insect microbiome and collections of adult mosquitoes, which will then be compared with the environmental references. v. Data concerning how the spatial arrangement and availability of egg-laying sites influences their selection by egg-laying females, in both field and semi-field conditions. vi. A set of odour collections from oviposition sites.  vii. A blend of odours from (vi) which is attractive to gravid Aedes mosquitoes, tested in laboratory, semi-field and field conditions.  viii. A series of communications with stake holders to improve stakeholder knowledge of mosquito movement patterns and workshops concerning gravid traps for reducing vector populations  ix. For each work package to have successfully submitted at least one peer reviewed article before the completion of the project. x. For data from the project to have been presented at a minimum of two international scientific meetings before the completion of the project. xi. For the results of the project to have led to at least one subsequent grant application for further development of the work before the completion of the project.</narrative>
