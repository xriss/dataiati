   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project will extend the impact of a current project funded by MRC/CONFAP. Key objectives of that project include (1) evaluation of a novel integrated health and social care intervention for older people in Belo Horizonte (BH), Brazil: Programa Maior Cuidado (PMC). (2) feasibility study for a similar intervention in the city of Fortaleza (FZ) (to demonstrate potential policy transfer). (3) close engagement with local/national stakeholders. These objectives are ahead of schedule and we did not anticipate the speed or degree of policy-maker uptake of our initial research. Based on our evaluation, BH municipality has committed to extend and modify PMC. FZ funded a feasibility study, completed in June 2019 and the State of Cear&#xE1; (which includes FZ) have provided about &#xA3;2million for related intervention, to be developed and evaluated in partnership with us. Other municipalities have requested our support for similar interventions. The Federal Ministry of Health (FMoH) now sees PMC as a model of good practice and is working with us to extend its implementation. This has created new impact opportunities, some of which require further funding. Activities specific to FZ and Cear&#xE1; will be funded by the Brazilian government. We are seeking NFIS funds for: (1) Monitoring and evaluation of the extension and reform of PMC in BH. This will provide additional evidence of our influence. It permits a baseline in the new districts, which will add robustness to our evaluations. (2) We have selected one new municipality (Contagem), to pilot a new model for supporting PMC-type interventions. It will entail less direct interaction with the core project team and will support the development of an online knowledge hub. This hub will later serve as a resource for other interested municipalities. (3) Additional collaboration with FMoH to disseminate good practice. (4) Further international engagement: using the Brazilian experience as a reference point for other countries.
