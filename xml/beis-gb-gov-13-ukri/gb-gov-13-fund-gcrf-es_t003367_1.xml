   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Islands of innovation in protracted crises: a new approach to building equitable resilience from below</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Protracted humanitarian crises are common, especially in borderland regions where the reach of the central state is limited. In such settings, local initiative and skills are combined to generate innovative adaptive responses through multiple shocks.   The key objective of the proposed research is to problematise the social learning processes of individual and community forms of resilience in relation to equity and how these &apos;islands of innovation&apos; provide the basis for broader structural transformation. This will be done through studying various communities that have successively experienced conflict, natural disasters and epidemics in C&#xF4;te d&apos;Ivoire and the Democratic Republic of Congo.  Studying these bottom-up approaches will provide an entry point to discuss synergies and tensions between individual and collective forms of resilience in humanitarian situations and the &apos;Leave No One Behind&apos; agenda behind the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), in particular the goals around Poverty, Health, Gender, Inequalities, Climate, and Peace.  One of our assumptions is that new forms of collective forms of resilience are being reconfigured as a result of these multiple shocks through socio-political dynamics and storytelling (i.e. from the customary and spiritual story tellers to music artists). The project has four sub-objectives:  - Contribute to debates on equitable resilience by looking at the interactions between collective and individual forms of resilience;   - Build the capacity of researchers to capture these bottom-up processes, which requires cross-disciplinary approaches;  - Provide a new interdisciplinary methodology relying on social sciences, arts and humanities to enable those survivors to express and empower their individual and community voices through diaries, focus group discussions, interviews, oral history and story-telling (customary and non-customary forms) and share these repertoires of resilient stories and strategies.  - Develop a new approach to humanitarian responses to protracted crises through local voices and long-term social learning and provide a platform for bottom-up resilience-building processes across disaster risk reduction and climate change, epidemics and peacebuilding.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">There are a number of countries which have been suffering from multiple humanitarian disasters, ranging from civil wars, floods and volcanoes and epidemics such as Ebola. The epicentre of these disasters, usually borderland remote regions, have struggled to meet the global development goals and targets, showing that the international community and the governments of these countries are not finding adequate solutions to deal with these protracted crises. The solution therefore may reside with the affected population and individuals themselves. Studying these bottom-up approaches will provide an entry point to discuss synergies and tensions between individual and collective forms of resilience in humanitarian situations and the &apos;Leave No One Behind&apos; agenda behind the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), in particular the goals around Poverty, Health, Gender, Inequalities, Climate, and Peace.  The two countries we are examining, C&#xF4;te d&apos;Ivoire and the Democratic Republic of Congo, have had tumultuous histories since the end of the 20th century. Our first case study is the western region of C&#xF4;te d&apos;Ivoire at the border with Liberia. This region has been the epicentre of violence during the civil war between 2000 and 2010. The war has created many forced displacement and humanitarian issues around food and health security. The region was also exposed to the threat of the Ebola virus via the Liberian border, although the virus was contained. A major flood, in 2018, also affected the whole country and agricultural production. Finally, climate change prediction around rising temperatures could seriously disrupt the region with its reliance on cocoa production.   Our second case study is the north Kivu region in the DRC. Decades of fighting have ravaged the economy of north Kivu, with the latest humanitarian catastrophe a toxic mix of renewed conflict and a major Ebola epidemic. Conflict in the Kivu has its origins in the Rwanda genocide and the breakdown of the authoritarian state created by Mobutu. Well-organised elites both inside and outside the country manipulate the conflict for economic gain (such as illegal mineral extraction) and political gain (especially around major elections). Despite one of the world&apos;s largest UN peacekeeping forces, dozens of large-scale militia forces act with impunity across the region. The region is also home to a volcano, Nyamuragira, which has had multiple eruptions (2002, 2010, 2011 and 2014) creating important damages in terms of local livelihoods. Over the medium-term, climate change has already affected the choice of staple crops for peasant farmers, and has affected the choices of large-scale plantation owners, often with negative consequences for their dependants.   Yet despite these challenges, communities in both regions find innovative ways to manage economically and socially, forced to adapt against a backdrop of constant change and insecurity. Learning how survivors organise to recover from major shocks, crisis and stressors, and how aid actors can best support these efforts, is therefore a central question to address one of the greatest global challenges of our time. Sharing this knowledge could help build resilience more widely but needs to be done through media and methods that resonate. Often this is about those who have experienced such adaptations telling stories; and about identifying with the storyteller or the common experience.   Our methodology will combine approaches from anthropology, history, political economy, participatory research and story-telling. Our interdisciplinary, international team will bring together social science, arts and humanities researchers with diverse thematic and regional experience essential to the project.</narrative>
