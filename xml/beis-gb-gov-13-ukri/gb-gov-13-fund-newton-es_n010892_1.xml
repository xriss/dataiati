  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The core objectives of &apos;Mental Health, Migration and the Chinese Mega-City&apos; are to produce new insights on:  (1) How mental disorder is patterned in cities like Shanghai, and especially how that pattern is affected by recent dynamics of migration; (2) The absorption of rural migrants in Shanghai, and the establishment of new forms of community, and patterns of daily life, especially as these play out in densely-packed edges of contemporary Shanghai; (3) Governance mechanisms that intersect with the experience mental disorder in the city, and policies or services aimed at reducing the burden of mental health among rural migrants in Shanghai; (4) The implementation of new mental health legislation and related community services, to the extent that these can be leveraged to reduce that burden. (5) How the Shanghai experience can inform mental health policy interventions in mega-cities elsewhere in the world, especially in relation to their growing slum and migrant populations.    The objectives of the project thus significantly advance two key aspects of the ESRC Newton call:  (1) Migration and public services: This project makes a major contribution to this theme by investigating one of the most historically-robust, and yet still little-understood issues affecting densely-populated migrant communities in cities, the effect on mental health specifically. This research focuses on two key issues. First: understanding the experience of mental ill health within the social life of the migrant city, and the current resources available to alleviate mental ill health or support those individuals and families afflicted by mental health problems.  Second: identifying China-specific governance strategies and reforms - involving both formal and informal mechanisms, and state and non-state provision, which can form potential points of intervention for improving mental health among migrant populations in Shanghai.   (2) Inequalities and everyday life: Urban inequalities are intrinsically linked to the distribution of mental health problems in urban settings, and in particular to the forms of everyday life that characterize those who live in precarious situations. Via its ethnography the project will be the first to perform a close-up, street-level analysis of the lived inequalities of everyday migrant life in Shanghai, and the consequences for mental health and mental life more generally.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">We have known, since at least the early twentieth century, that there is an association between living in a city and being diagnosed with a mental illness. But questions around the specificity of relationship between urban life and have continued well into the twenty-first century. We still don&apos;t know, for example, exactly why mental illness clusters in cities; we don&apos;t know how it relates to experiences of urban poverty, deprivation, overcrowding, social exclusion, and racism; and we don&apos;t know the precise biological and sociological mechanisms that turn difficult urban lives into diagnosable mental health conditions. What we *do* know is that migrants into cities bear a disproportionately large share of the burden of urban mental illness; we know that dense living conditions seem to exacerbate the problem; and we know that the general stress, tumult and precarity of urban living can, sometimes, create the basis for the development of clinical problems.  If there are unanswered questions around the relationship between mental health and the city, these questions are particularly acute in contemporary China: China has urbanised at an unprecedented rate in the last decade, and has now become a majority urban society. But whereas in nineteenth-century Europe urbanization came from a growth in population, in twenty-first century China the situation is different: most of the growth is from rural migrants coming into the cities. In China, then, the link between urban transformation and mental illness is a critical issue: (1) Development in China is related to migration from the countryside into the cities; (2) Unrecognized and untreated mental disorder is a key factor in casting individuals and families into poverty and social exclusion; (3) Effective development of urban mental health policu requires far greater understanding of the related problems of urban stress, precarious living conditions and mental disorder  This project is an attempt to understand the relationship between migration and mental health in one Chinese mega-city: Shanghai. Given what we know about the relationship between urban mental health and particular patterns of social life (poverty, migration, dense housing, and so on), it starts from the position that this question requires new input from the social sciences. At the heart of the project is an attempt to mix what we know about mental health in contemporary Shanghai with a new kind of close-up, street-level data on what the daily experience of being a migrant on Shanghai is actually life - especially with regard to stress, housing, and access to services. We will then connect these two forms of knowledge to produce a new kind of survey for getting a new sociological deep surveying instrument for mapping migrant mental health in Shanghai.     The project, which is split between researchers in the UK and China, asks: (1) How is mental disorder actually patterned in Shanghai, and how is that pattern affected by recent migration? (2) How are immigrants absorbed in Shanghai, and what is daily life actually like in Shanghai&apos;s migrant communities? (3) What policies, services, or laws might alleviate mental health among migrants in Shanghai? (4) What can be learned in Shanghai for similar problems in other developing mega-cities (such as Sao Paolo or Lagos).   This project should also us to also produce new data on two of the major research-areas that are prioritised under this join UK-China research-scheme: &apos;Migration and public services,&apos; where we will look at the relationship between the welfare system and migration, and analyse the services that currently help to alleviate this problem, as well as migrants&apos; access to those services; (2) &apos;Inequalities and everyday life,&apos; where we will develop a close-up, street-level analysis of the lived inequalities of everyday migrant life in Shanghai, and try to understand how urban inequality might contribute to the development of mental health problems?</narrative>
