   <narrative xml:lang="EN">On World Teachers&apos; Day 2014, the heads of UNESCO/ ILO/ UNICEF/ UNDP and Education International affirmed that &quot;an education system is only as good as its teachers&quot; [1]. A 2015 UNESCO report [2] on the relationship between the teaching profession and Art. 26 of the UN&apos;s Universal Declaration of Human Rights [3], the right to education, reported that teachers often lack the resources and training to give the high standard of teaching required for good learning outcomes. Uzbekistan, a lower-middle income country, has insufficient resources for the education sector to fully capitalise on learner and teacher development, with knock-on effects on its economic workforce.  A working knowledge of English is an important facet of a professional education. However, a 2010 OSCE report [4] found that only 1% of students, teachers, professors and public servants in Uzbekistan used English in their professional lives or read articles in English, a finding potentially explained by low levels of English proficiency. Thus, providing a program to improve English formal reading and writing abilities will bring benefits to Uzbek students, language teachers, and, via a trickledown effect, the country as a whole. This will give students the skills to successfully study online/abroad bringing back valuable knowledge to benefit the country, give teachers access to international professional journals to improve their teaching and share their own practices and research, and allow Uzbek citizens to more effectively communicate with the rest of the world.  My PhD research focused on the development of formal reading and writing skills of non-native English speaking students. Also, I have been a teacher of formal English in Uzbekistan for 4 years and in the UK for 6 years, and have seen how certain skills and practices could be beneficially transposed from the UK to the Uzbek context. My goal is to create two inter-related educational tools, which aim to initiate and perpetuate high-quality teaching and learning of formal English in Uzbekistan via a bottom-up approach. The tools will be based on my PhD findings and teaching experience that 1) exposure to formal writing styles in English and the use of model essays with extensive feedback, and 2) training teachers on navigating English language knowledge networks and engendering sensitivity to and knowledge of English formal writing styles, are both beneficial to language learners&apos; outcomes.  My first aim is to create an interactive model essay website (package 1) containing a corpus of formal student writing in English from the Uzbek context, via my close links with the Uzbekistan Teachers of English Association (UzTEA). The texts will be sorted thematically, digitised, reviewed and annotated with extensive feedback on issues such as text organisation, appropriacy of language, etc. These will interactively allow students and teachers to notice and attempt to correct errors and provide detailed feedback on the correction they choose. The materials will be a valuable pedagogical tool.  The second aim is a self-perpetuating workshop on improving formal reading and writing skills (package 2). The 3-day workshop package, in a modular format, will provide instruction to English teachers on aspects of teaching formal reading and writing felt lacking in the Uzbek context. Development of the workshop package will be based on my PhD findings and a brief needs analysis in the form of an online questionnaire. The materials will be constructed via a co-production process, in Uzbekistan, with teachers from varying educational sectors. The workshop package will be implemented by effectively running it with a group of teachers and will thereby also serve as a model for those teachers of how to run the workshop. All resources will be made available online. Attendees will be encouraged to run a similar workshop in their home institutions, thus, initiating a domino effect that can will cascade through the country.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="The main objectives of my proposed fellowship are:  (1) The ambitious and ultimate aim of this project is to improve levels of formal English reading and writing of professionals in Uzbekistan, into the future, so that the country becomes better able to contribute to and benefit from English-medium professional/technical/academic texts.  (2) On a personal level, this project will act as a springboard to allow me to establish a strong track record as a researcher by providing me with the opportunity to improve the ways in which Uzbekistan, my home country, can communicate with the English speaking world. Furthermore, the project will allow me to communicate my previous doctoral work through presentations at international conferences and the submissions of peer reviewed journal articles.  (3) An interactive model essay website is planned which aims to turn a key finding of my PhD from theoretical proposition into a working pedagogical tool which can be used to raise standards of formal English reading and writing in Uzbekistan. I define formal English loosely as the varieties of English used as a lingua franca for communication in international professional and academic circles. The promotion of this website, through various channels, will ensure that it has a lasting impact on its intended audience.  (4) A workshop on formal English reading and writing aims to build capacity in the teaching profession in Uzbekistan. The workshop will be co-created with a small selective group of active Uzbek teachers of English, and will use a bottom-up methodology, i.e., disseminating directly to teachers. Furthermore, the workshop is designed to be self-perpetuating, in the sense that the initial workshop serves to train attendees how to pass on their new knowledge to teachers in their home institutions, to ensure that the impact of the project lasts well beyond its finishing date.  (5) I aim to undertake specific training on online data collection and analysis to better me to carry out this project. Although I have a sufficient support network to help with this task already in place I want to take the opportunity this fellowship brings to learn the skills for myself.  (6) I aim to present the work undertaken in this project at academic (AAAL 2018) and professional (IATEFL 2018) conferences to allow academic and non-academic audiences to benefit from my experience and, potentially, open up fresh avenues to impact in other socio-cultural contexts. In addition, I will participate in events with other researchers in a similar position at my doctoral training centre and through the ESRC to share my experiences and learn from theirs.  (7) I will aim to work closely with the Uzbekistan Teachers of English Association (UzTEA), a professional body who will act as in-country facilitators to this project, both from the UK and during my visit to Uzbekistan. This will be done in order to build and strengthen links between Lancaster University (which has a strong international reputation in second language learning and teaching research) and Uzbek teachers of English."></capital-spend>
