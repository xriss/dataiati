   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Almost half of all children who are out of school live in conflict affected countries (at least 27 million children in 24 countries). Children in these countries are twice as likely to die before their fifth birthday and countries with conflict have some of the largest inequalities between girls and boys and the lowest literacy levels in the world. Good quality education can protect children from violence and provide life-saving messages concerning health and safety, as well as the knowledge, skills and attitudes to survive, recover and rebuild their society after conflict. Yet, education is often given a low priority in situations of conflict. We know that modern conflicts can last more than 20 years and often involve multiple armed groups competing for control of government institutions [such as schools], natural resources and territory. This also means that provision of education can be highly politicised in situations of conflict and this can prevent much needed assistance reaching those who need it most - it is usually the poorest or most marginalised who suffer the worst consequences of violent conflict. Education is usually considered &apos;a good thing&apos;, but we know that in certain circumstances education may actually be &apos;part of the problem&apos; as well as &apos;part of the solution&apos;. For example, unequal access to education and distribution of education resources may fuel grievances between groups in society, particularly if they are already in conflict. Exclusion of minority voices from decision-making will cause resentment. Insensitive or politically biased education policies in terms of the language of instruction or content of the curriculum may create mistrust between different ethnic, religious or cultural groups by fuelling stereotypes, xenophobia and other antagonisms.        We therefore need to better understand the underlying political, economic and social reasons why some forms of education may make conflict worse. This is known as Political Economy Analysis (PEA) and is highly relevant to the provision of education in conflict affected countries. However, there are problems with current approaches. There is a reliance on international consultants to undertake &apos;one-off&apos; assessments that lack sensitivity to local history, politics, culture and knowledge of power-relations that are better conveyed in local languages. There is also a tendency to ignore the impact that international agencies have on national policy and practices and the different political circumstances that operate in different parts of a country. There is often a reluctance to raise critical questions about education provision because they are too sensitive or may challenge vested interests. These severely limit the potential of analysis to improve the planning and development of socially just education systems.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Objectives The PEER Network aims to develop a critical and locally grounded approach to Political Economy Analysis (PEA) of Education that will help national, regional and global level policymakers and practitioners make socially just decisions about investments in education that benefit children in contexts of conflict and crisis.   For the Development Award, our overall aim is to undertake preparatory tasks for the submission of a Full Proposal by 19 September 2019 and, if successful, early inception activities to enable the PEER Network to be up and running by April 2020.   The main objectives to be achieved during this development period (1 July 2019- 30 June 2020) are to: - Revise outline proposal based on feedback from GCRF and submit full proposal - Consult existing networks and for advice and lessons learned that will help us with early establishment and functioning of the PEER Network. - Identify and clarify purpose of additional partnerships for network and via hubs - Plan for capacity development, review tools, documents, plan workshops - Identify Early Career Researchers in this field and their involvement in Network</narrative>
