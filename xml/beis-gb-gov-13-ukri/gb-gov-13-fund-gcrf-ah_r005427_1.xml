  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Our main aim is to address slavery as an urgent development challenge in sub-Saharan Africa, by pioneering a participatory approach to knowledge partnership that uses arts and humanities methods to address the following Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) targets: 8.7 (&quot;Take immediate and effective measures to... end modern slavery and human trafficking&quot;), 5.2 (&quot;Eliminate all forms of violence against all women and girls... including trafficking and sexual and other types of exploitation&quot;) and 16.2 (&quot;End abuse, exploitation, trafficking and all forms of violence against and torture of children&quot;). To achieve this, we have 5 key objectives: 1. Deliver co-designed work with local communities that helps to enable sustainable development, free from slavery. Projects will provide usable research, skills, and engagement tools. They will harness participatory engagement strategies and build antislavery resilience. By enabling knowledge partnering for contemporary antislavery, we aim to measure an increase in the number of at-risk people whose participation in creative, cultural and heritage-based programming has built antislavery resilience by increasing rights awareness, developing leadership skills and accessing new networks. 2. Produce high quality interdisciplinary research that generates a solid evidential base for the debates over the role of the arts and humanities in addressing development challenges. The network will deliver a programme of research that supports bottom-up sustainable development without the denial of human rights. We aim to evidence the value of arts-based initiatives to changing the socio-economic contexts that make people vulnerable to slavery, increase research capabilities for arts and humanities contributions to development, and advance the debate over the role of cultural activities in development work by offering creative grassroots alternatives to campaigning approaches.  3. Engage and connect actors and organisations across the area of focus with UK-based slavery researchers. Our pilots bring together three leading research centres in the UK and partners in three West and Central African countries. The hub and spoke model, complemented by our commissioning strategy and database, will develop new relationships that combine research and antislavery action. Our strategy for commissioning is informed by our pilots&apos; lessons and prioritises a flexible, responsive agenda. This will generate a diverse range of commissioned projects. We will share strategies to maximise effective knowledge-partnering and network-building, and foster new partnership models between universities and civil society. 4. Drive conceptual change through the transformative power of the arts and humanities. The arts and humanities have the power to create lasting legacies by engaging with diverse audiences through education, training, and creative leadership. We aim to use the transformative power of collaborative projects rooted in the arts and humanities to foster processes of communication and mutual learning, and to develop creative ways of responding to development challenges. We aim to measure, as a result, changes in the way that most development agencies and NGOs think about impact, to include levels of community resilience as a result of creative and cultural programmes. 5. Secure legacies that are sustainable beyond the funding period. We will create institutional structures through capacity-building with our partner organisations, scholar exchanges, and network-building. We will commission projects with evidence of co-design, knowledge exchange, and impact pathways. They will establish baselines and indicators for assessment, develop educational applications, and engage with other network partners. The combined evidence base of the pilot and commissioned projects will generate new arts and humanities development projects-beyond the funding period-that draw from our methods, theories and examples.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Antislavery Knowledge Network offers the first extended effort to address slavery as a core development challenge in sub-Saharan Africa via innovative approaches from the arts and humanities that deliver community-engaged antislavery work. Focusing on the idea of &quot;activated community memory,&quot; we champion the innovative use of heritage as a resource for social change. The network aims to demonstrate that participatory arts-based strategies, rooted in heritage, can empower Global South communities to play a central role in tackling contemporary slavery. The Global Slavery Index estimates that there are 46 million slaves worldwide today. The UN&apos;s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) include the target of ending slavery by 2030 and African states have recognised slavery as a key challenge to their economic and social development. An estimated 6.2 million people are enslaved in sub-Saharan Africa and slavery&apos;s ongoing presence impacts negatively on many SDG targets for Africa, include those relating to health, education, equality, decent work, and sustainable communities. This is a region experiencing rapid change, where demands for enhanced infrastructure stretch political and economic resources; rapid population growth and urbanisation threaten heritage; and unplanned development fails to address persistent patterns of poverty and deprivation that are strongly gendered. But development and antislavery policies aimed at African states have too often ignored the complex historical backdrop of slavery in the region and failed to foster community antislavery strategies that draw on heritage and memory. Slavery and antislavery interventions sit at an intersection of politically sensitive issues around history, sovereignty, citizenship, religion, mobility, and economic governance. As the Chief of UNESCO&apos;s History and Memory for Dialogue Section put it in 2015, the historical slave trade&apos;s &quot;tenacious poison... paved the way for new forms of slavery that continue to affect millions.&quot;  Humanities-based research can provide innovative ways to navigate and address these intersecting issues through a focus on historical power dynamics and marginalised voices, and by partnering with artists, arts organisations and museums to invigorate development.  Our community-based, regional focus harnesses this power of the arts and humanities to provide an alternative to the top-down focus of international legal agreements, trade and diplomacy, and intergovernmental initiatives. We build on &quot;asset-based&quot; and participatory approaches to development that recognize the transformative potential of existing cultural resources and heritage, and the value of co-designed and co-delivered work. We therefore move beyond the dominant paradigm of externally-designed interventions based on international rankings or standardised methods. Our approach tries to advance SDG target 8.7 (ending slavery) by strengthening antislavery strategies that re-set the relationship between development initiatives and local communities. We will launch the network with an initial programme of three pilots in African countries shaped by historical slavery that are also sites of contemporary enslavement: Ghana, Sierra Leone and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. All three pilots will develop models for what works in different national and local contexts, via different methods of in-country partner collaboration. They will therefore lay the groundwork for a structured commissioning phase inviting new projects, of varying sizes and around three themes, that develop our core interest in establishing the value of the arts and humanities to challenging slavery. The commissioned projects will continue pioneering new participatory approaches to knowledge partnership that use arts and humanities methods. Together, the pilot and commissioned projects connect the long history of slavery,antislavery&apos;s unfinished work, and the symbols of heritage to current antislavery challenges.</narrative>
