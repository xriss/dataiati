  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Alcohol consumption (&apos;drinking&apos;) is a major cause of disease globally, and is the leading cause of preventable deaths in people aged 15-49 years old. It impacts negatively on the economy as well as drinkers and those around them, through lost days of work, violence, relationship breakdown and road traffic accidents, as well as placing a major burden on health services. Drinking is increasing in low and middle income countries (LMICs) causing harms there to rise. Drinking is not simply a matter of individual choice, as people&apos;s choices are shaped by how available, affordable and attractive alcohol is in each community and country. Alcohol companies can increase drinking by making alcohol widely available to buy, opposing government taxation to keep prices low, and designing and promoting brands that are attractive to current and future drinkers.  Research has shown that enforcing controls on where, when and by whom alcohol can be bought, increasing alcohol taxes and controlling alcohol advertising are measures likely to work to reduce harms. These measures are supported by the World Health Organization (WHO) although studies are lacking in LMICs, and they need government action and political support to be implemented. They are typically opposed by large alcohol companies. In Brazil and Peru, there are few controls on alcohol, those that do exist are not well-enforced, and there are high levels of alcohol-related harms. Charities, health organizations and others sometimes successfully work together in &apos;advocacy coalitions&apos; to strengthen controls on alcohol, but have not yet done so in Brazil and Peru. In both countries, new policymakers have recently said that they are concerned about alcohol related harms and interested in introducing greater controls. This creates an opportunity to strengthen alcohol policies to reduce harms and our study will build on this opportunity.  Our aim is (1) to understand how policymakers and charities/health organizations in Peru and Brazil view alcohol consumption, harms and possible regulations, what concerns them, what action they would support, and how interested they are in working with others to improve alcohol control policies. We will do this through analysing 60 interviews, split between countries and different &apos;stakeholder&apos; types i.e. policymakers and charities/health representatives. We also wish find out (2) what alcohol statistics and other data are available in each country to help policymaker decisions, how those data could be improved, and whether they could be used to find out the impact of any policy changes. We will do this by checking national statistics providers, speaking with stakeholders in both countries and international researchers.  Our team consists of six experienced researchers who have an excellent range of knowledge relevant to this bid from different academic areas (policy studies, public health, psychology, epidemiology, sociology, health economics), two of whom are based in Peru/Brazil and will lead the research there. We will be supported by a study advisory panel made up of academics, a senior WHO advisor, other health organizations and policymakers from Latin America, and researchers from the USA and South Africa, with expertise in alcohol policy as well as the study of policy changes and health systems more generally. We will recruit fulltime researchers for the study in both Peru and Brazil and offer them multiple opportunities to learn about alcohol policy research, how to use research to influence policy, and working with the media.  We will work closely with stakeholders from the start of the study and throughout to give them an opportunity to be involved in shaping (1) our interview questions and (2) our data assessment, so that they are helpful to local policy and advocacy; (3) to share our findings and find out what they think of them, and (4) to plan next steps for policy development, advocacy, and research in each country and regionally.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">OVERVIEW: Alcohol consumption is a major and increasing cause of preventable death and disease in low and middle income countries (LMICs), where the activities of alcohol producers and retailers are largely unregulated. Evidence-based measures to address the availability, affordability and promotion of alcohol have been little tested in LMICs, require political support for enactment and implementation, and are opposed by industry actors. Advocacy coalitions, typically including concerned charities and health bodies, can successfully influence policy, but there are no strong alcohol advocacy coalitions in Peru or Brazil to date. Alcohol consumption and harms data that could underpin advocacy and policy has been little explored and used. Recently empowered politicians are interested in greater alcohol regulation giving rise to an opportunity for policy progress that this research seeks to accelerate.  WE AIM TO ADVANCE UNDERSTANDING OF ALCOHOL POLICY SYSTEMS IN PERU AND BRAZIL BY: 1. Generating new evidence on political and civil society values, beliefs and interests in relation to alcohol problems and policy solutions 2. Co-developing context-specific options for progression of alcohol policies or their implementation 3. Assessment of suitability/availability of data to inform, model or evaluate such policy changes.  TO ACHIEVE THIS, OUR OBJECTIVES ARE: A. To ENGAGE EFFECTIVELY WITH POLICY AND CIVIL SOCIETY ACTORS, via two stakeholder events in each country and informal liaison throughout the study: the initial event will ensure that the research is sensitive to the context and stakeholder priorities and interests. B. To establish a MULTI-SECTORAL STUDY ADVISORY GROUP with representation from policy, civil society and research to ensure that the findings have wider regional and international impact and relevance. C. To CONDUCT IN-DEPTH INTERVIEWS with 60 policy/civil society actors split between country to establish their beliefs and values on alcohol consumption, harms, evidence needs, experience of advocacy/lobbying and their interest in and views on potential policy options to reduce harms. D. To conduct inductive FRAMEWORK-BASED ANALYSIS of interview data, theoretically informed by the Advocacy Coalition Framework to generate new evidence on common/contrasting framing, beliefs and values within and between countries, shared priorities, areas of consensus and challenges regarding policy progress. E. To IDENTIFY AVAILABLE DATA ON ALCOHOL consumption and harms by reviewing national surveillance systems and related publications, consultation with national policy and academic stakeholders, and liaison with colleagues responsible for relevant international datasets. F. To ASSESS AVAILABLE DATA for quality, representativeness, storage, ease of access, longevity, stability, frequency of collection, and attribution, and report on the suitability and best available data for future studies. G. To BUILD CAPACITY for theoretically informed, alcohol policy systems research by recruiting two full-time researchers in Peru and Brazil, and engaging them in impact, media and alcohol evidence in practice training, co-authorship of papers, and international dissemination. H. To CO-CREATE FURTHER TIMELY, CONTEXT-SPECIFIC RESEARCH STUDIES to meet stakeholder needs, bringing in local and regional researchers and partner organizations, where possible drawing on identified data sources. I. To ENGAGE STAKEHOLDERS ON THE FINDINGS of the interview and data studies via the second stakeholder event, and seek consensus and commitment on next steps for data, research, policy and advocacy to reduce alcohol-related harms nationally and regionally, including coalition building where feasible/appropriate.  J. To DISSEMINATE THE FINDINGS REGIONALLY AND INTERNATIONALLY via the Pan American Health Organization, WHO head office/regional offices, ICARA (see letters), the Global Alcohol Policy Alliance, and our international advisory panel.</narrative>
