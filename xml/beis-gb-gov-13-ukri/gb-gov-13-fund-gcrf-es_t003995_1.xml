   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The developmental period from 0-4 years lays the foundations of an individual&apos;s life-course, setting the trajectory for their long-term outcomes in health, education, employment and wellbeing. Language is at the heart of this trajectory. Because &quot;skill begets skill&quot; (Heckman, 2008), addressing language difficulties at this stage brings much greater gains and economic returns than when children are older. In the Arab world policy-makers tend to focus on later remedial programmes, with much reduced chances of &apos;narrowing the gap&apos;, especially for socially disadvantaged children. Across any population ~7% of children do not reach expected levels in language development. This corresponds to ~23 million children and adolescents with language difficulties in Middle Eastern and North African countries. Whilst these difficulties are found across the social spectrum, their prevalence is higher in socially disadvantaged families, reaching up to 40% in some UK schools.  This 4-year project is a multi-disciplinary collaboration between two UK universities (Newcastle and Plymouth) and the University St Joseph (Beirut), the Jordan University of Science and Technology, and Birzeit University (West Bank), with activities covering Egypt, Jordan, the West Bank and Lebanon. It brings together a team of linguists, psychologists, speech and language therapists, paediatricians and educators to develop the necessary knowledge and tools for effective Early Years policy in Levantine countries and Egypt. Our aim is to address the lack of culturally sensitive and standardised tools to measure language development in Arabic-speaking children, as a primary indicator of healthy development and the foundation skill for education. For this, we need to show the feasibility of a multi-dialect approach, and we need to quantify the effects of social disadvantage, multilingualism and childcare mode on language development. We also need to estimate how war-related traumas impact trajectories of language development in the region. Finally, we need to raise awareness of the importance of early language skills in the public and policy makers, empower end users with tools to screen children for language delays and provision for language-centered curricula, and disseminate the expertise of local practitioners for prevention and interventions. In WP1, we adapt and standardise the Communicative Development Inventory (CDI) across all four countries. The CDI is the Gold Standard parental questionnaire to assess vocabulary and language development in infants aged 8 months to 4 years. In WP2, we focus on Lebanon, where the multiethnic and multilingual situation creates an acutely complex picture. Using the CDI as an investigation tool, we define an accurate measure of social disadvantage and examine how the diversity of childcare mode impacts language skills. We evaluate the most efficient way to account for multilingualism by comparing the Arabic CDI to the Lebanese trilingual CDI. Finally, with the CDI, the ASQ (5 developmental domains) and the SDQ (socioemotional skills), we paint a full picture of developmental trajectories in Syrian and Palestinian refugee children in settlements and camps, to circle back contextualised information to NGOs and policy makers. In WP3, we set up a key stakeholder group and co-design appropriate methods to maximise the impact of knowledge gathered from WP1 and 2. In particular we develop an app version of the standardised CDI, providing free assessment and culture-specific, parent-centred activities. We co-create a series of social media campaigns, professional training events, seminars for practitioners and policy makers. With refugee families, we promote and evaluate Early Years activities geared towards getting children ready for school and reducing dropout rates. Beyond the focus on Lebanon, we assess the exportability of these initiatives to partner countries, with the long-term goal of reaching out to the rest of the Middle East.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="The Early Years (0 to 4) are fundamental to provide children with the learning opportunities and the experiences that will shape their lives. Central to early development is the acquisition of language, which holds the key to subsequent academic success, robust socioemotional development, and enhanced life chances in terms of employment, mental health and social inclusion.   In most Arabic-speaking countries, there is a lack of appropriate tools to measure language abilities prior to the age of schooling, which would allow parents and Early Years professionals to detect any difficulty and to provide interventions. There is also very often a lack of knowledge of the existence and consequences of early language delays, or of how language development proceeds with other aspects of development, including cognitive, motor, and socio-economic development. Finally, as in any other language, Arabic language skills are expected to be impacted by socio-economic factors and multilingualism (which is the norm in some Middle East countries), and in some areas, by war-related trauma. How these effects, added to those related to varied childcare solutions, conspire to shape language development in the Middle East, is largely unknown.   This project is designed to address the major gaps in ecologically-valid measurement tools for child language development in the Arab world and to identify the social and demographic factors which hinder children from reaching their potential. We root our project in the Middle East context through a tight consultation with stakeholders from the four groups of actors of child development: parents, practitioners, policy makers and NGOs, leading to the co-creation of policy-guiding recommendations and dissemination routes for maximum impact. Our partner DAC countries are Egypt, Lebanon, Jordan and the West Bank.  Our first objective is to develop solutions for successful large-scale and affordable early-language screening in young Arabic-speaking children. To reach this objective, we will (1) establish the feasibility of a pan-Arabic, multi-dialect approach to early Arabic assessment, and determine the most accurate way to account for multilingualism; (2) adapt and standardise freely available tools that can be used by parents and Early Years professions, empowering them to detect any early signs of language delay; and (3) publicise these tools to end users along with parent-led interventions, in the four DAC countries.   Our second objective is to offer language-centred solutions to reduce the inequalities in children&apos;s early education in the Middle East. Here, through the case study of Lebanon, we aim at (1) deriving a locally-sensitive measure for socio-economic vulnerability and describing the variability of childcare provision; (2) establishing the impact of these factors on language development; and (3) improving the provision of oral language content in the curriculum of Early Childhood Education training (ECE curricula).     Our third objective is to contribute to enhancing the life chances of young Syrian and Palestinian refugees in Lebanon, two long-standing refugee communities that continue to experience serious disadvantage. To achieve this, we will (1) document language development trajectories in refugee children; (2) facilitate children&apos;s online access to the Lebanese Early Years curriculum (EY curriculum) to increase their chances to enrol in primary schools and decrease dropouts; and (3) collaborate with NGOs to promote parents&apos; involvement in their child&apos;s early education.  Our final objective is to contribute to policy changes around early childcare, health and education provision in the Middle East, grounding the importance of language development in the Early Years."></capital-spend>
