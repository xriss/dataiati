   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The COVID-19 (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2020 was passed by the Government of Mauritius in May 2020 and will be reviewed in December 2021. Landmark changes were made to the Workers&apos; Rights Act (WRA) 2019 which are impacting both domestic and migrant workers. The hardest hit are workers in tourism and hospitality, textile factories and the informal economy. Examples include reduced compensation, withholding of workers&apos;annual leave, facilitation of justified termination of workers&apos; contracts and exemption from negotiations with workers&apos; organisations (unions) by employers prior to reduction of the workforce (Appleby, 2020). Public policies are critical in providing an environment for the development of capabilities and freedom of choice. We use a capabilities approach to assess the impact of the amended WRA on workers, their opportunity set and their freedom to lead lives they value. We will collect survey data from 1200 domestic and migrant workers from Bangladesh and conduct 50 semi-structured interviews with relevant stakeholders to produce evidence-based datasets for the co-development of a policy brief and detailed report in order to inform the Government&apos;s review in December 2021.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="Aim: To assess the impact of the amended Workers&apos; Rights Act 2019 on domestic and migrant workers in Mauritius, provide in-depth analysis on how workers&apos; capabilities may be being constrained and make recommendations for policy on how workers&apos; capabilities can be enhanced  Objective 1: To generate data and datasets for public use from domestic and migrant workers on the impact of the amended WRA on their working lives, opportunity sets and wellbeing, cutting across sectors including tourism and hospitality, textile manufacturing and the informal sector   Objective 2: To use the dimensions of capabilities (commodities, capability set and functionings), alongside new quantitative and qualitative data to engage the Mauritian authorities in a discursive process to inform policy from the bottom-up  Objective 3: To promote the use of capabilities approaches to policy makers and enhance research capacity on the ground in Mauritius with a focus on and measuring and benchmarking values   Objective 4: To co-develop a strategic approach to stabilizing livelihoods and income and promote economic recovery for employment and decent work in Mauritius  Preliminary research questions  1. What are the important individual and collective capabilities of migrant and domestic workers across hospitality, textile manufacturing and the informal economy in light of (i) commodities possessed (ii) the set/extent to which people are free to lead lives they value (iii) their functionings/the life they lead?  2. Have workers&apos; capabilities changed as a result of changes to working conditions and employment protections in light of alterations to the Working Rights Act 2019 and the Covid 19 pandemic?  3. In light of Covid-19, what are the substantive freedoms people value, and have they been eroded?  4. If so, how does this play out, and what are the effects in the labour market and life course?"></capital-spend>
