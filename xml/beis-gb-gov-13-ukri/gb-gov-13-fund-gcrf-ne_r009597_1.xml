   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Ecosystems are under threat worldwide - natural habitats are being lost and the remaining areas are degraded and fragmented. Developing countries in the tropics have some of the world&apos;s highest concentrations of endemic species, but very high rates of land-use change. Climate change is already affecting tropical species, and there is particular concern about whether they will be able to shift from areas that become too hot or dry, across fragmented landscapes, to reach refuges in montane regions. If land-use change and forest degradation continue too intensively in these countries, species and ecosystem functions will be lost, leading to detrimental impacts on the livelihoods of local people dependent on these lands. Habitats across a landscape can be thought of as an &quot;ecological network&quot;, and these networks need to have sufficient habitat area, quality and connectivity to be functional. Robust ecological networks require stronger protection of existing habitat and restoration of degraded forest. Policy makers and nature conservation practitioners are increasingly thinking about biodiversity conservation at landscape scales, but continuing land-use change leads to difficult decisions about how to prioritise habitat preservation and restoration, and technologies are lacking to allow practitioners to be able to do this.  There is huge potential for landscape prioritisation to be informed by NERC-funded research. We have developed a model based on ecological understanding of range shifts, which quantifies how different elements of a habitat network contribute to long-distance connectivity. This model can also identify the best habitat to preserve, or locations to target for restoration. We have also quantified biodiversity in fragmented tropical forest habitats, and shown how land-use change affects forest species, in particular the extent to which they can persist in selectively logged forest, small forest fragments, extensive plantations and intensive plantations. This knowledge can now be used innovatively with new technologies and data, particularly remotely sensed data, to enable large-scale sustainable land-use planning for tropical developing countries under climate change.  This project will develop an online spatial decision support tool for planning robust and resilient habitat networks under climate change. Our tool will be co-created and tested with partners in Ghana, Indonesia and Malaysia, locations where landscape planning is urgently required to support the livelihoods of local communities and other stakeholders dependent on building resilient landscapes under environmental change . Our partner organisations are responsible for sustainable forest planning and biodiversity protection in their countries, balancing biodiversity and socio-economic needs of landscapes. Our partners have proposed specific case studies that exemplify the most pressing choices and alternative scenarios they face - our new tool will be applied with their existing data to highlight priorities for action. Priorities will be based on connectivity benefits for biodiversity, weighted by economic costs and stakeholder preferences.  The most tangible and long-lasting output of this project will be the freely available web interface to our tool, backed by a high-performance computing cluster in Liverpool that will perform the analyses. This interface makes the tool globally accessible, and is vital for future users in developing countries, because computing power limitations would preclude them running a desktop version. The project will also provide face-to-face training to relevant stakeholders in our partner countries, and online tutorial materials tailored to the needs of developing countries. Hence we will build capacity for our tool to be used as part of multidisciplinary projects addressing development challenges in future, to find efficient solutions where vital networks of natural habitat coexist with the needs of local stakeholders.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="Our aim is to provide decision-makers with the techniques and skills to implement sustainable land-use planning for tropical developing countries under climate change. We will do this by developing an online spatial decision support tool to help plan robust and resilient habitat networks. This tool will ultimately aid welfare and long-term sustainable development of our partners&apos; countries and other tropical DAC-list countries with similar land-use change challenges. Such a tool is urgently needed because tropical species are highly sensitive to climate change, there is rapid land-use change, and evidence-based planning is hampered by lack of infrastructure.  The specific objectives of this project are to: ~1. Create innovative, easily-used decision support methods, with three technological advances: ~~a. A flexible ability to prioritise locations for additional protection or habitat restoration, given the need for connectivity in multiple directions for tropical species. ~~b. Accounting for the way that varying habitat quality affects connectivity, using data from many studies of biodiversity in intact and degraded tropical forests, and plantations. ~~c. Adjusting priority locations according to variation in cost and stakeholder preference.  ~2. Demonstrate how conservation decisions can be supported in our partner organisations, and refine our methodology, through three collaborative case studies: ~~a. Aid protection decisions to maximise connectivity between multiple lowland and upland protected areas in Sabah, Malaysia (demonstrating prioritisation in multiple directions). ~~b. aid the prioritisation of restoration of degraded tropical forest in and around a &apos;corridor&apos; between two mountains in Java, Indonesia (demonstrating habitat quality effects). ~~c. aid decisions on the most efficient areas for conservation action in a landscape in Ghana threatened by multiple socio-economic changes (demonstrating effects of cost and stakeholder preferences).  ~3. Ensure long-term accessibility for our decision-making tool, especially for users in developing countries, by: ~~a. creating a freely available web application with design input from non-academic end-users, backed by a high-performance computing cluster in Liverpool with guaranteed maintenance beyond the end of this project. ~~b. creating online training and support materials, based on our case studies and so highly relevant to developing countries, as well as training &gt;40 end users in our partner countries."></capital-spend>
