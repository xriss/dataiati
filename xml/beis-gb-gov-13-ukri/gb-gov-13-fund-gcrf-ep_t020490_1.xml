   <narrative xml:lang="EN">1. Address current and future deficiencies in anti-leishmanial drug delivery through advanced crystal engineering and formulation techniques; 2. Optimise lead structures to afford more active analogues with better potency, selectivity and physicochemical profiles designed to enable new nanopharmaceutical formulations for  enhanced oral and cutaneous drug delivery; 3. Use supramolecular and co-crystallization approaches to access optimized solid forms and morphologies to enable single dose combination therapies to be developed; 4. Apply innovative medical anthropological and community engagement methods to identify and direct optimal drug delivery methods and formulation design for applications in endemic regions; 5. Provide scientific exchanges to enable young Indian scientists to experience new research environments and learn advanced methodologies that will enhance their future careers on an international stage; 6. Develop the pharmaceutical value chain from lead molecule to drug formulation in an international collaboration for a neglected disease.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Leishmaniasis is an important &apos;Neglected Tropical Disease&apos; caused by protozoan parasites of the genus Leishmania. There are five clinical forms which  range from localized cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) to fatal visceral leishmaniasis (VL). With over 350 million people world wide considered at risk, 12 million people currently infected and an economic cost that can be estimated in terms of 2 million DALYs the health challenge is only surpassed amongst parasitic diseases by malaria and lymphatic filariasis. Consequently, the leishmaniases have been classified by the World Health Organisation as Category I: emerging or uncontrolled diseases. In particular, the spread and severity of infection is exacerbated by its status as an important co-infection of AIDS patients and the overlap in prevalence of HIV and Leishmania species.   In India, despite considerable government effort VL is still  a major health hazard in 90  regions whilst CL, not being a notifiable disease, is a neglected &apos;neglected disease&apos;. The treatment of leishmanial infections is difficult with all forms requiring a long, painful and costly course of drug therapy. The challenge presented by these disease states is heightened by the fact that the few efficacious drugs available often exhibit serious, potentially fatal, side-effects. New medicines with better modes of delivery are therefore required.   In this UK-India collaborative project, that brings together chemistry, pharmaceutics, formulation science, parasitology and medical anthropology, we will address these challenges by developing novel active antileishmanial compounds with better modes of administration. We will use state-of-the-art crystallisation and formulation technologies to enable new oral and topical delivery methods for each compound. This key aspect will be directed by community engagement within endemic communities and local health care professionals to define what makes a drug acceptable to the affected populations. Significantly, to help overcome the potential for resistance to arise, the design of delivery devices that enable combination therapies in which two different drugs are dosed simultaneously will be undertaken.</narrative>
