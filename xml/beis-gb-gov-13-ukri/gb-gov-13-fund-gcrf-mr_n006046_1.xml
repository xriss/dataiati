   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Menstrual cups and unconditional cash transfer to reduce sexual and reproductive harm and school drop-out in adolescent schoolgirls in western Kenya</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Girls in low-income countries leave school early due to pregnancy, illness, early marriage, and lack of money for schooling and personal needs, including for menstrual hygiene management (MHM). School drop-out places girls at greater risk of sexual and reproductive health harms such as pregnancy, increased fertility, sexually transmitted infections (STIs) including HIV, and higher mortality of their children. School drop-out also reduces economic opportunity, keeping girls&apos; in poverty and thereby at risk of increased morbidity and reduced quality of life. For economic, health, and social reasons, these are government ministry priorities, and interventions are needed to keep girls in school and improve their sexual and reproductive health. The Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, with Kenyan partners including the Ministries of Education and Health (MOE/MOH), have completed a Joint Global Health Trials-funded pilot study, examining girls&apos; use of menstrual cups and sanitary pads in rural primary schools in western Kenya. Pre-intervention, girls reported using rags, bedding or paper for MHM, causing discomfort, humiliating leaks and odour, reducing ability to concentrate in school, and causing them to skip school. Girls followed up revealed pads and cups were comfortable, increased their ability to engage in class, prevented leakage, and reduced the need to have sex with boyfriends in return for money to buy pads. No health or safety issues were found. At study completion girls were checked for STIs, and school drop-out (for pregnancy, marriage or other reasons). These negative outcomes combined were halved in girls using pads or cups compared with girls in control schools. Girls using cups preferred these to pads, because pads are ten-fold more costly, cause chafing if not changed frequently, and packs have to be shared with others. Girls did not share cups for fear of infection. We now propose to conduct a large-scale trial in the same area, in secondary schoolgirls, who are older but have increased drop-out rates (over a third higher), and a higher risk of HIV, STI, and pregnancy. We will examine if cups enable girls to stay in school and reduce their sexual and reproductive harms; while cups will improve dignity, health and wellbeing, and confidence at school, they may not be sufficient to resolve all girls&apos; unmet needs, which cause them to drop-out of school. Cash transfer (CT) is an alternate but more expensive intervention, with studies showing it reduces absenteeism, drop-out, and sexual risks. In Malawi, CT reduced schoolgirls risk of HIV and human simplex virus (HSV-2; an indicator of girls&apos; sexual risk behaviour), and reduced pregnancy. Cash amounts vary by study but the researchers recommend $5(&#xA3;3.5) a month as sufficient. Our 4.5 year trial will examine if cash, cups, or cash and cups both provided, will prevent school drop-out and improve girls&apos; sexual and reproductive health. For statistical rigor we will recruit 4032 secondary schoolgirls in 56 schools, provide interventions and follow-up them for 2 school years (6 terms). We will evaluate the cost per outcome (school drop-out including for pregnancy, HIV and HSV-2) prevented for single and combined interventions. The study will provide vital information on the comparative value of each intervention, how the interventions are used, any problems encountered, and their effect on girls&apos; sexual behaviour, their wellbeing and school completion. We will seek advice from girls, schools, communities and stakeholders, working with all beneficiaries including MOE/MOH, using workshops to evaluate progress and develop materials for implementation packages. Girls clubs will be funded to encourage peer-support and advocacy. Packages will support scale-up should the trial demonstrate cost-effective outcomes. Findings will be widely disseminated to strengthen the evidence base supporting advocacy to improve the quality and equity of girls&apos; lives.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Grand Aim: Inform evidence-based policy to develop intervention programmes which improve adolescent girls&apos; health, school equity and life-chances.  1. Primary Trial Objective: To determine if menstrual cups or unconditional cash transfer alone, or in combination, provided to secondary schoolgirls, will significantly reduce a composite of deleterious outcomes (HIV, HSV-2 infection, or school drop-out) which compromise girls&apos; ability to stay in school and lead healthy lives.  2. Secondary objectives - Research:  2.1. To measure the protective efficacy of menstrual cups, cash transfer, alone and in combination, on a composite outcome of HIV, HSV-2, and school drop-out over a 2-year intervention period.  2.2. To measure the age-specific HIV, HSV-2 incidence in secondary schoolgirls and risk factors for incident HIV and HSV-2 infections.  2.3. To determine the risk, risk factors and reasons for drop-out of secondary school, examining the influence of social, epidemiological, and/or health characteristics.  2.4. To determine the cost of menstrual cup and unconditional cash transfer programmes for schoolgirls, and the cost savings of outcomes averted, for individual and combined interventions, and calculate the estimated societal impact.  2.5. To determine the safety of menstrual cups use, including risk of cup contamination over time, serious adverse events, and identify factors that increase or modify this risk.  2.6. To determine factors affecting how adolescent girls spend cash transfer money, and what training is required to support their decision making.  2.7. To determine any adverse outcomes associated with cash transfer provision, and evaluate ways to minimize this risk.  2.8. To determine the impact of the interventions on girls&apos; sexual behaviours, including age of sexual d&#xE9;but, transactional sex, number of partners, age discordance of partners, and use of contraception.  2.9. To develop local research capacity to conduct intervention studies among adolescent girls, and school-based studies, including epidemiological, clinical, social science and behaviour, and laboratory skills. 2.10. To provide trial results to the research consortia on menstrual management, as an evidence based platform to support further research.  3. Secondary Objectives - Translation of research into best practice:  3.1. To examine programme implementation implications for providing interventions in schools. 3.2. To work with beneficiaries and stakeholders to develop implementation packages, to inform and guide programme scale up. 3.3. To utilise research data to inform and support Kenya Ministry of Health and Education policy and programme activities. 3.4. To translate research findings into policy and practice, in collaboration with government officials, researchers, programme specialists, NGOs, aid agencies, donors, and international organizations. 3.5. To share research with DfID Kenya and partners to inform allied studies aiming to support school retention among adolescent girls. 3.6. To contribute research findings to the development of holistic packages to improve the quality of life of schoolgirls. 3.7. To contribute research tools and methods used towards monitoring and evaluation of school health intervention programmes, such as WASH in schools. 3.8. To use the research findings to raise the profile of adolescent girls unmet needs, at local, national and international level, to promote funding for implementation of programmes. 3.9. To utilize research methods and findings to support the newly founded research consortia on menstrual hygiene management for schoolgirls, to provide a platform for advocacy and systematic development of global policy and implementation.</narrative>
