   <narrative xml:lang="EN">A language and reading intervention programme for Chile, piloted in the Robinson Crusoe population.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Robinson Crusoe Island is a remote island situated 667km west of Chile. It forms part of the Juan Fern&#xE1;ndez archipelago in which there are three Islands but this is the only inhabited one. Access to the Robinson Crusoe Island is difficult, there is aeroplane access in the summer but in the winter there is only a monthly ship which serves the island (if possible). This means that the Islanders are very isolated, both geographically and culturally from the mainland, even though they are Chilean. The current population of the Island is approximately 800 people. The majority of these people are descendants of the families that founded the Island in the late 19th century and most people earn a living from lobster fishing. All people live in a single town and all children attend a single school. Although the school follows the curriculum of the mainland, the teachers usually come from the mainland on a 2-3 year post and so are not necessarily integrated into island culture and the teaching tools are not always modified to the Islanders and their way of life. The isolation of the island means that children have to move to the mainland at a young age if they wish to continue their studies into higher education. Travel to the mainland is also essential for medical and dental treatment meaning that children can miss a lot of school. These factors can act as a barrier to a high quality education and reflect the challenges faced by many isolated and indigenous communities through Chile and the world. The vulnerability of the Robinson Crusoe population, in terms of educational opportunities, is further increased by a high incidence of language and learning disorders, which are associated with lower educational attainment and employment opportunities. In addition, a tsunami recently struck the island wiping out existing municipal facilities including the school. Classes now take place in a shipping container with little space for individual tutoring or quiet lessons.  In the UK, studies have shown that vulnerable populations can be helped by extra lessons at school. Training in speech-sounds, letter knowledge and reading provide the best long-term educational advantages for children with language difficulties. Strong language foundations, in turn, bolster literacy development and numeracy skills and provide a wider framework for classroom learning. We would like to pilot this kind of scheme on the Robinson Crusoe Island to see if such interventions are also advantageous in isolated Chilean populations. This is an ideal population to test out the system because they have many complicating factors that challenge educational progression. If the interventions work here, we would like to make recommendations to extend the programme to other isolated, indigenous and rural populations in Chile. We will work with speech and language experts at the University of Chile, who have existing contacts with the Islanders and with specialists at the University of Oxford who have designed and trialed interventions in the UK and Brazil. We will work with local professionals to provide training and support of the programme transferring skills across international boundaries and building research capacities in Chile. We hope that the lessons learned from this project can be extended to indigenous and continental populations on the mainland and beyond, allowing Chile to take a leadership role in the confrontation of educational inequalities.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project aims to develop and evaluate a language and literacy intervention programme that suitable for rural, isolated and indigenous populations in Chile (and beyond). The direct objective of the programme is to evaluate the value of reading and language intervention within vulnerable Chilean populations. &quot;Value&quot; will be measured across different aspects; (i) the adaptation of the programme into a new cultural setting and the integration of the programme into school life, (ii) the oral language gains produced by the programme (iii) the educational gains (principally reading) associated with intervention, (iv) the efficacy in different educational and clinical subsets of children, (v) the transfer of skills into the community, (vi) the feasibility of such a programme across other isolated and mainland populations. EXPECTED OUTCOMES - Development of a culturally and linguistically appropriate intervention programme, manualised with associated materials - Training and support of local individuals to deliver the programme - Monitoring and evaluation of the programme delivery and recording of any practical issues that arise during implementation - Evidence that intervention programmes that have proven successful in developed educational systems can be effective for Chilean populations - Baseline assessments of rates of language, reading and learning difficulties - Measures of immediate and longer-term gains produced by the intervention programme - Information regarding the efficacy of the programme in different developmental subsets (in terms of age and associated language/reading disorders) - Increased understanding of barriers to learning in challenging contexts - Recommendations for future development of the programme and applicability to other populations - Strengthened alliance between the University of Chile and the University of Oxford - Knowledge exchange between the UK and Chile and strengthening of research capacities in Chile - Increased research capacity in the UK and Chile in the use of RCTs in education - Transfer of skills into society promoting long-term growth</narrative>
