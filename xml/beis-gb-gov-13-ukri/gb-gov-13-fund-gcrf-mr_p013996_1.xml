   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Concerns about the poor and most vulnerable not getting adequate access to quality health care are widespread in low and middle income countries (LMICs) and have led to an intense advocacy for universal health coverage (UHC) in the last 5 years. Effective implementation of UHC requires equity in health care, defined as payment for health services according to capacity to pay and the receipt of benefits according to need. Indonesia has in recent years embarked on a programme to achieve UHC through a national health insurance scheme (Jaminan Kesehatan Nasional - JKN). However, with coverage currently at 65% and the 2019 goal for full coverage fast approaching, a second wave of JKN reforms are being planned to bolster Indonesia&apos;s progress.  The primary aim of this study is to prospectively evaluate the combined effects of a second phase (2017-2019) of JKN-reforms in Indonesia and provide an overall assessment of progress toward the achievement to UHC. The reforms are designed to address factors currently hindering the effective implementation of the national health insurance scheme and in turn the pursuit of UHC by 2019. Over the next 3 years the government will be initiating and strengthening a number of important reforms ranging from re-structuring provider payment schemes through to socialization campaigns to raise awareness of the scheme and its benefits. Strategies for increasing fiscal space for health through increasing tobacco tax and the phasing out of subsidies on fuel are also proposed. Understanding the equity impact of these reforms and how they may (or may not) be facilitating progress towards UHC is of considerable interest to the government of Indonesia.   The study will take a &apos;whole of system&apos; approach by integrating both the public and the increasingly important private sector of the Indonesian health care system.  Using a before and after design, the impact of these UHC reforms will be measured according to three key outcomes: (i) the progressivity of the health care financing system (ii) the pro-poorness of the health care delivery system and (iii) self-reported health outcomes across socioeconomic groups. The quantitative tools of financing and benefit incidence analysis will be used to assess who pays and who benefits from health care spending at baseline (2017) and 2 years into implementation (end 2019). The study will bring together an international research team consisting of those with substantial experience of evaluating UHC-reforms in Africa and the Asia-Pacific and those with an in-depth understanding of the Indonesian health care system. Qualitative studies to document the context pre and post UHC reforms, and the process of implementing UHC reforms will also be undertaken. Stakeholder analysis will be used to support the translation of priority financing reforms identified through the evaluation into viable policy proposals.  The study will advance methods in this field by testing different indicators and indexes of &apos;need&apos;, against which the appropriateness of the distribution of benefits from using health services can be assessed. The study will also advance knowledge through a better understanding of the contribution of the private sector to meeting the needs of the poor and in turn, inform through the stakeholder analysis, ongoing discussions about effective engagement with private sector to strengthen progress towards UHC.  The over-arching goal of this study is to strengthen the healthcare system of Indonesia through more equitable and sustainable health financing policies. As the fourth most highly populated country in the world, with a total population of around 255 million people, the implications of this study&apos;s findings for the design of a universal health system will be far-reaching.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="This study aims to evaluate the equity impact of Indonesia&apos;s latest Universal Health Coverage (UHC) reforms and thereby support the development of evidence-informed pro-poor health care reforms in the country. Understanding the extent to which these reforms improve the pro-poor nature of financing and service use and how they may (or may not) facilitate progress towards UHC is of considerable interest not only to the Indonesian government but also to other countries in the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) region that are moving towards the provision of UHC.   In 2014, Indonesia implemented a national health scheme known as Jaminan Kesehatan Nasional (JKN) to address growing disparities in health care and make health care available to its entire population of 255 million by 2019. Indonesia has made steady progress with around 165 million people now members of the JKN, making it the biggest single-payer health system in the world. There is however mounting evidence of areas where the JKN is underperforming and without action, the JKN is unlikely to reach expected levels of population coverage, service coverage or financial protection by 2019. It is estimated that 90 million (40% of the population) remain uncovered, most of these working in the informal sector. About 25% of JKN members also continue to incur out-of-pocket health expenditures. Moreover, Indonesia&apos;s public health financing remains at roughly half the estimated requirement for UHC. In response, the government is entering a new phase over the next 3 years in the scaling up of JKN to achieve UHC by 2019. This will involve several key reforms including the integration of remaining insurance schemes into the single-payer system, structuring of provider payment schemes, expanding the network of providers especially from the private sector and increasing socialisation among targeted beneficiaries to encourage enrollment in the JKN (see &apos;case for support&apos; for detailed description of reform package).  Using a before and after design, this study will evaluate the combined effects of this latest package of UHC reforms at study baseline (2017) and 2 years later (2019) on the progressivity of the health care financing system, the pro-poorness of the health care delivery system and on self-reported health outcomes across different socioeconomic groups (SEGs). Given the increasing importance of private health services in Indonesia, these outcomes will also be compared across public and private sectors. Qualitative studies to document the context and the process of implementing these reforms, will also be undertaken.   Specific study objectives are to:  1) Undertake a &apos;whole of system&apos; evaluation of Indonesia&apos;s equity-focused UHC-reforms - comparing impact on: the distribution of health care benefits across SEGs; the distribution of the burden of paying for health care across SEGs; and self-reported health outcomes across SEGs. 2) Identify factors influencing equity in the delivery and financing of health care in Indonesia, paying particular attention to the role of the private sector (vis-&#xE0;-vis the public sector) in the delivery and financing of health care. 3) Advance analytical methods by testing different measures of &apos;need&apos;, against which the appropriateness of financial contribution and utilization of health services can be assessed. 4) Document the context and process of implementing UHC-reforms in Indonesia and identify actions for increasing stakeholder support."></capital-spend>
