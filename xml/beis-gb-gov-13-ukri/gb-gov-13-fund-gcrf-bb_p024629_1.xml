   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The livestock sectors of many LMIC are negatively impacted by pathogens for which no viable vaccines are currently available. T-cells are known to contribute to protection against a number of these pathogens (e.g. tuberculosis, East Coast Fever) and current efforts are directed to better understanding the role these cells plays in conferring immunity and defining the &apos;correlates of protection&apos; that can be used to rationalise future vaccine development.   One parameter that has been advocated for inclusion in comprehensive analysis of T-cell responses is the repertoire of the expressed TCR, which can be exploited to study the clonotypic structure, kinetics and recall of pathogen-specific T-cells. TCRs are heterodimeric, clonotypically distributed receptors composed of alpha (TRA) and beta (TRB) chains that determine the antigenic-specificity of individual T-cells. Somatic V(D)J recombination and non-germline editing of the V(D)J junction generates a vastly diverse TCR repertoire, that in humans has been estimated to be ~2x10&apos;7. Upon encountering their cognate antigen, either during vaccination or pathogen exposure, T-cells undergo clonotypic expansion which can be evaluated by the increased expression of the clonotypic TRA and/or TRB chains. However, achieving sufficient sequencing depth of the TCR repertoire to reliably detect such clonal expansions in highly complex T-cell populations (e.g. in vivo PBMC or primary T-cell cultures) was difficult before development of NGS platforms.   In the last decade, development of a number of bioinformatic pipelines (e.g. MiTCR and IMGT-HighV-Quest) has enabled TCR analysis using NGS data to be applied to the study of human and murine T-cell populations. The pre-requisites for these analyses are i) TCR chain-specific PCR protocols that generate unbiased TCR chain amplicons, ii) a comprehensive database of V and J gene segment sequences and iii) sophisticated algorithms that can align TCR sequences to the relevant V and J gene segment databases (and so define V and J usage and the hypervariable CDR3 sequence of individual TCR chains) and also compensate and correct for the inevitable PCR/sequencing errors that can significantly compromise sequence data interpretation.  The principles used in bioinformatic pipelines developed for human and murine TCR analysis are generic and in recent studies we have demonstrated that given the appropriate V and J gene databases the pipelines can be modified and applied to NGS sequence data from other species (in this case European Bos taurus cattle). In this project we propose to:  1 - Design PCR protocols to enable unbiased PCR amplification of TRA and TRB chains from the relevant livestock populations. Optimised SMART-based PCR amplification protocols for pig, goat, sheep and water buffalo TRA and TRB chains will be validated. 2 - Sequence sufficient full length TRA/TRB amplicons to enable comprehensive coverage of the expressed TRA and TRB repertoires. Amplicons generated from 5 representative individuals from different LMIC and European breeds will be subjected to PacBio sequencing to obtain full length amplicon sequence. 3 - Bio-informatically de-construct somatically recombined TRA and TRB chains to construct database of germline V and J gene segments sequences. Pipelines to de-construct recombined TRA/TRB chains will be developed to enable germline sequences of the constituent V and J gene segments to be established and a comprehensive database populated. 4 - Modify existing algorithms to enable these databases to be employed in NGS analysis of TCR repertoires (and provide TRBV, TRBJ, TRAV and TRAJ databases to managers of publicly accessible TCR analysis algorithms). A modified version of the MiTCR algorithm which will enable the utilisation of the livestock species databases will be established and hosted by the CTLGH bioinformatics repository. In addition, the databases will be hosted by the publicly available Milaboratory website.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="T-cells are required for protective immunity against many key pathogens affecting the livestock sectors of LMIC. The successful development of vaccines that elicit protective T-cell responses in livestock species is subject to numerous constraints, including the availability of tools to comprehensively analyse the performance of candidate vaccines. The T-cell receptors (TCRs) that dictate the epitope-specificity of individual T-cells are clonotypically distributed, heterodimeric receptors composed of alpha (TRA) and beta (TRB) chains. The formation of individual TRA and TRB chains by somatic recombination of variable (V), diversity (D- TRB only) and junctional (J) gene segments generates a highly diverse repertoire (estimated at &gt;2x10&apos;7 in humans), which was difficult to analyse in sufficient depth until the advent of NGS. The quantity of sequence data generated by NGS platforms and the unusual structure of TCR chains (i.e. the presence of non-germline encoded hypervariable regions) requires specialised bioinformatics pipelines, which are available for humans and mice (e.g. MiTCR) but not currently for livestock species. By providing data on individual T-cell clonotypes, TCR repertoire analysis can provide high-resolution data to describe critical parameters of T-cell responses and consequently has been advocated for integration into candidate vaccine evaluation programmes.   NGS analysis of TCR repertoires in livestock species is currently restricted by lack of the necessary bioinformatic resources (i.e. comprehensive databases of TRB and TRA V and J gene segment sequences and targeted bioinformatic tools). We have recently modified the PCR protocols described for humans to generate unbiased TRB amplicons from European Bos taurus cattle and - using a database of bovine TRBV and TRBJ genes and a modified version of the MiTCR application - were able to provide high-resolution analysis of TRB repertoires in European Bos taurus cattle. Here we propose to adapt the technique to allow NGS analysis of the TRA and TRB to a range of livestock species (e.g. Bos indicus and African Bos taurus cattle, pig, water buffalo, sheep and goats) of fundamental importance to the agricultural sectors of LMIC countries. To achieve this, the following objectives will need to be met:  1 - Design PCR protocols to enable amplification of TRA and TRB chains from the relevant livestock populations.  2 - Sequence sufficient full length TRA/TRB amplicons to enable comprehensive coverage of the expressed TRA and TRB repertoires. 3 - Bio-informatically de-construct somatically recombined TRA and TRB chains to construct database of germline V and J gene segments sequences. 4 - Modify existing algorithms to enable these databases to be employed in NGS analysis of TCR repertoires (and provide curated TRBV, TRBJ, TRAV and TRAJ databases to managers of public accessible TCR analysis algorithms).  The outputs from the proposed study will provide both the methodologies and publically available databases required to implement TCR repertoire analysis of T-cell populations in a range of livestock species that are critical to LMIC countries. Such resources will enhance the capacity of the research community to analyse T-cell responses induced by both pathogens and vaccine candidates and so aid in disease control measures that would directly impact on the economic performance of agricultural sectors of LMIC."></capital-spend>
