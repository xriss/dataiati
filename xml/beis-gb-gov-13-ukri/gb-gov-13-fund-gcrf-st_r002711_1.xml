   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Development of bright laser-driven secondary sources toward applications for societal benefit</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In this proposal, we aim to develop next-generation technologies for extremely bright radiation and particle beams driven by intense lasers. In the near future these unique sources could be adopted for a wide range of advanced applications in healthcare, security and defence and industrial imaging. The advantage of the laser-driven source is its lower cost and smaller size compared to conventional accelerator machines. They can also be used to produce multiple, synchronised beams  from a single device. This makes them a powerful and affordable tool and one that can be widely deployed in industrial environments and hospitals. For example, tuneable beams of highly penetrating x-rays and neutrons could be used for multi-scale dynamic and tomographic imaging of large dense objects at unprecedented resolution. In the healthcare sector laser-driven x-ray beams could provide soft tissue imaging comparable in quality to that achieved at large-scale synchrotron facilities and also deliver electron and hadron beams to treat the cancer.   The wide-spread adoption of laser technology for these societal applications is a long term goal and the primary objective of this project is to establish a UK-India network to train young scientists in the methods necessary to operate such facilities. India has invested in state-of-the-art laser facilities and can attain a world-leading position in this growing field of applied science. The UK has long experience in high intensity laser development and implementation and we will work with our partnering Indian research institutes to maximise the output from their investment. Knowledge exchange and collaborative experiments in this research area will be highly beneficial to both the Indian and UK high power laser research communities. As these high-profile Indian laser institutes develop they will encourage young people to pursue scientific careers and attract investment from industrial sources with challenges that can be addressed by this technology.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">We propose to develop a focused network between the UK and India for exploiting laser-driven accelerators as compact and affordable radiation sources for applications with broader societal benefits in India. This network would act as a seed for a future GCRF programme in this field that, along with realising the potential of laser-driven sources, would train India&apos;s young generation in associated cutting-edge science and technology, thus building up a critical mass in India for sustained exploitation of its benefits. India has invested in high-cost state-of-the-art laser systems in centres such as TIFR and RRCAT, which are set to grow in coming years. It is essential that young researchers gain the knowledge and expertise required to maximise the output from these facilities and establish a world-leading position in this R&amp;D sector. Equally India needs to build capacity to fully exploit laser-driven sources for applications and create scientific hubs based on these technologies, driving innovation and attracting external investment. The UK brings a wealth of experience into this collaboration as one of the world leaders in this area and ancillary drivers such as high power laser, computing and detector instrumentation.   At the start of the project we will organise a workshop to establish the network of researchers and engage with industrial and medical experts in order to identify the applications of laser-driven sources that are important for India. We expect in the longer term the outcomes of this work will contribute to the adoption of these sources for a wide range of advanced applications in healthcare, security and defence and industrial imaging. Involvement of the beneficiaries of the research - NGO&apos;s, hospitals and industries - in this process right from beginning ensures a sustained development to maximise impact.   Alongside the networking activities we will pursue a program of research to develop the new approaches necessary to operate laser-driven accelerators at a higher laser repetition rate than previously available. Collaborative experiments with highly experienced UK teams provide an ideal training environment for visiting Indian students to gain the confidence and competence to subsequently lead projects in India and internationally. A key scientific goal is to demonstrate the viability of the laser-driven sources for applications, for example rapid microtomograpic x-ray imaging. Success in this area will have high visibility and provides a sound footing for the laser facilities in India to establish and maintain world-class status in this emerging technology.  The proposed programme has three main objectives: * Identify applications of laser-driven sources that are important for India, addressing its special needs.  * Establish a collaborative network between UK and India, involving academic institutions, hospitals and other industrial partners in India in order to exploit the uses of laser-driven sources for applications and train India&apos;s young personnel in next-generation R&amp;D technologies.  * Demonstrate proof-of-principle utilisation of novel laser-driven sources for societal applications to establish a strong position in this growing S&amp;T research sector.</narrative>
