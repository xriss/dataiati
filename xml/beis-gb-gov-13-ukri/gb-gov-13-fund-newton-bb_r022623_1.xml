   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Understanding resistance of key crop pests in Brazil</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Insect pests represent a major threat to current and future food security with an average of 20% of crops worldwide lost annually to herbivorous insects. This issue is particularly acute in Brazil where agriculture forms a key component of the economy accounting for 22% of gross domestic product (GDP). Synthetic insecticides are widely used by farmers and growers in Brazil in an attempt to reduce yield loss from insect pests. Unfortunately, the growing reliance on insecticides has resulted in the emergence of insect pest populations that are resistant to many of the chemicals used for control. Two of the most economically important species in this regard are the neotropical brown stink bug, Euschistus heros, and the fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda. E. heros is a major pest of soybean and vegetable crops and causes severe damage to cotton and maize, while S. frugiperda feeds on more than 80 plant species but is particularly destructive on maize. Resistance to several important insecticides has now emerged in these species and threatens their sustainable control. Despite the seriousness of this issue very little research has been carried out to understand the evolution of resistance in E. heros and S. frugiperda and to use this knowledge to develop means to combat its emergence and spread. This is, in part, due to a lack of genomic resources for these key pest species - particularly in the case of E. heros.   This Stage 1 pump-prime project has two aims, firstly it will generate key &apos;omic&apos; (genomic and transcriptomic) resources and data for E. heros and S. frugiperda that will be a valuable asset to the community studying these species. These will include the first annotated draft genome for E. heros, sequence characterization of the entire microbial community (the microbiome) in the gut of E. heros and S. frugiperda, and tissue-specific gene expression data for both species that can be used to determine where candidate genes (such as those involved in resistance) are expressed. In the context of this proposal these data will greatly facilitate future characterization of genes and DNA markers associated with insecticide resistance in these species that can be used to develop tools to prevent, slow or overcome the development of resistance.   To ensure that the knowledge gained in this and follow on projects can achieve applied impact the second main aim of this pump-prime project is to develop a network of key stakeholder groups in Brazilian agriculture. This will be achieved by holding workshops with members of growers associations, government and industry including representatives of Insecticide Resistance Action Committee Brazil (IRAC-BR), the Brazilian Cotton Growers Association (ABRAPA), the Soybean and Maize Growers Association (APROSOJA), the Brazilian Ministry of Agriculture and the Technical Advisory Committee of Pesticides (CTA). These meetings will define the priorities of future research and develop routes for translation of the science into tools and strategies for resistance management and rational control of these two important insect pests of Brazilian agri-ecosystems.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This Stage 1 pump-prime project addresses the growing problem of insecticide resistance in two economically important pests of Brazilian agriculture: The neotropical brown stink bug, Euschistus heros, and the fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda. The project has two main aims: 1) To generate &apos;omic&apos; resources to underpin the future characterization of the mechanisms of resistance in these species and, 2) to develop a network of key stakeholder groups to ensure routes to translation of the fundamental science into applied impact. The project comprises three main Objectives as follows:  Objective 1. Development of genomic and transcriptomic resources Characterisation of the molecular basis of insecticide resistance in E. heros and S. frugiperda is currently hampered by a lack of genetic resources for these species, especially for E. heros. This Objective will address this need in three tasks. Task 1.1 Sequencing the draft genome of E. heros. This task will provide the first draft genome of E. heros as a prerequisite for future study of the genetic mechanisms of resistance in this species. We will use our established pipeline to sequence and assemble the genome, predict genes and assign functional annotation. Task 1.2 Tissue specific RNAseq of E. heros and S. frugiperda. Tissue-based transcriptomic data provide unique cost-effective insights into organismal functional genomics. In this task we will generate such data for E. heros and S. frugiperda, focusing on tissues with a known role in xenobiotic detoxification or that are the site of insecticide action. Data will be used in a Stage 2 project to develop user-friendly expression atlases for these species. Task 1.3 Sequencing the microbiome of E. heros and S. frugiperda. We have previously shown that the gut microbiota of insecticide resistant strains of S. frugiperda can break down insecticides. We will sequence the gut microbiome of insecticide resistant and susceptible strains of E. heros and S. frugiperda as an important first step in understanding the role of the microbiome in resistance.  Objective 2. Development of biological resources This objective comprises two tasks that develop biological material required to maximize the utility of the genomic resources developed in Objective 1 for the molecular characterization of insecticide resistance in E. heros and S. frugiperda. Task 2.1 Development of genetic lines for molecular analyses of resistance. We will use genetic crossing and insecticide selection to prepare resistant and susceptible lines of E. heros and S. frugiperda that share a common genetic background. These populations will form the starting cultures for molecular analyses in a Stage 2 project. Task 2.2 Isolation of gut microbiota. We have previously demonstrated that the gut microbiota in insecticide resistant strains of S. frugiperda can break down insecticides and may play a role in the evolution of resistance in laboratory selected strains. This task will 1) select microbes capable of degrading pesticides from the gut of insecticide resistant lines and 2) explore the association of pesticide-degrading bacteria in natural populations of S. frugiperda and E. heros. This task will provide important preliminary data for Stage 2 objectives.  Objective 3. Developing stakeholder networks This objective aims to develop a strong network of key stakeholders to ensure this and future projects will deliver impact to Brazilian agriculture. The objective comprises two workshops - one at the project outset and one ~6 months into the project. Attendees will include all project partners, representatives of key growers associations, industry and the Brazilian Ministry of Agriculture. The Workshops will define grower, government and industry priorities in terms of the two pest species, and identify routes to application of our science.</narrative>
