   <narrative xml:lang="EN">It has been widely accepted that cigarette has tremendous impact on human health. Effective tobacco control effects can help prevent kinds of diseases and social-economic disasters which may happen on smokers of non-smokers exposed to secondhand smoke. In China, internal rural-to-urban migrant (mostly migrant workers) makes a large proportion of the whole population, accounting for about 0.24 billion in 2012. This migrant workers population has a serious situation of tobacco exposure.  We first propose to design a package tailoring the WHO 5A&apos;s model into 5A&apos;s group consulting intervention package through literature review, in-depth interview and focus group discussion.  The 5A&apos;s group consulting package intervention would include: 1. Factsheets detailing key information on smoking, SHS. 2. Guidelines for group guiders on how to deliver the 5A&apos;s group consulting (activities for different audiences: smokers, non-smokers exposed to SHS). 3. A leaflet that contains the key facts about smoking and SHS that can be disseminated to migrant workers after consulting.  Based on the package desigend, we aim to recruit 8 factories (clusters) and all the migrant workers working in these factories from industrial zone of Guangzhou, China. The clusters will be randomized to the intervention and control group in a 1:1 ratio. Clusters allocated to the intervention arm will be offered the 5A&apos;s group consulting package. The clusters in the control arm will not be offered the package until the completion of the study. All the migrant workers who work in each factory and provides informed consent will be recruited. Factories will complete a factory survey of basic factory information, all participants will complete a questionnaire (about the status of tobacco exposure, knowledge and attitude of tobacco, and demographic information), and a non-smoking individual will provide a salvia sample which will be tested for cotinine. All these participant outcomes (questionnaire and salvia cotinine) will be measured before and after the 3-month intervention in both arms of the trial. In addition, a purposive sample of participants will be invited for interviews to investigate the facilitators and barriers for integrating 5A&apos;s group consulting package into workplace settings and how these can be enhanced or addressed at the end of this trial.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="We aim to design a 5A&apos;s group consulting package, which will be adapted from WHO 5A&apos;s model and has potentials to be implemented in the workplaces settings in China. in the years to come, we will conduct a randomized controlled trial(RCT) to test its effectiveness in reducing non-smokers&apos; exposure to SHS as measured by salivary cotinine levels in workplaces in China, with secondary aims of determining its effectiveness in reducing the uptake of smoking and reducing smoking rates in migrant workers. In this study, we will test the feasibility and acceptability of conducting a workplace-based migrant-workers intervention program of the 5A&apos;s and provide information to inform the future design of RCT. Research questions 1. How can the WHO 5A&apos;s model be adapted into 5A&apos;s group consulting intervention package that fits migrant workers in China? 2. To what extent it is feasible and acceptable of delivering the intervention in the workplaces setting, and how the evidence generated from this study will inform the design of the main trial. Objectives 1. To tailor the WHO 5A&apos;s model into 5A&apos;s group consulting intervention package that fits migrant workers. 2. To test the feasibility and acceptability of delivering the intervention , and provide information to the design of the main trial such as outcome suitability, number of clusters (factories) and size of each cluster (participants), effect size, intra-cluster correlation coefficient (ICC) , recruitment and attrition rates."></capital-spend>
