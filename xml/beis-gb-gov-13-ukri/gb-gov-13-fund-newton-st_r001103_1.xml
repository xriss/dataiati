  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">- Provide a basic training in the skills involved in radio astronomy to ten trainees per year in Ghana, Zambia, Kenya, Namibia/Botswana, Madagascar and Mozambique to enable them to use the radio antennas in these countries that will form the African VLBI Network (AVN). The advanced STEM skills they learn will also enable them to drive economic development in a variety of related industries such as telecommunications, space science, computing and big data. Their participation in this big science project in Africa will encourage more take up of advanced STEM subjects and subsequent economic development. - Provide advanced training in skills at MSc and PhD level to a number of students from AVN countries to enable them to carry out research using the AVN. These students will be able to form the foundation of radio astronomy groups in their countries. - Build a sustainable network of African radio astronomers who can collaborate with each other and utilize the AVN. They will also build links with both UK and SA experts in the fields of radio astronomy and related industrial fields that will lead to a sustainable collaborative network. - Construct a virtual centre of excellence that will act as a repository for training materials, a contact database for academics and industrial partners, a platform for further opportunities, and a place for entrepreneurs and business ideas to develop.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">We will conduct a training programme in radio astronomy in Africa that will help to drive economic growth. South Africa is hosting part of the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) - the major next generation radio telescope and  the first big science project on the African continent. A network of up to 2000 dishes will eventually spread out across southern Africa to give the telescope its powerful resolution to see small structures in the sky. To this aim South Africa is partnering with eight other countries in Africa that will host these outstations. However, there is virtually no astronomy activity in these countries at present and so SKA-SA are building the African VLBI Network (AVN) as a precursor instrument and very useful addition to the world&apos;s radio astronomy networks in its own right. The AVN will consist of 30 m class radio dishes in each partner country, either converted from defunct telecommunications dishes or newly built ones. The UK team has experience in the conversion of old telecommunications dishes for radio astronomy purposes through its involvement in a similar project at the Goonhilly Earth Station in Cornwall. The UK team, together with SA colleagues, will provide a basic training in the AVN countries so that the local people can use and help run the radio telescopes there. The STEM skills learnt as part of this training can be applied to a range of industries such as telecommunications, space science, land management and computing. Therefore the training will result in a pool of local talent who can help to drive economic growth in the AVN countries. An integral part of the training programme will be interaction with entrepreneurs who have experience of setting up businesses using related technologies. Advanced training will take the form of a number of MSc and PhD bursaries. The students will undertake research training using the interferometric radio telescopes and spend time in both the UK and SA to help forge strong research links. A virtual centre of excellence will be established that pulls the various strands of training, research and industry together. Showcasing the radio astronomy facilities in these countries and demonstrating how the skills and technologies used in radio astronomy can be applied to many areas of industry and commerce can lead to a general upskilling of the population.</narrative>
