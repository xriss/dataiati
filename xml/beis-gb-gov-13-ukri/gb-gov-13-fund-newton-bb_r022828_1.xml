   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The overall objective is economic development in Colombia by focused, science-based exploitation of biodiversity to develop new varieties of tropical forage grasses (Brachiaria and Panicum species and hybrids) to meet needs of small and medium scale farmers, and defined goals of environmental sustainability. The following objectives will generate underpinning knowledge for this aim:   - Identify ploidy of accessions to identify appropriate parents for breeding at diploid and polyploid levels across the germplasm collection for Brachiaria;  development of genome-specific probes from NGS data to identify the genomic composition of polyploids and hybrids - Identification of candidate genes implicated in determining forage quality (eg digestibility, lipid content to reduce enteric methane emissions) leading to an atlas of the allelic diversity; Gain improved knowledge of apomixis, its genes and seed production for exploitation in breeding -              RNA-seq from 30 to 40 accessions of both genera to prioritize candidate genes for breeding, building towards a pan-genome defining variation across the genera. Analyse RNA-seq data for evidence of genome interactions and differential gene expression in hybrids - Define pull from improvements in environmental and sustainability requirements (GHG, soils/erosion, water, nutrient cycling) from forage crops; Define economic pull for defined forage grass improved characters from farmers and breeders in Colombia; Measure the economic value of traits and market sizes for improved Brachiaria seed; define measures for environmental benefits.  - Make RNAi and CRISPR-CAS9 constructs designed to modify candidate genes to improve forage quality - Plan second and third years programme based on results - Outputs and capacity building: Training of CIAT staff and students in UK to raise technical skills and experience; allow UK participants to gain international experience at CIAT; Prepare publications, blogs, website for farmers, policy makers, public, hold a workshop to disseminate results.</narrative>
