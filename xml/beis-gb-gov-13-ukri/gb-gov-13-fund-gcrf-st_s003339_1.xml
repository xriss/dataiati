   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Training of Students and Scientists in the Republic of Armenia in the safety and fundamental science uses of cyclotrons.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The main objectives are: 1) Provide training for postgraduate students in Armenia in low-energy nuclear physics skills, both through courses in Armenia and in the UK and in doing so form a close collaboration with Armenia in basic nuclear science and isotope production. 2) Introduce techniques of low-energy nuclear science with its associated applications to participate and compete in international science projects with basic nuclear science, nuclear astrophysics, environmental studies, mining, health, and economic deliverables. 3) Increase the instrumentation and technical know-how for high-resolution gamma spectroscopy necessary for isotope monitoring at the cyclotron. This will lead to the transformation of the theoretical aspects of learning at Universities to hands-on experimental potential with the use of the cyclotron. 4) Increase the pool of PhD level trained in nuclear scientists to address the large disparity in the age profile within the institute by attracting young talented students via relevant, modern teaching and experimental research. 5) Contribute to the transformation of ANSL into a competitive modern laboratory capable of both scientific and economic impact.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This is a proposal for the training of graduate students and scientific staff of A. Alikhanyan National Science Laboratory (ANSL), Armenia in the operation of cyclotrons for science, applications, isotope production, and medical physics.  Armenia is a nuclear-energy country and its strategic location makes radiation monitoring important. There are also significant mining interests. The Republic of Armenia has invested in the purchase and installation of an 18-MeV cyclotron from IBA-Belgium. The international advisory body of the institute recommended that Armenia implement a research programme in low-energy nuclear science along with a cyclotron that can produce isotopes for nuclear medicine. The cyclotron is fully constructed as well as the building that houses it. The missing component is the experience and skill set of the graduate students and staff in the use and operation of the facility. This is needed to secure approval for running the machine. This proposal will engage students from ANSL and the three universities in Yerevan (the capital of Armenia) in strong in STEM subjects, namely, the Yerevan State University, the Yerevan Polytechnic University, and the Russian University of Armenia. Associated with this request for training and education in the safe operation of the cyclotron operation are radiation monitoring aspects. This is needed as radio-isotopes that the cyclotron can produce are key to diagnosing and treating many health conditions, such as a variety of cancers. The new PET and SPECT instruments at ANSL can be used effectively to improve health outcomes once the cyclotron is producing isotopes for medicine.  The ANSL in Armenia has been recognised as the strongest scientific institution in the country and they are able to grant both Master of Science and Ph.D. degrees at the graduate level.  The expertise in low energy nuclear science is completely missing in Armenia.  All of the reasons why a robust education and training programme in nuclear science are crucial for the well-being and advancement of Armenia. This proposal aims to address the nuclear science training needs in Armenia. The Universities of Birmingham and Surrey have an established history of low-energy nuclear physics teaching and research. Additionally, since the 1940s Birmingham has operated cyclotrons for both nuclear physics research and medical isotopes production. This expertise will be used to offer much needed training for Armenia in two stages. 1) Four-week training courses will be delivered by UK academics at ANSL for post-graduate students. This will take place in both 2019 and 2020. 2) The best five students as selected by ANSL and UK academics will travel to the UK for a month to undertake hands-on nuclear spectroscopy training both at the University of Surrey/National Physical Laboratory and at the Birmingham cyclotron. These skills will provide the practical grounding for those students to proceed to the PhD programme in Armenia and form the core of a new generation able to carry out and teach such skills, essential for the economic development of Armenia.</narrative>
