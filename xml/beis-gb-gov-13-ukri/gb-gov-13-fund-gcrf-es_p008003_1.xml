   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The RELIEF Centre aims to mount an innovative and breakthrough social science project of global significance that will speed up the sustainability transitions that the world critically requires in the context of large scale movement of peoples. The core will be a programme of research and civic engagement, centred around the research questions and objectives below. A vision of future prosperity for Lebanon - applicable also to refugees&apos; home countries - will be developed with indicators and metrics (ways to measure value creation) that ordinary citizens can use to determine whether their communities and governments are on track to achieve their vision. Here the aim is to develop a radical new vision of prosperity within a world on the move, but to do so in the context of Lebanon and the refugee crisis with the intention to develop a model/template that could be used elsewhere.  Research Questions: 1. What does inclusive growth and sustainable prosperity look like in the context of large-scale movement of people? 2. How can we improve the quality of life for all in urban environments in the Lebanon? 3. How do we drive innovation and measure value creation in the context of the Lebanon? 4. How can the research and knowledge transfer capacities of Universities be reconfigured to develop innovative responses to these challenges? These research questions will answered by addressing the following objectives: O1. Develop an innovative and integrated approach to sustainable prosperity for &apos;hosts&apos; and &apos;refugees&apos; in Lebanon based on social and economic inclusiveness, with concrete and locally specific learning and knowledge transfer outcomes at the core O2. Undertake research on the needs, barriers and opportunities for social and economic transformation for prosperity and innovation in the context of Lebanon and the possible return of refugees to their countries of origin, with specific capabilities and knowledge outcomes O3. Engage stakeholders - including academic networks, policy makers, business, civil society organisations, communities and citizen scientists - in the co-design, co-production and implementation of localised and contextualised options based on robust research evidence  O4. Using established standards and taking into account existing gaps, develop new measures of value that enable good decisions through modelling, simulation and visualisation of data sets O5. Focus efforts on sustainable collaboration across and between UK and Lebanese higher education (HE) institutions to develop innovative responses to learning and knowledge transfer with potential relevance to other contexts of movement/migration O6. Demonstrate and develop the role of social science in leading new forms of multidisciplinary knowledge production across disciplines and sectors of intervention to develop a shared intellectual agenda and deliver innovative research to support and inform high level impact O7. Use digital technologies to build new knowledge sharing platforms for innovative forms of collaboration between Universities and communities, both for research and for capacity development and knowledge transfer  O8. Develop a new generation of scholars able and trained to work across disciplines and to use quantitative and qualitative data, to co-produce research excellence with multiple stakeholders, including local communities, and cross policy boundaries to ensure long-term change.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The RELIEF Centre will research pathways to achieving inclusive growth in the context of mass displacement and movement of people around the world. Achieving inclusive growth involves looking beyond monetary indicators and GDP, and towards multidimensional notions of prosperity that reflect people&apos;s quality of life and well-being. There is growing evidence that inequality is harmful to individuals and societies, and that both social and economic inclusion contribute to sustainable gains in prosperity. Prosperity is consistently eroded by poor educational opportunities, poor health, poor social cohesion, and poor employment prospects. But what does it take to achieve inclusive growth of prosperity in today&apos;s world, where 63.5 million people are forcibly displaced according to the UNHCR? Given the magnitude of displacement across the globe, it is no longer enough to see movement as an anomaly. The geopolitics of war, climate change and social inequality mean that this is now the &apos;new normal&apos; for people, whether they are &apos;hosts&apos; or &apos;movers&apos;. In response to this, the RELIEF Centre will mount an interdisciplinary social science project that will speed up the globally critical sustainability transitions required to improve the quality of people&apos;s lives. The core will be a programme of research, education and civic engagement that develops a vision of future prosperity for Lebanon - the country with the largest number of refugees per capita in the world today - but with findings and outputs that will be applicable to other countries throughout the world. The Centre&apos;s research programme comprises the following four research themes (R1 to R4), addressing key aspects of inclusive growth for prosperity and social cohesion:   R1 Post Conflict Cities will examine how Syrian refugees and their host Lebanese communities that can collectively participate in the design of more resilient and better quality living environments in contexts of resource constraint in Lebanon. This theme will also explore mechanisms for public engagement in the reconstruction of cities in Syria if/when Syrian refugees decide to return.   R2 Creating Value will identify existing collective goods for communities (of both hosts and refugees) in Lebanon, as well as the most efficacious forms of investment in communities to address their needs. This strand will consequently develop a model to assess the value of successful community-driven projects for enhancing and delivering collective goods in terms of both job creation and well-being.   R3 Future Education will mobilise new technologies to deliver affordable education to refugees and hosts in Lebanon, as well as generate data for the three other research themes. The RELIEF Centre will develop a curriculum of massive open online courses (MOOCs) aiming to provide people with the skills and capacities for managing conflict, improving environments and well-being, and creating opportunities for flourishing. MOOCs will include surveys at the outset, and at regular intervals throughout the course, on the specific needs of refugees and hosts. This data will then be used to improve them, as well as help address the other themes&apos; objectives.   R4 Prosperity Gains and Inclusive Growth will examine what prosperity and inclusive means for refugees and hosts, how they view their prospects for a better life, and their role in making gains in prosperity. R4 will produce a conceptual framework and methodology for understanding what drives prosperity gains, as well as develop mechanisms and methods for refugees and hosts to monitor prosperity gains or deficits in their communities and cities.</narrative>
