   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Anti-Microbials In Society (AMIS): a Global Interdisciplinary Research Hub</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Our use of antibiotics has escalated. We are often most aware of antibiotic use when we treat infections - for people, and animals. However, their use is more widespread. We use them routinely to reduce risks of infection amongst people with vulnerable immune systems, in farming livestock, to manage infection and to promote growth and even in crop farming. This widespread use is linked to a rise in antibiotic resistance (AMR). The amount of antibiotic chemicals in circulation is held responsible for driving selection pressure amongst bacteria such that some infections become untreatable with previously effective drugs. This can have dramatic consequences for both health and economics. And yet, scientists have emphasised the lack of evidence for using antibiotics in many scenarios. For example, it is estimated that at least 50% of human antibiotic usage has no clinical benefit.  Policy makers are agreed that we must reduce our reliance on these medicines. But how? Efforts to change end user behaviour are often called for but thus far have not had the widespread impacts required to curb the emergence and spread of resistance. In this research, we propose that antibiotics are embedded within our socioeconomic infrastructure in such a deep way that attempts simply to change behaviour of patients, physicians of farmers are peripheral to our underlying dependency on their use. We suggest that by understanding the ways in which antibiotics are intertwined with our lives, institutions and infrastructures today we may identify ways to replace their use while minimising unintended consequences. For example, attempts to reduce use of one antibiotic often increases the use of another. Removing antibiotics all together may require a more systemic intervention such as the promotion of recovery time. In so-doing, however, other consequences could occur for the workforce and for economies tied up with pharmaceutical production and sales. We need to look closely at measures that have already been taken to reduce antibiotic use and understand what their consequences have been, as well as play out potential new interventions in different settings. If we are able to identify effective measures to reduce reliance on antibiotics in different scenarios, this will be more cost effective and timely than one-size-fits-all efforts to change end user behaviour.  The issue of AMR is global, and is expected to have most severe consequences for low and middle income countries (LMICs). The need to reduce use of antibiotics in these settings presents a particular challenge, where markets fill the gaps of fractured health systems. An access-excess balance is described whereby many in need of antimicrobials remain untreated while these medicines are commonly used unnecessarily. This scenario persists despite decades of research and programmes into the rational use of medicines in LMICs. New approaches are needed to uncover the significance of antibiotics in our societies, to understand why the imperative to target their use so difficult to enact.  This project presents a fresh approach beyond the traditionally delineated domains of social, biological or clinical sciences. The project aims to launch the AMIS Hub, an internationally recognised centre of excellence for developing, implementing and disseminating high quality research on antimicrobials in society, and two initial studies in Thailand and Uganda with the following objectives:  1. To understand the roles of antibiotics in every-day life and infrastructure 2. To evaluate the impact on care of imperatives to restrict antibiotics 3. To identify and rehearse counterfactuals to antibiotic use   This project will generate a critical mass of researchers undertaking high quality research into AMR, high quality comparative evidence indicating the nature of our reliance on antibiotics and recommendations for alternatives to antibiotics that will minimise unintended consequences.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project presents a fresh approach to the topic of antimicrobials in society. It expands the lens of study beyond the traditionally delineated domains of social, biological or clinical into newly configured analytical territory of human-microbial-chemical relations. With this approach, the project aims to provide new ways to consider the problem of and potential solutions to antimicrobial resistance. To achieve this, we propose the following objectives:  1. To establish an interdisciplinary research hub to study antimicrobials in society (the &apos;AMIS Hub&apos;), as an internationally recognised centre of excellence for developing, implementing and disseminating high quality research on antimicrobials in society.  2. To undertake the first two international empirical research studies within the AMIS Hub, in Thailand and Uganda, providing insights into current reliance on antibiotics and proposing practical alternatives.  These objectives respond primarily to the call for research on &apos;informal markets and access to antibiotics&apos; by exploring what is appropriate use of antibiotics in different contexts, as well as the call for &apos;public health as an opportunity to reduce the use of antibiotics&apos; by taking a historic perspective on systems that are now intertwined with antibiotics. We will develop and assemble a body of research from diverse settings and will enhance research capacity to perform high quality research on this topic across different contexts into the future. The health and financial risks posed by antimicrobial resistance have been estimated to be most severe for low and middle income countries. By understanding better the roles of antibiotics in these settings and by identifying counterfactual arrangements to replace dependence on these substances, the body of research generated and brought together by this project will help to reduce risks of antimicrobial resistance across settings.</narrative>
