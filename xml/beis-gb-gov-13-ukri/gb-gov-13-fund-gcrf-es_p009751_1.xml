   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Engaging and responding to local voices: the case of children&apos;s schooling in rural Ethiopia and the implication for development theory and practices</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The economic and social benefits of educating all children in developing countries are widely recognised and brought about global and national level commitments to get schooling to all children in the world. Following many years of varied global and national development initiatives increasingly many of the world&apos;s children are enrolled in school. In particular, in the last decade the enrolment rate has increased significantly across the developing world, however, it is widely recognised that bringing to school specific categories of children such as those who are female, rural, in conflict situations, have physical or intellectual disabilities, are refugees or stateless, or from pastoralist communities has met with persistent problems. In addition, many of those children who enrol in developing countries leave school with little learning and before they complete the full course of primary schooling. Therefore while the considerable increase in enrolment following the global effort is acknowledged, researchers have directed our attention to those children that are still out of school and to questions of equality, quality and learning. According to UNESCO (2015) currently there are 58 million primary school age children globally that are out of school. This stands in stark contrast to the promises made in the 2000 UN summit to create Education for All children by 2015. The majority of out of school children are currently found in Sub Saharan Africa (SSA), which is an increase from 1999 when the African share of out of school children stood at 40% (UNESCO 2015). Despite earlier optimism (e.g. GMR 2008), recently UNESCO stated that &apos;there has been virtually no progress in reducing the global rate and number of out-of- school children since 2007&apos; (UNESCO and UNICEF 2015-17). This is a worrying trend, especially regarding rural children, as they experience greatest need deprivation, exacerbated by lack of essential services and infrastructural development (Grantham-McGregor et al. 2007; also see Filmer and Pritchett 1999). Taking Ethiopia as a case study, my PhD thesis considered the factors that affect primary school enrolment, non-enrolment and dropout for rural children. Also noting the exclusion of poor, uneducated and rural people&apos;s views from ongoing debates as to why the problem persists, I aimed my research on the voices of children, their parents and teachers. Researchers in International Development previously highlighted the value from hearing people&apos;s views on matters that affects them. Following this view my research towards understanding schooling problems have generated a rare insight into the problems their own perspectives. With this project, I aim to take back the findings to the communities to further generate interest and spark constructive debate in the way that can challenge policy makers, development practioners, donors and communities themselves. The PhD findings will be turned into film to give genuine participation of the communities that are not able to read or write. The discussion following the screening of the film will give an opportunity for children and parents to examine their own schooling path, decisions and help them gain inspirations from other stories they were exposed to by the film. I am aiming to depict various stories in the performance and the film related to rural children&apos;s schooling in the way many rural people can relate to. This will raise consciousness and provide space for reflection, an opportunity to question social norms and potentially influence attitudes and practices.Teachers too will have opportunity to reflect on their own role and apply what they learn into practice. Similarly it will benefit donor countries and policy makers to learn from lived experiences of children and their parents and make them reflect the implications of existing policies and gap to be addressed.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This fellowship has six interlinked objectives: 1. to establish my academic career by producing quality academic papers to be published on peer reviewed journals relevant to International Development and Education and policy briefs targeting policy makers and donors (e.g. DFID,USAID); More specifically, I am planning to develop 3 conference presentations and write for publications that have implication for education policy and the theorisation of education in International Development (see more discussion in this in Impact section for details of articles for publication) 2. to allow me to think in innovative and novel ways of getting the PhD findings across to all stakeholders (academic and non-academic) appropriately and to maximum impact. This will enable the rare and important findings of my PhD research that is anchored on rural people&apos;s own voice, to reach a wider audience of policy makers, government officials at the Ministry of Education and Women and Children&apos;s Affairs, academia, development actors, front line administrators in schools and education desk situated at national and regional offices. 3. to produce a quality, well designed film with intention of furthering the debate on schooling in developing countries using rural Ethiopia as a case study with intent of getting the muted rural people&apos;s and their children&apos;s voices into existing debates on education and International Development; This is aimed at having strong skilled team that will help me think through for production of my PhD data into accessible film and influence impact across board. Further, I aim to collaborate with colleagues in University of Bristol Faculty of Arts and interdisciplinary groups of Screen Research @Bristol to have guidance on how to prepare good quality film for maximum impact. I will also draw on expertise from Policy Bristol and University of Bristol press team for marketing and dissemination ideas and training (See more on this discussed below it the Ethical issues). 4. to create a space where people (children, parents, teachers) can discuss the findings of the PhD research presented in film format and use the platform to raise consciousness and influence social norms across board; My PhD was committed to bring the voices of people to the fore and generated wealth of quantitative and qualitative data. Given that I have benefited from the experiential knowledge of children, their parents and teachers, it seems even more appropriate to bring back my findings to these groups in a way that is accessible to them. Clearly the large thesis produced is no use to communities with limited levels of literacy. Oral communication through live performance and film is an appropriate way to involve communities and a genuine attempt to acknowledge and value their perspectives (see in the Summary below on practical application of this). 5. to utilise the discussions that follow the screening of the film for scoping out a new research idea relevant to global challenges of development including comparative rural - urban study; and explore further areas under gender and education broadly, including reproductive health of young adolescent girls and schooling; early marriage, migration and child labour and schooling. 6. to expand my professional network , academic profile and collaborations with the help of my mentor; By taking my work to UK and international conferences, to DTC and ESRC, key INGOs working in Ethiopia UNICEF, Save the Children-UK, DFID in Addis Ababa, presenting to academics in UK and in Ethiopia at the Addis Ababa University (staff and PGRs) and taking part in the expert&apos;s discussions I will expand my professional network and come to know potential collaborators for my future research relevant to global challenges. I will have opportunity to learn from my mentor about relevant associations that I can join and benefit from his expertise and guidance.</narrative>
