   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Designing and evaluating provider results-based financing for tuberculosis care in Georgia: understanding costs, mechanisms of effect and impact</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Georgia has a high tuberculosis (TB) incidence of 106 per 100,000 population (TB all forms). The overall TB treatment success rate in 2013 was 80% for new TB cases, which is below the global average (86%) [1]. The low treatment success is largely due to a loss to follow up (LFU) of around 10% [1]. Reducing the LFU is not only essential for patient outcomes, but also to prevent multi-drug resistant (MDR) TB. Georgia belongs to 27 high MDR-TB burden countries with about 12% of new cases resistant to the first line drugs [1]. Among MDR-TB patients, treatment success rate is 48%, compared to other high MDR-TB countries, which mostly report treatment success rates exceeding 70% [1,3].  Currently a programme is in place to provide monetary incentives to patients with support from the Global Fund (GF) and the government. The aim of this program is to improve patient adherence to TB treatment. However, demand side interventions may not be enough as barriers may remain for providers. In Georgia, TB services are currently provided by a mix of public and private providers. Primary health care (PHC) providers are responsible for initial diagnosis and referrals of presumptive TB case to specialised TB services, and TB specialists are responsible for the ambulatory treatment and follow up of TB patients. The payment model of general and specialised TB service providers may not to provide sufficient incentives to improve efficiency and quality of care, particularly as mandatory requirement for private sector for retaining TB services (set by the Government of Georgia (GoG) seven years ago) may be removed in the coming years. Moreover, TB staff salaries are amongst the lowest in the health care system, leading to demotivation and unwillingness to deliver high quality care [3].Given this context, the government plans to introduce provider focused result-based financing (RBF) into the TB programme to overcome the current bottlenecks for the supply-side of TB care. Provider RBF is to be initiated in pilot areas in 2017[4]. Although TB indicators are included in about half of the RBF schemes examined globally [5], there is currently little documentation of how RBF changes provider behaviour and contributes to better adherence and treatment outcomes [6]. Specifically, the link between RBF, measures to improve quality of services, and adherence is unknown. There is also a lack of evidence on important dimensions of RBF, such as cost-effectiveness compared to other approaches, effect on organizational and providers behaviour, impact on equity, negative or positive unintended effects, and the feasibility and impact of the application of RBF to the private sector [6,7,8,9]. This proposal aims to take advantage of the government&apos;s plans to pilot RBF for TB providers in Georgia in order to shape and assess this intervention. The main goal of the research is to assist the Georgian government in developing a provider incentive payment scheme for TB (as a pilot RBF intervention) and to generate evidence on its effects on adherence and treatment success rates, cost, and how it works in different contexts in Georgia.  More specifically, the research objectives are: 1. To support the design of a pilot RBF intervention which is meant to is meant to address the current supply side weaknesses of TB service delivery and to document the joint development of the intervention with policy makers; 2. To examine the (i) impact, (ii) cost-effectiveness and (iii) underlying mechanisms and wider effects of the RBF intervention using a theory-informed controlled trial design; 3. To assess and provide insights for policy-makers on how the RBF intervention could be fine-tuned and modified, if necessary, to optimise a potential national roll-out and extension; 4. From a methodological perspective, to develop understanding of how the realist evaluation approach can be used to inform intervention trials and cost-effectiveness analysis.</narrative>

  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Tuberculosis remains one of the world&apos;s biggest killers, and Georgia is among the countries where the TB burden is high. Georgia has low TB treatment success rates, indicating that people are not completing treatment, thus posing a risk to their health and to their families and communities. Untreated TB cases lead to the development of drug resistance, which is a huge challenge for the country, for the region and the world. The GoG recognises the importance of this public health problem. Significant achievements in TB control were made during the last decade, including improvements to TB case detection and treatment. Nevertheless, challenges related to timely initiation of treatment, patients&apos; poor adherence to treatment and lower than targeted treatment success rates remain. A number of factors could potentially explain the poor control of TB cases in Georgia, including health system (provider) related factors, such as demotivation of health care providers and delayed TB detection, and patient related factors, such as failure to seek treatment, and poor adherence to treatment. In an attempt to address these barriers, Georgia has provided patient adherence support to all TB patients since 2007, with the support of the Global Fund (GF). This includes monetary incentives to encourage continuous treatment and to cover transportation costs. Notwithstanding the introduction of incentives for patients, treatment adherence remains low and the attention has shifted to the incentives available for service providers. In Georgia, primary care facilities are predominantly privately owned and paid by capitation, without tying incentives to their performance (e.g. for case detection and referral). These providers must provide TB treatment in their mandate, but this mandate will shortly expire. Although the GoG is paying referral specialists salaries for the provision of TB services through its vertical programme, it has limited capacity for monitoring and leverage over the performance of these providers, and salaries are low compared to other specialists. The GoG is therefore planning to introduce a provider RBF intervention in pilot areas in 2017. The pilots intend to explore the potential of a provider intervention, in addition to the already existing patient incentives, to increase the motivation of both public and private providers in improving patient adherence and treatment outcomes. From a research perspective, the introduction of this scheme provides an opportunity for embedded development and research, working closely with the national programme and policy makers, and leveraging Global Fund support and influence. The main goal of the research is to participate in problem analysis during the design phase and provide evidence on the implementation and effects of the new supply side RBF scheme on adherence and treatment success rates, on the cost of the intervention, and how it works in different contexts in Georgia (including wider health system effects, intended or not).  To achieve this goal, we will engage with policymakers and programme managers during the process of designing and developing the intervention. By doing so we will ensure that the design is theory-led, engage policy makers from an early stage and develop and document the iterative and participative learning process between policy makers and researchers.  As well as informing policy in Georgia, the results are expected to enrich global policy debates on RBF and TB programming, including through public-private partnerships, as well as feeding into academic debate on how to combine realist evaluation techniques with trials and cost-effectiveness analysis.</narrative>
