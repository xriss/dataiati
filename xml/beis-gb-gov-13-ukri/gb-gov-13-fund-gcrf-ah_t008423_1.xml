   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This research network will look at the discourses about the problem of pollution from solid waste plastic materials - especially those with a short service life - and how these narratives translate into regulation, other governance initiatives and voluntary approaches - in other words, action. It will look at the way in which the story about plastics waste is told and how that leads to policy and regulation. Despite the popular call towards a &apos;no-plastics&apos; future, a world without plastics is unimaginable. The challenge is to deal with the escape of waste plastics in a way which does not allow waste to escape into the environment but enhances a circular economy in plastics - a closed-loop system where end-of-service-life plastic objects become a resource and thus reduce waste plastics to as near zero as possible. The use of plastics since their rise in popularity over the past 50-60 years has now presented the world with what can only be described as a &apos;Wicked Problem&apos; - a problem combining technical and social complexity where traditional solutions do not work and which are not solvable by any single discipline. Take, for example, the problem of wet wipes which are the cause of 93% of sewage blockages. A simple regulatory solution would be to ban them as in the recent UK ban on micro-plastic beads in cosmetics. But this would lose a valuable and useful commodity as shown by the example of bans on plastic bags which have been implemented in a number of African and other developing countries.  Seeking a multidisciplinary solution which combines technical solutions, such as using a different material with all the properties of current wet wipes, driven by regulatory sanctions and changes in consumer behaviour can achieve a long-lasting result which has environmental advantages as well as societal gains. It is only through a truly multidisciplinary approach that a &apos;zero&apos; plastic waste solution can be approached.  It is the case that some reactions to the problem of single-use plastics and the way they affect the environment as graphically displayed, for example, in the BBC series, Blue Planet II, have been to ban plastics and to replace them by other materials which may also be abandoned once used and may be just as harmful to the environment in the long term. So why are some countries seeking solutions which miss the heart of the problem? The danger from such a reactive approach is to transfer the problems caused by our consumption and production patterns down the line while thinking that the problem of waste in the environment has been solved.  Bans on the importation of certain plastics waste by DAC-listed countries may control the problem in the interim but not solve it for the future.  Yet, at the same time, the public awareness escalated by such imagery on the media is good in that it raises the attention of policymakers and legislators to the need to find solutions.  What is a problem about it is that it may cause such groups of regulators to take quick and easy steps which appear to solve this wicked problem.  So this project intends to investigate the way in which the message about plastics pollution is being delivered around the world, especially in DAC-listed countries where particular problems arise from importation of plastics waste from high consuming countries, and how that translates into regulatory and governance action so that lessons can be learned as to how to deal effectively with such wicked problems as plastics waste. The network will share knowledge and experiences on the analysis of the way in which the message about plastics waste is developed and delivered so as to contribute to the long-term solution of this wicked problem.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="1. Establish cooperation and knowledge exchange among diverse actors cutting across North-South boundaries in the governance of plastics pollution and the media imagery surrounding this problem 2. Structure dialogue among members and foster open information and knowledge sharing 3. Provide a forum to support inter-disciplinary innovation in addressing the global sustainable development challenge (SDG 12) of plastics waste pollution 4. Provide a forum to share information and knowledge about media imagery and campaigns regarding plastics waste 5. Provide a forum to showcase and discuss plastics governance systems and their outcomes and how these have been driven by the discourse surrounding the problem of plastics waste 6. Ensure that gender is recognised as a key element in the management of plastics waste and to exchange information about current inequalities of outcome where solutions are proposed on how to govern plastics waste in a local context. In particular, to engage with the communities affected and share their lived experience, measures and interventions to address issues of marginalisation. 7. Target dissemination to diverse groups from global to local about appropriate plastics pollution governance information and show how the intersection between the message and the outcome operates in different worldwide contexts. 8. Identify, assess and disseminate information on new innovative circular tools and knowledge for plastics pollution governance and share knowledge and information about how the circular plastics economy is reflected in different media messages and imagery 9. Involve key stakeholders with special emphasis on women and young people with a view to including innovative dialogues leading to imaginative interventions leading to long-term future impact."></capital-spend>
