   <narrative xml:lang="EN">GCRF GlobalSeaweed* - Safeguarding the future of seaweed aquaculture in developing countries</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">GCRF GlobalSeaweed* will be a 4-year, challenge-led, strategic programme in collaboration primarily with the Philippines, Indonesia and Tanzania. We will provide practical solutions and long term capacity building though to many other seaweed-producing DAC-list countries through the GCRF GlobalSeaweed* Fund. This programme is built upon the foundations laid by the NERC International Overseas Fund GlobalSeaweed Programme, however, this new programme will be entirely focused on the needs of seaweed-producing DAC-list countries (unlike GlobalSeaweed, which focused on cutting-edge research and knowledge gaps on seaweed cultivation in the UK).  GlobalSeaweed* has a strong policy component, thus enabling us to directly supports 10 out of the 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals. The key objectives for GCRF GlobalSeaweed* are: (i) Challenge-led and problem-focused disciplinary and interdisciplinary research  This will be based on 4 key work packages (WPs), with an initial 6-month training period in UK Partner Institutes for DAC-list Partners (DPs), including x3 Co-Is and x12 early career researchers (Months (M) 0-12). This will be followed by 3 year research programmes, based in the Philippines, Indonesia and Tanzania (M12-48). The 4 work packages will include:  WP1 - Disease and Pest Detection; WP2 - Biosecurity: Farm Management &amp; Legislation;  WP3 - Characterisation, conservation and exploitation of algal genetic resources towards crop improvement; and  WP4 - Socio-Economic Resilience.  These work packages will support excellent science and innovation that is directly driven by the needs of our DPs. The WPs will also be delivered by a highly interdisciplinary team derived from international experts in algal biology, aquatic pathology, disease and pest taxonomy and policy development, to provide a unique opportunity to build research capacity in DAC-list countries and the UK. (ii) Strengthened support for international research collaboration, enabling reactivity to emerging crises and disseminating expertise to other DAC-list countries. The GCRF GlobalSeaweed* Fund will provide 100 travel grants (&#xA3;2k each) and 20 research/ innovation grants (average &#xA3;35k per grant) through a competitive process to applicants from UK and DAC-list countries (M3-42) to provide an agile response to crises (for example, disease and pest outbreaks), where an urgent research need is demonstrated.  (iii) Building capacity through online, open-access and mobile, web-enabled and face-to-face training to empower the seaweed sector globally at all career stages. A MSc-level module will be developed through an existing international Erasmus Mundus Master programme, open-access training materials and a UN Food and Agriculture Organisation technical paper will be produced. Training materials will be accessible to all seaweed-producing DAC-list countries (M24-48).  (iv) Engagement with researchers, governments, industry and NGOs through three targeted &apos;Sharing Best Practice&apos; events in the DPs and the production of brochures, flyers and posters (M24,30,36) and more globally through the organisation of; (a) special sessions at international conferences (M6,24,42);  (b) publication of peer-reviewed open access, high impact scientific papers (M36-48);  (c) the production of three national science-based policy briefs and one international overarching Policy Brief, in collaboration with the United Nations University - Institute for Water, Environment and Health to provide recommendations on legislation, biosecurity and farm management practices (M36-48) and a FAO Technical report on disease and pest identification and biosecurity protocols (M42-48); and  (d) a fully-updated Online Atlas of Seaweed Diseases and Pests to minimise crop losses and inform policy (M4-48).</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The seaweed cultivation industry is the fastest-growing of all aquaculture sectors, with an annual growth rate of 10% and a value in excess of $5bn. 95% of this cultivation is undertaken by developing countries. Worldwide, seaweed farming provides income to &apos;millions of families&apos; in rural coastal communities and has enabled women to become economically active for the first time, in areas where few opportunities exist. Yet outbreaks of seaweed disease and pests are threatening this industry, leading to dramatic (&gt;15%) declines in yield, notably in three major seaweed-producing developing countries - the Philippines, Tanzania and Indonesia and is having catastrophic socio-economic impacts on the communities reliant on seaweed production. In the Philippines alone, losses over US$ 100 million a year were attributed to disease, representing 15% of their farmed seaweed production and similar reductions have been seen in Tanzania and Indonesia.  OUR VISION for the Global Challenge Research Fund (GCRF) GlobalSeaweed* programme, therefore, is to grow the research and innovation capability of developing countries engaged in seaweed farming. The GCRF GlobalSeaweed* team will consist of international experts in algal biology, aquatic pathology, disease and pest identification, biosecurity and policy development. It will be a 4-year programme, primarily collaborating with senior seaweed specialists in the Philippines, Indonesia and Tanzania, but we envisage working with many other seaweed producing developing countries through the establishment of a GCRF GlobalSeaweed* Fund, enabling rapid action to emerging crises in the seaweed industry &amp; fostering further international cooperation.  GCRF GlobalSeaweed* aims to address three key &apos;Development Challenges&apos; directly linked to the United Nations Sustainability Development Goals and these include:   Challenge #1: Secure and resilient food systems supported by sustainable aquaculture - develop innovative new detection methods for key yield-limiting seaweed diseases and pests on cultivation sites and in the wider environment and legislation/ biosecurity measures to prevent their introduction and spread: We will focus on identification of emergent diseases and pests and the development of early warning, risk-based detection protocols and robust national and international policies to ensure the security and resilience of this industry in developing countries. Challenge #2: Resilience and action on short term environmental shock and long term environmental change - mitigate the sensitivity of seaweeds to fluctuating environmental conditions and climate change: We will empower our overseas partners to develop and test new commercial strains for increased resistance to the key yield-limiting diseases and pests under conditions of environmental change and embed the knowledge gained into practical farm management protocols to ensure maximum yield at the farm sites. Challenge #3: Sustainable livelihoods supported by strong foundations, infrastructure and gender equality for sustainable economic growth and innovation - understand the socio-, political and institutional landscapes in our overseas partners regarding biosecurity, gender equality and risk management: We will work closely with local communities and national governments to develop a robust approach to policy development to promote sustainable economic growth of the seaweed industry in these countries.   Through addressing these challenges, GCRF GlobalSeaweed* will not only produce excellent scientific research, but train 24+ early career researchers, develop open access training materials and an unprecedented digital Atlas of Seaweed Disease and Pests, protocols, international technical and policy papers in collaboration with the FAO and United Nations University and organise special sessions at international conferences and sharing best practice events in collaboration with our overseas partners.</narrative>
