   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This impact and engagement project focuses on practical interventions that will support the sustainable livelihoods of the visual art community and capacity in the creative industries in in East Africa, an international development priority. It will do this through engagements that respond to the needs, ambitions and priorities articulated by visual art professionals and the organisations that support them.  These priorities are also set out in government policy and development reports on the creative economy in East Africa commissioned by the British Council.    Extended evidence-gathering has identified that a deficit in skills, experience and capacity in art curating is a significant constraint to the development of a flourishing and sustainable visual art ecology. As well as providing an intellectual framework and context for East African art, curators source funding for exhibitions, document and bring publicity to the work of creative artists, assist artists with essential elements of professional development. They are job creators and market movers. They bring attention to artists, some who might otherwise not become recognised, or are unable to meet the barriers to entry to the professional art world. They present artists to potential buyers and give them vital exposure. A resource of experienced curators will lead to an increase in not just the quantity but also the quality of exhibitions. A deficit of curatorial skills therefore constrains the role and capacity of the visual arts within the cultural economy.   Balanced against this, young curators are eager for opportunities. The  enthusiasm and energy for practical initiatives is evidence that emergent generations in the visual art community - already identifying themselves as key future players in the creative economy, will respond enthusiastically to opportunities offered to assist their professional development.  The project has been co-designed during workshops organised as part of the AHRC-GCRF funded research network &apos;Networking New Opportunities for Artists in East Africa&apos;.  This has brought together visual art professionals from diverse backgrounds, including artists living and working in deprived areas to collaboratively scope interventions that will support the sustainable development of their livelihoods. The network&apos;s activities focus on identifying pragmatic approaches to shared problems, practical initiatives that will impact directly on real life experiences and make definable contributions to building capacity for visual art activity in the creative economy, thus working towards EAC and international development goals.  The project team comprising Makerere and Newcastle Universities, visual arts organisation 32 Degrees East, Ugandan Arts Trust, the British Council and Kampala Arts Trust have collaborated on plans that will benefit not just curators, but the wide visual art community including artists, writers, technicians and gallerists and the wider public. If features a pilot project developing entrepreneurial and business skills in curators.  This innovative approach to nurturing emergent voices in the visual arts, fostering a new generation of artistic curators and providing them a public platform is structured around a year-long activity programme that includes exhibition making, workshops, mentoring and audience engagement.  Members of the visual art community will be equipped with the key skills, knowledge and experience which are currently lacking and which will assist them in the development of sustainable livelihoods.  The project develops its impacts within a context where the importance of supporting visual art professionals and growing the creative economy has been recognised through measures such as the passing of the Creative and Cultural Industries Bill (2015), but where government support remains minimal. The impacts that will derive from this project are therefore urgent and vital.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="This project&apos;s overarching aim is to support the development of sustainable livelihoods within the visual art community and build capacity in the creative industries in in East Africa. It aims to do this through scalable and sustainable engagements that respond to the needs, ambitions and priorities of visual art stakeholders. The challenges facing the visual art community have been set out in East African government and official reports. To explore these challenges, and scope possible solutions, a new AHRC-GCRF funded network &apos;Networking New Opportunities for Artists in East Africa&apos; (NOFA) was formed in 2018.  NOFA drew on priorities set out in a British Council scoping report and on evidence of development needs of the community gathered by NOFA&apos;s participants to generate practical ideas for building sustainable livelihoods and capacity within the visual art community. NOFA aims to define and develop plans for focussed and pragmatic activities that can improve the livelihoods of the visual art community. A significant outcome of NOFA proceedings is a shared understanding, grounded in evidence (Standing, &apos;Scoping Visual Art in East Africa&apos;, British Council, 2014), that a deficit in art curating skills is a constraint to the development of a sustainable and flourishing visual art ecology and impedes the development of sustainable careers for a wide range of art professionals.  This Follow on Funding for Impact and Engagement project aims to address this through a year-long hands-on programme of collaboratively designed and delivered engagements including mentoring, exhibition making, knowledge exchange, professional development and audience engagement. Its objectives are to 1) Foster a new generation of E African curators, assisting them acquire new skills, knowledge and confidence. Nurture, through mentoring by senior curators and professionals with in-depth knowledge of the local and wider context, a small group of early career curators and support them in the design, development and delivery of new public art exhibitions.   2) Use the exhibitions curated by the project as a platform to exhibit and promote the work of East African artists and art writers, including those engaged in innovative practices such as making work within non-traditional settings or modes of production such as digital platforms, performance, installation, or engaging with challenging subject matter such as complex identities. 3) Collaborate with existing art organisations in Kampala to ensuring that sustainable working relationships with this group of curators can be developed that will last beyond the funding period  4) Develop a pilot project that aims to link entrepreneurial and project management skills with curatorial skills, assisting participants gain freelance employment 5) Strengthen a wider network of art professionals in E Africa who engage with curating (as artists, art managers, clients) through participation at two workshops. so that those participating in the project are well positioned to use their newly acquired skills and experience to engage new audiences and markets, benefit their peers in the visual art community and the next generation of art professionals, and establish relationships with new stakeholders, thus contributing to the aims of building capacity for the visual arts in the creative industries in East Africa. 6) Engage new and wider audiences, including potential clients and sponsors, both commercial and institutional as well as the art consuming public, thus establishing new relationships with stakeholders who will help build support for the development of the creative industries in E. Africa.    Through these engagements, the project aims to impact positively on the livelihoods of visual art professionals, on arts organisations, and on the public who consume art, contributing to a more professionalised and confident visual art community, and a stronger visual art ecology in East Africa."></capital-spend>
