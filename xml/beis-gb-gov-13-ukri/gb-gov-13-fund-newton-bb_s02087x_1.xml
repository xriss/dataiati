   <narrative xml:lang="EN">UK-China Agritech Challenge: Environmentally Benign Combination Biopesticides - Transforming Pest Control in Chinese and UK Agriculture</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Environmentally benign fungal pathogens and naturally insecticidal plant extracts could offer a sustainable alternative to synthetic chemical pesticides. Fungal control does not have many of the problems associated with conventional control such as pest resistance, toxicity to humans and persistence in the environment. One downside to such a technology is that it can be slow acting to achieve effective control. The aim of this project is to create a formulation combining fungal pathogens with the pesticidal plant extracts to create effective pest control with two non-synthetic control agents. This solution will be applicable in developing countries such as China where the materials can be locally produced. Creating a new product with these technologies may confer additional benefits as the modes of action may work in synergy to achieve greater pest control with less material required. Additional benefits to using these biopesticides would be the stimulation the growth of this market, provision of safer working conditions, creating job opportunities and allowing local growers to receive a greater return for their produce by conforming to EU regulations on pesticide use. We anticipate that this will have considerable benefits for the ecosystems in which they are applied due to reduced impacts on non-target insects such as pollinators. From a scientific and cultural perspective this would open-up opportunities for other pathogen-botanical extract formulations to be developed and increase awareness of alternative solutions in pest control, encouraging growers and industry to move away from synthetic chemical control. The project will involve laboratory testing of the plant extracts and fungal pathogens for potentially synergistic, antagonistic or additive effects when controlling pest populations, formulated blends of plant extracts with the fungal pathogen in a concentration identified as effective in laboratory assays and field testing on crops in China. In field and laboratory testing the incidence of target pests, damage caused and the impact on beneficial insects (i.e. pollinators and natural enemies of the pests) will be monitored. A report will be prepared with a plan for future research required and a plan for the exploitation of this new technology. The project will be a collaboration between the Natural Resources Institute and Eurorganic Ltd in the UK and Fujian Agriculture &amp; Forestry University and Jiangxi Tian-Ren Ltd in China.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The volume of synthetic pesticide use in China is enormous with applications exceeding 1.2 X 109 kg/annum. While this overall scale is in line with China being the world&apos;s largest agricultural producer, the exposure of people to pesticide is much greater owing to the fact that farming is typically small holder. The Chinese government has prioritised the development and uptake of environmentally benign pest management technologies across all sectors of agriculture. Botanical pesticides and Entomopathogenic Fungi (EPF) both offer effective, alternatives which pose less threat to the environment and human health. These technologies can underpin a more sustainable pest control solution for farmers. However, despite their potential many farmers do not consider them as a viable alternative to synthetic pesticides owing to their short term efficacy (botanical extracts) or slow action (EPF). This has led to slow global uptake of this technology, with China lagging behind more economically developed EU countries.   The overarching objective of this project is to develop a combination pesticides that has the rapid knockdown of the botanical pesticide and the persistence of the fungi. This will overcome the limitations of each pesticide and offers an opportunity to garner larger scale uptake among farmers. We will explore the impact of the new technology against beneficial insects including pollinators and natural enemies to identify its compatibility with existing integrated pest management strategies. The approach is likely to be applicable in both developing and developed countries but will see particular benefit for the former as the entire manufacture of these products can be completed locally. The shift away from conventional pesticides to the use of more environmentally benign technologies will enable growers in developing countries access to safer produce and the ability to command a higher price to international markets. Main and specific Objectives for the project (in priority order) are: 1. Laboratory based biological evaluation of botanical-EPF combination pesticides to determine  a. optimal application rates  b. relative sensitivity of different target pests of Brassicas and strawberry c. potential additive or synergistic properties  d. minimum effective doses e. relative persistence to understand frequency of application required f. effects of combined formulations on pollinators and natural enemies i. direct toxicity cf. synthetics ii. behaviour modifying effects  2. Formulation of combined pyrethrum-EPF pesticide a. Scale up formulation production b. Evaluate formulations in field trials on strawberry and Brassicas (in China) c. Assess field impacts of pesticides applications on natural enemies and pollinators  d. Measure improvements to quality and yield of agricultural produce. 3. Pathways to impact  a. Disseminate results of laboratory and field work oriented to both scientific peers and commercial stakeholders and policy makers b. Identify route to market for the product in China  c. Identify route to market for the product in worldwide.  4. Capacity building for both UK and overseas partners through participatory scientific work in laboratory and field including a. Experimental assessment of bioactivity in laboratory and field for China graduate students  b. Evaluation of environmental impacts of biological pesticides  c. Scientific writing for research and policy d. Mechanisms and approaches to commercialisation</narrative>
