   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The current proposal aims to implement a new approach to fieldwork in Egypt by looking at the broad spectrum of history - up until the present day - at multi-layered sites, including efforts to preserve heritage rather than only researching it. The project will undertake and develop a sustainable conservation policy for archaeological sites using the Asyut region in Middle Egypt, and the village of Shutb in particular, as a case-study. Rather than merely looking upon archaeological sites as salvage missions or narrow-eyed academic pursuits, the project supports local interests to better the lives of local communities so that they can function as working partners in preserving the site.  The employed methodology promotes (1) better integration of preservation and heritage management methodologies and specialists into archaeological fieldwork projects, (2) coordination and collaboration amongst different institutions and agencies concerned with heritage preservation, (3) engaging with local communities, local heritage professionals and other stakeholders through training and capacity building by hands-on experience and implementation of projects.   To achieve these goals, the British Museum will collaborate with an interdisciplinary team of Cairo-based consultants, staff of Cambridge University and local stake holders to develop a set of protection measures in order to uphold Shutb&apos;s archaeological value, to prevent further decay of the historic fabric and to enhance the socio-economic (living) conditions of the inhabitants. Two seasons of fieldwork in Shutb will include a series of surveys and meetings to assess the impact and perception of the village&apos;s presence on the archaeological remains and identify and prioritise meaningful ways of intervention.  Further efforts to engaged local communities will focus on capacity building through documentation and training linked to tangible results - seeking to enable the next generation of curators to have skills to deliver such documentation themselves. Such engagement will facilitate the education of local communities about the value of the archaeology beneath them. Many of the defined threats to heritage also negatively affect people&apos;s health, such as proximity to garbage disposal and ground and water pollution. The gathered survey data will be used to define programmes to reduce and redirect garbage dumping and improve waste and water management systems of residential units to reduce ground pollution and increase personal health. Depending on the outcome of the community meetings and interviews; the project will develop solutions to the community&apos;s most pressing needs.   Such an all-inclusive approach has never been tested in Egypt, where fieldwork has traditionally been physically and intellectually separated from the surrounding environment and communities. It is, however, an opportune moment to develop more sustainable methodologies as ancient tells are at risk from the forces of nature and the impact of social, political, and economic change. Through collaboration with the Ministry of Antiquities, the impact of the established methodology can be accelerated if implemented at other sites or -even more fundamentally- incorporated into governmental strategies.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="The main objectives of the proposal are to increase the effectiveness and impact of established methodologies and policies to document and preserve Egypt&apos;s unique heritage, and enhance the quality of life, health and creative output of rural communities so that they become working partners in preserving this heritage.   The employed methodology will contribute to the following specific outcomes:  1. Shutb&apos;s endangered cultural heritage is researched, documented, and plans for further conservation are made to prevent permanent loss of the historic fabric.  2. Better coordination and collaboration amongst different institutions and agencies (local/international) concerned with heritage preservation.  3. Local stake holders have acquired specialist skills to develop a set of protection measures in order to better to uphold the site&apos;s archaeological value, which will benefit the local economy and enhance the socio-economic (living) conditions of the inhabitants.   4. Local inhabitants of Shutb are able to value their cultural heritage and identify meaningful ways of intervention to protect their cultural heritage and the role it plays on society and the economy. Depending on the outcome of the community meetings and interviews, the project will have developed sustainable solutions to the community&apos;s most pressing needs and define programmes to reduce and redirect garbage disposal and improve waste management systems of residential units to reduce ground pollution and increase personal health.  5.     Providing learning tools and publications outlining strategies. Through collaboration with the Ministry of Antiquities, the impact of the established methodology can be accelerated if implemented at other sites or -even more fundamentally- incorporated into governmental strategies. Such an all-inclusive approach has never been tested in Egypt, where fieldwork has traditionally been physically and intellectually separated from the surrounding environment and communities."></capital-spend>
