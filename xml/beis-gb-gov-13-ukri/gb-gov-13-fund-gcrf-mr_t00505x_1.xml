   <narrative xml:lang="EN">A randomised controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate a scalable active case finding primary care-based intervention for tuberculosis using a point-of-care</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">HYPOTHESIS: Community-based active case finding (ACF) using Gene Xpert OMNI (in a low cost scalable mini-mobile clinic) performed at point-of-care (POC) is feasible and more effective (proportion of TB cases failing to initiate treatment especially if they are &apos;super-spreaders&apos; i.e. highly infectious) than Xpert performed in a centralised laboratory.   SPECIFIC AIMS:   Aim 1: To conduct a controlled trial (screening 16875 and randomising 3375 participants) to evaluate the multi-country feasibility and impact of an ACF intervention using Gene Xpert OMNI at POC (compared to ACF with centralised testing) employing a low-cost scalable mobile mini-clinic using a Nissan panel van manned by 3 healthcare workers.  Sub aim 1.1: To evaluate the feasibility (concordance with lab-based testing and user appraisals) of performing Gene Xpert OMNI (Xpert) by minimally trained health care workers in different settings at POC. Sub aim 1.2: To evaluate the impact of ACF using Xpert OMNI when placed at POC versus centralised placement [the primary outcome will the proportion experiencing pre-treatment loss to follow up (defined as test positive patients failing to initiate treatment within 60 days) and/ or the proportion of highly infectious patients (smear positive/ cavitory disease) not initiating treatment within 14 days of diagnosis].  Significance and impact: At present 50% of the TB caseload remain undiagnosed in the community and these cases serve as transmission sentinels that drive the epidemic. Xpert will be a simple and user-friendly approach to intensive case finding. The primary outcome measure is a surrogate of transmission and disease amplification (especially of the &apos;missed&apos; highly infectious cases). The intervention package remains untested in a multi-country setting. Determining the precise optimal location of Xpert is required to optimise the molecular-based ACF model.  Aim 2: To bio-phenotype microbiologically confirmed but minimally symptomatic TB patients who are detected as part of an ACF strategy using microbiological characteristics, and novel cough aerosol and imaging technologies (these aspects will be compared to a cohort already recruited and detected through passive case finding). Sub aim 2.1: To quantify the infectiousness of untreated TB cases in the community using novel cough aerosol sampling technology (CASS). Sub aim 2.2.: To quantify disease extent using imaging [chest x-ray (in all and using computer-assisted diagnosis; CAD) and PET-CT in all Xpert positive patients (~100) at the Cape Town site. Sub aim 2.3: To describe the host (clinical, radiological) and M.tb-specific microbiological characteristics in the same patients (these will include CASS, mycobacterial load, and strain-typing using WGS).   Significance and impact: Aim 2 will allow us, for the first time, to accurately model the impact of our intervention on disease burden taking into account transmission. The characteristics of index cases who drive transmission in the community has, hitherto, not been comprehensively characterised. Novel imaging characteristics will allow us to accurately benchmark transmission potential and will shed light on the evolutionary biology of why highly infectious persons with TB remain minimally symptomatic? Urine and serum will be bio-banked for triage-based bio-marker studies (to be funded separately).   Aim 3: To model cost effectiveness of an ACF strategy using Xpert when located at POC (battery-operated in a mobile van) versus distant from point care (centralised laboratory) factoring in transmission of TB.   Significance and impact: Our study design will enable for the time, the factoring in of transmission-based disease amplification, into cost-effectiveness calculations. These will be presented within a national context (including  GDP) to show that ACF is highly cost effective (per case diagnosed, and per transmission event prevented) in the broader scheme of national health economics.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">TB remains the foremost infectious disease killer globally. A starling statistic is that 2 out of every 5 TB cases globally (40%) remain undiagnosed and untreated. These &apos;missed&apos; or undiagnosed cases are disproportionately concentrated in large peri-urban &apos;slums&apos; and informal settlements of large cities in Africa and Asia (they are frequently minimally symptomatic but remain infectious). TB will never be brought under control unless this large reservoir of transmission is wiped out. The lack of a sensitive low cost same-day test represented a major challenge to active community-based case finding (ACF) compared to the current model where patients &apos;self-seek&apos; care (passive case finding). More recently, sensitive TB DNA-detection tests called Gene Xpert (Xpert) have become available. Small portable battery-operated versions of these tests are now available (OMNI). We conducted a large study in South Africa and Zimbabwe (published in 2016) that showed that using the old non-portable version of Xpert on a mini-truck equipped with a generator was feasible and highly effective for ACF. In a subsequent study funded by the American government (XACT II) we showed that using the portable version of Xpert on the back of a small low-cost scalable panel van (in effect a mobile mini clinic) was feasible and had a very high pick-up rate of TB in peri-urban communities (~10% of those undergoing targeted screening; see preliminary data).   In the proposed study (XACT III) we will use the same approach, but we need to be sure that such a strategy is scalable and feasible in different settings where the challenges and conditions vary. More importantly, we need to methodologically optimise the ACF model. Thus, we need to determine where Xpert (the diagnostic test) should be optimally placed from a physical location point-of-view, i.e. do we really need to install it on the mobile mini clinic, or, can it be located in centralised laboratories (as it is now) with samples being sent to these laboratories? This is a very important question: we know that sending collected sputum samples to centralised laboratories will be much easier as it uses existing infrastructure, however, the downside is between 20 and 40% of patients fail to come back to collect their results (pre-treatment loss to follow-up; PTLF). Using the diagnostic in the mobile mini van (at point-of-care; POC) dramatically reduces this PTLF enabling quick diagnosis and interrupting transmission. To definitively settle the question we need a study using the 2 different strategies to find out which strategy is most cost-effective yet can rapidly pick up the most cases and minimise transmission.  There are 2 other important sub-questions that the study will answer. Chest x-rays, which can identify people at high risk of having TB, can now be automatically read by a computer algorithm (called computer-assisted diagnosis of TB; CAD-TB). It will be very important to know whether mass screening using CAD-TB can triage individuals i.e. narrow the net so that we target the ACF only to those at high risk of having TB. This could save even more money yet be just as effective.  Secondly, a fundamental unanswered question is why individuals with minimal or no symptoms can be highly infectious (transmit disease)? We need to study this phenomenon in greater detail using cough aerosol readouts, chest x rays, and looking at the TB strains. This might provide medical science with the information it needs to design diagnostic or therapeutic interventions to address this important problem.   However, the key priority now is to show that the XACT approach is feasible in different settings and to clarify how the molecular diagnostics should be optimally located. Answering these questions will allow the initiation of ACF programmes in many countries and will contribute critical data to policy makers so that guidelines on ACF can be disseminated and implemented.</narrative>
