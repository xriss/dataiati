   <narrative xml:lang="EN">An integrated genomics/genetics approach for development of mungbean varieties with improved disease resistance</narrative>

  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Pulses, are edible grains (seeds) of leguminous crops i.e. peas, beans and lentils, and are a staple food source for the majority of India&apos;s 1.3 billion people. Pulses are a main source of non-meat protein in the diet for approximately 1/3 of the Indian population, with demand growing due to the expanding Indian population. Pulses have a high protein content (23%), are also rich in dietary fibre, B vitamins, and minerals, particularly iron, potassium, magnesium and zinc, and are low in fat. Despite being high in iron, iron-induced anaemia has remained a top cause of disability in India for the past decade. Therefore, pulses offer significant nutritional and health benefits that supplement wheat and rice based diets of the poor, including the vegetarian populations of India and other countries across Asia. Like other legumes, pulse crops are able to fix atmospheric nitrogen through their symbiotic association of specialized root bacteria that can improving soil fertility (green manure) for subsequent crops that contribute to the higher yields of succeeding cereal crops such as wheat or rice, thus reducing fertilizer requirements and thus impact on the environment by reducing greenhouse gas emission and water pollution. Mungbean, is one the most important pulse crops grown and consumed in India. Locally it is known as green gram, and is an ancient crop that was domesticated in India some 3,5 million years ago, and currently ranks third among all pulses grown within India after chickpeas and pigeonpeas. It is a versatile crop that only takes 60-65 days to harvest; in addition, mungbeans are not only grown for their seeds but also as forage (fodder for cattle). However, demand for mungbean, in India significantly exceeds current Indian production levels, where India now directly imports mungbean to meet its demand. And although high yielding mungbean varieties are available, lack of productivity has contributed to Indian food insecurity (the state of being without reliable access to a sufficient quantity of affordable, nutritious food) and malnutrition of the poorest populations. Indian farmers generally see less than half of the mungbean yield potential of these higher yielding varieties, which is often due to the yield reducing mungbean diseases that include Cercospora leaf spot and powdery mildew. Therefore, this collaborative project of partners based in India (BHU and OUAT) and RRes will tackle the these two most economically damaging fungal diseases. We will take an integrated approach that will involve the most up to date genetics (study of genetic variation) and genomics (study of genetic material) tools will be employed to aid development of new mungbean varieties that have improved disease resistance. We will characterise the genetic composition using DNA sequencing technology of both the fungal pathogens responsible for these diseases and mungbean varieties that will allow us to pinpoint the regions of the DNA that contribute for pathogenicity (causes disease) and for disease resistance of the pathogens and the plant, respectively. Using this knowledge, we will use state of the art biotechnology tools to engineer broad spectrum, and likely durable disease resistance into new varieties. Therefore, the results of this project will provide us a wealth of novel fundamental information on how the disease-causing fungus interacts with the mungbean plant, will help inform the best disease management strategies and help plant breeders to produce disease resistant mungbean varieties.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project will address the key issue of susceptibility to the economically damaging diseases of mungbean, one of the three most popular pulse crops in India. Some years see significant reduction of mungbean quality and yield by over 40% due to diseases such as Cercospora leaf spot and powdery mildew. The partnership between Rothamsted Research in the UK, and BHU and OUAT in India, will tackle these two most serious and economically damaging fungal diseases of mungbean through an integrated approach. We will aim to gain an in depth knowledge of the biology of the pathogens inducing these diseases including at the full genome level, to develop novel molecular genetics and genomics tools for mungbean disease resistance breeding, and to utilise powerful emerging technologies such as RNA-interference/Host-induced gene silencing and genome editing to engineer broad-spectrum resistance to these economically damaging diseases of mungbean.  The following main objectives will be pursued in this project:    1. Develop a map of Cercospora leaf spot and powdery mildew diseases across all main mungbean growing regions in India.    2. Assess genetic race structure and pathogenicity in the current natural population of Cercospora canescens to inform best Cercospora leaf spot management strategies.    3. Develop a reference genome sequence for the current Cercospora canescens isolate representing the most prevalent race to allow identification and future characterization of key pathogenicity related genes.    4. Genetically characterise the mungbean germplasm and two reference mapping population using genotyping by sequencing, and identify markers that can be used to accelerate disease resistance breeding.    5. Evaluate efficiency of stable Host-induced gene silencing (HIGS) for achieving broad-spectrum resistance against Cercospora canescens in mungbean.    6. CRISPR/Cas genome editing (the Mlo gene) for broad-spectrum resistance against powdery mildew.  Hypotheses to be tested:    - that certain races of Cercospora canescens prevail either throughout India or in specific mungbean growing areas of India    - that GWAS can be used to pinpoint genetic loci in the pathogen that contribute to pathogenicity toward mungbean    - that resistance to Cercospora leaf spot and powdery mildew in mungbean is controlled by major resistance genes and/or major disease resistance QTLs, and these can be identified through GBS and GWAS    - that HIGS can be used to control Cercospora canescens    - that powdery mildew can be effectively controlled by knocking-out Mlo gene in mungbean</narrative>
