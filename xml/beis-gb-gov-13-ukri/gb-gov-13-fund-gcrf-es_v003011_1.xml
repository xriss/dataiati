   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The aim of the Unite4Resilience network is to build capacity for collaborative decision-making across government institutions to promote the creation of resilient environments and communities against the increasing climate change risks, giving due consideration to poor and vulnerable. It plans to co-create knowledge and promote learning among researchers, practitioners and policy makers from different institutions with a view to injecting impetus to transform the current silo-based approach to a  collaborative decision-making approach to producing  innovative solutions for combating complex climate related risks, giving due consideration to equitable resilience and ecological integrity.  The knowledge and capacity that will result from this network will allow organisations to make sound risk trade-offs by considering various conflicting and supporting narratives such as social justice, economic growth, ecological integrity, the health and wellbeing of citizens, long term food and water security, etc. 

The key objectives: 
1.	To establish a network of key actors from the research community, practitioners from government institutions and policy makers and get their buy-in to engage in the network activities to implement a multi-stakeholder approach for building equitable climate resilience.  

2.	Diagnose the limitations of the current decision-making processes in considering disaster risks, especially on poor and vulnerable communities, due to increasing climate change impacts.

3.	Build a collective vision, identifying key challenges and required capacity and solutions for implementing a collaborative multi-institutional approach for decision-making for building equitable climate resilience. 

4.	Explore relevant research areas and identify priorities. Some examples of research areas are: the city as a complex system, the cascading effect of a disaster, equitable resilience, adaptive governance, advanced technology platforms that can support collaborative consensus building for creating resilient environments and communities, etc.  

5.	Co-design a plan for building institutional capacity for realising the vision through training, mentoring, exchange of staff, knowledge creation workshops, and small and larger projects involving inter-disciplinary teams. This will form the basis for the Network Plus project.

6.	Develop an interdisciplinary research workforce, especially involving researchers who are early in their careers. 

7.	Disseminate the outcome of the network widely.</narrative>
