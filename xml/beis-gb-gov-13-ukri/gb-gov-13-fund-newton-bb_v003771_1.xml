   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The management farmers apply to their land has a significant impact on the health of the surrounding environment and the socio-economic wellbeing of the farmer and their family. A previous Newton Fund project (NUCLEUS) focused on enhancing Nitrogen (an essential plant &amp; soil element) Use Efficiency identified a suite of novel practices, well suited to smallholder famers in northern Brazil, which increased the sustainability and productivity of the tropical agri-systems with low natural fertility. Here we intend to disseminate this new approach more widely which makes use of a variety of ecosystems services to increase crop productivity and soil nutrient use efficiency. These include i) the adoption of a new soil management system (no-till) where farmers avoid the disturbance of soil created by ploughing to retain soil organic matter allowing a more natural, effective soil structure to develop; ii) incorporation of advantageous soil amendments (e.g. leguminous biomass (which adds Nitrogen) and gypsum (which improves soil structure and hence deep rooting); and iii) introducing leguminous trees which enhance soil nutrient cycling and provide added value as a harvestable good. This new approach minimises soil degradation, facilitating repeated cropping of the same area thus removing the need for unnecessary shifting cultivation systems, which have contributed so significantly to deforestation, environmental degradation and poverty via rural to urban migration. To date we have validated this system in partnership with a small network of traditional communities in Maranhao, Brazil by trials on their farms. Now we intend to expand this via knowledge exchange, community events and outreach activities through establishment of new Diffusion Centres (i.e. exemplar farms). By surpassing the barriers which hinder technology uptake by the farmers in the rural community of central-north of Maranh&#xE3;o, we estimate c.150,000 rural families livelihoods can be improved.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposal addresses a crucial issue for the development of poor rural communities in Maranh&#xE3;o, namely the productivity and sustainability of agri-systems with low natural fertility. The overarching objective is to contribute to poverty alleviation of the rural communities by disseminating a new system developed in NUCLEUS. The objectives are: 1) To establish new Demonstrative Units on local farms, located in Northern Maranh&#xE3;o, allowing further dissemination of knowledge about management of infertile tropical lands. 2)To prepare educational materials for smallholder farmers based on the benefits of the new system using contemporary communication strategies including documentary style films, videos that play on smart phones, explanatory booklets and web resources. 3) To host a series of workshops and field days to raise awareness between farmers and stakeholders about the benefits of the new agri-system and how it is utilized to improve income through delivery of harvestable goods.</narrative>
