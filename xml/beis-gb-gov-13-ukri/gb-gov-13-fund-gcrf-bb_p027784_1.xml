   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Agricultural development is fundamental to achieving many of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in Sub-Saharan Africa.   Levels of undernourishment and malnutrition remain high across the region and current trends show a growing gap between the food needs of a growing population and agricultural productivity. Moreover, in a context of changing climates, and, in many areas, increased incidence of extreme and unprecedented events (notably drought and extreme heat, as well as increasingly extreme rainfall and crop pest infestations), the increased risk of crop failures is exacerbating this challenge. Across Africa, governments recognise that agricultural development and transformation needs to be an engine of economic growth and poverty alleviation, particularly where cycles of low productivity (and periodic crop failures), limited access to resources, and small land holdings lock rural households into cycles of poverty.  Agricultural practice must also contribute to the sustaining of soil, water, biodiversity and more, and is increasingly being targeted as a sector within which we must reduce greenhouse gas emissions.   Achieving sustainable and resilient transformations of agriculture and food systems in Africa is a complex and multi-faceted challenge, which requires novel approaches to research and evidence and new policy and institutional enabling environments. This project sets out to collaboratively build the capacities required across research and policy to tackle this multi-faceted challenge, and help avoid the policy paralysis that in some countries led to little or no progress towards the Millennium Development goals.   The project team, which includes the University of Leeds, University of Aberdeen, the UK Met Office, the Food, Agriculture and Natural Resources Policy Analysis Network (FANRPAN) and Chatham House encompasses expertise in agriculture, climate, ecology, soils, water, post-harvest losses, land use, nutrition and health, rural livelihoods, and policy and institutional analysis. FANRPAN is a multi-stakeholder pan-African network whose mission is to build resilient food systems across Africa through the assessment and creation of food, agriculture and natural resources policies that are both evidence-based and developed in partnership with non-state actors.   We will address research and capacity growth under 3 broad themes: (1) how to make agriculture (and food systems) productive as well as resilient to extreme weather whilst minimising impacts on the environment and maximising its contributions to livelihoods, and food and nutrition (2) as the economic and food-security demands on agriculture change over the next decades, and at the same time weather and climate risks change, what are the feasible ways that agriculture can develop to become more productive in order to meet future needs? (3) how can policy be developed that enables potential sustainable, productive, climate-resilient pathways to be realised in the most inclusive way, thus maximising the contribution of agriculture to achieving the SDGs?   Work will be focused in four countries in SSA: Malawi, Tanzania and Zambia -which are low income countries with varied farming systems - and South Africa, which is an upper middle income country. In each country, research and policy capacity will be built through collaborative partnerships across academic institutions, non-governmental organisations, and policy makers. Through FANRPAN and Chatham House&apos; s inter-governmental policy expertise and platforms, we aim to generate lessons learned from our case-study countries and disseminate them across Africa to contribute to capacity building and evidence-based agricultural transformation through the application of a similar model of evidence into policy in other African countries, and at the regional level.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="Our focus is to build capacities for outlining and implementation of agricultural development pathways that contribute towards poverty alleviation and improved nutrition and health, promote economic growth, are resilient to changing climates, and are environmentally sustainable. This directly corresponds to the GCRF Research Agenda on &apos; Secure and resilient food systems supported by sustainable agriculture&apos; , but in focusing on agriculture and food systems in the context of sub-Saharan Africa, such an agenda is inseparable from those of &apos; sustainable health and well-being&apos; ; &apos; Sustainable livelihoods supported by strong foundations for inclusive economic growth and innovation&apos; ; &apos; Resilience and action on short-term environmental shocks and long-term environmental change&apos; ; and &apos; Reduce poverty and inequality, including gender inequalities&apos; ; all of which are directly addressed within the proposal.   The proposed work focuses on 3 LICs - Malawi, Tanzania and Zambia - as well as South Africa (an UMIC), with the aim of generating learning that is applicable and applied across Sub-Saharan Africa. Our principle objective is to enable the design, and uptake, of evidence-based practices and policies that deliver productive, sustainable, resilient agri-food systems: &quot;Climate Smart Agri-food Systems&quot; to allow sustainable development towards the SDGs and beyond. To do this we will undertake research and capacity building to:   1) Develop and analyse an interdisciplinary evidence base for sustainable and resilient agriculture and food system transitions. This includes evidence on: Agricultural techniques (including soil, water, sustainable management of crops and livestock, and post-harvest loss), impacts on livelihoods, analysis of enabling (or constraining) policy and routes to upscaling, characterising weather variability in order to better understand what agriculture needs to be resilient to. 2) Collaboratively define evidence-based sustainable and resilient agricultural and food system development pathways based on land-crop-climate models modified for each country. 3) Contribute towards the policy implementation of, and creation of enabling institutional environments for, sustainable and resilient agricultural and food system development pathways. 4) Generate common lessons for sustainable agricultural development pathways across country-contexts and upscale this learning to a regional and continental level through a range of mechanisms   Achieving these objectives requires capacity building in the UK and in Africa.   Our foundational objectives are to:  1) Develop research partnerships, novel tools, and knowledge exchange infrastructure for UK-African agriculture and food systems research that integrates agricultural, social, political, nutritional, climatic, and ecological understandings to underpin sustainable economic growth. 2) Enhance capacity with national, regional and continental policy makers to use evidence for the development of evidence-based policy. 3) Establish and contribute to mechanisms for evidence communication and policy uptake and evaluation across scales. 4) Train African and UK scholars and research managers, through mutual exchange, to undertake the ambitious, interdisciplinary, cross-scale and policy-oriented research required to address global challenges."></capital-spend>
