   <narrative xml:lang="EN">PEGASUS: Producing EnerGy and preventing hAzards from SUrface water Storage in Peru</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Our overarching aim is to provide the underpinning science required to maximise the opportunities and minimise the risks presented by future surface water storage in glaciated catchments of the Peruvian Andes. Specifically, we aim to address challenges 1, 3 and 5 outlined in the funding call.   Our main objectives and supporting research questions are:  1. To simulate future climate and glacier recession and their impact on mountain environments (Challenge 1)  How will temperature and precipitation evolve on an individual catchment scale in this complex mountain terrain?  At what rate will glaciers recede into the future?  What will the resulting landscape look like, and where and when will new lakes emerge?   How will freezing levels evolve with different warming scenarios?  2. Measure and forecast changes in sediment flux/delivery to downstream areas (Challenge 3)  What are the rates of sediment release by glaciers in active recession?  What is the current capacity of lakes to store sediments released by glacier recession?  Are contemporary rates of sedimentation comparable with those of the recent past?  How will downstream fluvial reaches be impacted by changing sediment dynamics brought about by deglaciation and lake development?  3. Assess future risks presented by glacial lakes and ice/rock avalanches (Challenge 5)  Where will the major hazards be located and what are their likely triggers?  Will the most vulnerable people, defined by socio-economic factors, be located in zones that may be impacted by these hazards?  To what extent will major flood events entrain downstream debris and how will this impact on flood propagation?   Are planned infrastructure projects e.g. hydropower developments, likely to be in zones that may be impacted by glacier hazard and water scarcity events?  4. Balance risks and resources: integrating recommendations for businesses, policy makers and people (Challenges 1, 3 and 5)  Which future lake sites will have the most sustainable water supply and minimum potential for sedimentation and over what timescale?  What are the cultural, social and economic pressures that may be in conflict when creating natural water storage areas in the mountain landscape?  What is the current political context for water storage and exploitation and how may relevant policies account for changes in glacial runoff and landscape evolution  What are the opportunities for resource exploitation in the context of future environmental change?</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Peruvian Andes is home to 71% of the world&apos;s tropical glaciers, and the meltwater they supply is an essential resource for people downstream who depend on it for irrigation and sanitation. Further, hydropower plants driven by glacial meltwater provide more than 40% of Peru&apos;s electricity. However, Peru&apos;s glaciers are receding rapidly, threatening this supply, as well as releasing sediment to valley areas and revealing topographic depressions that may become natural reservoirs for glacier runoff. These thawing landscapes are also very active and can pose risks to downstream people and infrastructure. PEGASUS will assess the opportunities and threats that rapidly evolving landscapes, and natural resources, will bring to the people and businesses of three glacierised Cordilleras of the Peruvian Andes - Urubamba, Vilcabamba and Vilcanota - and make recommendations that will maximise the potential prosperity that can be gained in the face of continued environmental change.   Modelling the climate of mountain catchments such as those in Peru is complex because of the interaction of large-scale weather systems with local-scale winds and extreme relief. Uncertainties in modelling the climate feed into projections of glacier change, which themselves are limited by a lack of data on previous glacier behaviour for calibration, and downstream river flows for validation. Robust climate modelling is also required for predictions of permafrost (freezing) heights, which are a key control on ice and bedrock stability, and thus avalanche risk. PEGASUS will produce new and refined projections of climate that will drive cutting edge glacier and permafrost models, to yield firm predictions of how the glaciers and freezing levels will change on a 5-yearly interval from now until the end of the century.  As the glaciers recede and hillslopes become more active, sediment will be released into the valleys, and lakes will develop where ice existed. Some of the sediment will be trapped within these glacial lakes, and some will be transferred downstream by river flows. The rate of sediment release by glaciers in advanced states of recession is poorly known, and the role of lakes in capturing the sediment is also poorly quantified. PEGASUS will perform field measurements and modelling to improve understanding of the role of glacial lakes in removing, conveying and storing sediment being released from the glaciers, and characterise the impact this will have on downstream water quality and critical hydropower infrastructure.  The locations of future glacial lakes can be predicted by modelling the thickness of the current glaciers and identifying subglacial depressions that will be revealed as the ice recedes. Using a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) of this ice-free terrain, it is possible to make a quantitative assessment of the hazard that these new lakes, as well as existing glacial lakes, pose to downstream areas if they were to burst catastrophically. PEGASUS will carry out this assessment for the largest lakes in the Urubamba-Vicabamba-Vilcanota study area and then undertake additional fine-resolution and physically-based numerical modelling to robustly quantify the effects of flooding and debris flows on people, land, the downstream river dynamics, and hydropower infrastructure.  PEGASUS will then identify the barriers and opportunities that exist to the use of these lakes for water storage and hydropower development. This assessment will integrate consultations with government (CORECC), a large hydropower company (EGEMSA) and, crucially, communities living in the catchments of the lakes we have analysed. The recommendations that follow will provide information on the sustainability of existing and future hydropower schemes, how to manage water use in future decades and formulate policies that reflect the needs of all stakeholders, and the potential hazards that unstable mountain environments may pose to lives and livelihoods in future years.</narrative>
