   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Coronary heart disease (CHD), with myocardial infarction (MI) or &quot;heart attack&quot; as the main manifestation, is the leading cause of death worldwide, and is also the leading cause of death in Malaysia. It is estimated that in Malaysia and other South-East Asian countries, nearly a quarter of CHD events occur in people younger than 50 years, resulting in a significant loss of productive working years due to death and disability. This is why we have deigned a case-control study of acute MI in Malaysia to recruit 5000 participants (2500 MI patients or &quot;cases&quot; aged &lt;50 years and 2500 healthy participants or &quot;controls&quot;). In this study, we will initially investigate the hereditary and lipid-related risk factors of heart attack in Malaysia&apos;s population - which has distinctive features of multi-ethnicity and consanguinity (or intermarriage).   The specific objectives of our proposed study are to:  (1) investigate genetic risk factors of premature heart attack in Malaysia;  (2) evaluate cardiovascular risk factors of specific relevance to the Malaysian population, such as indigenous forms of tobacco consumption and local dietary patterns, with potential implications of results for public health policy; and  (3) create collaborations between Malaysian and UK scientists, who will jointly manage and further harvest the dataset and bioresource of this nationally-important research platform.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="The main objective of this study is to establish the first large-scale CHD bioresource in Malaysia to enable:  (1) assumption-free discovery science that leverages Malaysia&apos;s unique history of multi-ethnicity and consanguinity through genomic studies of MI and cardiometabolic traits, with potential implications of results for downstream studies to elucidate the mechanistic basis of CHD and inform therapeutic target identification and prioritisation;  (2) detailed evaluation of candidate cardiovascular risk factors of specific relevance to the Malaysian population, such as indigenous forms of tobacco consumption and local dietary patterns, with potential implications of results for public health policy; and  (3) enduring collaboration between Malaysian and UK scientists, who will jointly manage and harvest the dataset and bioresource of this distinctive and important research platform."></capital-spend>
