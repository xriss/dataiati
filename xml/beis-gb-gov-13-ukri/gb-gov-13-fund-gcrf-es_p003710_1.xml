   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Objectives The objectives of the project address the Call requirements by improving the capacity and methods for secondary data research and by investigating a novel academic topic, which has a strong non-academic impact for the understanding of economic development and welfare of developing countries. The research aims to address the crucial question of how conflict affects the development of the private sector at a fine-grained spatial level of analysis for a large set of African countries. The findings will shed light on several aspects of the debate on how the occurrence of conflict is able to damage persistently economic growth in developing countries. Specifically, the novel objectives of this research are:  1. Empirically identify the effect of conflict events on entrepreneurial activities with different growth potential, focusing specifically on: (i) Capital investment effect, referring to the extent in which violent conflict constrains entrepreneurs from investing in activities with larger capital investment; (ii) Employment effect, related to how conflict events could affect the size of the entrepreneurial activity; (iii) growth effect: how changes in conflict intensity affect firm growth in size, investment, and profits.  2. Uniquely combine several data sources on household, conflict, ethnic, and nightlight data for a large set of Sub Saharan African countries. This means a substantial matching effort, at the geographical level of grid cells, and the creation of a new dataset accessible to all the researchers interested in the field. 3. Analyse with several advanced econometric techniques the conflict-entrepreneurship relation by accounting for the temporal and spatial variations in the level and composition of investments by exploiting a new panel dataset from Nigeria. 4. Collaborate with academic and non-academic partners to maximize the engagement with, and the dissemination of our findings to a large number of stakeholders. Institute for Peace and Conflict Resolution and Peace Direct will contribute to such dissemination both at the international and at a fine-grained local level, and inform decision making by policy makers in central, national and local governments, trade unions, and the third sector in education and training and their clients (i.e. individuals) about future employment and investment decisions.  5. Ensure top-quality academic outputs, and their dissemination within both relevant academic and policy circles to maximize the policy impact of our findings. This objective will be met relying on SPRU&apos; five decades-long tradition of deriving sound policy implications from quality academic research, and a series of academic events that are planned at SPRU in the next two years.  6. Maximize the benefits of the project in terms of capacity development of two very promising ECRs, with strong micro-econometrics skills, and specialized in different aspects of conflict and individual behavior. By working within the team of senior colleagues and through formal training, the ECRs will deepen and broaden their analytical and econometric skills.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Some scant evidence exists that conflict influences households&apos; investment choices in economic activities, for example by reducing investments in relatively more capital intensive activities and in activities with longer term returns. However it is unclear to what extent such results can be generalized across conflicts and what other factors may affect the direction and intensity of these effects. Beyond the type of investment, it is also not clear how changes in conflict intensity affect the growth of investment and firm size. This research aims to provide comparative evidence by improving our understanding of the impact of violent conflict on investment in entrepreneurial activities with different growth potentials. Methodology will consist in building a new dataset matching and harmonizing household surveys and violent conflict events for fragile and conflict states (FCS) in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). We will investigate how conflict affects the type of private investments by households - type of activity, firm size, and returns to investment - and how institutional, geographical, and individual characteristics influence this entrepreneurial choice. We will also investigate how changes in conflict intensity affect firm growth in size, investment, and profits. This project will make a number of crucial academic and policy contributions. Firstly, it will shift the focus from the effect of conflict on the number of entrepreneurial activities to the composition of entrepreneurial activities with different growth potentials. Secondly, it will improve on the identification of the average effect of conflict on entrepreneurial activity and private sector development at the micro level. Thirdly, it will improve substantially our understanding of the institutional, geographical and conflict related factors that mediate the impact of conflict on entrepreneurial activity. Furthermore, the inclusion of a large set of countries will allow to test for the external validity of these effects across several countries and types of conflict on which no such evidence exists. All these achievement will be obtained through an approach that will credibly identify the causality of conflict on economic activity through the use of a novel instrumental variable strategy and exploiting a new household panel dataset. Lastly, and more importantly, we will be able to test the effect of conflict as a barrier to firm growth in size and investment. This research adds to a debate on pressing social and policy issues: conflict and economic growth. It is therefore particularly relevant not only for the academic community, but also for policy makers, peace builders and peace keepers, NGOs operating in the field, employers, public, social and private enterprises, trade unions, training institutions and young and old members of the workforce that seek and use information on employment and investment decisions. Our dissemination plan ensures that the findings of our research reach all the above stakeholders to inform their decision-making processes.</narrative>
