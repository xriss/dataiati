   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In line with MRC guidance on the development and evaluation of complex interventions a two-phased study will be undertaken to inform the design and conduct of a future full scale RCT.   Objectives:  Phase 1 Exploratory Study   1. To assess the perceived acceptability of implementing a comprehensive policy and fiscal intervention delivered through a school based setting 2. To explore in depth the views, concerns and suggestions of parents of children and school authorities towards interventions delivered in school to reduce SSB consumption. 3. To explore in depth the views and concerns of school going children about the proposed intervention  Phase 2 Feasibility Trial   1. To develop a comprehensive intervention delivered in schools aimed at reducing sugary SSB consumption amongst school going children 2. To undertake a feasibility trial to assess the delivery and evaluation of a comprehensive intervention and in particular the recruitment and retention of subjects, the fidelity of the intervention, distribution of study outcomes and extent of clustering to inform future sample size calculations for future studies 3. To assess through nested process evaluation the acceptability of the intervention to both children and school authorities. 4. To make recommendations on the design, methodology and sample size for a future definitive trial of a multi-component intervention to reduce SSB consumption among children.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The increased consumption of Sugar and Sweetened Beverages (SSBs) is one of the most important reasons for obesity and overweight, dental caries and Type II diabetes. The consumption of SSBs is rapidly increasing among children and adolescents especially in developing countries. This is an important public health issue as majority of the population in developing countries is very young. Governmental bodies around the world are taking increasing action to address the availability of soft drinks in schools through increased taxation on soft drinks or banning their sale in schools. However, the evidence around effects of restricting availability or increasing taxes on SSBs on their consumption and health is still unclear and emerging, it is likely that these actions are being driven by the belief that high-calorie, nutrient-poor drinks no longer have a place in schools, and, moreover, that schools are an appropriate starting point to reduce total consumption of SSBs among youth. In the absence of robust evidence, an intervention cannot be delivered to test the effectiveness of various fiscal policies in reducing SSB consumption among youth. This study will test the acceptability and feasibility of a fiscal intervention delivered through schools to reduce SSB consumption among children and adolescents.</narrative>
