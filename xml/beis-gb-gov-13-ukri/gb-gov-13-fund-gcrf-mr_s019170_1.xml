   <narrative xml:lang="EN">MICA: Development of new agents for the treatment of cryptosporidiosis</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">A recent clinical study in Africa and South Asia has found that cryptosporidiosis is one of the most significant causes of death and illness from diarrheal diseases amongst children in the developing world. Cryptosporidiosis is caused by a single-celled protozoan parasite; the predominant species infecting humans are called Cryptosporidium hominis and Cryptosporidium parvum. This parasite mainly lives in the cells in the gut wall and has a complex life-cycle. Infection occurs due to consumption of water or food contaminated with the parasites. Parasites are spread from an infected individual through their faeces. In people who are healthy and well nourished, the disease clears naturally within a couple of weeks. However, in people who are malnourished (particularly in young children) and people with an immune system that is not functioning properly (for example HIV/AIDS victims), the disease can have a much more significant impact. It is the major contributor to life-threatening diarrhea in young children, with 2.9-4.7 million cases in children under 24 months in sub-Saharan Africa and the Indian sub-continent, leading to more than 200,000 deaths per year. Cryptosporidiosis is also associated with malnutrition and stunted growth in children and probably causes chronic infections, which last for weeks or months. The only drug registered for the treatment of this disease is nitazoxanide, which is not very effective, especially in those patients who are most severely affected due to a weak immune system and/ or malnutrition.   Therefore there is an urgent need for the development of new drugs to treat: (1) children &lt;24 months, especially those that are malnourished and with chronic diarrhea; and (2) immunocompromised children and adults with advanced AIDS and chronic diarrhea. Cryptosporidium may be the cause of as much as 75% of chronic diarrhea in this patient cohort.   We have discovered some chemical starting points that can be used for a drug discovery programme. We have a series of compounds that kill the parasites and also are very effective in clearing the parasites from rodent models of cryptosporidiosis. The compounds are thought to work through preventing the parasite making proteins. The aim of this project is to take these starting points and optimise them to make a molecule which has the potential to be a drug. This will require us to optimise multiple features of the molecule: its ability to kill the parasite, its ability to reach the sites in the body where the parasite resides without being broken down, and its safety. At the end of this project we hope to have a &quot;preclinical candidate&quot;. This is a compound that we think should be suitable to enter human clinical trials. The steps after this project, prior to human clinical trials will be to make the compound on a larger scale under properly defined conditions and to carry out formal safety testing.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The overall objective of this project is to develop a preclinical candidate for cryptosporidiosis.   Our starting points are compounds with activity against cryptosporidiosis in mouse models of infection. The first milestone is to profile the current leads in more detail and gain further understanding of the pharmacokinetic properties required for efficacy in a mouse model of infection. We will also probe further whether inhibition of mammalian KRS will lead to tolerability issues. The outcome of this will be selection of a compound with suitable properties for a calf PK study. The second milestone will be to develop at least two late lead compounds. The third milestone will be a detailed profiling of these late lead compounds to select a preclinical candidate.  Milestone 1, the objectives are:  (1) A clearer indication of whether systemic exposure is required for activity of KRS inhibitors. This will be achieved through measurement of PK/PD (efficacy, systemic exposure, faecal levels) for a variety of compounds (including current front-runners) with different pharmacokinetic properties in mice. (2) A clearer indication of whether inhibition of mammalian KRS is a driver of tolerability,  by correlating free compound levels in mice to the Ki values for mouse KRS at various doses upto the MTD. (3) Development of a variety of methods to predict selectivity for CpKRS over HsKRS. (4) An understanding of how to achieve selectivity for CpKRS over HsKRS. (5) Enzymatic and cellular selectivities &gt;1000 fold. (6) Consistent activity against a range of C. hominis and C. parvum strains: EC50 &lt; 1 micromolar.  The following compound progression criteria will be used, assuming systemic exposure is a driver for efficacy. If PK/PD dictates that systemic levels are not necessary for efficacy then emphasis on some of these progression criteria is reduced:  Microsomal/ hepatocyte clearance in preclinical species and human &lt; 5.0 mL/min/g  No inhibition of the 5 major human CYP450 enzymes:  IC50 &gt; 10 micromolar Measured permeability (PAMPA) &gt; 10 nm/s; ideally &gt; 30 nm/s. Solubility (FASSIF) &gt; 100 micromolar Selectivity against hERG: IC50 &gt; 30-fold free Cmax at minimal efficacious dose Efficacy: a &gt; 2 log-fold reduction in levels of parasite in the faeces when dosed orally b.i.d for 7 days to NOD SCID gamma mice MTD exposure &gt; or equal to exposure at efficacious dose delivering &gt;2 log reduction in levels of parasites in faeces  Milestone 2, the objectives are to develop compounds with the following properties (1) Enzymatic and cellular selectivities &gt;1000 fold. (2) Greater than a 2-fold log reduction in levels of parasites in the faeces when the compound is dosed orally to SCID Null gamma mice twice a day for 7 days. (3) Microsomal/ hepatocyte clearance in preclinical species and human &lt; 1.0 mL/min/g  (4) No major inhibition of the 5 major human cytochrome P450s (IC50 &gt; 10 micromolar) (5) Solubility in fasted state simulated intestinal fluid greater than 100 micromolar (6) Negative in the Ames assay (7) IC50 against the hERG channel &gt; than 30-fold the free Cmax at the minimal efficacious dose. (8) Exposure by AUC at the maximum tolerated dose should be greater than 10-fold the exposure at the minimal efficacious dose. (9) Rat pharmacokinetics consistent with achieving multiples of the minimal efficacious exposure by AUC  Milestone 3, the compound should show the following: (1) Efficacy in the calf model: &gt; 2-fold log reduction in parasite levels in faeces when dosed no more than twice a day for no more that 7 days. (2) No significant warning of adverse effects from a panel of receptors at 10 micromolar. (3) A therapeutic index predicted of greater than 10-fold. This to be derived from the NOAEL in a non-GLP rat 7-day toxicology study. (4) Non-rodent pharmacokinetics consistent with achieving multiples of the minimal efficacious exposure by AUC (5) Compound scaled up to at least 100 g.</narrative>
