   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Children&apos;s Literature in Critical Contexts of Displacement: Exploring how story and arts-based practices create &apos;safe spaces&apos; for displaced children</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The focus of the proposal is to establish a network of academics and children&apos;s literature specialists, who will examine and promote the contribution made by arts-based practices in creating &apos;safe spaces&apos; for displaced children and their families and for developing relationships between migrants and local communities through these arts-based practices. In Egypt and Mexico, both of which are countries with increasing migration flows (including deportations) and numbers of displaced children (many unaccompanied) spaces for sharing books and learning through children&apos;s literature and arts-based activities, have developed in urban and rural areas through government, NGO or volunteer initiatives. The network will benefit from, and has the potential to grow, through international cross and interdisciplinary knowledge exchange with these two countries as well as others on the ODA list through collaborations between arts, humanities and education. Our aim is to bring together academics and third sector partners with expertise in children&apos;s literature, migration and education in the UK, Egypt and Mexico in order to create a network that will build on common expertise and best practice in using children&apos;s literature, storytelling and the arts to help negotiate the current challenges stemming from contexts of flux and precarious resources and also to support the development of sustained international boundary-crossing collaborations.The objectives are as follows:  1. To scope unique practices and identify successful strategies of using children&apos;s literature (with a specific focus on creative local traditions of sharing stories and texts) that can be further examined in order to understand how they create safe spaces and develop relationships between migrants and local communities and promote them within Egypt and Mexico (and via the network, expand them to neighbouring countries);  2. To collaborate on activities that will expand/exchange knowledge on current issues of concern affecting the cognitive and emotional welfare of displaced children, including the issue of understanding and acceptance by local (host) communities; 3. To build strong partnerships between academics and non-academic partners, including NGOs and government agencies; 4. To strengthen arts-based research and creative, practice-based capacities in both countries, involving students/graduates and/or academic staff in various disciplines (e.g. literature, art, education, refugee and migration studies, psychology) for sustainability; 5. To design a common research plan/agenda for developing further funding to build on the network&apos;s activities.  In establishing the CLCCD network we plan to lay the groundwork for research which is genuinely inter-disciplinary and springs from a &apos;hopeful&apos; view of the role of literature and the arts in creating &apos;safe spaces&apos; for identity, belonging, connections, communities, empathy, taking into account the interplay between literature, art and education. In addition, by emphasizing a comparative perspective across both countries that can be extended to other contexts, the network seeks to counter negative discourses of migrants that involve stereotypes, racism and educational deficit. Sharing models of best practice and developing new strategies across contexts in the two ODA countries will strengthen the network&apos;s capacity to cascade and implement these strategies in their own contexts. Finally, CLCCD will provide its members with a model of networking and partnership-building. The non-academic partners can strengthen their expertise in working with academics and early career academics and graduate students from UK, Egypt and Mexico will have the opportunity to get actively involved with non-academic collaborators and learn how to organise and develop sustainable relationships in an international context.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed network draws together academic partners from different disciplines (arts, humanities and education) along with non-academic partners, to examine and promote the contribution made by children&apos;s literature in creating &apos;safe spaces&apos; for displaced children and their families and for developing relationships between migrants and local communities through arts-based practices. Children&apos;s literature (eg traditional tales, picturebooks and poetry) deals with topics such as identity, conflict, resilience and tolerance; in multi-ethnic contexts with fluctuating patterns of migration, these stories and books can become key tools in providing spaces for distraction from anxieties and supporting literacies required by needs and living conditions. In both Egypt and Mexico, the situation regarding displaced children has recently reached critical proportions and spaces for sharing books and learning with displaced children, through children&apos;s literature, story- and arts-based activities, have developed in urban and rural areas via government, NGO or volunteer initiatives. Spaces often include different cultures and languages and involve health workers and teachers but also artists, storytellers and musicians. By understanding how these spaces are operating, we can learn about participatory arts-based practices that improve the identification of needs and the implementation of literacies that allow children to participate more fully in more cohesive communities. The proposal was developed through the collaborative partnership between Egypt, Mexico and the UK in order to meet the needs as perceived by the organizations working on the ground, such as the regional sections of IBBY (International Board on Books for Children and Young People), the UNHCR in Cairo and the Mexican Ministry of Culture (Reading promotion programme). It is based on previous national and international research in the UK that approached the needs of migrant children through literacy education, children&apos;s literature and integration. CLCCD will also allow participants to identify key areas for future collaboration, research and research training that will address the emotional welfare of the children and inter-community relations, thus aligning with the Middle East and South American regional goals of the UNHCR (2016-2017). The three overlapping phases of activity during the 18 month time-frame focus on relationship-building (through links among academic and non-academic partners); capacity-strengthening (through the development and sharing of best practices and location-specific activities), and international development and outreach (through the production of multimedia resources and KE links with potential partners in other ODA countries). One of the main outcomes will be an overview of current practices and successful strategies involving children&apos;s literature along with story and arts-based practices that allows for a comparative perspective. Another outcome will be the creation of strong research links that will form the basis for future exchange and collaboration and which can be expanded, in the first instance, to neighbouring countries (Kenya, Sudan, Yemen, Lebanon, Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador). This will include a grounded, ethical and sustainable plan to develop the research capacity of academic staff and students to use arts-based research methods (with children&apos;s literature as a base) in ways that are flexible for both researchers and practitioners working in contexts of flux and displacement. By emphasizing a positive and &apos;hopeful&apos; view of the interplay between literature, art and education, the network seeks to counter negative discourses of migrants that involve stereotypes, racism and educational deficit. The CLCCD network will lay the groundwork for research which is genuinely inter-disciplinary and intercultural and supports and develops the creation of &apos;safe spaces&apos; for displaced children within more cohesive communities.</narrative>
