   <narrative xml:lang="EN">China&apos;s rapid industrialisation and urbanisation has been accompanied by large increases in air pollution. In recognition of the health and socio-economic issues associated with this China&apos;s State Council authorized a 1.75 trillion Yuan investment package: the Air Pollution Prevention Plan (the Plan).  Our project, INHANCE, will: i) evidence the socio-economic efficacy of &quot;the Plan&quot; and, moving forward, ii) deliver an evidence based, effective, equitable and integrated intervention and management plan for air pollution mitigation in the Chinese megacity, Beijing. Through the engagement of its internationally leading research team INHANCE is very well placed to achieve these goals and with high-level involvement (Deputy Chief Scientist) from CRAES, (major drafters of Pollution Prevention and Control Law in China), we are well-poised to realise maximum impact from our research.    INHANCE embraces ODA priorities by: i) promoting the economic development and welfare of a transitional China as its main objective; ii) ensuring long-term sustainable improvements to air quality in Beijing (transferable to other megacites); iii) building capacity in skills and knowledge, and; iv) supporting sustained development of research that will result in welfare enhancement and economic growth. The UK contribution in areas of environmental economics, UK air pollution abatement and air-quality renewable energy interactions represent clear engagement of UK research strength to realise ODA priorities.  As an &apos;enabler&apos; project INHANCE will promote synergies and opportunities across the whole program and through the INHANCE &apos;Champions&apos; (see Case) will lead the engagement with Themes 1-3, and ensure the delivery of integrated science-based policy evaluation and design.  Central to the INHANCE approach is a strong commitment to across program communication (WP1). Toward these ends an Executive Committee, in consultation with the program administration, will map INHANCE expertise to Themes 1-3. Two-way internal- and external-facing communication mechanisms will be implemented to foster an interdisciplinary environment.   INHANCE will deliver a quantitative performance assessment of China&apos;s current air pollution policies wherein the effectiveness of current anti-air pollution measures will be &apos;scored&apos; (WP2). This scoring will be based upon pollutant inventories, atmospheric chemistry models (PKU-V3 / WRF-Chem), emission and economic performance of energy structure optimization, and, evaluation of end-of-pipe control measures.  The nexus among emission-health (physical and mental)-socioeconomic-energy impacts is central to the INHANCE research agenda (WP3). In order to interrogate this nexus INHANCE will establish and evaluate interactive relationships among exposure, vulnerability, impact on health, implications for industry and economic consequences. This WP will focus upon: air quality and renewable energy interactions; air pollution exposure and health impacts for low income population groups; measuring air pollution induced mental health impact; pollution footprint analysis - direct and indirect economic costs associated with physical and mental health losses, and; an estimation of the health burden associated with final consumption and trade.   In its conclusion, INHANCE will deliver recommendations regarding integrated policy design and deliver an assessment for policy cost-effectiveness. To achieve this INHANCE will: compare and qualitatively assess air quality policies between Beijing and other cities; engage with Themes 1-3 and other relevant stakeholders to prescribe air pollution abatement trajectories; undertake policy performance assessment modelling; utilise techno-economic inventories for anti-pollution measures to conduct micro cost-benefit analysis of new policies; measure health and macroeconomic costs and benefits in mitigating air pollution, and; transform evidence generated into practical emission alleviation pathways.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="INHANCE, supported by co-production of knowledge and inputs from other Themes projects, will evidence the performance efficacy of current anti-air pollution policies and, moving forward, analyse and discuss relevant research and deliver an evidence based, effective, equitable and integrated intervention and management plan for air pollution mitigation in Beijing. In particular, INHANCE identifies four core research challenges and designs corresponding means and instruments to tackle them. This research will address the coordinated reduction of multiple air pollutants, the dynamics of energy-pollution-health-socioeconomic relations, the total economic losses induced by both physical and mental health impacts of air pollution, and the past experience in the UK and other countries in terms of policy and mechanism design and implementation for air pollution mitigation. INHANCE will update and validate emission inventories, simulate pollution dispersions, conduct input-output based pollution footprint analysis, perform psychophysical analysis, evaluate health loss by different citizen groups, and cost effectiveness analysis for policy measures. INHANCE will closely work with policy and public stakeholders to perform quantitative assessment for current policy measures in terms of air quality improvements; unfold the nexus among pollution-health-socioeconomic-energy impacts; conduct integrated policy design; provide assessment for policy cost-effectiveness; and sketch an air pollution mitigation roadmap for Beijing. INHANCE partners have strong collaboration track records and can play complementary roles of natural science and socioeconomic and policy analysis in delivering final research goals and policy impact.     INHANCE embraces ODA priorities by: i) promoting the economic development and welfare of a transitional China; ii) ensuring long-term sustainable improvements to air quality in Beijing; iii) building capacity in skills and knowledge, and; iv) supporting research that will result in welfare enhancement and economic growth. INHANCE also creates a platform (the Champion pairs system and INHANCE Academy, see Pathways to Impact document) for both established and early career researchers as well as relevant stakeholders from (and beyond) the whole programme consortium to assess and comment, from a distinct trans-disciplinary perspective."></capital-spend>
