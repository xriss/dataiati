   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Building resilience and resources to overcome depression and anxiety in young people from urban neighbourhoods in Latin America</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Background The numbers of people with depression and anxiety greatly increases during adolescence. Adolescents who live in big cities more commonly experience stressful events such as conflict, poverty, substance misuse and social isolation. This includes adolescents from Latin America - which is the most urban part of the world.  Although many individuals experience stressful events, the majority do not develop either depression or anxiety. Furthermore, when people do experience them, up to half recover within a year. This raises the question of what helps people to prevent depression and anxiety, and what helps people recover. We have called these resilience factors. Our aim is to understand resilience factors so we can develop new approaches to treat depression and anxiety.    Objectives The overall aim is to identify resilience factors that are linked to either prevention of depression and anxiety, or to recovery. We will focus on adolescents and young people who live in three large Latin American cities - Buenos Aires, Bogot&#xE1; and Peru.  To achieve this, we aim to:  1. Develop new ways of measuring resilience factors that can be used with adolescents and young people, 2. Identify which resilience factors prevent depression and anxiety, 3. Identify which resilience factors help adolescent and young people to recover from depression and anxiety within one year, 4. Develop case studies about existing approaches that promote prevention and recovery,  5. Build up the research skills and knowledge of researchers in Latin America, 6. Involve adolescents and young people through an interactive arts-based project.    Methods The project is organised into six work packages (WPs). In the WP1, we will ask young people and staff who work in schools, youth organisations and healthcare services to help us develop new ways of measuring resilience factors to create an assessment tool. The new tool will be used in a study that will compare 1020 adolescents (15-16 years old) and young people (20-24 years old) with depression and anxiety to 1020 adolescents and young people without. We will look at personal factors such as health behaviours and social factors including relationships. We will test if there are differences between the two groups. This will help us discover which factors are linked to prevention. The individuals who have depression and anxiety will be asked to complete the same measures after one year. We will compare individuals who recovered from depression and anxiety to those who did not. This will tell us about recovery. To promote prevention and recovery we will conduct interviews with participants who did and did not recover and with different stakeholders. This will help us identify areas of &quot;good-practice&quot; which we will write up as case studies. This may include initiatives such as health centres or social-groups in the community (WP4). So that researchers in Latin America can continue studying resilience and recovery, we will provide training and activities focused on research skills (WP5). Finally, we want to involve adolescents and young people in our research. To do this, we will run an arts-based project where we will ask those with depression and anxiety to use different materials such as photographs, films, and graffiti to document their experience. We will hold exhibitions to display the art. We hope this will encourage other young people to get involved in research (WP6).  Expected results The project will lead to new knowledge about what prevents depression and anxiety and what help people recover. Understanding this will help us develop new approaches to improve the mental health of adolescents and young people and reduce the burden of mental disorders. Our communication methods will ensure the research is widely disseminated. Although the project focuses on Latin America, our learning will help other countries, including many Low and Middle Income countries, which are becoming more urban.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The overarching aim is to identify which resilience factors help young people living in urban environments in Latin America prevent and recover from depression and anxiety. Identification of resilience factors is a crucial step in the development of new approaches at an individual, community and societal level to reduce the burden of common mental disorders.   The aim will be addressed via specific objectives: 1. Develop appropriate methods for adolescents and young people to assess resilience factors that may be linked to preventing and recovering from depression and anxiety (WP1), 2. Determine whether resilience factors differ qualitatively or quantitatively between adolescents and young people with and without depression and anxiety (WP2), 3. Identify which resilience factors help adolescents and young people recover from depression and anxiety over a one-year period (WP3), 4. Explore existing approaches and resource-oriented interventions that are effective in preventing depression and anxiety in adolescents and young people or in supporting them to recover (WP4), 5. Build up research capacity in Latin America through a network of researchers (WP5), 6. Design and promote, in collaboration with local stakeholders and policy makers, strategies for building resilience to help adolescents and young people avoid and recover from depression and anxiety in urban neighbourhoods in Latin America (WP6).  The core activities are two linked studies which will identify a) factors that are linked to prevention (WP2) by comparing adolescents and young people with and without depression in a cross-sectional study and b) factors linked to recovery from these disorders (WP3) by longitudinally following up those with depression and anxiety and comparing individuals who recover within a year to those who do not. We will include two age groups, individuals aged 15-16 years old and individuals aged 20-24 years old. The specific research questions to be addressed in these two studies are:  For WP2: 1. Do resilience factors differ between young people with and without depression and anxiety? (primary research question) 2. Specifically, what are the differences in: a) social capital, b) meta-cognition, c) nature and quality of the social network, c) health behaviours and e) the type and number of context-specific resources? 3. Are the same differences apparent for a) the two age groups and b) gender?  For WP3: 1. Which resilience factors are associated with recovery from depression and anxiety at one-year follow up in adolescents and young people from urbanised communities? (Primary research question) 2. What is the association between the different resilience factors used and their impact on recovery? 3. Do the same factors predict recovery for both age groups? 4. Do the resilience factors that predict recovery vary by gender?  More generally, the wider aims of this programme of research are to: 1. Strengthen the research capacity in Latin America - particularly promoting junior researchers through expert advice and methodological support, 2. Strengthen the existing partnerships between the UK and Latin American institutions,  3. Form a wider network of research centres to expand the critical mass of researchers in this area, with the potential for future innovation and income generating activities, 4. Promote mutual knowledge and cultural exchange south-north and north-south, 5. Advance the scientific literature on preventing and treating adolescent depression and anxiety, 6. Identify factors which enable low-cost, sustainable and generic approaches to reduce the treatment gap currently experienced by those with common mental illnesses.  7. To give a voice to adolescents and young people who live in urban environments, are often exposed to multiple risk factors for poor mental health and are often absent from the research and mental health discourse.</narrative>
