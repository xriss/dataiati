   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Malaria remains a problem in many parts of the world. Even in countries where the level of infection is low, malaria can still cause death and there is the constant threat that drug and insecticide resistance may undermine any ongoing control attempts such that malaria comes back.     A major complication for control programmes when infections are rare is identifying where transmission is actually occurring. This is because the current methods used to diagnose malaria are not sensitive enough to detect all infections and miss a substantial proportion. Although these infections that are missed may not cause illness, they can still lead to infections in mosquitoes and therefore maintain malaria transmission in the area. It is an expensive process for many poorer countries to try and actively find all these cases, and so more flexible approaches need to be used to identify where infections are happening so that they can be targeted effectively.    The Philippines is a prime example of a low transmission setting. The country has recently experienced a reduction in annual malaria cases (from over 36,000 local cases in 2000 to fewer than 5,000 in 2014), but despite this progress, 54 out of the 81 provinces remain endemic of malaria, putting 14 million people at risk of the disease. Novel approaches and more sensitive methods are needed to detect if and where any remaining transmission might occur. With drug resistant parasites circulating in some countries in South East Asia, targeting transmission in the Philippines through an integrated surveillance system is particularly important and probably the most effective approach to address this issue.      In this project, we will combine existing systems that monitor malaria in people who attend local clinics in the Philippines with more sensitive diagnostic methods to see who is infected and who has recently been exposed to malaria. We will use the data from the clinics and cutting edge mapping techniques with tablet computers to identify where people live, so that we can see where infections are occurring. We will give this information to the Philippines National Malaria Control Programme so that they can target the area for control. We will perform these activities regularly at health facilities and continually update the maps. This will allow us to identify new areas of infection and check that targeted areas remain low.     We will work closely and continually with the control programme and health facility staff to see if the approach we are promoting is acceptable and how it might be improved. The goal is to develop an approach that can be easily absorbed into the existing health system using more modern approaches, and ultimately to help the Philippines eliminate a deadly and costly disease - and potentially to help other countries and regions achieve the same.     The project also aims to build human capacity in the Philippines in serological and molecular surveillance, data analysis, epidemiology, spatial studies and health systems research. The international collaboration provides a unique opportunity to develop and evaluate malaria burden measurement tools, allowing for novel strategies in a region of diverse and complex epidemiology, in which the rapid advances being made on elimination require great input in research and innovation.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="Objective 1: To establish, integrate and evaluate the combinations of laboratory, clinical and epidemiological surveillance collected during health facility surveys in estimating the magnitude and heterogeneity of malaria infections in the Philippines. The integrated surveillance tools will more effectively identify risk of infection with malaria and enhance malaria control and elimination activities. The objective will be addressed through the following:  1.1. Serosurveillance: We will identify antigen or antigen combinations for detecting antibody responses to all local malaria species (primarily P. falciparum, P. vivax and P. knowlesi). We will optimise and validate these antigen antibody responses for high throughput ELISA techniques. Simultaneously we will adapt existing analytical methods to allow measurement of age-specific prevalence of species-specific antimalarial antibodies as proxy for residual malaria infections. This will be used to determine the proportion of seropositive individuals in different age groups, and calculate the rate of acquisition of antibodies to malaria parasites. We will then integrate the serological data with epidemiological data to identify both behavioural and residential risk for exposure.  1.2. Molecular surveillance and characterisation of parasites: We will establish molecular techniques that rapidly identify individuals harbouring Plasmodium species by multispecies amplification. Assays will be complimentary to serological assays and use dual extraction processing for speed. We will further analyse parasite positive samples to a) genotype drug resistance loci and b) barcode organelle and genome polymorphisms. We will use a) to estimate prevalence of any drug resistance loci and whether there is any geographical foci of these. We will use b) to examine parasite lineage and assess &apos;relatedness&apos; of infections in each study area.  1.3. Spatial epidemiology: We will test new methods for identification of area residence of participants using iteratively defined maps on tablet computers for visual cues. Base maps will be generated from existing cartographical resources (e.g. Google Earth) and augmented with local knowledge and actual GPS positioning.     1.4. Integration of data into existing health systems: Data from 1.1.-1.3. will be combined to generate evolving risk maps of exposure to and infection with malaria. We will use maps to identify areas or demographic groups at higher risk and work with the control programme as to how these might be better targeted. We will explore and refine how the new epidemiological information can be optimally collected and utilised by decision makers and integrated into existing health systems to improve malaria elimination efforts.   Objective 2: To build human capacity in serological and molecular surveillance, data analysis, epidemiology, spatial studies and health systems research, through:  2.1. Capacity and partnership strengthening activities: We will have a strong formative component with three on-site meetings in the Philippines, as well as exchange of researchers between the two countries. The first meeting is aimed at harmonising the study design. The second meeting will monitor and evaluate the integrative process of information from the surveys into the health system. The final meeting will conclude the study, disseminate findings and plan for future studies."></capital-spend>
