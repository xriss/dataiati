   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Insects represent a vast but underexploited food resource. They have a global distribution and are amongst the most abundant animals in the world. Recent evaluations of their nutritional quality have also shown many of them to be comparable or superior as a source of nutrition to many of our current livestock animals.   Although not widely used in European societies, insects are already traditionally consumed in two thirds of countries worldwide, with over 2000 species being eaten around the globe. As a widespread resource that can be collected without cultivation, the sustainable harvesting and preservation of insects offer solutions to food security problems, particularly in impoverished communities within developing world nations. Whilst this potential has been realised in some places (e.g. mopane worm in South Africa), insects have been underutilized in many areas where food security is poor.  Our project will address food security issues in Sub-Saharan Africa. Many areas, such as the region of Benin where we work, experience seasonal food shortages. These arise as a consequence of extended dry seasons when crops will not grow. Limited development of food storage and preservation at the community level compounds this problem, as periods of plenty cannot be used to improve food security in famine times. This project aims to bridge this food security challenge through developing termites as a sustainable and locally available food source. Each year, a single termite mound will produce thousands of winged individuals which will disperse from the mound, and can be collected locally. These termites, which are already eaten traditionally in the region by some communities, are highly nutritious. They are naturally &apos;overproduced&apos; - of the thousands who fly from a mound, 99% are eaten by birds or reptiles. As such, alate termites offer great prospects as a sustainable food product.   We will assess the efficacy of different methods for the collection of termites, and combine this with an assessment of the total potential yield of termites regionally to determine the magnitude of natural capital represented in alate termites. We will then improve harvesting techniques, and develop preservation techniques that allow the product to be traded commercially/used locally over famine periods. Together, these data and techniques will allow us to determine the value-chain of a termite based food product. Within community use and local marketability will be examined as two means of maintaining nutrition through famine periods.   Our project will work in collaboration with communities in Northern Benin, and supply them with the direct means to enhance food security using termites as a food product. In doing so, combining existing regional traditions of eating insects with modern advances in food preservation and production, food security can be targeted using an entirely local approach.   The project aims further to be a proof of concept to establish more widespread use of termite as a food source across sub Saharan Africa.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="There is a huge potential for the consumption of insects and insect based food stuffs to contribute to ensuring global food security. Termites represent an underdeveloped form of nutrition in Sub Saharan Africa, being both nutritionally rich (protein, fat and micronutrients) and seasonally abundant. They are also eaten traditionally in a large number of societies. There is, however, no evaluation of potential yields and best practice for collection. Further, there is no system for preservation that would allow the resource to be utilized outside of the emergence period and potentially commercialized. In this project we will develop termite collection and preservation techniques ascertain sustainable yields of termites, and apply these to enhance food security and economic development in Africa.  Objective 1: Evaluating the natural capital of termites.  We aim to maximize the sustainable collection of reproductive (alate) termites. This involves two phases: first, establishing the total natural capital, and second, optimizing means of collection. To this end, we will quantify the number of alate (sexual) dispersing termites produced by a range of mound sizes. We will combine this with information on the number of mounds at the landscape level from satellite and drone imaging to estimate the total natural capital. We will then develop improved means of collection, comparing use of solar light traps to traditional methods of collection. From these data, we will develop an assessment of sustainable yield at the village and landscape level. In addition to better ecological understanding, this part of the project will also directly involve community participation, contributions and education while designing strategies for optimizing the collection and management of this natural capital.   Objective 2: Developing means of preparation and preservation.  We will develop preservation and preparation methods that the community can use to store termite food products. Preservation methods to be evaluated are based on traditional practices which we will modify through means that are sustainable at a community level in an impoverished region (drying, grinding, desiccated packaging). These methods will be developed and applied in close collaboration with the community to ensure they are suitable for the communities. We will: a) Examine how the nutritional quality of termite based food products varies with preparation/preservation method. Analyse macronutrient quantity and quality, as well as some micronutrients. Metabolomic profiling of low molecular compounds of termite food ingredients and products will be conducted. Microstructural characterisation of termite ingredients, a pre-requisite for incorporation into composite food products, will also be undertaken.  b) Evaluate biosafety of the preserved product; in particular we will assay for mycotoxins and contaminating bacteria associated with the preparation and preservation of termites, and thereby help develop a safe and durable food product.   Objective 3: Community engagement and resource use To capitalize on the product created above, it is vital to evaluate the social factors that surround food production. Working with a community who have already shown considerable interest in creating insect-based food products we will be able to do this. An evaluation of the cost/benefit of termite collection and preservation will be carried out. Time and resources spent on achieving a final product will be weighed against benefits of personal consumption or selling of the product, and evaluated within the context of other activities.   The above creates a &apos;model system&apos; working in the community. Our final objective is to use this knowledge and success to promote the uptake of termites as a resource more widely in Benin and Sub Saharan Africa."></capital-spend>
