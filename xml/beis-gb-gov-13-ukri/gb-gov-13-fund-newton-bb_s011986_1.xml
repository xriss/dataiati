   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Based on detailed market research existing MSW processes struggle for profitability because they are based solely on energy generation. The project will develop a flexible MSbioW process to maximise non-food sugar production used in increasingly demanded sustainable, biodegradable products. The team are drawn from recognised experts at LEEDS and ICT who have not had the opportunity to work together before, but through this project could provide a powerful force in this area. Industry and academic partners in the UK and India have been brought into the project to fill specific gaps in expertise. The project builds on and uses expertise at partner FIBERIGHT, and their collaborative work with LEEDS on sugar production from MSbioW in the US and UK. Studies have shown high-levels of indigestible ligno-(hemi)cellulosic material in Indian waste (paper, textiles, agriculture) whose breakdown is required to ensure economic sugar, rather than use for energy. A key aspect is the development of more active oxidative cellulose/cellobiose/lignin/polyesterase digesting enzymes that can contribute to, and improve the existing commercial mixed enzyme product, that will be used as a starting point. The ability to use MSW different sources will be managed by a plant design adaptive at several points in the process: analysis of the variability of source MSbioW; adjustment of new hydrothermal or microwave pre-treatment; tailoring the mix of oxidative, hydrolytic enzymes developed specifically for more efficient breakdown of recalcitrant Indian waste; developing the batch or continuous flow bioprocess to maximise sugar production; directing non-sugar waste streams to either hydrothermal carbonisation (HTC) or anaerobic digestion (AD). A focus across each work package is to ensure viable economics of this non-food sugar production to compete with current use of food sugar in non-food markets. Studies will be directed towards the construction of a pilot plant in ICT Mumbai able to generate representative test samples, and data to build a model of the economics of full-scale plant operation to convince investors. A profitable process will encourage implementation leading to employment, changes in waste collection behaviour, environmental improvement and consequent societal benefits. The non-food sugar can be used in high value commercial products such as sustainable biodegradable binders in: building sector (MDF, Glass Wool); polymers (eg. FDCA-based, PLA, PHBV polyesters), pharmaceuticals ((R)-3-HB in statins, antivirals, anti-diabetes). The project furthers ODA aims by: creating wealth through 100-1000s jobs and 10s of new &#xA3;100m MSW businesses; social impact by influencing changes in practice for MSbioW segregation and collection affecting positively low-paid waste workers; reducing environmental municipal waste burden.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project will develop the IB required to test the vision of an integrated, profitable, non-food sugar producing commercial plant design which can adapt to different sources/compositions of Indian MSW segregated biowaste. The team will: assess viable MSbioW; develop new pretreatment technology; high activity, tolerant and cost effective oxidative and hydrolytic enzymes specific for high ligno-cellulosic waste; a more productive process; the use of non-chemical waste for biochar and AD; ensure plant control and integration; economic viability and representative sugar test samples by building a pilot plant at ICT. The key to a viable, sustainable operation in India is maximising the economic production of non-food sugar that is increasingly demanded in sustainable biodegradable high-value products. The project brings together for the first time strong capabilities at main partners LEEDS and ICT, along with specific and crucial industry input. The socio- technoeconomic outcomes will develop society, wealth and environmental improvement in India with potential impacts upon DAC countries and the UK.
