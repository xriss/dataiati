   <narrative xml:lang="EN">International: Embedding analysis of seismic hazard and risk for improved welfare in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The aim of the project is to improve the seismic resilience of the city of Bishkek in Kyrgyzstan. This will be done by better informing the location of urban expansion of the city, a process that is currently encroaching onto active faults. This will be achieved by embedding the ability to generate updated seismic risk scenarios in the agency responsible for this in the capital Bishkek, through capacity building at the Institute of Seismology (Kyrgyz National Academy of Sciences), who in turn engage with government stakeholders responsible for construction, disasters and health. To enable this impact, the latest knowledge of fault locations found from our pre-existing research council and academy funded projects will be used. This will be done in collaboration with project partners that have the open software, databases and expertise to facilitate the execution of such risk scenarios. Expertise in Earth Observation and Digital Elevation Models from prior NERC funded research will be applied to update exposure elements for the city of Bishkek. The outcome of this better-informed urban construction in Bishkek will be the reduction in the number of building collapses, fatalities and economic losses cause by future earthquakes, thus promoting the economic development and welfare of this developing country. The objectives to meet this aim are: 1. to incorporate the new knowledge recently gained concerning the relative activity, location and past ruptures of faults that could affect Bishkek with future earthquakes into our project partner&apos;s (GEM) User Contributed Active Fault Database. Once this milestone is achieved in the first part of the project, this open database will be used as a constraint on the possible fault rupture scenarios that are used in subsequent hazard and risk analysis. 2. to identify the changes in the exposure of the city buildings as the city has expanded in recent years. This will be achieved through the use of high resolution satellite imagery and digital elevation models (that will also be used to constrain the secondary hazards of landsliding and liquefaction). Stakeholders have identified that key infrastructure is absent in the current earthquake risk models that currently focus on residential building stock and not commercial/industrial or key pieces of infrastructure (hospitals, schools, bridges and water courses). 3. to produce a suite of risk scenarios indicating the extent of building collapse, fatalities and economic losses for a range of different earthquake scenarios for varying sized earthquakes on nearby and distant faults, as identified in the active fault database. In light of recently identified earthquake fault sources and also with city expansion onto the faults south of the city, regular updates to these models will be required as more buildings are built in ever closer proximity to the faults. 4. to embed the capacity of risk scenario analysis within the Institute of Seismology whose current responsibility is to provide assessments of seismic risk for Kyrgyzstan to government. In order to be able to update these risk scenarios in future, we will undertake capacity building through training in the use of the risk calculation software and use of such datasets required to determine exposure and hazards. 5. to deliver our outcome of improving the resilience of the city to earthquakes, we will also support further engagement by our project partner with government stakeholders following the recommendations outlined in a recent World Bank report. This will be done through the use of both risk maps and estimates of building, human and economic losses. These will be used by stakeholders to better inform urban planning, enhance the enforcement of building codes, enable targeted retro-fitting of key infrastructure (hospital, schools and bridges) and provide better communication to citizens of the potential for seismic risk in Bishkek.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The country of Kyrgyzstan in Central Asia is exposed to the hazards of earthquakes. The tectonic collision of the Earth&apos;s plates is creating huge mountains in this region. These mountains are created from earthquakes on large faults along the northern Tien Shan mountain range. Kyrgyzstan&apos;s&apos; capital, Bishkek, lies on top of one of these major fault lines and is home to a million people. In the past, major cities that exist along the northern edge of this mountain range, such as Almaty to the east, have been destroyed in large earthquakes at the end of the 19th Century. This occurred when they were relatively small towns. The impact today from similar sized earthquakes would have a much more devastating effect if it were to strike the major city of Bishkek. The rapid expansion of cities in poorer countries has meant that a large number of buildings are not strong enough to be resilient to earthquakes. We want to help the Government ministries in Bishkek, such as the Ministry for Construction and also for Emergency Situations, to be able to better assess the potential impact for earthquakes to strike the city in future. We will do this by providing them with estimates of how many people may die in future earthquakes, how many buildings will be damaged or collapse, and how much such an earthquake will cost financially. We will also provide maps of where we think the city will be most affected by different types of earthquakes, as small nearby earthquakes can have as big an impact as distant large ones. This will enable the Kyrgyz government ministries to target where in the city key buildings, such as schools and hospitals, should be reinforced, as well as to better plan where new housing estates should be built, and also to enforce the seismic building codes to make sure the buildings are built better. In order to provide this latest information, we will be working with the Institute of Seismology in Bishkek, whose responsibility it is to provide these kinds of estimates of seismic risk. We are therefore working directly with the organisation that has the mandate to provide information to the government and by doing so we will ensure that our work will also have an impact. We are also going to train the institute staff to be able to update these estimates of losses so that they have the capacity to continue this work once we are no longer working on this project. It is important to be able to keep updating the estimates of losses and maps of seismic risk. Cities are constantly enlarging. If these cities lie in earthquake prone areas, such as the Kyrgyz capital of Bishkek, this growth increases their exposure to seismic hazards, increasing the risk that people face. Often some of the best views over a city come from higher ground, but this high ground is created by faults that build mountains. The city of Bishkek is expanding southwards as the urban population grows, and homes are now being built right on top of these fault lines. Being very near to a fault increases the amount of shaking if an earthquake happens, and therefore increases the chances of the building collapsing, injuring or killing the occupants. As well as the increased exposure to earthquake hazards, we are also discovering more active faults in the region through mapping out the fault lines and identifying past earthquake ruptures. It is important to incorporate this new information into the estimates of seismic hazard, as some very large earthquakes are known to have struck the region in the past. Therefore we will include this recent scientific information into our estimates of seismic hazard. We are working with other partners, such as the Global Earthquake Model Foundation, which was created to serve the public good through collaboration, openness and transparency by providing credible assessments of seismic hazard and risk. Their open software &quot;OpenQuake&quot; enables us to do the calculations of seismic risk.</narrative>
