   <narrative xml:lang="EN">GCRF Accountability for Informal Urban Equity Hub</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">More than half of humanity currently lives in urban areas and 68% are projected to do so by 2050. One in three urban dewllers, and an estimated 881 million people in Low and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs) now live in informal settlements, colloquially known as &apos;slums&apos;, where they have inadequate, insecure housing and limited services. These settlements are often the only option for people working in the informal sector, and existing evidence shows that residents are often highly resourceful, resilient and innovative in navigating the problems they face daily.  However, they also face challenges that appear intractable:  multiple health and well-being risks and vulnerabilities, related to an unhealthy environment, insecurity and social marginalisation.  Informal urban settlements are rapidly changing, with in and out-migration and shifts in social norms, as well as being economically and socially unequal.  Failures to provide services, infrastructure and mechanisms for redress by national and local governments are often linked to the presence of multiple actors and organisations including non-governmental, private and criminal organisations. These conditions can act as an incubator for various forms of violence (e.g. political and gender-based), which threaten well-being.    Our Hub will work with the most marginalised dwellers in informal urban settlements, including through federations of &apos;Slum/ Shack Dwellers&apos;, linked to Hub partner SDI. We will support them in identifying their priorities, making their conditions visible to key service providers related to health (both governmental and non-governmental) across a range of sectors, and working with identified allies amongst these actors to develop better mechanisms for accountability and more responsive services.  We will test this approach to addressing this intractable challenge, and pilot the priority interventions developed.  Many conventional research methods and routine information systems are ill-suited to these complex and rapidly changing contexts and are not sufficiently linked to action. We will use innovative participatory methods, including analysis of data collected by informal urban dwellers themselves, to gain a deep understanding of health risks, vulnerabilities, and priorities and service access barriers. We will bring insights from a range of disciplines including social and political sciences and epidemiology to develop innovative metrics that can better reflect these realities and inform policy and practice development and evaluation.  Learning and data from these innovative approaches and methodologies will be brought together to form a tested set of methodologies that identify promising mechanisms for improving accountability and service responsiveness to promote health and well-being for the most marginalised. We will communicate the new concepts, evidence and methodologies to national, regional and global governmental and non-governmental organisations through our networks and partnerships to maximise the potential for improved policies, strategies and services.   Our Hub is uniquely placed to realise our vision. We bring together partners with long standing relationships, and develop new collaborations that add value in terms of expertise and networks.  IDS and University of Glasgow bring core strengths in participation and urban governance; epidemiology and inter-sectoral action respectively. LMIC partner institutions have strong national, regional and global influence and reach, including with informal urban dwellers (e.g. SDI and APHRC), with national and international non-governmental organisations (e.g. LVCT Health, BRAC ) and with national governments (e.g. COMAHS, SLURC, The George Institute).  LSTM has an outstanding track record in leading successful multi-partner collaboration for health impact. We will collectively build interdisciplinary capacities across the Hub and use this learning to benefit the next generation of researchers.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Our overarching objective is: To catalyse a step-change globally, nationally and locally in approaches to improving state-citizen accountability and promoting equity in the well-being and health of marginalised people living in poverty in informal urban settlements.   We will achieve this through iterative participatory action research cycles of reflection, planning, action and adaptation in four study countries: Bangladesh, India, Kenya and Sierra Leone. These were chosen because they represent variation in types of informal settlement, and wider geographic, socio-cultural, political and economic contexts, as well as providing the opportunity to build on and existing deep and equitable partnerships. We will extend beyond these countries through our responsive fund. There is insufficient global knowledge on the conditions and enablers for the emergence and effectiveness of varied accountability strategies. This is especially the case for contexts with less cohesive social movements, fragmented, pluralistic governance systems and less political space for citizen demands.    Our research cycles will work across three, inter-related domains in our Theory of Change: understandings, relationships and action.  We will develop new understandings of the linkages between informal urban governance, health and well-being that illuminate underlying power relations and how these shape intersecting inequities and vulnerabilities.  Central to this approach is working with urban informal residents to bring a bottom-up analysis of their priorities, diagnose exclusionary and anti-accountability forces, and identify strategies to effectively negotiate with governance actors for change. We will work in partnership with residents to build the necessary relationships and alliances, through convening fora incorporating diverse formal and informal governance actors across sectors and interests. These will jointly reflect on our new insights and data, develop and test action to improve accountability strategies for equity in the social determinants of health and service provision.    Our specific objectives are therefore: 1. To work with marginalised people living in poverty in informal urban settlements in study sites, to analyse their priorities and create strategic alliances for collective action to demand improved accountability and responsiveness of services that promote health and well-being. 2. To convene fora that build relationships in study sites and strengthen coalitions between residents of informal urban settlements, formal and informal governance actors and service providers, in order to set priorities, and co-develop and test actions for improved accountability, service provision and system responsiveness for equity in well-being and health.  3. To enhance understanding of effective accountability strategies for equity in well-being and health, identify their contextual enablers and contribute comparative learning that is applicable across informal urban contexts.  4. To develop the evidence base on processes that shape well-being and health outcomes among marginalised people living in informal urban settlements, with respect to gendered social relationships, well-being and health vulnerabilities, resilience, and power relations inherent in governance arrangements that drive intersecting inequities. 5. To develop improved tools, approaches and methods, drawing on interdisciplinary dialogue, to reflect residents&apos; own understandings of their lived realities, to inform engagement of governance actors and multi-sectoral service providers and catalyse impact in policy and programming. 6. To re-frame and actively communicate new conceptual frameworks for accountability for equitable well-being and health in informal urban spaces, and to utilise these to inform global discourse and policy.  7. To develop and sustain an interdisciplinary and equitable partnership and capacities that will have continued impact beyond Hub funding.</narrative>
