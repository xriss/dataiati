   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Consumer Cost-Sharing in Primary Care: Unintended Health and Economic Outcomes</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">A common feature of health systems in low and middle income countries (LMICs) is the underuse of primary care, especially by the poor, which results in undue reliance on hospital services to treat illnesses, which could have been better prevented or managed through primary care. This distorts the optimal split of resources (medical staff, equipment, facilities) between primary and secondary care, results in inefficient choices that increase costs and severely weakens health systems. The importance of this issue is growing with the rapid increase in Non-Communicable Diseases, which require timely diagnosis and management through primary care services.  The main objective of this proposal is to establish whether increased levels of patient cost-sharing are contributing to this inefficiency by reducing the use of primary care services, which results in undiagnosed conditions, adverse health outcomes, and costly hospital care later on. To fulfill this main objective, we will be convincingly answering the following research questions using detailed administrative longitudinal data from 97% of the Colombian population for 7 years:  (1) Does an increase in consumer cost-sharing reduce the use of primary care services? And by how much?  (2) Does higher consumer cost-sharing decrease the likelihood that non-communicable diseases are undiagnosed? And does it decrease the likelihood patients&apos; NCDs are correctly managed?  (3) Does an increase in consumer cost-sharing increase hospitalizations, use of accident and emergency services, conditions sensitive to mismanagement of chronic conditions, and mortality (one and five year)? And by how much?  (4) Does an increase in consumer cost-sharing increase or decrease the costs of primary care, secondary care, and the overall costs of the health system? Over what time horizon, and by how much? Would a decrease in consumer cost-sharing pay for itself (because the cost reductions compensate for the loss in revenue)?  The second objective of this Foundation proposal is to disseminate our results amongst stakeholders and gather their insights on the topic. This will allow us to prepare a Full Research Grant proposal, which will investigate the full extent of consequences that patient cost-sharing have on the health system, including in the mix of staff, equipment, and facilities, as well as on its funding.   The second objective is conditional on the response obtained to the main objective, which makes this proposed research particularly suitable for a Foundation grant proposal.      The third objective is to build and make publicly available  a set of computer programs, which will clean and merge different health administrative databases of the Colombian Health System, the Colombian Social Security System, and Colombian vital statistics. This will allow any researcher who obtains the administrative databases from the Colombian Ministry of Health and Social Protection to have databases ready for a variety of analysis in a much shorter time span. This will greatly foster clinical and health systems research using Colombian data, and will serve as a model for other middle income countries.   The fourth objective is to increase research capacity by facilitating the acquisition of infrastructure and knowhow for the storage and analysis of &quot;big data&quot; on the health sector in Colombia. We will also hold a training workshop on quasi-experimental evaluation (including Regression Discontinuity) of health policies for policy makers and academics in Colombia.  The fifth objective is to raise awareness of the Regression Discontinuity method amongst epidemiologists and health systems researchers. This quasi-experimental method is widely used in economics and psychology, and it is making inroads into other disciplines. We expect our publications to be widely cited, which will indirectly raise awareness about the Regression Discontinuity method.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In many countries, even insured individuals must pay a fee (usually patient cost-sharing) to see their family doctor. The theoretical purpose of that fee is one of cost-containment: to limit the overuse of doctor visits, although it can also play a role in the funding the health system.  An unintended consequence of such fees is that they might prevent individuals from visiting their family doctor for necessary medical conditions. Hence, individuals&apos; health might deteriorate, and in the future they might need much more expensive medical treatments (e.g. hospitalizations), which would defeat the cost containment purpose that the fee was supposed to serve.   The importance of this unintended consequence might be growing with the rapid increase in Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs), which require timely diagnosis and management through primary care services. For many NCDs, it is easier to postpone doctor visits because they are not painful in their initial stages (e.g. diabetes), but if they are not diagnosed timely and appropriately managed, they will lead to more expensive medical procedures in the future. Visiting the family doctor might help to diagnose the conditions timely, as well as to keep an adequate management of such conditions.  Hence, patient fees might be favoring use of hospitals instead of primary care services, which is inefficient because hospital services are much costlier. This inefficiency weakens the health system and limits how much the health system can improve in other dimensions (coverage, quality improvement).  Although the literature has been interested in this topic, most previous research has reported associations, which might be spurious. Some recent papers have been able to estimate the effect of patient fees on health, but they have not been able to assess how health care use patterns or overall treatment costs change. These are key issues to understand how patient fees affect the health system (split of resources between primary and secondary care), and its efficiency.   To contribute to this debate, we will be testing whether (and by how much) increased patient fees in primary care increase undiagnosed chronic conditions, adverse health outcomes, mortality, use of hospital services, and treatment costs both in the short and long term (up to 7 years).  To conduct this work, we will be using health administrative data for the years 2011 to 2018, covering 97% of the Colombian population and containing patients records of all health care services provided in the Colombian Health System, including date and type of service used (outpatient, hospital, etc), prescriptions, treatment costs, ICD-10, sociodemographic characteristics of individuals (including income or wealth scores) and mortality. The person identifier is consistent across the seven years, providing a uniquely rich and detailed longitudinal administrative database. Moreover, its huge size allows us to estimate the effects of interest for particular subpopulations of interest (e.g. individuals with poor socio-economic status, or chronic patients).  However, data is not enough to provide a robust answer to the question of interest. We also need a method to be sure that we will not be reporting spurious associations in the data. Experiments are usually used for that purpose but they are unlikely to provide us with long term effects as the ones that we will be estimating, nor the samples be large enough.  We are fortunate enough that the patient cost-sharing system in Colombia works &quot;in abrupt jumps,&quot; that is, cost-sharing jumps abruptly at pre-specified thresholds of some continuous variables. This is the ideal setting to apply a quasi-experimental method called Regression Discontinuity (RD), which is known to provide causal estimates, free of spurious correlations, under very weak assumptions. Note that you cannot use RD whenever you want, the conditions must be there, but we are fortunate that they do hold in Colombia.</narrative>
