   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Rewriting the Prehistory of Jordan</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Jordanian prehistory begins with the traces left by human ancestors on a key route out of Africa into Europe and Asia. This earliest phase is mainly known from scatters of flint tools made, used, and abandoned. Around 20,000 years ago, archaeological preservation improves providing evidence for some of the most profound changes in human history. These include the development of food producing technologies, the domestication of plants and animals, and the social and ideological developments that enabled living together in increasingly large and sedentary communities: what have been identified as the earliest modern societies (e.g. Cauvin 2000). Similar developments took place independently in a number of regions across the globe (Barker 2006), but their earliest manifestation was in Southwest Asia.   Until recently, Jordan was considered as marginal to this process, but archaeological evidence now suggests that Jordan was important region to this transformation. Sites such as Kharaneh IV in the Epipalaeolithic show developments in subsistence and social complexity from c 20,000 years ago, while recent excavations at Shubayqa now provide evidence of permanent architecture from the Natufian period c 14,000 years ago. The earliest Neolithic, the Pre-Pottery Neolithic A (12,000-10,300 years ago), was barely known in Jordan even a decade ago, but is now known from multiple sites. The Pre-Pottery Neolithic B (10,300 - 8,700 years ago), previously thought to derive from developments elsewhere, is now seen to incorporate local innovations when the Jordanian plateau became one of the most densely populated parts of the world. Although field evidence remains scarce, the Late Neolithic (8,300-6,500 years ago) continues a local historical trajectory when the farming package consolidates. Jordan plays an important role in the development of nomadic pastoralism following the domestication of sheep and goats.  With notable exceptions, such as Profs Zeidan Kafafi of Yarmouk University and Maysoon al-Nahar of the University of Jordan, early prehistoric archaeological research has been dominated by international researchers, and has been marginal to archaeology and cultural heritage presentation within Jordan. The narrative of early prehistory has been largely written by international scholars, whose focus has been to place Jordanian evidence into a wider regional and global context. With the exception of scholars working directly on Jordanian material, most Near Eastern Neolithic archaeologists continue to downplay the significance of Jordan, indeed, with rare exceptions (such as mention of the large Late Pre-Pottery Neolithic B sites), Jordan does not register in regional syntheses, and the crucial early developments evident in Jordan are often omitted. Prehistory does not figure in Jordanian school education, despite the many resonances with contemporary issues of settling down, the growth of sedentary communities, and the early development of an agricultural package that still lies at the core of Jordanian subsistence.  This project aims to develop a new generation of Jordanian scholars and cultural resource managers working in early prehistoric research. We will focus on Jordanian engagement, helping develop Jordanian skills, policies and procedures to research and manage prehistory, and to foster a new research environment with Jordanian perspectives and agendas.  The project will seek to engage the wider Jordanian public in prehistory, where a lack of local interest translates into a lack of protection for these sites. We will raise the profile of prehistory, show its relevance to modern life in the origins of herding, farming, and water management, all vital to modern Jordanian society. We want to show this is a human and local story, not just academic and global.  We will develop the tourism potential of prehistory, locally and internationally, to provide direct economic benefits to rural communities and the Jordanian economy.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project will build capacity in the prehistoric archaeology of Jordan within the academic and cultural resource management community, supporting Jordanian led prehistoric research and ensuring that international research collaborations take place on a peer to peer basis. Within Jordan this will be particularly important, localising prehistoric research and giving greater voice to Jordanian narratives. This will help mobilise prehistory as part of Jordan&apos;s heritage, promoting public engagement and developing domestic tourism. The promotion of prehistory will stress the relationship between ancient developments and modern intangible heritage, in particular the skills in animal management and pastoralist life ways, the relationship with primary domesticated agricultural products and food, and the development of village culture, all of which resonate with traditional Bedouin and Fellahin heritage. To achieve this aim, the project will:  Establish the Faynan Centre for Prehistoric Research: This will be a facility for both the Jordanian and international research communities, ensuring that post-excavation analyses of prehistoric finds are more often conducted within Jordan. In addition to providing a practical base for research work, the Centre will ensure that Jordanian archaeologists can work within the core of international research programmes, and provide training and employment opportunities for research assistants within Jordan. The Centre will be located in the (presently unoccupied) upper floor of the recently opened Department of Antiquities museum in Wadi Faynan, southern Jordan. The Centre will provide both laboratory and accommodation facilities. The laboratory will be fitted with robust and low maintenance equipment to facilitate a range of key post excavation analyses in a safe and secure environment. The laboratory will include an IT infrastructure as well as a range of microscopes and digital imaging equipment.   Provide training in Prehistoric Research: The project will design and develop a suite of eight one-week, residential training courses to develop the skills and knowledge base to assist Jordanian scholars to re-write the (pre)history of Jordan through archaeological discoveries. The training courses will be held in the Faynan Centre for Prehistoric Research. Each course will feature training staff from both UK and Jordanian academic and professional archaeological communities. Trainees will be comprise DOA staff and early career researchers from Jordanian Universities. Each course will include hands on training, theory, site visits and a review of literature and will cater for 6 trainees. Through training DoA staff in Jordanian prehistory, the project will assist in the management and conservation of Jordan&apos;s unique cultural heritage, developing a suite of protocols for the management of Jordan&apos;s prehistoric heritage. This will allow the DoA to better deploy Jordanian prehistory as a cultural and economic asset within the theme of cultural heritage in sustainable growth, with an immediate impact by developing a sustainable cultural heritage facility in a relatively impoverished part of Jordan.   The project will also: Support digitisation and the use of technology in the interpretation, presentation, and conservation of cultural heritage by providing training in digital imaging. This will have immediate impact through its practical application on open days and through project publications. Support local community engagement in prehistory by providing training, local employment opportunities, popular publication and open days.  Many of the local community have been employed in archaeological fieldwork; this research will showcase the results of their work.  Promote and popularise prehistoric research more widely through open days, production of a non-academic book, and use of targeted media outreach. This will help this world-class heritage serve both cultural and economic purposes.</narrative>
