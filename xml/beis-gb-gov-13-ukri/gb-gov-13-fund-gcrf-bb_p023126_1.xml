  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Mineral Micronutrient Deficiencies (MNDs) are widespread in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). MNDs (a.k.a. hidden hunger) have a major detrimental effect on human health which constrains economic growth and efforts to alleviate poverty. Alleviating MNDs is a major component of the second Sustainable Development Goal (SDG2), to &quot;End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture&quot;, by 2030. This Foundation Award will focus on supporting efforts to reduce MNDs in Ethiopia and Malawi, two countries with widespread mineral nutrient malnutrition problems where dietary mineral intakes fall well below levels required for optimal nutrition. For example, zinc deficiency risks are &gt;40% in both countries which causes high rates of child mortality and stunting. Selenium deficiency risks exceed 75% in Malawi, compromising the healthy functioning of human immune systems. Iron and iodine deficiencies are widespread and are the focus of widespread supplementation and food fortification programmes (i.e. technical &apos;fixes&apos;) in the region.  The scientific aim of this Foundation Award is to understand how the spectral properties of tropical African soils relate to plant-availability of minerals in soils and, subsequently, to the transfer of minerals into the edible portions of staple crops and diets, and to population-level biomarkers of optimal mineral status. Achieving this aim will enable the geospatial prediction of plant-available nutrients in soils and in edible crop tissues, and thereby in downstream food systems. Spectral properties have previously been measured on a massive scale by the Africa Soils Information Service (AfSIS) programme, using X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF) and Mid Infra-Red (MIR) spectroscopy. We have previously identified strong links between soil-crop-biomarkers in small-scale cross-sectional studies in Malawi.  This aim will be realised through activities in three Themes. In Theme 1, a designed soil and crop sampling programme will be conducted at 500 sites in Ethiopia. Two sets of statistical models will be developed, the first will focus on predicting relationships between total (XRF) and plant-available soil mineral concentrations, using covariate data from MIR, remote sensing and legacy data (e.g. maps) sources. The second set of models will focus on relationships between plant-available soil mineral concentrations and their concentrations in crop edible portions. In Theme 2, these data will be integrated with data from published/government sources to predict dietary mineral supply (and highlight knowledge gaps). These predictions will be tested against mineral biomarker data (e.g. blood, urine) and proxies of micronutrient status (e.g. stunting) from national surveillance programmes. Outputs of Themes 1 and 2 will be delivered in the forms of maps and reports suited to communicating with policy-makers, to include the communication of uncertainty. Maps will be used to highlight those geographical areas that are at highest likely risk of MNDs. The focus of Theme 3 is interactions with policy-makers to optimise communication strategies, and to strengthen networks and capacity to conduct longer-term R&amp;D to address knowledge gaps in the region.   We have well-established networks of partners in Ethiopia and Malawi, including academics, high-level policy-makers, NGOs and industry, who will all play active roles to ensure that the Foundation Award delivers genuine impact that will be assessed using robust evaluation procedures.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The long-term vision for GeoNutrition is to develop an Agriculture-to-Nutrition framework to reduce mineral Micronutrient Deficiencies (MNDs) in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), and thereby improve human health and well-being. GeoNutrition will build on, and add substantial multi-sector value to, the Africa Soils Information Service (AfSIS) programme. Within this Foundation Award, pathfinder studies will be conducted in Ethiopia and Malawi that are scalable to other countries and regions of the world.  The scientific aim of this project is to understand how the spectral properties of tropical African soils relate to plant-availability of minerals in soils and, subsequently, to the transfer of minerals into the edible portions of staple crops and diets. We will test our predictions with population-level biomarkers (and health proxies) of optimal mineral status. Spectral properties have previously been measured by AfSIS, on a massive scale, using X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF) and Mid Infra-Red (MIR) spectroscopy. Achieving this aim will enable geospatial predictions to be made of plant-available nutrients in soils and in edible crop tissues, based on spectral data and co-variates. Our GeoNutrition proposal is therefore a systems-level approach which moves far beyond agronomic trials and analyses of biomarkers of single-elements.   Specific Objectives:  (1) to predict and test the movement of many micronutrient elements into human diets. [This objective will generate novel data for key elements not covered by AfSIS, including those important for human nutrition (e.g. selenium, iodine) and those which are toxic (e.g. arsenic)]  (2) to develop a mechanistic understanding of soil chemistry factors controlling soil-crop mineral transfer using targeted re-sampling to interpret existing spectral (XRF, MIR, etc.) soil data.  (3) to provide evidence to support public health monitoring, e.g. by integrating existing and new soil/crop data with food consumption and/or micronutrient surveys to encompass a wider range of minerals and potential biomarkers/health proxies. [This objective will be delivered in the form of maps which include the communication of uncertainty].  (4) to predict and communicate situations where interventions such as education programmes, or soil and crop management, could help to reduce MNDs and those in which more direct interventions (e.g. supplementation or food fortification) are required.  (5) to develop a multi-disciplinary network comprising leading academics, high-level policy-makers, and third sector (e.g. NGOs) and industry partners, to facilitate Knowledge Exchange and Capacity Strengthening so that longer-term, policy-relevant R&amp;D programmes can be developed post-Foundation Award.</narrative>
