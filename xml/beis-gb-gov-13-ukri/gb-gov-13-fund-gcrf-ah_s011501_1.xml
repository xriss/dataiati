   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Mapping Development Pathways between Science Research &amp; Innovation (SRI) and SDGs</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">It has long been recognised that investments in knowledge, in the form of Science, Research and Innovation (SRI), can positively influence human capital, economic growth and other Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). However, the processes by which this happens are highly complex, and entangled with socio-political and -economic imperatives. It is thus not apparent how governments and development funders in developing countries (should) channel their limited resources for SRI. To tackle this conundrum, in our report:   1) we intend to identify the main SRI topics that are and have been crucial in the past 18 years (2000-2017), to address the concerns of the SDGs; map evidence at the global and national levels about which research institutions, companies and ODA actors have developed and used SRIs to address SDG concerns; and describe current practices of SRI, situated in different regional contexts including Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), Asia and Africa, which are addressing the SDGs and analyse their relevance at the global landscape level;  2) we develop detailed understanding of the trade-offs and synergies between advances in SRI and the different SDGs, in order to improve the effectiveness of policy interventions for achieving the latter. We will use topic modelling in scientific publications, patents and ODA project reports, a) to provide a comprehensive map of SRIs and their relations to SDGs, building on insights from our literature review and case studies; and b) to produce visualisations and dashboards, based on our results, that will provide policymakers with tools to readily observe the relations between SRIs and SDGs, and to virtually reconfigure the relations based on the focal regions (multilevel), research areas and SDGs. This facilitates the identification of critical trade-offs and synergies between SRIs, and SDGs, allowing policymakers to select plural portfolios of solutions, rather than focussing on promoting a single solution;   3) we identify potential causal mechanisms through which multiple SRI pathways and SDGs may co-evolve. For that we propose to systematise the relations between SRIs, SDGs and actors, by building a taxonomy and classify how different types of SRI pathways (e.g. open/closed; international/domestic; North/South; trans/monodisciplinary; private/public/NGO), promoted by different actors (SRI funders, researchers, and users), are relevant for different SDGs;  4) using multiple methods including real-time Delphi consultation with roughly 2000 professional researchers, a bibliometric study of SRI pathways related to SDGs, and micro case studies, we aim to identify areas in which SRI can produce the most effective impact on concrete SDG outcomes. By analysing the areas that have been prioritised in the past and studying the ones that have proved more effective in addressing SDG concerns, we will suggest what kinds of prioritisation in and across SRI areas may be more effective in the future, while taking into account the changes in macro-political and environmental (climate) scenarios;  5) we will identify obstacles and study disjunctures between policies and practices and the way in which they have been overcome, honing in on best and worst practices. We will identify difficulties and challenges on how SRI may not be able to achieve certain SDGs, through our real-time Delphi survey and workshop. We will also identify and study the areas in which SRI has failed to address SDG concerns;  in order to inform and engage policy-makers, we will produce policy-briefs and share our findings through several impact pathways involving an advisory committee, existing extensive networks, social media, digital magazines and conferences/workshops. We will also produce interactive visualisations, dashboards and policy simulation games that can be readily used by policy- and other decision-makers.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Science, Research and Innovation (SRI) play a crucial role in providing new knowledge, artefacts and evidence-based strategies on how to tackle the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). However, due to the diversity of goals (17), constituting targets (169), indicators (232), and the strong inter-relationships between the SDGs, the potential contribution of SRI towards attaining the SDGs is complex and elusive. As synergies, trade-offs and misalignments emerge between different SRI areas and technologies, and between SDGs, there is no consensus on how science, policy and society should interact with each other, to most effectively achieve the SDGs and constituting targets. In order to fully appreciate the contribution of SRI to SDGs, we need an integrative framework that is capable of mapping and studying the synergies, trade-offs and misalignments across SRI areas and between SRIs and SDGs. The integrative framework should also highlight opportunities to exploit all synergies, while negotiating all trade-offs and misalignments constructively.  Our report aims to develop such an integrative framework, which is conceptually-grounded, empirically-based, and globally-produced. Our analysis aims to empower concrete policy action, for governing and (re)orienting SRI for meeting the SDGs, while accounting for national differences and transdisciplinarity. We will develop a systematic data-driven analysis of:  a) The most relevant SRI areas, and the interactions between them, for addressing each SDG;  b) The synergies, trade-offs and misalignments between the different SDGs and relevant SRI areas;  c) The actors in the SRI system globally, while zooming in to the national and local levels, and emerging developments that are most critical for attaining the SDGs;  d) The most viable and sustainable SRI pathways for the future, in order to achieve the different SDGs and exploit synergies between them; and  e) Concrete policy implications and guidelines, for exploiting and influencing SRI developments and their use, to address all SDGs comprehensively.  To achieve aims (a)-(e), we will build on four complementary levels of analysis - System Mapping, Sub-System Interactions, Micro-Case Studies, and in-Depth Consultations and Engagement, using quantitative and qualiative methods to build the report through five complementary work packages:  1) Identification of relevant SRI areas and technologies by engaging with international experts (methods: focus group/workshop);  2) Mapping of SRIs for each SDG, actors involved, and their relations to develop a taxonomy to map the potential importance of different SRI for SDGs (methods: topic modelling, scienotmetrics and case studies);  3) Analysis of emerging and future SRI developments along multiple pathways, for achieving the SDGs (methods: literature review, focus group/workshop, scientoemtrics and real-time Delphi survey);  4) Policies, tools and implementation with diverse stakeholders to produce detailed evidence on how SRI can be made more central to decision-making for SDGs (methods: case studies, and interactive visualisations, and games); and 5) Continuous consultation and engagement with relevant researchers and experts to interpret results, identify challenges, discuss investment directions and improve impact mechanisms (methods: consultation meetings, workshops and discussions with stakeholders).  The report&apos;s impact on policy and practice will be facilitated through continuous engagement with engaged communites of practice, who will be mapped through a participatory forum involving our high-profile advisory committee and existing networks in which the UK and UNDP teams are involved.</narrative>
