   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Trypanosomatids are eukaryotic parasites that migrate between insect vectors and mammalian hosts. They cause a number of highly debilitating and potentially fatal zoonotic diseases with major impacts on human health (and life-span) on a global scale. Trypanosoma cruzi, which causes Chagas disease, is believed to affect approximately 11 million people in Mexico, Central America and South America. There is currently no vaccine against Chagas disease, and the available antiparasitic treatments are unpleasant and not fully effective. Moreover, resistance to the commonly used azole- and nitro- derivative drugs is rising. Leishmania is spread by sandflies in South America, southern Europe, the Middle East, Asia and Africa, and causes three types of disease (cutaneous, mucocutaneous and visceral leishmaniasis) in approximately 12 million people. Many of the drugs used against Leishmania have side effects, and resistance is on the increase. In this project, we propose to investigate the feasibility of pursuing a new route to developing drugs effective against these dangerous parasites. This route involves differential targeting of the protein synthesis machinery in the parasite so that the human (or animal) host is unaffected.  Over the two years of this project we expect to achieve a significantly enhanced level of understanding of important targets for drugs in trypanosomatids and also to have identified some candidate drugs that can be incorporated into trials in animals subsequent to this study.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="We have put together teams with complementary expertise at the UK universities of Warwick and Leeds and at the ICC Fiocruz in Brazil with a view to develop a new way of tackling highly debilitating diseases caused by trypanosomatid infections. The project will be based on a large body of preliminary data and relevant technical and strategic experience.  In order to achieve rapid progress towards the aim of developing effective drugs, we will bring to bear expertise in structural biology, protein-protein interactions, biophysical analysis of bimolecular interactions, structure and function of the translational machinery, peptidomimetics, small molecule screening, trypanosomatid biology, and cell culture, physiological and molecular techniques for the study of trypanosomatids.  By working as three teams, we will perform the following tasks, largely in parallel:  Relevant characterisation and rate control analysis of trypanosomal cap-binding complex proteins  Production of recombinant translation factors from Leishmania and T.cruzi and analysis of their interactions in vitro  Relevant characterisation of interacting interfaces of the target proteins using biophysical methods including NMR and X-ray crystallography  Screening of small molecules for their ability to interfere with interactions between the trypanosomal translation factors (but not their human equivalents)  Design and testing of peptidomimetics as a basis for informing our understanding of how to target the protein-protein interactions   Detailed analysis of the effects of candidate inhibitors on the growth, infectivity and differentiation of Leishmania and T.cruzi parasites  The above work will both inform our fundamental understanding of key biomolecular interactions in the trypanosomatid translation pathway and help us progress towards developing effective drugs that can be used to fight these parasites."></capital-spend>
