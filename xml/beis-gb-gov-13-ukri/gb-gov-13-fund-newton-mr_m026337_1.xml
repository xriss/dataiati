   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The First Episode of Psychosis is perhaps the most important stage of schizophrenia, unless effective treatment is established during this phase many patients develop an unfavourable clinical outcome. If we can understand the biological markers associated with FEP and subsequent response to treatment, we maybe able to develop ways of predicting which treatment patients will respond best to. However, to understand this we need to examine samples from patients before they undergo drug treatment, as otherwise it is unclear what changes are due to the disorder/episode and what are due to the prescribed medication. We have collected blood samples (RNA, DNA and serum) from psychosis patients who are treatment na&#xEF;ve (before they received drug treatment for the disorder), and who have been followed for 8 weeks (N=80) and one year (N=30) after drug treatment. This group of patients is unique and being able to study biomarkers unaffected by the drugs given as treatments may allow us greater understanding of the causes and potential underlying risks for psychosis.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="Schizophrenia is among the most devastating of psychiatric disorders and is a top-10 cause of disability worldwide. Our objective is to analyze the genomic, transcriptomic and methylomic features in a remarkable and growing longitudinal cohort of antipsychotic-na&#xEF;ve Brazilian First Episode Psychosis patients at first onset (N=80), 8 weeks (N=80) and one year of antipsychotic treatment (N=30).   Genetics Module: Analyze how schizophrenia genomic polygenic risk scores predicts antipsychotic response. Generate gene expression and methylation profiles from blood of treatment-na&#xEF;ve First Episode of Psychosis patients (avoid confounding by treatment). Model and predict schizophrenia progression after eight weeks and one year. Conduct systems biology analysis of data in order to comprehend genetic features of the disease as whole.  Integration module: Teach how to analyze data from gene expression and methylation microarray, by organizing a bioinformatics course in Brazil. Establish a stable partnership between MRC-SGDP, KCL and the Federal University of Sao Paulo."></capital-spend>
