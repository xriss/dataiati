   <narrative xml:lang="EN">ARGENT: ARgentinian GEnomics for Tuberculosis</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The biggest cause of deaths due to infectious disease (over 1 million/year) and drug-resistant infections (~0.5 million/year) is the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which causes tuberculosis (TB). About one third of deaths caused by drug-resistant infections are due to TB. This is possibly the single biggest infectious public health threat the world faces, with 1.6 million reported deaths globally due to TB in 2017 (https://www.who.int/gho/tb/en/). As drug resistance leads to treatment failure, the standard-of-care is to test a bacterial sample from a patient, to determine which drugs are likely to be effective. The gold standard culture-based approach is slow (taking many weeks) and expensive, so many countries use a fast (hours) test based on DNA amplification to detect resistance to rifampicin, the recommended treatment for non-drug-resistant TB. If they see resistance to rifampicin they pragmatically assume the sample is also resistant to isoniazid, and therefore multi-drug resistant (MDR). When this assumption is wrong, the patient is being subjected to 18 months of inappropriate treatment with brutal side-effects.  There is an alternative: the bacteria causing the infection can be isolated from (usually) the sputum of a patient, and the bacterial DNA decoded by a process called whole genome sequencing. Because drug resistance is caused by specific changes to the DNA sequence (mutations) in the bacterium, sequencing provides a comprehensive output describing the resistance profile of the bacteria. There are many roads to drug resistance, and decoding the whole genome allows access to all of these mutations. A secondary benefit to whole-genome sequencing is that closely related bacteria have very similar DNA, and if one person infects another, their bacterial strains are closely related. Thus one can decode the mutation patterns in TB samples from many patients - this provides actionable information that can direct the prevention and management of outbreaks.  The challenge is turning whole-genome sequencing into a production system that runs in a public health lab or hospital, with acceptable error rates and outputs that make sense to doctors, nurses and public health practitioners. The only country in the world to have adopted whole genome sequencing for TB diagnosis, patient management and outbreak surveillance is the UK.   Through the GCRF-funded CABANA-project, EMBL-EBI is collaborating with the Argentinian National Reference Lab, which is responsible for confirming all the TB diagnoses in Argentina and in neighbouring countries. This project, named ARGENT, will achieve two things.   First, it will enable us to perform a feasibility study of  whole-genome sequencing for diagnosis and management of TB in Argentina, working closely with the experts dealing with the TB cases. Introduction of such a service into routine use requires very careful validation and accreditation, which is beyond the scope of this project. However, by specifically introducing a software workflow which is heavily tested, and being developed in the UK into an accredited workflow specifically designed to be shared with other countries.   Second, the project will build a global, open, web platform (Mykrobe Atlas) incorporating all (&gt;50000) global TB genomes, allowing users to upload their own samples and immediately compare theirs with all that have gone before. Since several countries have legal blocks preventing sharing of pathogen sequence data, a key sub-study will be to trial a hub-and-spoke model that allows a country to participate in Atlas while retaining their raw sequence data in country.  Through the supranational network with other countries in Latin America, led by the Argentinian lab, we will share our learning with other national labs in the region, and also in those countries with the greatest burden of disease - in Africa and Asia.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The objectives of this project are:  1.) To implement in Buenos Aires a workflow for sequencing, computational processing and reporting of TB isolates referred from local labs to the National Reference Laboratory (NRL) for Argentina.   2.) To evaluate whole-genome sequencing of TB at the NRL, in terms of cost and effectiveness,  as an alternate to the current standard-of-care, which is based on culture and phenotyping. 3.) To benchmark the analysis component against state-of-the-art options used by other public health agencies. 4.) To implement a global TB surveillance service which allows ultra-finescale real-time monitoring of TB across Argentina, Latin America and beyond, and is properly tailored for public health users. 5.) To trial &quot;Autonomous Sharing&quot; of pathogen sequence data, allowing nations to refrain from sharing their raw sequence data while still actively participating in global management of TB, via smart real-time sharing of data on genetic variation in the bacteria. 6.) To perform a post-mortem exercise after the feasibility pilot, update SOPs, and design a subsequent validation and accreditation process, building on the work already being done (by Crook and Public Health England) to produce a &quot;shrink-wrapped&quot; version of Clockwork for ISO compliance. 7.) To prepare for extending these tools to the rest of Latin America, and beyond, to higher burden countries.  Background context Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) is the causal agent of tuberculosis (TB), a disease that is responsible for the death of 1.3 million people every year. Argentina reported 11503 total cases notified in the 2017 WHO report, with an estimated number of MDR of 520. National surveillance is coordinated by the National Reference Laboratory (NRL) at INEI-ANLIS Dr Carlos G Malbr&#xE1;n, through a network of laboratories that provide the diagnosis of and isolates of MTB. Only 15-17 of these laboratories test for drug susceptibility with GeneXpert machine (which provides incomplete data). The NRL received all MDR detected by the laboratories to test for second line antibiotics, and all the isolates of patients with risk factors to test for drug susceptibility.  The control of TB depends on rapid diagnosis, effective therapy, and control of transmission. For national surveillance, it is also crucial to understand the transmission dynamics of this pathogen, including geographical signatures and transmission chains that are responsible for the emergence of secondary TB cases. For the comparison of isolates, the NRL uses a low resolution technology MIRU/VNTR (see Wyllie et al, for evidence https://www.ebiomedicine.com/article/S2352-3964(18)30262-7/fulltext) Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) is revolutionary, delivering a huge amount of information in a single step, representing a new paradigm for the diagnosis and surveillance of infectious diseases. Given the cost of the laboratory techniques used at the NRL (GeneXpert and MIRU-VNTR), using WGS for the routine surveillance of MTB at the NRL is a viable alternative, especially given the added discriminatory power for epidemiology, patient infection history and the hugely increased power to detect drug resistance compared with GeneXpert.</narrative>
