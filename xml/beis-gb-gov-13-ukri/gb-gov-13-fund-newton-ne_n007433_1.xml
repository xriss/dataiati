   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Loess Plateau of China covers an area 2.5x the size of the UK (some 640,000 square km) in the upper and middle reaches of China&apos;s Yellow River and is renowned for having the most severe soil erosion in the world; deforestation, over-grazing and poor agricultural practice have resulted in degenerated ecosystems, desertification and unproductive agriculture in the region. To control severe soil erosion on the Loess Plateau, the Chinese government imposed a series of policies for fragile ecosystems, such as the 1999 state-funded &quot;Grain-for-Green&quot; project, which has resulted in significant land use changes. Related programmes have produced beneficial effects on soil erosion and water cycles. However, the impact of these changes in soil and water processes on related ecosystem services is unknown and demands further study. The proposed research will focus on three spatial scales: slope, watershed, and region. It uses a combination of A) experiments to collect environmental, biological and agronomic data; B) remote sensing data and C) modelling approaches.   A) Data collection: Four experimental stations located in four main topographical regions of the Plateau are chosen as case studies: 1) Ansai Comprehensive Experimental Station of Soil and Water Conservation; 2) Changwu Agro-ecology Experiment Station; 3) Guyuan Ecological Station; 4) Shenmu Erosion and Environment Station. At each station, treatments of different vegetative covers, slopes, and the practices of soil and water conservation at the plot scale were set up in the 1980s and data collections include: soil water, canopy size, runoff, soil losses and meteorological records. Most of the Chinese members of this project have been involved in prior studies at the stations. At the slope scale, additional environmental, biological and agronomic data will be monitored in a sub-set of the plots. At watershed scale, four watersheds where the stations are located will be monitored. The spatial distribution of the following variables will be measured: precipitation, soil properties, vegetative types, canopy size, runoff and soil loss.  B) Remote sensing data collection: At the regional scale, remote sensing combined with ground-truthing data will be used to investigate the spatial variability of vegetation type, land cover, productivity, the components of water balance, soil losses, soil type, etc.  C) Modelling approaches: a cascade approach will be used to build an improved model framework applied to different spatial scales. Mechanistic soil-water-plant models will be applied to the slope scale. Their outputs will then be used as inputs for models at watershed level. Spatial empirical/statistical models will be used at the regional level. Observed and collected data from A) and B) will be used to further develop, calibrate and validate our models. Model simulations at the slope level will be used to reveal the dynamic mechanisms in soil and water in different regions and analyse the effects of vegetation type, soil type, slope degree, climatic factors and management practice. Watershed models will estimate soil and water carrying capacity for different vegetation types, predict the effect of land use/cover changes on soil losses, water cycle and ecosystem services and evaluate management scenarios in the practices of soil and water conservation, vegetative changes, and ecosystem services. The soil and water carrying capacity for different vegetation types and the optimal ecosystem services will be addressed at the regional scale. Outreach workshops and demonstrations will disseminate knowledge to farmers and policy makers.  The proposed research will elucidate the coupled relationships between soil and water processes and agro-ecosystem services at various scales, and evaluate the effects of vegetation cover and changes in land use on water cycle, soil erosion, and ecosystem services across the Loess Plateau.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="By bringing together internationally excellent scientific groups in this project, we will create a collaborative potential for research that is not achievable by any one organisation or any one country alone. This level of synergy is necessary if the complex challenges facing the delivery of China&apos;s ecosystems services in association with agricultural production are to be met and the translation of solutions are to be effective. The proposed research will elucidate the coupled relationships between soil and water processes and agro-ecosystem services at various scales, and evaluate the effects of vegetation cover and changes in land use on water cycle, soil erosion, and ecosystem services across the Loess Plateau. This proposal aims to sustain agricultural production while mitigating adverse environmental impacts in the fragile Loess agroecological zone. The main objective is to study the coupled processes and mechanisms between the soil and water processes and ecosystem services across different scales by combining observation and modelling techniques. The specific objectives are:   1) To understand the processes of water movement and soil erosion at different spatio-temporal scales through observation and modelling. Key questions to address are: identifying the contribution of individual components to water balance and soil losses; analysing the effects of slope degree, soil types, and topographies on the processes; studying the dynamic features in soil and water processes in the different regions of the Loess Plateau.  (2) To investigate the impacts of different vegetation types, including crops, grasses, shrubs and forests on the processes of soil and water and to predict the consequence of water and soil processes with vegetative cover changes. Key questions to address are: the relationships between vegetation and soil and water processes; the effect of vegetation changes on the components of water balance and soil losses; the spatio-temporal variability of soil water content with different vegetative types and regional differences in these relationships.   (3) To find optimal ecosystem services for different vegetation types, supported by local water and soil resources, and to provide recommendations to policy makers at both local and central levels of government on sustainable management of soil, water, and the ecosystems in the Loess Plateau. Key questions to address are: the impacts of land degradation and rehabilitation on key ecosystem services at multiple scales; the effect of water and soil processes on ecosystem services; the trade-offs and synergies among key ecosystem services; and the relationships between soil erosion, water and soil organic matter content."></capital-spend>
