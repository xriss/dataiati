   <narrative xml:lang="EN">START is a proposal to utilise Synchrotron Techniques for African Research and Technology. It will build a partnership between world leading scientists in Africa and the UK who specialise in two strands of science; developing and characterising novel energy materials (catalysts and photovoltaics) and structural biology (understanding disease and developing drug targets). In START the research direction will be set by considering the local environment and through engagement with scientists, energy industry representatives and relevant non-governmental organisations (NGO&apos;s) across Africa.  Most importantly, START is not only about developing new energy materials or structural biology research; equally important is training the next generation of researchers and research leaders in these important areas of study. We will work together in sample fabrication and advanced characterisation through training visits between African and UK institutes. This will include experimental time at Diamond Light Source (the UK national synchrotron source) through peer reviewed access to many of the experimental facilities and in techniques that are the mainstay of understanding these materials. A major ambition of this partnership is to strengthen and broaden the network of synchrotron researchers in Africa, where there is a burgeoning ambition to exploit such facilities. This talent development will benefit the researchers themselves but also the local communities, society in general and the environment, through the reduction of burning fossil fuels and improved healthcare.  There are unique challenges to developing sustainable energy in Africa; the large fraction of off-grid consumers, the degradation of energy devices in an environment of heat and dust and the high initial capital costs for traditional installations of energy production or storage systems. Similarly challenging is addressing the health needs on the African continent, where diseases like tuberculosis and malaria negatively affect whole societies. The first step to finding and developing cures is to understand the molecular structure. Thus for both strands of research, synchrotron radiation for structure determination is at the core of scientific progress. It is critical that the countries in Africa expand their own capabilities to produce the next generation of appropriate energy materials and development of cures for relevant diseases. START aims to aid those developments through building the capacity and capability of African based scientists in both strands.   The START team is driven by the ambition to work together to solve these two strands of research, addressing some of the most pressing problems that will directly impact on peoples lives. This proposal is directly in line with the development aspirations of the African Nations who have a stated ambition to &apos;transform Africa from traditional to modern sources of energy and ensure access of all Africans to clean and affordable electricity&apos; and &apos;Develop/implement strategies for the growth of the pharmaceutical industry in Africa&apos;. Our aspirations are furthermore directly in line with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals of Affordable and Clean Energy (Goal 7) and Climate Action (Goal 13) as well as Goal 3 (Good Health and Well-Being). START will help to contribute in all of these areas, which crucially underpin many of the further Sustainable Development Goals.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="1) Create a UK-Africa partnership to develop a programme of world class research based around energy materials (strand 1) and protein structure determination (strand 2), for which we have brought together leading investigators from across Africa and the UK. This will be developed into a true partnership with shared goals and ideals - so that we are able to address SDG 3, 7 and 13 together and for the benefit of Africa. Some investigators have been working together for some time and others have similar research ambitions; investigators will work together in the two strands areas but come together to share best practice and cross theme challenges.  2) Identify and tackle specific issues to developing energy materials for Africa - While the priority challenges are generally clear, the route to specifically address them needs to be clarified. There is, for example, a clear opportunity to develop new materials to harness solar energy, optimised to the local environmental conditions but these may be based on organics, perovskites or many other potential components. We will develop an agreed strategic direction to work on the most promising research routes, together with leading NGO groups within the region including ANSOLE, ASLP and Smart Villages Initiative.  3)  Undertake research into emerging and neglected diseases of direct importance to the African continent through an extensive programme of structural biology.  4) Extended training in Synchrotron techniques - The nexus of START is Diamond Light Source, the UK synchrotron. The research themes have a common requirement of advanced characterisation using techniques only available at a synchrotron. Africa is the only habitable continent that does not have its own synchrotron, but there is a growing ambition to develop an African Light Source. Increasing the number of highly trained African researchers in synchrotron techniques is a key goal, that we will promote through visits to Diamond. UK based researchers will go on reciprocal visits to deliver training courses.   5) Engage with a broader audience - Understanding and engagement of the research undertaken is critical to societal acceptance. START researchers will all engage with a broader range of scientists, policy makers, general public and children about the what synchrotron techniques can do to address the SDG.  6) Break down barriers - We will challenge the under-representation of women and other groups in materials research, building on the leading roles that e.g Bassioni has in women in science initiatives within the region.  7) Enduring cooperation between world leading scientists - The success of START will be its legacy. We aim to ensure that the partnerships created during START will lead to further research cooperation (e.g. joint grant applications) and lifelong collaborations of both investigators and PDRAs.  8) Develop the next generation of research leaders - We aim to train the PDRAs in high quality research techniques but also more broadly in aspects of innovation and leadership. They will develop their own projects within START and we will encourage independence early in the project.  9) Ensure that the flow of information and talent is not one way - START will build capability in the African and UK research team. Through direct engagement, UK researchers will benefit from the drive to solve specific challenges for Africa; developing world leading research, teaching, training and forging lifelong collaborations."></capital-spend>
