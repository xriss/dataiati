   <narrative xml:lang="EN">GCRF - Low cost technologies for safe drinking water in developing regions (SAFEWATER)</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">At least 1.8 billion people globally use a source of drinking water that is faecally contaminated and thus likely to lead to diarrheal illness: nearly 1,000 children die each day due to water and sanitation-related diarrhoeal diseases.   Safe drinking-water is required for all usual domestic purposes, including drinking, food preparation and personal hygiene.  Diseases related to the consumption of contaminated drinking-water place a major burden on human health. In 2015 663 million people still lacked access to an improved drinking water source, and these are mostly the poor and marginalized. Almost a quarter of those people rely on surface water which is untreated and over 90% live in rural areas. Many people are forced to rely on sources that are microbiologically unsafe, leading to a higher risk of contracting waterborne diseases, including typhoid, hepatitis A and E, polio and cholera. This proposal aims to develop and assess low cost technologies for safe drinking water which can help address the significant socioeconomic impact of water borne diseases in developing regions.  We will establish a centre which will involve a range of different expertise collaborating with universities in Brazil and Colombia and two not-for-profit organisations from Colombia and Mexico.  The objectives are to develop low cost technologies to give clean water to the poor people in rural Brazil, Colombia and Mexico, and to develop devices which can be used to assess drinking water quality in remote regions without access to high tech laboratories.  These water technologies will be tested under real conditions with the cooperation of the rural communities.   We shall also assess any health benefits in the communities following the use of the technologies to give safe water. The main benefit of this research will be a reduced incidence of water borne diseases in developing regions.  This will result in less illness and fewer deaths for children.  This will also lead to improved quality of life for families.  Females are normally responsible for water in the home and user-friendly, safe water systems will result in less pressure on females.  Reduced illness means that children are more able to attend school and there will be less absence from employment for adults.  If local communities can get involved in the manufacture, deployment and/or maintenance of water treatment systems, then this may lead to economic development in the communities.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">i. Undertake a transdisciplinary analysis involving all stakeholders leading to the formation of the common research objectives which should deliver safe drinking water to the poor in developing regions. ii. Build capability at Ulster and grow capacity with our collaborators in Brazil, Colombia and Mexico (extending that relationship to other NGOs and local government).  iii. Develop prototypes systems for household/community based water treatment and prototype devices for water quality assessment for use in the field. iv. Undertake field trials of the enhanced technologies in ODA countries to assess the efficacy of the technologies and determine the health impact at a community level.  v. Disseminate research by publishing in high impact journals, presentation at conferences, publishing and presenting  to non-scientific audiences, end-user engagement by local workshops (in ODA countries);  vi. Inform policy by publishing reports concerning cost-benefit analysis of low cost technologies for drinking water.   vii. Sustain the collaborations through further funding and development activities beyond the life of the programme.</narrative>
