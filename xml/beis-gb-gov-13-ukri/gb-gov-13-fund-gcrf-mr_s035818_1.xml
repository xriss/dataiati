   <narrative xml:lang="EN">A lack of research training, resources, infrastructure and data in Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMIC) greatly limits their ability to conduct studies of common mental health conditions. Nowhere is this more true than in Africa generally and in Malawi specifically, where sparse mental health care alone limits not only clinical research capacity, but also the ability to attract inward investment. In a partnership between UK and Malawian institutions, we propose to directly address this challenge by building clinical research capacity through the coordinated appointment of new researchers and research assistants, a programme of education and dissemination, and the development of a population mental health dataset focussed on an area of great unmet need - the mental heath of mothers and their children.   After a period of piloting our research assessments and obtaining the necessary approvals, we will recruit 5000 mothers prior to delivery of their child from antenatal clinics in Lilongwe and Karonga districts, selected to represent urban and rural populations respectively. We will assess the mental health of mothers before and after birth, and the mental health of their spouses and other family members with a view to identifying the major risk factors for mental health disorders and mitigating variables that promote resilience. We will then examine the impact of maternal and, where possible, paternal mental health on the neurodevelopment of their offspring.   In addition to creating new and highly valuable data, we will also create the bioresources needed for future genetics and &apos;omics based research. We believe this is essential to prevent the current imbalance in genetic research favouring rich countries of predominantly European ancestries leading to greater entrenchment of global health inequalities.  As part of the proposed work, we will develop internationally competitive research capacity and datasets in Malawi, augment standard of care treatment, develop research training and the availability of affordable and effective interventions for depression and other common mental disorders, such as the &quot;Friendship Bench&quot; intervention. Our research will be multidisciplinary, involving experts from psychiatry, clinical psychology, nursing, reproductive and child health, and social sciences in both UK and Malawi. Throughout the project, we will carefully monitor our progress and impact on the participants and their communities.   The project, if funded, will lead to a step change in mental health research capacity in Malawi, paving the way for new inward investment and the development of evidence based interventions and policies.</narrative>
