   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Venturing into under-researched areas (disability studies in Africa and the religio-cultural narratives of disability in Namibia) this project will develop a &apos;Diverse Bodies Namibia&apos; network, collaboratively created by the Universities of Namibia and Exeter, the National Federation of People with Disabilities in Namibia and the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Namibia.   Religio-cultural attitudes can be co-opted into disabling narratives, whether around illness, or experiences of specific disabilities (physical/sensory/mental) and those associated with gender and sexuality. For example, illness may be associated with sin or spirit-affliction and people with disabilities may encounter perceptions of deficiency, pity or as requiring cure. Gender as disability means that women are exposed to the patriarchal religious or cultural attitudes that may undergird a scourge of gender-based violence. Contestation over where religious and cultural authority lies concerning issues of sexuality has precipitated a polarised debate on the ground, lacking in nuance. The stark inequalities caused by Namibia&apos;s colonial legacy are compounded by, and intersect with, divisions of race and ethnicity. These unchecked inequalities contribute to intensified experiences of poverty, exclusion and a lack of well-being.  The project will focus initially on a traditional understanding of disability. We will document lived experiences of physical and mental illness in Namibia alongside church responses and develop an educational package based on biblical and local cultural resources that tackles marginalising discourses. Given its use to address social injustices in Southern Africa, Contextual Bible Study has been chosen as an appropriate methodological approach to complement disability studies in a context where 90% of the population is Christian.   The network will gradually expand to collaborators in well-established, pioneering activist-advocacy groups in Namibia - those concerned with social justice, development, and disability/gender/LGBTQI+ rights. In this forum, academic and activist-advocacy groups can engage with church representatives in a collaborative effort to explore and interrogate dominant religious and cultural narratives surrounding diverse experiences of embodiment. It will consider the extent to which missionary-colonial narratives of &apos;normativity&apos; have been co-opted and are being refigured and rehearsed as inviolable, Christian and/or indigenous narratives. It will then go on to consider ways in which those same religio-cultural resources might be employed in the promotion of equality, inclusivity and diversity, in line with the UN 2030 Agenda&apos;s drive to &apos;leave no one behind&apos;.   The network will bring together expertise on the impoverishing effects that people with disabilities experience disproportionately: disempowerment, marginalisation, stigmatisation, inadequate access to health care and education, socio-economic struggle, and even violence. The network will exchange knowledge and collaborate further on four themes:  i. collating and foregrounding impoverishing experiences of disability  ii. understanding challenges and priorities from the perspective of the disabled and their advocates iii. mapping and interrogating religious and cultural narratives of inclusion/exclusion iv. addressing religious and cultural narratives of inclusion/exclusion in order to promote inclusivity, equality and diversity and, thereby, to maximise potential for development.  The network will convene participants at 3 workshops, with resources being trialled throughout the year. It draws upon substantial regional academic expertise in religion and social justice, thereby promoting &apos;South-South&apos; collaboration alongside UK-LMIC collaboration. Members of the network will foster Namibian-centred approaches to the promotion of equality and diversity, avoiding the pitfalls of importing Western approaches to embodied diversities.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="This interdisciplinary network, &apos;Diverse Bodies Namibia&apos;, will engage diverse Namibian audiences (academics, community/activist/advocacy groups, and church/political/traditional authority representatives). Together, we will explore under-researched religio-cultural narratives of normative embodiment, both in history and reception. Exploring the various influences of these narratives within medical, social and cultural models of disability in Namibia will allow us to interrogate their disabling effects on those of diverse embodiment. This collaboration between the Universities of Namibia and Exeter, the National Federation of People with Disabilities in Namibia (NFPDN) and the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Namibia (ELCIN) culminates on the International Day of Persons with Disabilities 2020. It will:  1) Facilitate sustained transdisciplinary communication and knowledge-transfer between researchers and non-academic collaborators, to enhance understanding of inclusion, equality and diversity in Namibia. Sustained engagement will pave the way for a legacy research project, towards which the remaining objectives contribute.  2) Document lived experiences of disability in Namibia: a. Develop links with non-academic participants in collaboration with NFPDN b. Gather participants at Workshop 1: &apos;Experiences of Disability&apos; to listen to and document experiences of physical/sensory/mental disabilities. These lived experiences, as part of the legacy research project (and subject to ethical consent), would be developed into a digital resource (in Community Story Project format: https://www.windowseatmedia.org/voices-from-the-harbor-community-story-project) and an exhibition in co-operation with the Owela Museum, Windhoek c. Agree the major, shared challenges and priorities faced by people with disabilities in Namibia d. Gather feedback from non-academic collaborators on planned academic outputs e. Use the disability studies lens to explore with participants a broader understanding of disability (gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, social background and locality), which will be embraced in the legacy project.  3) Document church perspectives on disability in Namibia: a. Develop clergy network in collaboration with ELCIN b. Gather ELCIN participants at Workshop 2: &apos;Disability, Religion and Culture&apos; to listen to and document church perspectives on disability c. Use the disability studies lens to explore with participants a wider understanding of disability (as 2e, above).  4) Develop and trial an inclusive educational resource taking into account disability, church, community and cultural perspectives. This would be modelled on Contextual Bible Study (CBS), an Afro-centric approach that uses biblical texts as stimuli to explore religious and cultural attitudes and promote social justice. We will trial CBS sessions with (i) NFPDN participants, (ii) ELCIN participants, and (iii) community groups. Thereafter, we would present a refined version of the resource and gather feedback at the Workshop 3: &apos;Challenging Disability Marginalisation in Namibia&apos;.  5) Promote South-South collaboration amongst Southern African scholars and non-academic collaborators: a. Learning from regional colleagues (Universities of KwaZulu-Natal, Zimbabwe, Western Cape) about the use of religious and cultural resources in the promotion of equality and social justice (invited speakers, Workshop 1-3) b. Use the disability studies lens to explore with scholars a wider understanding of disability (as 2e, above)  6) Co-author a peer-reviewed academic article and grant proposal (Universities of Namibia and Exeter) for a major interdisciplinary research project on &apos;Disability and Embodiment in Namibia: Religious and Cultural Perspectives&apos;, both to be evaluated at Workshop 3. Co-author 4 blogposts for the &apos;Global Challenges Collaboratory&apos; (University of Exeter), of which Louise Lawrence and Helen John are members."></capital-spend>
