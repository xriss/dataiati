   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Through a close collaboration between the leading UK/Chinese universities and the top Chinese/UK companies, the proposed UK-China collaborative R&amp;I project will develop a novel building integrate-able solar PV/T system for space heating, hot water and power supply. The universities have specific knowledge of the most advanced PV/T and loop heat pipe technologies and also expertise in China-oriented business strategy. The companies have strong R&amp;D and manufacturing capacity in solar PV, thermal, PV/T and heat storage/exchangers. The new PV/T system will achieve around 30% higher overall solar efficiency and 20% cost saving compared to the existing equivalent PV/T systems and will be flexible in component selection to meet different needs in buildings. The innovative technologies include (1) a novel loopheat- pipe (LHP); (2) a novel PV/T panel; (3) a highly efficient heat storage/exchanger, and (4) an internet-based intelligent monitoring and control system. In terms of tasks, the project involves development of (1) a computerised design and optimisation model; (2) an experimental prototype and associated test rig; (3) a pre-production solar PV/T system for real building use; and (4) the economic, environmental and market performance reports and business model specifically tailored for the PV/T system.  Within the Consortium, QMUL will be responsible for development of a business model and completion of a market analysis relating to the innvotive solar PV/T system. These works will help prediction of the market sizes of the new PV/T system in China and development of the appropriate business strategy and action plan. Further, QMUL will head up the dissemination activities including networking, workshops, website etc, thus maximising the impact of the research at a global extent. Based on the established successes in managing the UK-China collaborative projects and knowledge/technology transfers, QMUL will also help with transfer of technologies and development of a joint business among the UK and Chinese partners. Finally, QMUL will involve economic and environmental analyses of the new technology that will enable assessment of feasibility and affordability of the new PV/T system and its potential environmental benefits.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="The overall aim of the project is to develop a novel building integrate-able solar PV/T system for space heating, hot water and power supply, which has around 30% higher overall solar efficiency and 20% lower cost compared to the existing equivalent PV/T systems. From technical point of view, the project has four specific objectives, as below: (1) Development of computer models for the individual technologies and integrated system, leading to a fully-integrated, computerised PV/T system design and optimisation model; (2) Construction/testing of a 5kW rated experimental PV/T system, leading to an experimental prototype PV/T system and associated test rig; (3) Field testing/demonstration of a 20kW rated PV/T system at FIVE-STAR, leading to a pre-production solar PV/T heat and power system installed in a real building; (4) Investigation of the economic and environmental performance, market analysis and business modelling of the PV/T system, leading to the economic, environmental and market analyses reports and business model specifically tailored for the PV/T system.  Furthermore, the project has a non-technical objective which is to carry out a series of planned exploitation and dissemination activities to facilitate future marketing of the technology and promote academic advancement in this area. As a project particpant, Queen Mary University of London (QMUL) will be responsible for market analysis and business model development of the novel solar PV/T system, and assist in relevant economic and environmental analyses.  Furthermore, QMUL will lead the dissemination activities and help with exploitation of the innovative technology across China and worldwide. The specific objectives of QMUL&apos;s works are: (1) To assess feasibility and affordability of the new PV/T system and its potential environmental benefits in China, through dedicated economic and environmental performance analyses; (2) To predict the market sizes of the new PV/T system in China, through a dedicated market analysis, taking into account the governmental incentive plans, customers&apos; knowledge, values and beliefs to renewable energy application, and their environmental concerns and lifestyle preferences; (3) To schedule a business plan, by developing a business model and implementing the modelling solutions; (4) To make necessary preparation for initiating a new PV/T business, by involving a series of exploitation related activities, e.g., data/knowledge management, IP management and transfer, and license and business agreements development etc. (5) To publicise the project findings to wide range of societies globally, through dedicated dissemination and communication actions, e.g., workshops, conferences, networking, internet and audio materials etc.  The whole project will be coordinated by Prof. X. Zhao of UHULL. The management/reporting lines will be: &apos;Individual Partners&apos; - to - &apos;Task Leaders&apos; - to - &apos;WP leaders&apos; - to - &apos;Project Steering Committee&apos; (chaired by Prof. Zhao and comprising the PIs of the five partners)) - to - &apos;Innovate-UK&apos; (by the UK leader - UHULL) and &apos;MOST&apos; (by the China leader - USTC). All partners will meet at quarterly intervals (kick-off/12-month meetings in the UK, final meeting in China, remaining meetings at their own countries with the overseas partners participating by Skype) to review project progress, identify any discrepancies between the scheduled and actual achievements and develop associated contingency plans."></capital-spend>
