  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Agenda 2030 of the UN sets out ambitious challenges for society to achieve 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). While all SDGs are important in Africa, those related to poverty (SDG 1, 8), inequality (SDG 5, 10) and climate change (SDG 13, 7) are especially relevant. Africa has some of the highest global poverty rates, levels of inequality, climate vulnerabilities, and shortfalls in energy access. Making substantial progress on all these SDGs will require action in any single SDG domain that maximises synergies and co-benefits and avoids as much as possible negative trade-offs.  Aims and Objectives:   Our project&apos;s overarching research question is: How do African societies design and implement climate action to improve sustainable livelihoods, and reduce both poverty and inequality? For example, all African countries need to adapt their food systems to be more resilient to climate change, but there are different routes to achieving this - such as investing in large-scale industrialised agriculture or supporting small-scale farmers to be more climate smart - which can result in very different livelihood benefits across society.   Our second objective is to build a network of African-UK researchers who can bring deep disciplinary expertise to bear on this interdisciplinary problem. In particular, our project brings together two newly-established ARUA Centres of Excellence (CoE) on climate change and inequalities, with world-leading expertise from the UK, to form this network and to work at the nexus of climate change, inequality and poverty.   Our Approach:   To address the climate-poverty-inequality nexus in Africa we have created an interdisciplinary research team with expertise in development economics, livelihoods, poverty and inequality, climate policy and governance, energy and mitigation, and adaptation. We will answer our research questions through comparative research across three country settings - Ghana, Kenya and South Africa - that will allow us to synthesise commonalities and differences across these different contexts.   Our approach is multi-scale and multi-dimensional, seeking to understand i) the political, economic and policy context within which transformative climate actions are enabled (or prevented); ii) how socio-economic and climate change policies have affected livelihood trajectories of different groups in society; iii) the potential outcomes from climate change actions, with a focus on how these outcomes vary across social groups, especially between men and women, but also social differences such as education, income, and land tenure; iv) how existing climate actions are working (or not) to build sustainable livelihood trajectories for communities; v) understanding the country-wide social and economic benefits of different climate actions, when applied at scale. Our project will involve close collaboration with leaders in policy and practice, and also with communities, so that their needs and priorities inform our research, and so that our research in turn shifts their thinking and actions.   Project Outcomes:   - A well-established, pan-African research network that has multiple collaborations within this project, and in new projects leveraged out of this project.  - Evidence on the synergies and trade-offs between climate action, poverty and inequality.  - Evidence on how specific national priority climate actions can be designed to deliver co-benefits for livelihoods and reducing poverty and inequality. - Ultimately, climate policies and associated actions to be transformative in improving livelihoods and well-being, reducing poverty and inequality, rather than business as usual at national and global political levels.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The overall objective of TSITICA is to build an African-led transdisciplinary research team that will generate high quality evidence and understanding of how climate change action can leverage sustainable development outcomes in Africa. The project addresses the nexus between climate change, sustainable livelihoods and multidimensional poverty and inequality to tackle the overall question of how climate actions can be deliberately targeted to improve livelihoods and equitable benefits for the most vulnerable and poor.   Research Objectives: To investigate the bidirectional relationships between climate actions and social inequalities and benefits, across three contrasting African countries: Ghana, Kenya and South Africa. The research aims to address three questions: i) How do social inequalities within the political economy shape decision-making processes and climate action outcomes? ii) How development policy, and especially, climate actions for adaptation and mitigation of climate have, and will in future, impact on all livelihoods in society, with particular attention to women and youth; iii) How specific climate actions can transform social inequalities by producing co-benefits for all, especially the most vulnerable, whilst leveraging favourable outcomes for the SDG.   Specific Research Objectives:   1. Identify institutions &amp; policies, which are changing or sustaining inequalities. 2. Contribute to a better understanding of entry points for climate action, considering the constellations between actors, interests, income distribution &amp; institutions in each country. 3. Understand local livelihood dynamics in specific communities as well as changing spatial relationships between communities over time. 4. Provide a detailed picture of multidimensional well-being in each country, at the national &amp; local levels, including poverty traps &amp; the dynamics across the low, middle &amp; top end of income distributions. 5. Understand social mobility in each of the countries, with focus on the relationship between ownership of &amp; access to wealth &amp; assets &amp; persistent poverty &amp; inequality in each of the three countries. 6. Identify SDG impacts in specific climate actions, &amp; their pros and cons in terms of sustainable livelihood and co-benefits in reducing poverty and inequality. 7. Generate empirical evidence on both the SDG co-benefits and unintended inequality outcomes across different social groups from climate change projects where these have been implemented in different settings across the three countries. 8. Develop analytical frameworks allowing for cross-case comparisons across communities, using both econometric &amp; qualitative comparative analysis techniques. 9. Ensure consistency in research methods across working streams and to enable cross-fertilisation between these streams, synthesising insights &amp; evidence on specific questions across the network. 10. Develop frameworks for policy planning &amp; emissions analysis that can inform the determination of national contributions. 11. Synthesise results into to influence decision-makers and communities in understanding &amp; rethinking &amp; ultimately changing their climate actions.   Networking Objectives:   TSITICA aims to lay the foundations of an inclusive, transdisciplinary, pan-African network of researchers and practitioners on climate change &amp; inequality. The first building blocks of this network involve bringing to together two ARUA CoEs - each with strong teams in Ghana, Kenya and South Africa. This will consolidate and increase research capacity for the analysis of climate action, social inequality, sustainable livelihoods and the relationships between them.  The research activities will occur in collaboration with practitioners in government, the private sector, and civil society to drive the desired changes in thinking and practice to meet TSITICA&apos;s ultimate goal of achieving improved livelihoods &amp; equitable benefits from climate actions for the most vulnerable.</narrative>
