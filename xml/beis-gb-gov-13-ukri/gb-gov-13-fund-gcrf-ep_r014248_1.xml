   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Cambodia is one of the world&apos;s most landmine affected countries with over 64,000 casualties recorded since 1979 and over 25,000 amputees. Added to this there is also a rise in the number of amputations resulting from road traffic accidents. Currently around 10 million people in South East Asia, India and Sri Lanka need but do not have access to prosthetic and orthotic services and there is a deficit of circa 40,000 professionals. This project directly targets end-users (Prosthetists and amputees) in Cambodia with a view to future expansion into the Philippines, Myanmar, Indonesia and Sri Lanka through strategic partnership with Prosthetics and Orthotics NGO Exceed Worldwide and the Exceed Research Network. We have active collaborations with UK (and European) prosthetics manufacturers (Blatchfords, Otto Bock, &#xD6;ssur), NHS prosthetics and rehabilitation services, and the Defence National Rehabilitation Centre Headley Court.  Recent developments in medical care have resulted in a surgical preference for through-knee amputation where previously above knee amputation was considered preferable. Through-knee amputations allow the socket for the prosthesis to fit on the stump so that the load through the artificial foot and knee is transmitted directly to the end of the stump; this maintains healthy, normal load through the thigh bone. An above knee amputation does not permit this normal loading; the socket has to transmit the loads all the way to the pelvic bone, partially bypassing the thigh, causing pressure sores, inhibiting the range of motion of the amputated limb, and producing bone fragility in the thigh. Therefore, through-knee amputations result in a reduction in pain, fewer incidences of bone formation within muscle (a highly debilitating complication), the ability to bear significantly higher loads, and maintain bone health. The cost (&gt;&#xA3;50,000 per device) and maintenance required make modern sockets and powered knee mechanisms designed for through-knee amputees inappropriate for use in low and middle income countries. Current low cost solutions for this provided by the adaptation of Red Cross knee joint prostheses suffer from major limitations such as an inability to be locked in extension, severe compromises on cosmetic appearance resulting in social exclusion, and a very low prosthetic knee joint (due to the long thigh component) producing other functional deficits. In this project we will develop a low-cost through-knee prosthesis the initial concept for which has been developed by the applicants through prior work with partners in Cambodia. This will be developed further to create a pathway to support the translation of future frugal technology projects (projects that are low cost in terms of manufacture and maintenance) and we will populate this frugal technology pathway with a series of follow on prosthetics and orthotics projects for amputees. Finally, we will ensure that there is a route to harness the frugal technology development for low and middle income countries for the benefit of healthcare in the UK. This project will create a community of researchers, engineers and clinicians developing and translating affordable prostheses.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The overall aim of this proposal is to address the societal needs of the large number of through-knee amputees in low and middle income countries (LMICs) through the design, development and translation of novel frugal technologies. Our headline aims are, in order of priority: 1. to develop a low-cost through-knee prosthesis specifically aimed at amputees in LMICs (initially Cambodia) the initial concept for which has been developed in previous phase of work; 2. to develop a pathway to support the translation of future frugal technology projects into developing countries.  This pathway, as to be demonstrated by the low-cost through-knee prosthesis development, will provide a route to fast-track the development of frugal technology into a field where it is desperately needed; 3. to develop and populate a prosthetics and orthotics project pipeline to promote the rapid translation of appropriate frugal technology concepts to the LMIC market where they are in need; and 4. to harness the frugal technologies pipeline in a reverse innovation process through the network of prosthesis manufacturers with whom the applicants have a strong working relationship. We will achieve these aims through our targeted objectives. 1. LOW COST THROUGH-KNEE PROSTHESIS  1.1 To research the performance of existing knee prosthesis solutions for through-knee amputations used in the field as a bench mark for evaluation. 1.2 To design and prototype a through-knee prosthesis which meets specific user requirements such as: being low-cost; providing through-knee amputees with greater functionality such as a locking knee mechanism; being physiologically representative to minimise the social impact of their disability and provide a more natural walking gait; providing variable resistance to produce a more natural walking gait; enabling Prosthetists to easily align and adjust to suit the patient; and being suitable for local manufacture in Cambodia. 1.3 To evaluate the user requirements and analyse the design performance in comparison. 1.4 To evaluate component performance within laboratory conditions. 1.5 To manufacture prostheses for user trials. 1.6 To assess the prosthesis performance in desired use scenarios. 1.7 To produce a package of deliverables for scale up of manufacture. 1.8 To produce a package of deliverables for prospective distribution routes. 2. FRUGAL TECHNOLOGY PATHWAY 2.1 To incorporate a network of collaborators (engineers, clinicians, Prosthetists and manufacturers) for the development and support of the frugal technology pathway concept. 2.2 Development of an evaluation methodology for future concepts. 2.3 To organise a collective of manufacturers in LMICs for future developments. 2.4 To coordinate a distribution route through which low-cost prosthetics can be made accessible to those with the greatest need. 3. PROSTHETICS AND ORTHOTICS PIPELINE 3.1 To formalise procedures for a project pipeline through which new concepts may be proposed, evaluated and developed utilising the Frugal Technology Pathway.) 3.2 To evolve the design of existing knee prostheses to allow for squatting and cross-legged sitting. 3.3 To develop a knee prosthesis for children. 4. REVERSE INNOVATION 4.1 To create a set of formal interactions with our network of advanced prosthesis manufacturers (including members of the Exceed Research Network such as Blatchfords) to focus and drive a mechanism of Reverse Innovation, leveraging the technologies developed in this project. 4.2 To evaluate the potential benefits of the outcomes of the Frugal Technology Pathway to the NHS through a set of formal interactions with leaders in Prosthetics and Physiotherapy in the UK, including those at Charing Cross Hospital and DMRC Headley Court, who have advised on the initial phase of the through-knee project.</narrative>
