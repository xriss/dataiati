   <narrative xml:lang="EN">&apos;A sustainable re-construction method for seismic-prone heritage areas of India based on advanced recording technologies&apos;</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Buildings and public spaces in seismic-prone heritage areas are in constant risk of damage so their physical preservation implies continuous intervention. Despite the recurrence of earthquakes, responses are usually triggered afterwards, lacking mitigation strategies to diminish risks. Focusing on housing in heritage areas, emergency actions, long delays, poor repairs (if any), uncritical replication, and the impossibility to assess and respond to all affected buildings have characterised governmental reconstruction approaches in recent years in Chile (Devilat 2013)-yet not limited to that country.  After earthquakes, heritage is not often a priority and is usually left in stand-by mode until specific solutions are developed. This may take several years, as occurred with the historic centre of L&apos;Aquila after the 2009 earthquake; the heritage area of Amandola after the 2016 earthquake - both in Italy; or Zu&#xF1;iga after the 2010 earthquake in Chile. After the 1993 and 2001 earthquakes, some heritage villages in India were completely relocated (Jigyasu 2002). All of this led to a displaced population, a key issue to avoid after a disaster (Boano, Zetter and Morris 2010).  Damaged dwellings cannot be immediately reinforced to continue inhabitation; generating disruption. If buildings are repairable, the costs are high due to the difficulty to work with the existing remains. Large numbers of affected constructions make damage assessment difficult, impacting in slow and sometimes out-of-context responses.  This proposal will tackle these issues by developing a sustainable approach based on 3D laser scanning, named as re-construction (Devilat 2013). She makes the distinction between reconstruction, understood as current strategies of replication &apos;as before&apos; with re-construction, which she understands as to build again, as a step forward, respectful to the past but adaptable to ever-changing social, cultural and physical contexts.   3D laser scanning or LiDAR is a cutting-edge recording technology that captures the environment in one of the most accurate, fast and comprehensive ways currently possible, resulting in a digital, measurable coloured point-cloud with a precision of millimetres. Once the digital model of reality is obtained, it will offer the basis to achieve the research objectives. Re-using buildings is a sustainable mode of preservation. In seismic countries, constant maintenance could increase their resistance with smaller funding than of building anew. However, there is a knowledge gap in the tools available for rehabilitation in comparison with those available for new constructions (Pereira-Roders and Brand 2006), and more specifically, when trying to integrate the inhabitants and relevant stakeholders.  This proposal is novel at five levels. First, by using a context of constant change resulting from earthquakes. Second, by focusing on housing instead of monumental heritage, representative of inhabitants&apos; way of living as well as the character of heritage areas, and usually the most affected after earthquakes due to lack of maintenance. Third, by introducing technology to heritage conservation principles and the humanitarian sphere. Fourth, by extending 3D laser scanning as an effective surveying tool for a complete heritage area. Fifth, by establishing a user-led digital platform for conservation. The research will bring together the expertise on technology and re-construction of heritage areas through its PI Dr Devilat; state-of-the-art 3D laser scanning equipment from the CAUGH-NTU and knowledge on virtual heritage from Prof. Abdelmonem as Co-I; the specific knowledge of heritage in India of Dr Desai from CEPT CRDF; the Indian earthquake&apos;s expertise of Dr Jigyasu and platform for international dissemination and impact from his institution ICCROM; the local network and support for community participation of Hunnarshala as Project Partner in India; and the architectural knowledge of Dr Lanuza, Research Fellow.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In response to persistent challenges facing post-earthquake housing reconstruction of heritage areas, such as rapid damage assessment, buildings&apos; replacement and replica-leading to displaced population and heritage loss, the project will develop a novel approach using state-of-the-art LiDAR technologies. It is a fast, affordable and scalable method to break the unsustainable cycle of buildings&apos; replacement and subsequent heritage erasure. The aim is to build future resilience and local capacity of seismic-prone heritage areas of India by offering a digital platform to enable the design of mitigation and re-construction plans, damage and technical assessments, enhancing the re-use and repair of housing and virtually preserving its culture embedded as the record of &apos;living heritage&apos;. By bringing past insights from previous research experience of post-earthquake strategies for Chilean heritage areas, the aim is to exploit new uses of technology to enhance the number and quality of buildings conserved, mitigate future risks to buildings and human lives, and further impact public policies.  In the interest of conserving heritage areas as characteristic neighbourhoods for future generations, this research goes beyond the particular intervention of each building to develop a plan that considers the whole historic area as an ensemble formed by housing, public and private spaces and monuments, and the relationship between these places and its inhabitants.  The main aim is two-fold: to critically analyse established reconstruction approaches of heritage preservation and intervention considering that now, recording technologies are more accurate and accessible than ever before; and to develop strategies to repair, retrofit and re-use as much as possible of the existing constructions in a short time-frame to challenge the need to set up emergency and transitional housing. This would lead to more authentic, sustainable, user-led and resilient approaches in contexts of continuous change due to earthquakes. The innovation is not the technology itself but how it will be used as part of a research method to tackle-at the same time-the wider scale of the village and the smaller scale of the housing, pushing the technology to something that has never been done in such scale and time frame.  Moreover, the 3D laser scanning technique can record several layers, including social and cultural practices in the built environment, providing information of how spaces are used at the same time of recording the technical aspects of the constructions. This is of extreme relevance for the design of sustainable livelihoods since this technology can enable community participation in an effective manner, also relevant for further research into the modes of heritage inhabitation. Specific objectives:  1. To analyse and debate a critical stance on heritage intervention, speculating over its possibilities and pertinence in the current context of digitalisation of heritage. 2. To develop a sustainable methodology by using advanced multi-dimensional heritage recording technologies, by layering spatial information.  3. To provide holistic planning for community and local resilience, embedding methodical approach towards as a series of mitigation, re-building and repair strategies. 4. Developing participatory action research strategy for capacity building of local community in surveying and re-construction process using accessible user-interface and training programme. 5. To develop digital heritage preservation that integrates the life captured through occupation and material culture. 6. To create a visual historical archive and database based on the 3D laser scanning, including aspects of everyday life and cultural practices. 7. To disseminate the outcomes in an accessible manner: website, blog, guidance document for public and global access and academic publications, exploiting the representational aspect of the record to engage with a wider audience.</narrative>
