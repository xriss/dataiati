   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Background: Vitamin D deficiency in pregnancy is profound across distinct geographical areas of the Indian subcontinent, where levels of deficiency between 70-100% are reported and is detrimentally associated with multiple adverse outcomes including co-morbidities of pregnancy in the mother (e.g. preeclampsia, pre-term birth and gestational diabetes); increased infections in mother and baby; rickets, low birth weight and baby length and increased respiratory symptoms in the child at 3-5 years. Clinical trials of vitamin D in pregnancy in the USA provide evidence that (i) supplementation with ~10 fold higher levels of vitamin D than those currently within the recommended daily allowance in India are safe and achieve vitamin D sufficiency in the majority (&gt;80%) of pregnant women; and (ii) daily supplementation from early in pregnancy has the greatest effect in improving adverse clinical outcomes in both mother and her child. Earlier studies in India focused largely on bolus administration in late pregnancy. We propose that daily supplementation with higher levels of vitamin D in India will have a major impact on health outcomes for both the mother and her child. However concerns exist in India about these higher levels of supplementation and this proposal aims to address these concerns directly.   Hypothesis: Ensuring vitamin D sufficiency in pregnant women in India from early pregnancy till term improves maternal health outcomes in pregnancy and in her baby during the first year of life.   Aim 1. To perform a pilot feasibility study to determine whether the highest acceptable level of vitamin D supplementation (2000 IU/daily from 10-14 weeks of gestation), which is slightly less than half of that studied in USA trials, leads to vitamin D repletion in pregnant women at St. John&apos;s Medical College Hospital (SJHMC), Bangalore. We have obtained Institutional Ethics Committee and Government of India approvals for such a study.    Aim 2. Form a cross India network comprising scientists, clinicians, health care workers, policy makers to participate in a 3-day workshop. We will invite international experts in the field who have participated in global trials of high dose vitamin D supplementation in pregnancy. Our goal is to discuss the heterogeneity in global studies and concerns within India of vitamin D dose and supplementation regimens in pregnancy to potentially overcome the perceived roadblock to higher levels of supplementation in India. Our workshop is designed to provide a meta-analysis of vitamin D clinical studies in India in the context of global vitamin D trial outcomes and a projected high impact review with the potential to influence national strategy is planned. Our workshop program will include a training component on laboratory-based methods that underpin the science of how vitamin D supplementation benefits clinical parameters in both mother and baby and biological pathways likely to underpin this, to enhance knowledge transfer and capacity building.   Together these aims will empower testing of our hypothesis in a future application to the GCRF. Our goal will be to perform a large-scale clinical study to determine the potential of a safe and inexpensive public health intervention targeted to a vulnerable maternal and neonatal populations across India.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="Study Objectives  Research Question: Does the highest acceptable level of vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy in India achieve repletion in the majority of women?  Objective/Aim 1. To determine to what extent the highest acceptable level of vitamin D supplementation (2000 IU/daily from end of 1st trimester) leads to vitamin D repletion of pregnant women (n=&lt;200) by performing a pilot feasibility study at St. John&apos;s Medical College Hospital (SJMCH) in Bangalore, India.   Innovation: We will initiate supplementation earlier in pregnancy with a higher daily dose of vitamin D than previous Indian studies and above the current recommended daily allowance in India. This dose is within the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) guidelines and for which we have Institutional Ethics Committee and Govt. India (HMSC) approval. We propose daily supplementation in comparison to earlier bolus regimens performed in India, and in pilot studies will correlate repletion with new-born immunity in a subset of babies.   Objective/Aim 2. To build a cross-disciplinary consortium of healthcare professionals, scientists and policy makers / regulatory authorities across India, who together with international experts, will discuss the barriers of realizing the benefits of vitamin D supplementation in pregnancy in India.  We will host a workshop in month 4-5 of the award, most likely in New Delhi, India where we will overview the significant heterogeneity between vitamin D dose and supplementation regimens globally and the existing concerns within India of exceeding current guidelines. Our goal will be to capacity build, train and debate the optimal design of future vitamin D studies in India. Parameters that influence vitamin D repletion and biological pathways likely to underpin maternal and infant health outcomes will be covered. A definitive scholarly peer-reviewed output is envisaged, of wider benefit nationally and internationally.   Our long-term objective is that successful completion of the work we propose in this GCRF Seed award will lead to a large-scale, multicenter study of vitamin D supplementation in pregnancy across India to address a range of maternal and infant clinical and mechanistic outcomes. Correcting the profound levels of deficiency in pregnancy in LMIC such as India reflects an affordable and safe intervention with a potentially huge public health impact in improving maternal and infant outcomes."></capital-spend>
