   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Even when volcanoes are not erupting ash or lava, their persistent volcanic emissions (PVE) can be highly hazardous. PVE are extremely rich in acids (for example sulphur dioxide gas), fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and heavy metals, presenting a serious and persistent source of air pollution. UNRESP foundation phase will be based at Masaya volcano in Nicaragua, one of the biggest volcanic polluters in the world, which has been causing severe air pollution in populated areas for many centuries. UNRESP seeks to reduce the impact of Masaya&apos;s PVE on the local populations by introducing early warning and mitigation procedures for episodes when volcanic air pollution reaches hazardous levels.  Over 30 countries on the Official Development Assistance list (ODA) may be suffering from PVE, yet, this hazard remains loverlooked by the Disaster Risk Reduction community in developing countries of the Global South. Most of the existing knowledge and best practices on dealing with PVEC originates from locations in the Global North, such as Hawaii, Italy and Japan, leaving major gaps in their institutional applications to Global South contexts.   While Masaya will be used as a pilot location, the results will be applicable to other areas in Nicaragua impacted by PVE, and translatable to other countries. We are aiming to build early-warning procedures which are highly applicable and easily accessible to the populations at risk, and to improve the communication between scientists, decision makers and the local communities. We will apply a stakeholder-first approach, which enables and encourages the local communities to be involved in the building of the resilience strategies.  UNRESP combines the expertise of a large and highly interdisciplinary group of UK and Nicaraguan researchers across volcanology, environmental sciences, history, human geography, sociology and anthropology. We have two volcano observatories as project partners, including Nicaragua&apos;s INETER. UNRESP also involves project partners representing the remit of public health to which our findings will be highly relevant. The project&apos;s objectives will be met through collection of new data and a review of pre-existing information, as well as through discussions and active collaboration at Nicaragua-based workshops and outreach activities.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="The overarching aim of UNRESP is to reduce the impact of air pollution crises caused by persistent volcanic emissions (PVE) of Masaya volcano on the local populations. Lessons gained from this case study will be applicable to other areas in Nicaragua which are exposed to this hazard from other volcanoes. This is trail-blazing work within the Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) community because the PVE hazard is currently absent from risk management strategies in developing countries in spite of its prevalence and damaging impacts. By combining objectives O1-6 we will be able to develop procedures for forecasting, communicating and mitigating PVE air pollution crises at Masaya through channels that are the most appropriate for this particular setting. The recommended procedures will be rooted in pre-existing local practices and will therefore be applicable and easily accessible to the local communities.  O1 Identify the frequency, duration and peak concentrations of major airborne pollutants (sulphur dioxide and PM2.5 particulates) to better understand the severity of the air pollution hazard posed by PVE at Masaya. Assess the level of protection provided by buildings by comparing the air pollution indoors and outdoors.  O2 Account for pre-existing resilience to PVE by documenting how the interrelations between vulnerability, exposure and adaptive behaviour to PVE have been developed by the local communities going. This will ensure the visibility of experience-based knowledge and practices developed and used by the communities to cope with PVE, and will also document issues of social justice related to the epistemology of risk.   O3 Document how the institutional management of volcanic risk and hazards in Nicaragua is organised, including an assessment of the current capabilities for dealing with PVE crises. The aim is to identify the larger institutional blockages to communicate and to take action on PVE hazard between national and local level of risk management.   O4 Explore how the institutional management of volcanic risk and hazards is taking into account the experience-based, non-technical knowledge (as identified by results from O2) in their definition of monitoring and early warning practices.  O5 Assess the quality and completeness of historical sources from the 19th and 20th centuries for the purpose of reconstructing Masaya&apos;s PVE hazard history since this hazard leaves little geophysical record.
