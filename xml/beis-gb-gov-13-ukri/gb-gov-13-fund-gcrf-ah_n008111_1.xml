   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Value of Culture in Conflict - Investigating the Sustainable Livelihood Generation for Craftswomen in Azad Kashmir (Pakistan)</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Over July 2015, the Laajverd Summer School based in Upper Neelum valley, a workshop was conducted by the Principal Investigator along with the named research assistant that allowed participants from the local villages to understand basic concepts of design and apply skills in developing a handmade and design range that was understood to be relevant to a globalized craft market. The workshop provided skills and knowledge about design through conversations and visual communication, allowing participants to engage with the creative process and understand what it means to make things. Here designing with the craftsperson was seen as key to understanding action research as opposed to designing for the craftsperson. The workshop was successful and a growing need for training within craft was identified by participants from the villages in Neelum Valley. This conflict-ridden area, which is inside the Indian border, but now belongs to Pakistan sees intensive periods of fluctuating conflict.   The women of this region work within the crafts sector and produce an intermittent collection of goods that don&apos;t always provide them with sustainable livelihood. This project aims to provide these women with training within crafts, to enhance their ability to generate incomes. Working with a regional partner, with a track record of working within crafts, allows this project to build upon existing knowledge and skills. The project builds upon previous experience of training within crafts in the Srinagar Valley, in India for doctoral research conducted by the PI. Here craftswomen were trained in design and logistics of trade to enhance their income generation abilities. This project therefore has larger ambitions of conducting a cross border comparative case study of India and Pakistan, and the Kashmiri women who are rebuilding their lives through creative, culturally relevant, production of goods.  The Value of Culture in Conflict seeks to establish a framework that will advance the way in which we talk about the value of culturally valued creative activities within regions of intense conflict. This project specifically looks at the Neelum Valley region of Azad Kashmir (Pakistan). The first part of the framework will be an examination of the cultural experience of craft production in itself and its impact on individuals and its benefit to the society and local economy.   The second part of the framework will develop interconnected networks in the region with the partner organisation that has worked in promoting cultural production with craftswomen&apos;s groups and develop training for them that would filter out to their partner members who are the main beneficiaries of the project. This project relies on local knowledge, tacit understandings and the will to develop programs that enhance income generation capacities of the women who face the lived realities of the ongoing conflict.  The project will take as its starting point the different forms of cultural experience, such as, for instance, the aesthetic and cognitive dimensions of our cultural encounters. This might be seen as analysing the phenomenology of cultural experiences in order to understand better the benefits uniquely associated with cultural activity. This significant approach will be conducted alongside exploration of the many other economic and social benefits conventionally associated with cultural activity.   This work would be potentially of use to those organizations that work within development at the grass roots level. It would also be of use to women&apos;s self help groups, and NGOs who promote craft working for income purposes. This work would also be useful to political scientists who study the shifting understandings of conflict and post conflict. However, in the main, it is useful to crafts women, who seek to enhance their knowledge and skills in order to boost their income generation abilities.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The overriding objective of the project is to investigate the potential of sustainable livelihood generation through craft production for the women in the Neelum Valley in Azad Kashmir. This conflict zone has seen fluctuating levels of violence since 1947 and remains largely under developed. This project seeks to make cross-disciplinary links between creative production by a gender specific group and its potential socio-economic significance within a politically volatile region.   Development of this region is defined as the expansion of social opportunities to people through the creation of active public policy (Dr&#xE8;ze  and Sen, 1997) and as a process that enhances the freedom of those who are involved to pursue whatever objectives they value and choose (Sen, 1996). The central issue in economic development is the expansion of social opportunities to the people (Dr&#xE8;ze  and Sen, 1997), and the value of social opportunities is  defined as the ability to chose a life they want to lead. Here culture could be defined as &apos;ways of living together&apos; (De Cuellar, 1996) thus it could be understood that development should mean promotion of cultures which people value.  Kabir (2003) indicates that cultural industries that promote creativity offer effective yet underused resources for peace keeping and peace building, especially in regions characterised by a long history of shared culture and violence. This is applicable to Kashmir where promotion of crafts could in the long run lead to the development of peace. Sorensen (1998) mentions, &apos;Petty trade and small-scale business activities often play a central role in the revival of post-war economies. Among the reasons for their relative prominence is the fact that these activities are in principle open to everybody: large investments are not required, unlike in agriculture, they do not require access to land, which is a scarce resource, they can be carried out at any time and for any length of time, and, finally, the lapse of time between investment and income is considerably shorter than in agriculture&apos; (Sorensen, 1998, p. 30-31).   This project proposed that the promotion of craft could lead to economic development, which has been understood widely to contribute to peace. This has been evidenced in Sierra Leone by Ripon and Willow (2004) where culturally relevant activities, which were valued by the people of Sierra Leone, were seen to promote relationships between people and thereby promote dialogue and peace in the region. In Seirra Leone the militia promised jobs, money and women to the combatants who would join them (Humphreys and Weinstein, 2004). The easy availability of weapons and continuing influence of former combatants and militia often attracts unemployed youth towards criminality and violence and was evidenced in the case in Liberia and Sierra Leone (Ohiorhenuan and Kumar, 2005). Emerging studies from across the world indicate that chronic poverty in areas of conflict can make soldiering or violence an attractive means of income generation when other non violent means are unavailable (Justino, 2006).   This project is intended to provide a closer understanding of the crafts of Neelum Valley, and their potential to generate income, through a collaborative, cross disciplinary approach to research. The objectives of the research are: - To investigate the impact of the conflict on the crafts of Neelum Valley and understand their current status within society as an area of practice for income generation. - To investigate ways in which working within crafts impacts lives and livelihoods of women of the region. - To develop training needs assessment based on partner&apos;s previous work within craft  - To develop and deliver a training programme to a focus group drawn from members of the partner organization. - Through comparison of India and Pakistan: Kashmir case studies, examine how women&apos;s craft groups in different geographical locations cope with conflict.</narrative>
