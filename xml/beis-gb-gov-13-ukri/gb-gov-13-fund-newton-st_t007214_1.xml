   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Earth&apos;s turbulent atmosphere blurs the images of astronomical objects. Adaptive Optics (AO) can be used to counteract the detrimental effects of the Earth&apos;s atmosphere and restore sharp images. It is only by developing advanced optical instrumentation, such as AO systems, that we can enable the next generation of astronomical discoveries. Here, we propose a collaborative project between Durham University, UK, and the National Astronomical Research Institute of Thailand. This proposal not only aims to strengthen links between Thai and UK instrumentation communities, but also through the joint development of the AO and turbulence profiling instrumentation, build a domestic advanced astronomical instrumentation capability within Thailand.   AO system development provides experience within a huge range of fields, including optical metrology, machine vision, computer automation and high-speed computing. Such skills are in high demand within many sectors of Thai economy where much of the advanced technical knowledge and instrumentation is currently licensed or purchased from companies overseas.  The proposed research includes using advanced techniques developed at some of the world&apos;s premier observatories to fully characterise the atmospheric turbulence at Thai National Observatory (TNO) site. This part of the project will involve UK and Thai researchers working together on the development of new atmospheric characterisation instrumentation that will be deployed at the telescope site in northern Thailand. Large datasets will need to be captured and processed in an efficient manor by the collaboration, further training Thai researchers at NARIT in AO data acquisition, handling and analysis.  To assist with the training of researchers in the use and development of AO systems, we will also run a workshop in Thailand that focuses on the use of computer modelling of AO systems. AO system simulations are complex to understand, run and modify and we will provide hands-on training in how to set up and analyse the outputs from such simulations.  The training of staff and researchers within Thailand in the techniques and technologies used within AO is funded as part of the overseas development aid budget, with the goal of increasing skills in advanced optical technologies that can support new industrial applications  within the developing Thai economy.  This project also provides Thailand with an experienced AO system users and developers through the instrumentation programme run jointly with NARIT at the Thai National Observatory. Finally, this program allows UK and Thai researchers to undertake fundamental research into the properties of atmospheric turbulence and the development of novel instrumentation that can potentially be applied to other telescopes and fields outside astronomy.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="The prioritised list of objectives for this project are as follows: 1. Run a dedicated AO simulation workshop to train Thai researchers in development and application of AO simulations. Attendees will gain expertise in numerical optical modelling techniques. 2. Install a suite of dome turbulence characterisation instruments including an internal DIMM, a sonic anemometer and localised temperature probes at the TNT. Installation, data analysis and interpretation will be performed jointly by NARIT and Durham staff to facilitate the transfer of expertise. 3. Characterise the internal turbulence in the TNT dome. If possible, identify localised heat sources that are contributing to the internal turbulence and find ways to ameliorate them and thus improve telescope performance.  4. Continue to make turbulence profile observations at TNT using the existing SLODAR instrument that was developed jointly by Durham and NARIT. This will yield information about the turbulence statistics that will inform the design of future AO systems for TNT. 5. Perform a combined analysis of data from the dome instruments and SLODAR to distinguish between (external) ground layer turbulence and (internal) dome turbulence in the SLODAR turbulence profiles. 6. Develop new dome turbulence characterisation techniques that can be applied at observatories around the world. 7. Develop an online AO training resource through the release and hosting of the AO worksheets developed for the workshop."></capital-spend>
