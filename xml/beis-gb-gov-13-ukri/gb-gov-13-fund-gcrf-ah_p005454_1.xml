   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Return, Responsibility and Reintegration in Central Africa: A multi-disciplinary exploration into endemic violence and social repair</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">1. Produce high-quality evidence based research that informs national and international policies and practices to mitigate cycles of violence in sites of widespread displacement and return in the borderlands of Central Africa. The research will reframe understanding and policy making around the under-researched dynamics of &apos;return&apos; in conflict-affected places. Employing multi-sited ethnography, drawing upon history, anthropology, political science, heritage studies and innovative journalism, we will explore how refugees, internally displaced persons and former combatants negotiate and experience &apos;return&apos;. We will examine relationships of returnees with each other, with the &apos;stayee&apos; population and their engagement with state and local government elites; with aid agencies as well as with other forms of &apos;public authority&apos;, from clan elders and religious leaders to informal traders and vigilante groups. Where things have moved on peacefully, we will find out how mutuality becomes possible in circumstances of acute social stress and identify the processes and practices of social repair that allow for coexistence and improved well-being. Where this is not the case we will find out why violence persists and becomes endemic.  2. Focus on under-researched areas, including the long-term dynamics of ex-combatant return. Our &apos;returnee&apos; category is broad and we are particularly interested in the longer-term return dynamics of &apos;former combatants&apos; of Central Africa&apos;s numerous non-state rebel groups, many of whom occupy an ambiguous victim-perpetrator status. While much attention is paid to &apos;Disarmament, Demobilisation and Reintegration&apos; (DDR) in peacebuilding literature and policy, these processes tend to be sporadic, short-lived and reliant on donor funding. We know even less about those &apos;self-demobilised&apos;, including thousands of former Lord&apos;s Resistance Army fighters in northern Uganda and thousands of ex-combants in the Kivus in eastern DRC who have undergone no formal return or resettlement processes but have returned to civilian life, sometimes securely and at other times inauspiciously. Research into how and why some former combatants return peacefully while others become recruits of new violent groups will tell us more about the &apos;life-cycle&apos; of conflicts in this region.  3. Use local partnerships productively to provide fresh perspectives on how the &apos;local&apos; is produced and re-shaped by return dynamics. Drawing upon existing local knowledge and experience, the research will be co-designed, co-produced and co-disseminated. Through long-standing collaborations with confirmed local partners we will develop richer and more relevant analyses and prescriptions, opening up new perspectives on social repair and endemic violence in our research sites. Our place-based approach will privilege the &apos;local&apos; as a spatial category. We will develop our local partnerships to explore how processes of return produce the &apos;local&apos; by impacting on existing power structures and shaping and re-shaping public authority and collective consciousness. Increasing and enhancing local stakeholder participation is not just an output of the research project but a research strategy inasmuch as it generates trust with local populations and ensures the widest and most in-depth access to information.  4. Employ innovative methods that bridge the social sciences and arts and humanities. Using curatorial practice and comic journalism,we will develop a complementary &apos;story-telling&apos; element to our research and set new standards in research methodology and dissemination. These locally produced, innovative outputs are also central to our methods because they allow us to identify how audience reach can be improved and how innovative communications can influence policy making. We will also bridge social science and history through a comparative approach, identifying  patterns of endemic violence and repair that may be relevant to historical studies of past upheavals.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In 2015, the United Nations Refugee agency (UNCHR) reported that world-wide displacement hit an &apos;all time high&apos; as conflict related violence and persecution increase and threat environments become more diffuse and complex. Quite shockingly, it was calculated that today, one in every 122 people is either a refugee, displaced or seeking asylum.  Across huge swathes of the globe, people are uprooted as they try to negotiate profoundly difficult conflict circumstances, involving not only state armies, but non-state armed groups, criminal gangs, drug traffickers, and jihadists. To make matters more complex, individuals often occupy ambiguous victim-perpetrator statuses, moving between combatant and civilian roles, either through coercion or through choice.   Central Africa has witnessed prolonged and repetitive forms of displacement for many, many years. In 2015, the UNHCR described forced displacement figures related to this region as &apos;immense&apos;. To date, international organisations have prioritized &apos;going home&apos; as the most durable solution to this crisis. Processes of &apos;return and reintegration&apos; represent a huge practical and policy challenge for world governments and are therefore a critical international policy issue. This research project aims to study precisely these dynamics in the central and eastern African countries of Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of Congo, Uganda and South Sudan through an inter-disciplinary, multi-sited ethnography of &apos;return&apos;. By analyzing how refugees, internally displaced persons and former combatants negotiate and experience &apos;return&apos; we aim to fill a large gap in current knowledge on the &apos;lifecycle&apos; of conflicts in some of the world&apos;s most difficult places. Drawing on anthropology, comic journalism, history, heritage studies and political science we will focus on the everyday experiences of those attempting to build or re-build communities in central Africa, contributing to a better understanding of how conflict-affected societies constitute or re-constitute themselves.   Our research will explore the relationships of returnees with each other, with the &apos;stayee&apos; population and their engagement with national governments and international peacebuilding actors. We will examine if and how standardized peacebuilding approaches to return - such as Disarmament, Demobilisation and Reintegration (DDR); transitional justice (TJ); and psycho-social support (PSS) are relevant to people on the ground who negotiate conflict realities and their legacies on a daily basis. We will also investigate those ubiquitous processes that are persistently set aside by international actors, including customary spiritual practices of individual and collective healing and ideas associated with religious belief.  We will go beyond merely documenting the manner of return to focus specifically on how processes of return shape and reshape public authority across our research sites, questioning any assumed linear transition to &apos;civilian life&apos; and to &apos;peace&apos;. Our in-depth, inter-discipinary study of return across the Central African region will help us better understand the conditions under which conflict-affected societies are able to move on peacefully and/or live productively in situations of acute social stress and also the conditions under which mutuality is simply not possible and violence becomes endemic and seemingly inescapable.  We also hope to place current central African experience in wider comparative and historical contexts giving fellow scholars and policy makers a much clearer picture of how and when social repair becomes possible in situations characterized by such staggering levels of upheaval and suffering.</narrative>
