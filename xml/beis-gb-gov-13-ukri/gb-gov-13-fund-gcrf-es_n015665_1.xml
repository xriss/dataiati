   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Inherited blood disorders, globalisation and the promise of genomics: An Indian case-study</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Sickle cell and thalassaemia, forms of inherited blood disorders (IBD), classified by the WHO under &apos;prevention and management of inherited birth defects&apos;, have recently been defined as an emergent global health crisis.  The pattern of recessive inheritance implies that babies who inherit two copies of a mutant gene (from both parents) will have a serious blood disorder, needing long term treatment and care; while carriers who inherit only one copy will not have the disease.  A much higher incidence poses significant healthcare challenges in low and middle income countries, especially sub-Saharan Africa and India.  India is estimated to have the largest number of carriers of IBD in the world, around 42-45 million; where approximately 22,500- 37,000 babies with IBD are born each year.  A significant proportion are born in households with little or no  access to healthcare, especially in the rural, poor, marginalised ethnic and &apos;tribal&apos; communities. Despite cheap diagnostic tests and treatments, including curative stem cell transplants, available across public and private sectors, only 5-10 percent of children receive optimal care in India. There is little research examining the social and ethical reverberations of carrier screening, especially of pregnant women, and the use of prenatal diagnosis and termination of affected foetuses, as preventive interventions as a means of &apos;prevention&apos;.  Further,   it is imperative to examine how, given the widespread practice of sex selective abortions and poorly regulated markets, an appropriation of genetic technologies by state, public as well as private enterprise might further exacerbate existing structural inequalities related to ethnicity, caste, gender and disability.     This 40 month long, Indian case-study will provide a comprehensive analysis of the social and ethical reverberations of policies and practices surrounding the treatment and &apos;prevention&apos; of IBD, within the context of globalisation and the promise of genomics in reducing health inequities in the global South.  The main aim of our research is to relate these global debates to local forms of engagement and therapeutic citizenship reflected in the practices of NGOs helping people (potentially) affected by these disorders in the rural, poor and marginalised communities.  To contextualise our empirical work, we will first review literature from medical anthropology, sociology, global health policy and ethics to help refine the questions to be explored through a multi-sited ethnography.  Fieldwork across four sites will involve main actor interviews, shadowing NGOs, community focus group discussions and practitioner interviews, as well as in-depth interviews with patients, carriers and two main carers in 80 households, from rural/semi urban poor areas and 10 households from a higher socio-economic, urban background.  These households will be visited three times over 12-14 months.  Researchers will use a topic guide for interviews on how IBD are recognised and treated, and decisions related to risk and long term care, and maintain health diaries for each family with a record of illnesses, health expenses and decisions related to health.        The research will provide theoretical insights from medical anthropology/ sociology/ bioethics and the empirical findings to inform policy and practice on the far reaching social and ethical ramifications of the use of genomic technologies as a means of &apos;prevention&apos; of recessive gene disorders in particular, and the intersections between genetics, ethnicity/ &apos;race&apos;, gender, kinship, disability and citizenship at a broader level across South Asia.  Further, the project will provide methodological insights into a model of community engagement, where the local users and community organisations are intrinsic to the conception and execution of the research as well as the recommendations based on the research, to ensure that they have a stake and benefit from the dissemination plan.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This 40 month long, Indian case-study will provide a comprehensive analysis of the governance of sickle cell and thalassaemia, inherited blood disorders (IBD), within the context of globalisation and the promise of genomics in reducing health inequities in the global South.  The main aim of our research is to analyse the discursive practices surrounding treatment and &apos;prevention&apos; of IBD as an emergent global health crisis; and the social and ethical ramifications of policies aimed at preventing &apos;inherited birth defects&apos; for ethnically marginalised, poor and rural communities in India. Our empirical research will be contextualised within literature from medical anthropology/ sociology/ bioethics and health policy.  It will thus have broader theoretical relevance to debates on genetics, ethnicity, gender, disability and reproductive agency, and the potential of geneticisation of medicine in reinforcing existing cultural and structural inequalities at a global level.  A central focus of our research is to show how ethnographic research can be used to create a dialogue with the more pragmatic, neo-liberal policy concerns about &apos;prevention&apos; of inherited diseases with a view to reducing childhood mortality and suffering in resource poor settings.  The specific objectives of the research are:  1. To analyse the perspectives of main social actors in the field of management and prevention of sickle cell and thalassaemia disorders (IBD) at national, international and local levels 2. To engage with the specific questions and solutions related to IBD posed by these actors and the &apos;crisis rhetoric&apos; related to genetic risk, vulnerability and prevention; and the language of rights, welfare and citizenship within which these questions are framed 3.  To explore how IBD are recognised and (un)diagnosed within a local therapeutic milieu, and the kinds of decisions families have to make about treatment and long term care within the context of everyday life in the face of poverty  4. To understand how potential carriers, patients and carers affected by IBD engage with the notion of genetic risk; and how their strategies for &apos;prevention&apos; relate to wider notions of resilience, (gendered) impairment, disability and &apos;anomalous births&apos;    5. To disseminate the findings widely to academic audiences, local communities and healthcare practitioners; and provide a summary of findings with recommendation for national and international policy and practice audience based on the feedback from the local communities.      Following a literature review, a multi-sited ethnography across four areas (Delhi, Gujarat, Maharashtra and Rajasthan) will include main actor interviews, shadowing NGOSs, community focus groups and practitioner interviews, to seek a macro perspective at international, national and local levels.  We will conduct in-depth interviews with a sample of patients, carriers and two main carers in 80 households, in rural, poor, ethnically marginal communities (Rajasthan and Maharashtra), and 10 households from a higher socio-economic background in Delhi.  A diverse sample achieved through our NGO networks and snowballing will enable us to locate the disease within its therapeutic milieu, and how it is (un)diagnosed and treated, within the context of limited resources and wider notions of gender, disability and kinship.    Community engagement is an important feature of our research, and a wider objective is to highlight a successful model of state-NGO- practitioner alliances that can be adopted in other areas of health and healthcare settings.  Sickle Cell Society India and PRAYAS, NGO collaborators, have been consulted about the research questions and will be closely involved in sampling, fieldwork and dissemination activities.   Other community stakeholders will be involved in providing feedback on our findings to ensure that local priorities are reflected in the summary of findings and recommendations to be written for policy and practice.</narrative>
