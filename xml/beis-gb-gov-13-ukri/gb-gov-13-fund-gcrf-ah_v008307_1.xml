   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Future Festivals South Africa: Possibilities for the Age of Covid-19 is an international collaborative project developed by King&apos;s College London (UK) and Rhodes University (South Africa). It aims to investigate the impact of Covid-19 on arts festivals in South Africa (SA), building a new knowledge base - and a collaborative network - to enable them to survive these challenging times, and to thrive in the future. In doing so, the project is partnering with some of the country&apos;s most important festivals and will be seeking to develop a broad and inclusive network of stakeholders. The project brings together an interdisciplinary team of researchers including cultural economists, cultural policy researchers and creative labour specialists. Data collection has been carefully designed to integrate mixed-methods and to involve a wide range of research participants including festival organisers, creative producers, and festival audiences. Qualitative interviews and focus groups will be conducted with festival organisers and creative producers. Quantitative data will be collected with festivals&apos; audiences, via online surveys, exploring their patterns of cultural consumption and participation (before and since the outbreak of Covid-19). Finally, a community engagement project will be undertaken -  Letters, Videos and Pictures from the Future - to gather creative contributions from stakeholders on their vision of what South African festivals should be like in the years ahead. The project aims to provide an initial understanding of the how Covid-19 has affected arts festivals in South Africa, but also to enable new ideas for future: including new business models, and new approaches to audiences and participation.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="Future Festivals South Africa: Possibilities for the Age of Covid-19 aims to investigate the impact of Covid-19 on festivals in South Africa (SA). Working in partnership with some of the country&apos;s most important arts festivals we will build a new knowledge base, and a new network, to enable South African festivals to survive these challenging times and to thrive in the future. The project&apos;s main objectives are:   1) To understand the impact that Covid-19 is having on the working practices and activities of South African arts festivals: including any initial responses that are being developed, such as new ways of delivering cultural content (online or with social distancing), and business models that make it possible for festivals to continue.  2) To develop a new network - supported by an online knowledge exchange platform - to allow festival organisers and creative producers to navigate together the uncertainties posed by Covid-19, and to be informed by up to date knowledge.   3) To understand the ways in which Covid-19 is changing festival audiences&apos; patterns of cultural consumption and participation in SA: including whether they have participated in online festivals, and whether this has changed their perspective on the economic, social and cultural value of live and online events.  4) To support a wide range of stakeholders (festival organisers, producers and audiences) to creatively develop visions of &apos;future festivals&apos;: new possibilities for South African festivals in the age of Covid-19"></capital-spend>
