   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Counting every child in: promoting inclusive and quality education for disabled children in China</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Education is central to any country&apos;s economic development and welfare. The principle global challenge of our times is how to ensure every child&apos;s equal access to inclusive, equitable and quality educational provision regardless of children&apos;s differences. In particular, disabled children have long been the most vulnerable group to marginalisation and exclusion in education with far less satisfying learning outcomes. My PhD research explored the current status of disabled children&apos;s inclusion in regular schools in China, by listening to what children had to say about their everyday school lives. The research findings show great relevance for developing inclusive practice in Chinese schools. They need to be disseminated to a wide range of stakeholders, in order to overcome inequality and inequity in education in a context where educational gaps become increasingly significant across groups and regions, and where sustainability in development is an urgent issue concerning global interest.  This fellowship will disseminate my PhD research findings and establish an international and collaborative network for inclusive education across disciplines. The findings from my thesis will be translated into 4 key messages: Hearing and acting on disabled children&apos;s voices is a sustainable strategy for developing inclusive education; Inclusive education means promoting children&apos;s learning, participation, and well-being; Teachers must be supported to develop inclusive pedagogy in classroom teaching; Efforts are required from all stakeholders to transform current thinking, policy and practice of inclusive education in China.  These 4 key messages will be delivered to relevant stakeholders including academics, policy-makers, disability organisations, international agencies, headteachers, classroom teachers, school pupils and wider public audiences through a range of tailored materials and training workshops. Besides the dissemination, it is also important to bring together international expertise in this research field through strong partnerships. Thus I will accept the placement at the Centre for Inclusive Education of Beijing Normal University as a visiting scholar, to build up solid collaboration with leading Chinese scholars in this area. The visit will also involve field trips to local schools to learn more about the needs of children and teachers. I will coordinate the establishment of a world-leading academic network involving key members from Beijing Normal University, University of Edinburgh and Trinity College Dublin. The connection among network members will be strengthened through both online and face-to-face seminars. The network will facilitate the development of future educational development projects. Meanwhile, a network website will be set up to provide accessible public resources. In addition, I will receive further training to improve my academic and transferable skills. Progress and experiences will be shared with relevant audiences in Scotland and the UK. A pilot study will be conducted in one Chinese school to test the model for developing inclusive practice proposed in my PhD research. The fellowship will be undertaken through working with an advisory board formed by experienced researchers from multiple disciplines.  In all, this fellowship will create significant and important impacts on a comprehensive transformation towards inclusive and quality education in China at all levels, from government policy frameworks, structural reform and resource redistribution to educational management, everyday classroom teaching practice and school culture. By working knowledgeably, sensitively and ethically in the context of China, the fellowship will improve educational practices in China based on excellent scholarship, to contribute to the welfare of children and families, and the country&apos;s sustainable development.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Inclusive, equitable and quality education is the foundation for economic development, welfare and sustainability (OECD 2012; UN 2015). My PhD research examined disabled children&apos;s learning and participation in Chinese mainstream schools. It is the first study to foreground Chinese disabled children&apos;s accounts of school experiences. The findings are highly relevant for developing inclusive education in China, in alignment with international standards of inclusive education and the UN&apos;s Sustainable Development Goal 4 - &apos;Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all&apos; (UN 2015). Inclusive education aims to address the dynamics of inequalities in education. This fellowship will facilitate a comprehensive transformation of understandings, policies and practices of inclusive education in China, therefore enhancing China&apos;s capacity for further engagement with Education 2030 (UNESCO 2015a) to ensure every child&apos;s access to inclusive and quality education.  Objective 1: Disseminate key PhD findings. The findings necessitate the dissemination of important messages to stakeholders in China, in recognition of pupil voice as a sustainable strategy for developing inclusive education. A wide range of audiences will be engaged. First, child-friendly materials will be produced to engage pupils in making schools inclusive and safe. NGOs, grassroots organisations and families will receive a summary report. Journalistic articles will be published to raise public awareness. Second, practitioners from regular schools will be directly involved, including those working with low/middle-income children. Headteachers will be provided with a handbook to inform institutional strategies. To support classroom teachers&apos; development of inclusive pedagogy, a handbook with guidelines and examples will be produced, accompanied by 2 workshops (twice). Third, to advocate for a reconceptualisation of inclusive education, PhD findings will be circulated to key policy-makers from education and health sectors, disability organisations and international agencies. The impact will be guaranteed through 1 workshop (twice). For academics, 4 papers will be developed for international peer-reviewed journals (with translated version for Chinese audiences). Presenting at 2 relevant international academic conferences will also increase impact.  Objective 2: Establish international partnerships. There is a great need for scholarship development in China to better inform inclusive education policy and practice. First, I will accept a 2-month visiting scholar placement at the Centre for Inclusive Education (CIE) at Beijing Normal University, to form solid partnerships with leading Chinese scholars in the area. I will also undertake school visits to deepen my knowledge of local needs. Second, to link Chinese partners with excellent international scholarship, I will initiate a collaborative interdisciplinary network among CIE, the world-leading expertise on inclusive education at the University of Edinburgh and the innovative work on pupil voice at Trinity College Dublin. Besides 2 webinars, a 2-day seminar with network meetings will be hosted in Edinburgh (Sept 2017) to strengthen quality collaboration and develop proposals for future GCRF application. Furthermore, a network website incorporated with social media strategy will be developed to provide accessible resources for public audiences.  Additional. A follow-up study to pilot the working model for inclusive practice theorised in the PhD research, undertaken in one case school in China; Receiving further training on collaborative/action research methodology, ethics in international projects, and public engagement; Sharing the lessons learned from the fellowship at GCRF specific events, and briefing key players in Scotland-China networks; Organising 3 advisory board meetings with highly experienced colleagues from multiple disciplines to gain alternative perspectives.</narrative>
