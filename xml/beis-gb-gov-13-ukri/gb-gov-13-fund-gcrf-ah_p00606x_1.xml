   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Development Assistance and independent journalism in Africa and Latin America: A cross-national and multidisciplinary research network. (HN)</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The main objective of the proposed network is to foster discussion and research concerning the use of foreign aid and, more broadly, structures of post-colonial dependency (Easterly 2006), to promote or inhibit specific models of journalism and to assess to what degree this has been achieved.  The network addresses the following key research question:  What has been the role of international development assistance in shaping journalistic approaches and practices in Africa and Latin America and what are the consequences?   Subsidiary research questions include: - What is the existing body of research concerning this issue? - What has been the role of development assistance in shaping journalism education in Africa and Latin America? - To what extent has international development assistance fostered or inhibited independent journalism in Africa and Latin America? - What are the similarities and differences in the direct and indirect impacts of development assistance of journalism from the US, UK and other donors? - What are the continuities and discontinuities concerning the impact of development assistance on journalism practice and education in the post-Cold War era? - How has international development assistance either directly or indirectly affecting journalism been perceived by journalists, politicians and the general public in the beneficiary countries? - What interventions could be developed to counter any negative consequences of these traditions?  Subsidiary objectives to answer these questions include completion of the following project stages:  1. The network will create a multidisciplinary research space that will bring together researchers who have been working in this area but whose work has not previously been linked. This space will be physical, in the form of three core meetings; and virtual, in the form of an online forum.  2. The network will promote this research among scholars who have the potential and capabilities to engage in this area. Over the two year project time frame the network will expand to embrace additional countries and regions beyond the UK and the four developing countries involved from the outset.   3. We will develop a virtual platform in which the members of the network can meet, collaborate and develop individual and group projects concerning the issues presented here. This website will be a one-stop virtual space where researchers can collaborate with each other and find online resources for their research.    4. The network will produce teaching materials so some of the outcomes of this research can be articulated within syllabi and programmes within journalism and media education in both aid receiving nations and in donor nations.  We foresee this effort will include a MOOC (massive open online course) if subsequent funding permits.  There is ample internal support and expertise at Leeds University to facilitate this.    5. The network will seek to produce specific outputs in terms of journal articles and other publication.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project proposes an international and inter-disciplinary research network to explore the relationship between international development aid and local journalistic practice and training in Africa and Latin America.  The network will allow researchers to examine the global power relations and geo-politics of foreign aid that since the end of the Second World War was substantially directed at disseminating a specific model of journalism practice and education aligned with the interests of donor nations.  It will consider the extent to which the diffusion of a US/UK based model of journalism practice has been central to the &apos;modernisation&apos; project in international development.  This network project is linked to journalism practice, journalism education, and critical journalism studies in the context of the impact that foreign aid/development assistance has had in these regions and how this has affected the ability of these developing regions to foster a critical and independent media sector. Given massive contemporary change in the global news media landscape, especially in regard to journalistic practice and the limited potential for  genuinely independent &apos;watchdog&apos; journalism, researchers and practitioners need to critically re-assess the relationship between external influences on journalism and local cultures and practices of journalism. This contribution to a deliberative assessment of the nature of public discourse in developing regions has the potential to open the public sphere to a greater variety of voices and aid the project of democratization.   In this context, the critical scholarly approaches more commonly associated with arts and humanities research than with the more typically social scientific approaches to the analysis of journalism are particularly valuable.  We propose to bring together a network of researchers who can provide critique grounded in critical political economy and postcolonial studies approaches to the historical and present contribution to the local journalism sector of international development aid in Latin America and Africa.  The network will foster discussion and research concerning the use of international development aid and, broadly, structures of post-colonial dependency (Easterly 2006), to promote or inhibit specific models of journalism.  We start from the assumption that the dissemination of the US/UK paradigm of journalism was central to international aid efforts since the late 1940s and has become the default model that aid programmes tend to foster and support. Such models have been problematized by the geo-politics of the Cold War and more recently by corporative agendas. Moreover, these models have not come into existence without their own contradictions, given the support that the US and other Western countries gave to dictatorships in developing countries in the context of Cold War efforts to contain the advance of the Soviet Union (this is particularly true of Latin America and Africa, the continental foci of this network). A further interest, therefore, is the question of how the end of the US-USSR confrontation re-shaped (or not) foreign aid towards journalism modernisation, diversification, and independence.  Our network will initially link UK academic researchers with prominent journalism researchers and educators in two African countries and two South America countries, each of which receive UK Official Development Assistance.  Each of these countries has diverse and vibrant media and civil society sectors with which our academic participants are well connected. These countries are Ghana, South Africa, Brazil, and Venezuela, but our participants are also leading experts on journalism in the broader regions around their countries and well placed to extend the network in their regions.</narrative>
