   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Flooding is a threat to communities in both Malaysia and the UK. Computer modelling is a widely used approach to working out which areas are vulnerable to flooding. This allows government agencies, NGOs and communities to work out how to invest time and resources to protect areas at risk. Understanding of the causes of flooding has increased rapidly in recent years. We now have good data on environmental factors like rain and temperature which can influence where floods will happen. There are now good models of climate change. If we work out where flooding is going to happen, computer models can now be used to work out how flood waters will move around cities and which buildings will flood. One problem that still remains is to include the complexities of real life in these models. We currently assume that the same flood will always lead to the same consequences. This makes models quicker to run, but we know it&apos;s not how flooding works. If floods occur just before harvests they can destroy entire crops, but if they occur when fields are empty the costs can be very low. If one flood follows another in quick succession, facilities like hospitals and power stations could remain damaged from the first flood, meaning that the second one has much greater impact on people&apos;s lives. With research into how communities are affected by flooding, which takes into account the timing of floods as well as how closely associated they are in time, a genuinely new approach to flood risk could be developed.   Malaysia is a very good place to develop these models. Its economy is developing quickly, so new approaches have the opportunity to be tested in a changing environment. Similarly, climate in Malaysia includes monsoons, which are a good test of model ability for environmental modellers. From a development perspective, Malaysia is a success story which is rapidly transitioning towards developed status, but still has large numbers of people at risk and in large areas, development can be set back by severe floods. Lastly, following severe floods in 2014, there is a renewed interest in developing innovative flood risk approaches in Malaysia.  Our approach to developing a new flood model in Malaysia would make use of the different experts in our group. Bringing together experts from the UK and Malaysia, both of which have invested significantly in flood research in the last decade, would allow us to combine skills from experts with different specialities. Our economists will use economic modelling to understand how different sectors of the economy might change in future and how they might be exposed to flooding. Our group&apos;s environmental scientists will use existing computer models of rivers to show where river levels are likely to become high enough to generate flooding. Our flooding engineers will apply new hydraulics models to show how flood waters move once they have left the rivers.  Experts in combining computer model outputs will combine each of these into a new model of flood risks. This new model will be used to find the effects of scenarios (factors we can&apos;t control such as climate change and increasing urbanisation) and strategies (factors we can control such as new flood defences and warning systems) which will help to evaluate some of these strategies for their effectiveness and value for money. This will allow future flood planning to be better targeted within Malaysia. We hope that Malaysia will act as a good case study for this research and that it would be taken up by other countries in South East Asia and around the world.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="This project will deliver a step-change in flood impact assessment by developing new, more representative models of vulnerability and exposure to flooding across the Malaysian Peninsula (MP). Combined with state of the art models of inundation and large scale hydrology, a novel and highly practical representation of current and future flood risk will be established. This will allow new flood management strategies to be accurately evaluated, ultimately targeting resources more effectively and saving lives and livelihoods. Our objectives are to:     1) Capture specific details around the seasonality, sequencing and timing of floods, and how this changes a. Who and what is at risk from such flood events, and b. How likely they are to be affected by such flood events. 2) Develop novel methods for translating local scale understanding of exposure, vulnerability and inundation to flooding into large scale (10km2 grid square) maps of exposure, vulnerability and inundation across the MP by:          a. Exploring approaches to upscaling these data (statistical, process-based) b. Using comparisons between large scale model outputs and case study sites to evaluate model performance c. Applying future scenarios of socio-economic change to determine how altered future population, urbanisation, land use, crop choices and economic balance (industrial/commercial/tourism) could alter distribution of these factors 3) Investigate the key hydrological processes which influence high flows and flooding across the MP, including a. Understanding physical processes which drive current river regimes: precipitation patterns, vegetation and land cover, soils, crops/agriculture, and anthropogenic processes including reservoirs, abstractions and transfers;          b. Including climate change in hydrological time series including future monsoonal precipitation; c. Mapping future flows, allowing dynamic, distributed maps of future hydrology to be generated 4) Explore current and future flood risk through developing a framework for integrating complex sector models of exposure and vulnerability with maps of future hydrology by          a. Determining local effects of peak flows by conducting high resolution inundation modelling in test sites          b. Applying new hydrodynamic models to extend high resolution site models to a large-scale model of inundation c. Looking at current and future flood risk across the MP, including the identification of future high risk locations emerging from multiple scenarios of climate change and socio-economic modelling 5) Demonstrate how the new science and integrative systems-level modelling can be encapsulated into flood risk adaptation planning in the MP through:         a. Developing representations of flood management options including physical flood defences and early warning systems b. Investigating costs and benefits associated with investments and broader strategies for investment using adaptive management approaches to avoid lock-in c. Providing adaptation reports on flood management options for local and national authorities."></capital-spend>
