   <narrative xml:lang="EN">AIM: To improve identification of Familial Hypercholesterolaemia (FH) in Malaysian Primary Care   OBJECTIVES: 1. To compare detection rate of confirmed FH in Malaysian primary care population between FAMCAT and established clinical diagnostic criteria (Simon-Broome and Dutch Lipid Clinic Criteria)  [Work Stream 1] 2. To identify genetic mutation profiles, including new variant mutations, in individuals with suspected FH in the Malaysian primary care population [Work Stream 2] 3. To explore the experience, concerns and expectations of individuals with suspected FH who are referred for genetic testing [Work Stream 3] 4. Objective 4: To evaluate clinical utility of a new FH case identification tool in Malaysian primary care [Work Stream 3]   To answer OBJECTIVE 1, we will use observational study design to prospectively identify individuals with suspected FH, defined as high probability threshold for FH on FAMCAT (algorithm relative risk score &gt; 1), or Simon-Broome (SB) possible/ definite criteria, or Dutch Lipid Clinic Criteria (DLCC) score over 5 (probable/ definite) in the Malaysian Primary Care population. With these patients assessed for FH based on clinical phenotype and/or genetic testing. This will lead to the most appropriate diagnostic criteria being incorporated into a web-based FH case identification tool.  To answer OBJECTIVE 2, we will use targeted genetic testing using Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) to identify mutations including new variants in 7 FH candidate genes: LDLR, APOB100 and PCSK9, LDLR-AP1, ABCG5, ABCG8, APOE. Definitive molecular diagnosis and genetic mutation profiling of individuals with FH in the Malaysian Primary Care population will be established. New variant mutations in the seven FH candidate genes will be identified to support development of a genetic mutation testing for FH that is relevant to the Malaysian population.  To answer OBJECTIVE 3, we will use qualitative semi-structured interview methodology to explore the perception, attitude and experience of patients with suspected FH who are referred for genetic testing. Through detailed interview transcript analysis of the patients&apos; journey from recruitment to specialist review, we will inform clinical pathway for FH identification.  To answer OBJECTIVE 4, we will perform qualitative real-time observation of primary care practitioners (doctors and nurses) using the web-based FH case identification tool on simulated patients (&quot;Think aloud&quot; methodology) to identify the acceptability, appropriateness, and usability of FH identification tool by these practitioners. This will lead to production of clinic and practitioner training resources to support future FH case identification in primary care.   Collectively, this research will inform a pathway for FH identification, from primary to specialist care that is acceptable to primary care healthcare practitioners (doctors and nurses), the public, government agencies and other policymakers.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the leading cause of illness and death in most countries, including Malaysia, with up to 15% of young Malaysians affected. Identifying the causes for and reducing the incidence of premature CAD is a key national priority in Malaysia.   Familial Hypercholesterolemia (FH) has been identified as an important cause of premature CAD. This is one of the most common inherited conditions and has a high chance of being passed from one generation to another. Individuals with FH have high levels of Low Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (LDL-C) from birth, known as &quot;bad cholesterol&quot;. Left untreated, they are 22 times more likely to have premature CAD than individuals without FH. Early detection and treatment of FH through &quot;statin&quot; cholesterol-lowering drugs can effectively prevent heart attacks. Globally, between 1 in 200 and 1 in 500 people have the more common form of FH (heterozygous FH). Recent reports state as many as 1 in 100 Malaysians maybe affected. However, most of these individuals remain undiagnosed, resulting in lost opportunities to prevent premature CAD.   Improving identification of FH, particularly in primary care, enables early treatment of these individuals. As a result of reducing the risk of premature CAD, this will save lives, improve life expectancy and reduce long-term health expenditure. International guidelines recommend FH case finding using established diagnostic criteria developed from specialist care, specifically Simon-Broome (SB) and Dutch Lipid Clinic Criteria (DLCC). The UK team has demonstrated that using the SB criteria in English primary care setting has a low FH detection (6% of patients fulfilling criteria). To improve FH identification in primary care, the UK team has developed and validated the Familial Hypercholesterolemia Case Ascertainment Tool (FAMCAT). On assessment of over 3.7 million British patients with cholesterol measurements in primary care, FAMCAT was between 15 and 20% better at identifying FH than DLCC or SB criteria.  To evaluate how this will perform in Malaysian primary care, we have developed a web-based tool to collect key information to identify individuals with suspected FH using FAMCAT, DLCC or SB criteria. To compare these criteria, when patients attend clinic, they will be invited to provide this information. Using these criteria, patients with suspected FH will be offered genetic testing and examined for features of the condition. Based on the findings of the UK FAMCAT studies, we predict this criteria will perform better by detecting a greater proportion of patients with FH. Having confirmed the best approach to identify suspected FH, the web tool will be refined to be used in primary care clinics. To improve the uptake of this new FH case identification tool, doctors and nurses will be interviewed as they use the tool with dummy patient information.  By introducing genetic testing, we will, firstly, be able to show the type of FH causing genetic mutation found in the Malaysian primary care population. Secondly, we can explore the perception, attitude and experience of individuals who are offered genetic testing and seen in specialist care.   Hence, this project will indicate an acceptable and effective approach to identify FH in Malaysian primary care  and a clearer picture of FH-causing genetic mutations that are found in the Malaysian population leading to better tailored genetic tests. Also, through interviews with patients with suspected FH, primary care doctors and nurses will be able to provide advice to the Ministry of Health and policymakers on how to introduce FH identification in primary care and clinical pathway once tested. This includes advising on guidelines, the training need of health professionals and public health campaigns. Further, this will benefit Malaysian society through reduction in premature CAD, especially in those from the low and middle income groups, and globally enhance the profile of Malaysian</narrative>
