   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project responds directly to Strand 4: Cultural Heritages, Interpretation, and Representation and the Translating Cultures and Care for the Future themes in its examination of the ways in which response to and recovery from future volcanic events on the Eastern Caribbean islands of St Vincent and Montserrat is shaped by the cultural memory and narratives developed through past experiences. The project is interdisciplinary in its conception and design, bringing literary studies together with volcanology, international development, and project partners responsible for future emergency response on the islands, to allow for a thorough investigation of the ways in which resident populations have responded historically to severe natural threat, how crises have been dealt with, and recovery undertaken. In this way the project explores the extent to which knowledge of disaster translates between cultural and scientific experiences of volcanic risk and the extent to which cultural experience of past risk shapes future response by offering a comparative analysis of the literary record, oral traditions and histories, songs, and other artistic expressions, and working with local populations to gain an understanding of the place of the volcano in the cultural imaginary. The PI, Co-Is, and Project Researcher will work closely with the Project Partners, combining our different sets of knowledge and expertise, research methodologies and practices in order to examine the ways that literary studies can be conducive to new models of scientific, social, and political development. The project will combine literary scholarship to explore the place of the volcano in Caribbean literature and oral culture, archival research to search out evidence of experiences of past eruptions that are hidden from the official colonial records, focus-groups and interviews with local communities on both St Vincent and Montserrat as well as the islands&apos; diasporas in the UK, and a three day workshop in the Eastern Caribbean bringing together the Project Investigators and Researcher, the Project Partners, and other invited stakeholders from literary scholars, writers and performers, artistic figures, archivists and publishing houses, and civil and community groups where we will discuss our findings and explore the ways in which they can be put to the most use for the communities affected by volcanic risk.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="The proposal here is to develop an interdisciplinary project that brings literary studies together with volcanology, international development, and the institutions responsible for future emergency response to volcanic eruptions on the Eastern Caribbean islands of St Vincent and Montserrat in order to examine whether insights from literary, artistic and wider cultural expression (oral storytelling, poetry, song) can provide any new and useful ways to think about and implement programmes of resilience in the face of the natural hazard that volcanoes pose to communities.     The proposed project builds upon the previous work of the ESRC-NERC STREVA Project (Strengthening Resilience in Volcanic Areas) which investigated the impacts of volcanic activity on the communities affected and sought ways to lessen the impact on and protect the assets of those communities at risk. The project was led by this proposal&apos;s co-I, Jenni Barclay, and involved our other co-I, David Pyle, and Project Researcher, Teresa Armijos. The STREVA Project identified a gap in scientific and development knowledge about community understandings of volcanic activity and the place of the volcano and eruption in the cultural landscape of the Eastern Caribbean. Thus, this project will address this empirical gap by exploring the ways in which the volcano features and figures in the social and cultural spaces of St Vincent and Montserrat through a comparative analysis of the islands&apos; literatures, oral traditions, folklores, songs, and other artistic expressions with their often coded histories of power play, revolt, resistance, and resolve. Our aim is to understand the role that narratives of past volcanic events play in cultural life, community memory, and the shaping of island identities, and the ways in which this knowledge might usefully be employed to help with social response and readiness for future catastrophic events.     In order to understand the ways in which the volcano features in the contemporary cultural spheres on St Vincent and Montserrat the project will trace the &apos;hidden&apos; histories or &apos;hidden transcripts&apos; buried within the literary and artistic culture as well as within social and historical archives. Our aim here is to expand the historical record of the 1902 eruption on St Vincent and to bring to light the historical stories of those who experienced the eruption but whose stories are not represented in the official colonial records. For this purpose, we will continue the archival work of the STREVA Project (see Case for Support) and expand this work by conducting archival research within existing records in the Eastern Caribbean (for example, church records, medical records, newspapers). This way we will be able to trace how stories of death, survival, resolve, and resilience have been preserved and communicated culturally over time.  This work will be supplemented by interviews with communities on the islands and with diasporic communities in the UK (see Case for Support). These interviews will provide us with insights into narratives that populations have developed in response to dealing with and recovering from natural threat, any transformations of stories as they travel, as well as assist us in understanding what is important to these communities in the face of natural disaster.     Bringing together the literary expertise of the PI with the scientific expertise of the two co-Is and the development expertise of the Project Researcher will allow us to broaden our intellectual scope and share our different skill sets, research methodologies and practices, enabling us to employ a rich suite of research methods as we address our aims. The deeply interdisciplinary nature of this project and the public engagement at its heart means that we will develop an innovative framework for further work, complemented by the inclusion of our project partners in its development and management, and with community usefulness being central to all outputs."></capital-spend>
