  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The aim of the fellowship is to develop my research career on the topic of urbanization and child health and development. I will do this through disseminating my PhD findings to academic and non-academic users, building these networks of users of my research, obtaining further specialised training on communication and advanced research skills, and conducting a review of research on this topic. There are five main objectives I intend to achieve over the period of this fellowship. 1. The first is to disseminate findings from my PhD to both academic and non-academic audiences through public engagement activities and relevant workshops/seminars. Key findings from my PhD thesis have already been published in international peer-reviewed journals (with five published and one currently under review), which will substantially facilitate the dissemination in China. 2. The second is to build networks and partnerships with academic institutions and non-academic users (i.e., All China Women&apos;s Federation, China Charities Aid Foundation for Children) across sectors in China to develop proposals for future grant calls, such as the ESRC Global Challenge Research Fund and Chinese National Science Foundation grants. These will centre on conducting fieldwork and identifying appropriate surveys to explore the influence of urbanization on child health and development, children&apos;s experiences of urbanization and governmental responses in China.  3. The third is to receive specialised training, e.g., communication, translation and dissemination, policy analysis and further advanced quantitative methods to make me a well-rounded researcher. I look forward to sharing my research with GCRF fellows and participating in ESRC GCRF activities and meeting potential collaborators.  4. The fourth is to submit two manuscripts with existing and new colleagues to peer-reviewed journals, one is a review paper on the influence of parental migration on child health and development; the other is a quantitative paper to examine how urbanization in China affects child outcomes.  Both these research papers are directly related to my PhD topic of parental migration, caregiving practices and children&apos;s nutritional health in China.  5. In terms of career development, my long-term career goal is to become a leading researcher in the area of migration and urbanization and their impacts on population health and wellbeing, with a particular attention to child health and development in low-and middle-income countries. I aim to become an independent researcher in this area in 3-5 years&apos; time, combining disciplinary research skills in public health and social statistics with interdisciplinary research experience in developing countries. An ESRC Global Challenge Research Fund Postdoctoral Fellowship would provide an excellent step towards establishing my academic career in this respect. Afterwards, I will apply for other fellowships, e.g, Leverhulme Early Career Fellowship, Hallsworth and Simon Fellowships, and research grants that are available for early career researchers, e.g., ESRC New Investigate Grants and Chinese National Science Foundation grants to continue my research.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed fellowship study will expand on my PhD project about parental migration and its influence on children&apos;s health and wellbeing in China by considering an important macro contextual factor - rapid urbanization. It aims to examine how rural-urban disparity in child health changes during the process of China&apos;s urbanization. I aim to achieve five main objectives during this one-year fellowship: 1) To disseminate findings from my PhD to both academic and non-academic audiences; 2) To build networks and partnerships with academic institutions and non-academic users across sectors in China to develop proposals for future grant calls; 3) To produce publications in order to help establish a track record in the area of migration and urbanization and their influence on population health and wellbeing; 4) To receive specialised training, e.g., communication, translation and dissemination, policy analysis and further advanced methods to make me a well-rounded researcher; 5) To provide an excellent step towards establishing my academic career in the area of migration and urbanization and their impacts on population health and wellbeing.  China has seen rapid urbanization in the last three decades, with the proportion of urban population rising from 18 percent (172.45 million) in 1978 to 51 percent (690.76 million) in 2011. Unlike Western and former socialist countries, China&apos;s rapid urbanization is not merely driven by spontaneous rural-urban migration, but also partly planned by the government that has maintained an urban bias in favour of urban residents to preserve regime stability. China&apos;s household registration (hukou) system officially segregates its population into &apos;urban residents&apos; born in urban areas and &apos;rural residents or peasants&apos; born in rural areas. These are the status markers in contemporary China, and entail different state welfare entitlements. The hukou system is the most crucial institutional arrangement that has affected individuals&apos; life chances and socio-economic well-being in China. The process of China&apos;s rapid urbanization may cause the unequal distributions of socio-economic resources and life chances among its population, thus contributing to rural-urban health inequalities.  It has been suggested that targeting at childhood or early years of life has the potential to reduce health inequalities within one generation. The consequences of urbanization on child health in terms of physical health and psychosocial well-being are likely to be mixed. Children may benefit from improved economic status, better access to healthcare, sanitation, and better nutrition. However, rapid environmental, economic and social changes that follow urbanization may put children in risky situations such as environmental hazards, stressors, and unhealthy diets and lifestyles. The effect of urbanization on child health may differ according to the degree of urbanization because, for example, rural, newly urbanized communities and settled urban can be associated with different risk factors of child health and development.  Despite well documented rural-urban inequalities in child health in China, there are few attempts to examine how this relationship changes during the process of China&apos;s urbanization and possible mechanisms. Previous research has tended to study socioeconomic status, urbanization and child health separately in a cross-sectional fashion and failed to examine the dynamic socioeconomic inequalities in child health in a rapidly urbanizing society. This proposed fellowship aims to explore the dynamics of socioeconomic inequalities in child health and development by considering important macro contextual factors-rural-urban migration and rapid urbanization in China. Findings will provide a sound evidence base to inform decision-making in public health and social welfare to tackle health and welfare inequalities among children in China and other developing countries with rapid urbanization and internal migration.</narrative>
