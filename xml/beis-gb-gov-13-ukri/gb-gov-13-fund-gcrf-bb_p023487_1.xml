   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project will focus on chickpea in Ethiopia. Agriculture in Ethiopia and a further 19 of 31 &quot;least developed&quot; countries in Africa is constrained by arid, infertile and marginal soil conditions. Climate change, altered precipitation patterns, prolonged droughts and the soil loss that ensues, adds to the challenges. Ethiopia&apos;s population has risen 2.6% annually over the last 50 years, but crop production grew by only 2% annually. Solutions are required to increase crop productivity, quantity and quality, for food security and climate resilience.  Legumes such as chickpea and grains such as sorghum, millet and maize are the major crops here. We will focus on chickpea, a key crop in developing nations. Pulses such as chickpea are crucial for protein nutrition to provide income and support livelihoods in rural areas of the least developed countries. Most chickpea growers in semi-arid agrosystems are subsistence farmers who lack resources and knowledge for crop improvement, thus, in the long-term, will benefit most from the improvements we aim for.  The crucial role of root systems in limiting crop productivity was not previously addressed in breeding. Root system size and distribution sets the capacity for water and nutrient acquisition and therefore is key for climate stress resilience, contributing to drought tolerance, water and nutrient use efficiency. We will focus on developing advanced but cheap and cost-effective tools for root growth characterisation. This will subsequently allow researchers and breeders in Ethiopia to identify suitable germplasm for chickpea breeding. Plant resilience depends on appropriate root system architecture adapted to local soils; our low-cost but powerful tools will enable location-adapted breeding programs in Ethiopia for the first time. This will be the most direct path to innovation for increased and sustainable chickpea production by subsistence farmers. We are working closely with international scientists from Ethiopia and USA, with their project: &quot;Climate resistant chickpea&quot; (CRC). This initiative has support by several international programs, e.g. the USAID &quot;Feed the Future&quot;, CGIAR &quot;Consortium Research Program on Grain Legumes&quot;, and is key for success in our project. CRC generates a huge amount of information and resources for crop improvement. These include: a pre-breeding population consisting of &gt;7000 unique lines and a collection of &gt;600 landrace accessions in Ethiopia. Ethiopia has developed networks of agricultural advice services throughout the country that are critical for uptake of novel technologies and germplasm. We will work closely with these networks through our Ethiopian and international partners to provide pathways for innovation. We have three main aims at the Foundation Project stage: First, to develop, complement and enhance the existing network of Ethiopian and international efforts by using our multidisciplinary expertise to develop tools to enhance breeding for good yields even in drought conditions. For this to succeed in the longer term, we will develop collaborations, workshops and site visits to Ethiopia and through regular communication;  Second, we will develop powerful, low-cost technologies and equipment for root phenotyping in Edinburgh and Ethiopia; and in close coordination with Ethiopian colleagues. The project&apos;s Foundation phase will advance technology development in concert with evaluation in Ethiopia, to make the equipment fit for purpose under local conditions and in the hands of local breeders.  Third, to identify how our expertise in innovation financing and soil quality enhancement can serve to accelerate uptake of the technological innovations we will develop and how to increase soil fertility and soil nutrient recycling, potentially by biochar amendment. We will, in collaboration with Ethiopian colleagues, contribute to long-term planning for sustainable enhancement of food security in Ethiopia and other countries with an arid climate.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="The objectives of this project are:   1) Partnership and capacity building: Develop close scientific collaborations between a multidisciplinary team of scientists in Edinburgh (plant biologist, image analyst, economist and soil scientist) and a team from Ethiopia (chickpea breeder, plant scientists). First result of this collaboration is the co-developed proposal, and will be followed by a workshop in Ethiopia, to make public the aims and approach of the project to develop new breeding tools; reciprocal visits, and onsite training in Edinburgh in the use and maintenance of the new technologies to be developed for those carrying out the work in Ethiopia; and overall, joint work on the six work packages of the project. The transfer of this knowledge and technical skills and innovations will enhance the capacity of our partners and beyond them, Ethiopian breeders, to apply cutting edge tools to solve problems of food security sustainably.  2) Technology advancement: The development of a novel, powerful but affordable technology based on commodity optical and electronic components and open source machine-learning software to quantify root growth and root growth patterns, jointly and in a re-iterative process in Edinburgh and Ethiopia. Ethiopia is on the list of least-developed ODA-eligible countries, and the target crop is a staple food of poor subsistence and smallholder farmers. Easy gains in chickpea breeding have already been achieved, and the deployment of advanced technologies in now required for further sustainable intensification of production and enhanced yields to feed Ethiopia&apos;s growing population. The use of such technology using modular cheap components and to be developed open-source software will make the technology robust and resistant to catastrophic failure due to easy maintenance and help its further development and adaptation in Ethiopia in the future. 3) Disseminating knowledge: Make the knowledge and technology broadly available by publication and public domain access to the technology. Knowledge transfer is a key part of capacity building and inspiring a new generation of Ethiopian breeders to use powerful tools in the breeding process.  4) Technology dissemination: Support Ethiopian colleagues to secure broad adoption of the technology to be developed for incorporation into tailored breeding programs to benefit subsistence and smallholder farmers in Ethiopia. The partnership will extend to joint efforts to secure international and national follow-on funding subsequent to this project to ensure financing for broad uptake of the technologies in a breeding programme, and their dissemination to other ODA eligible countries and within Ethiopia for other crop breeding programs.  5) Enhancing sustainability: Deliberately, this project targets not only aims to be completed within the proposed 30-month project, but also addresses measures that will ensure their sustainability long beyond the project&apos;s funding period. Together with Ethiopian colleagues the joint analysis and evaluation of approaches for a) facilitating uptake of innovations through development and strengthening of financial tools, and b) the strengthening of sustainable crop production by identifying suitable pathways for building up long-term soil fertility are important to ensure rapid uptake of innovations and long-term sustainability in the face of climate change."></capital-spend>
