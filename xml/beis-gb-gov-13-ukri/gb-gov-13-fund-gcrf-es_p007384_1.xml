   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed Network aims to construct a research agenda on strategies to improve the social inclusion of ethnic and religious minorities in ODA-eligible countries. High level national and international activity will support development of new and existing collaborations to address this underresearched area in relation to the economic growth and welfare of such countries.  Agenda and outputs will be agreed with a wide range of stakeholders, including influential policymakers in relevant countries. The Network links to ESRC themes on &apos;The Dynamics of Inequalities&apos; and &apos;Migration, Mobility and Development&apos; and will support learning, collaboration and social change through the following objectives:  1. Review the state of international research on social inclusion of ethnic and religious minorities in a range of public institutions and gaps in the evidence needed to inform future policy and practice.   2. Develop interdisciplinary and multiagency learning on strategies and approaches supporting the social inclusion of minority ethnic and religious groups in institutional contexts, sharing lessons learned across disciplines and sectors, particularly where solutions or successful approaches have been identified.  3. Identify key challenges, priorities and reference points that cross disciplinary research can play a role in addressing, of relevance to people from minority ethnic and religious populations and organisations that represent their interests as well as to public service practitioners, policymakers, commissioners and funders.   4. Develop a research, community, policy and practice partnership and collaborate to develop and implement a future research agenda.  This will involve creative research designs that orientate to social justice and pool expertise on concepts, theory and methods from a range of disciplinary and institutional contexts.  5. Identify and exploit useful mechanisms for collaboration across the research life cycle - from inception to research design, seeking funding, conducting research, analysing data and dissemination.   6. Link to other relevant networks and large research projects - to keep abreast of emerging knowledge, avoid duplication of activities, disseminate outputs and contribute value and support.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">There is increasing awareness that across the world some groups in society are being excluded from opportunities while other groups enjoy unfair advantages.  This unjust state of affairs appears to be getting worse rather than better, even in countries where wealth is increasing overall. There is agreement among many international bodies working in low and middle income countries that equality and fairness must be given more priority in future in order to improve the economic wellbeing and life chances of all people in these countries.  Failure to do this in the past has led to most people from minority ethnic and religious groups being more likely to have low paid work, to live in slums with risky conditions and to have poorer access to healthcare, education, finance and public transport. People from these populations are also excluded from systems for justice and government and from decision-making about things that affect their lives. This kind of unfairness leads to public unrest and unstable societies.  Public services can be a major influence on how well individuals from ethnic and religious minorities are able to participate in society and be treated as full citizens. Supporting institutions to provide services more effectively to people from such groups is an essential issue for cities that want to be inclusive.  This involves political and social challenges, however, as competition for work and resources often drives conflict between ethnic groups. Institutions can also fail to give priority to this issue, especially when statistics they collect to see how well they are doing do not even record ethnic and religious differences.   The Socially Inclusive Cities Network will focus on how research might help reduce these inequalities.  We will look at research evidence from across the world on the experiences of people from minority ethnic and religious groups and any ways that public services have tried to reduce unfairness. We will also hold workshops in India, Kenya, Nigeria, Vietnam and the UK with experts on this topic, including voluntary and advocacy organisations that represent people from these populations, policymakers, service professionals and others who can contribute. We will specifically consider the needs of women and young people in minority ethnic and religious groups as they can face additional layers of disadvantage.   Workshop participants will discuss the evidence available as well as gaps in knowledge and what further research might help move things forward.  We will identify common issues across different public services and factors that apply to specific institutions and we will focus on what might help change things.  We are especially interested in minority ethnic or religious populations that experience the highest levels of social exclusion in low and middle income countries.  We also want to identify strategies that can be used across different services within a city so that things change across the board and help create &apos;inclusive cities&apos;.</narrative>
