   <narrative xml:lang="EN">ARCHAEOLOGY TO BUSINESS IN FAYNAN: EMPOWERING AND ALLEVIATING THE POVERTY OF BEDOUIN WOMEN IN SOUTHERN JORDAN</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">1. To empower and alleviate the poverty of Bedouin women in Faynan, southern Jordan. The region of Faynan and Gregira in southern Jordan is one of the most poverty stricken areas of the country, with women suffering especially high levels of deprivation. The region also has some of the best preserved and most distinctive archaeological monuments within Jordan, with considerable excavation having been undertaken by AHRC-funded UK teams, and those from the US. The objective is to use the outcomes of this research to support the alleviation of poverty.   2. To use the outcome of AHRC funded archaeological excavation at the early Neolithic site of WF16 to inspire the design of high quality and locally distinctive handicraft products for sale to tourists visiting the archaeological sites in Faynan. The AHRC funded excavation of the early Neolithic site of WF16 (2008-10) recovered a unique collection of Neolithic art objects, principally stone and bone engraved with geometric designs, with some human and animal depictions. This provides a source for designs for handicrafts that will be unique to the locality of Faynan. The products will raise awareness of the AHRC funded research and its findings to previously unrealised stakeholders.  3. To establish a &apos;Women&apos;s Cooperative Society&apos; for the manufacture, marketing and sale of these handicraft products. Tourism is on the increase in Faynan, but the local Bedouin community is currently unable to benefit because it lacks products that might sell to the tourists. Jordan is flooded with cheap handicraft imports from China and India, with tourists increasingly looking for locally distinctive high quality products.  4. To provide handicraft and business training to members of the cooperative so that it becomes a self-sustaining business, beyond the end date of the project. The aim is to support the Bedouin women in their development of a sustainable business enterprise that will be financially viable after the funding support has come to an end. As such, training will be provided in market research, pricing, accountancy, customer relations and so forth.   5. To identify and develop venues for the sale of the handicrafts in Faynan and from outlets in Amman. While Faynan will be the principal market for the sale of handicrafts, using specific tourist locations, such as the Faynan trekking camp, arrangements will also be sought with handicraft outlets in Amman to provide additional income streams.  6. To enhance social cohesion, cooperation and well-being within the Bedouin women from different tribal groups in Faynan. There are five different tribes within Faynan, each having different access to different resources, and different types of skills. The project seeks to build on a willingness from the women to develop greater cooperation between the tribes so that these skills and resources can be shared for the benefit of all.  7. To provide a case-study of how University-based researchers can work with an NGO committed to international development to generate economic impacts from Arts &amp; Humanities based research.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The &apos;Archaeology to Business in Faynan&apos; (ABIF) project will draw on the outcomes of AHRC funded research to support poverty alleviation and gender equality in the Bedouin community of Faynan/Greigra, southern Jordan. This area has a high level of economic deprivation, which is especially felt amongst the Bedouin women. The recent development of irrigation agriculture to grow tomatoes and melons is only benefiting a restricted number of families, this partly arising from the community being divided into five tribes with different levels of access to agricultural employment. Tourism is increasingly popular to Faynan, this being supported by a single hotel that caters for affluent westerners and is run by a company from Amman. While this hotel has brings income into Faynan, via employment and its supply chains, the majority of Bedouin, and especially the women, have been unable to benefit. As with agriculture, the distribution of benefits is inhibited by the tribal structure within Faynan. The recent development of the Faynan Museum, supported by AHRC funding awards, has attracted further tourists by promoting the archaeological sites and monuments in Faynan, to be further enhanced by a Faynan Heritage Walking Trail. During the course of this development, Bedouin Women have approached the PI and his colleagues to express their desire to produce handicrafts to sell to the tourists.  The handicraft market in Jordan is substantial, but is increasingly flooded with cheap imports from China and India. Tourists, and especially the affluent tourists coming to Faynan, are looking for highly-distinctive and high-quality products, relating to the specific localities they have visited. Despite the presence of base-line handicraft skills, the Faynan women cannot at present, produce, market, and sell such products. As such, the ABIF project will support the development of a new range of handicrafts, combining traditional Bedouin skills in weaving and other techniques with designs inspired from the ancient art of Faynan to make locally distinctive products.   That ancient art was discovered during the AHRC funded excavations at the Neolithic site of WF16 in Faynan. Excavations were undertaken between 2008 and 2010, producing a wealth of new information about this critical period of economic change in the southern Levant, one which saw the transition from mobile hunting &amp; gathering to sedentary farming communities, 11,800-10,200 years ago. A key discovery at WF16 was a collection of engraved objects that provides the oldest collection of art objects from Jordan. These primarily have geometric patterns engraved onto stone and bone, with some human and animal depictions. This art can be readily translated into the design of new handicraft products, creating a unique line of products for Faynan.  The ABIF project will involve collaboration between University-based archaeologists from Reading, UK, who excavated WF16, &apos;Future Pioneers for Empowering Communities (FPEC)&apos;, a Jordanian-based NGO committed to international development, and the Jordan-based Council for British Research in the Levant, that has expertise about traditional Bedouin culture and handicrafts. FPEC has extensive experience and an excellent track record in supporting local communities to develop their own sustainable business enterprises to alleviate poverty. These three bodies will work together with women from all five Bedouin tribes in Faynan to develop the &apos;Women&apos;s Cooperative of Faynan and Gregira&apos;. This will produce, market and sell high-quality handicrafts inspired by the art from WF16. Training programs in handicraft design and production, and in a range of business skills including marketing, pricing and customer relations, will be delivered with a view to the development of a financially self-sustaining business at the completing of the funding period.</narrative>
