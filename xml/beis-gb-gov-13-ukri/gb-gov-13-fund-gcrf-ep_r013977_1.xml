   <narrative xml:lang="EN">LoCoMoTE: Low Cost Morphable Teleoperated Endoscope for Gastric Intestinal Tract Screening</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Existing technologies are unable to meet China&apos;s endoscopic gastrointestinal (GI) screening needs, due to its large, aging population, insufficient infrastructure and high incidence of GI cancers. To address this challenge, we propose a novel and low cost soft endoscope, together with high-speed wireless communications to create a way to perform regular endoscopic screening programs in China.       The soft endoscope will be able propel itself inside torturous, compliant environments, such as the human gastrointestinal tract, and dramatically reduce the pain associated with conventional endoscopes. Because of the self-propelling feature and the inherent safety of using soft material, the new endoscope can be operated by non-specialist staff with minimal training and be supervised or even controlled remotely by specialist clinicians with wireless communication. The endoscope will be operated by clinicians via a custom made haptic interface. The endoscope itself will be made to be low cost and disposable. Therefore, this will enable rural medical clinics to run regular endoscopic screening programs with the system, as it will require no additional sterilisation facilities and will be easy to learn to use.       To facilitate adoption and to provide support for rural clinicians, the endoscope will be connected to a high-speed 5G wireless that will enable haptic tele-operation. Through this, expert clinicians in large hospitals all over the country will be able to monitor and directly control screening procedures from any location. Experts will therefore be able to train rural clinicians in techniques by physically demonstrating them, support rural clinics to ensure accurate diagnosis and allow experts to perform more complex procedures remotely. Aligning well with China&apos;s strategy of starting 5G commercial applications in 2020, this approach is timely and takes advantage of the wide-spread availability of wireless internet in China and deals directly with the challenges faced by efforts to create large-scale endoscopic screening programs in the country.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project aims to solve the unmet the needs of China&apos;s endoscopic gastrointestinal (GI) screening due to its large, aging population, insufficient infrastructure and high incidence of GI cancers. The technical objective is to develop a soft robot which can actively change its morphology, allowing it to propel itself inside torturous, compliant environments, such as the colon. We plan to use this device to create a low cost, disposable soft endoscope for colon screening with an aim to extend it to other GI screenings (including small bowel, stomach and esophagus). This device can be operated by non-specialist staff with minimal training and be supervised or even controlled remotely by specialist clinicians via high-speed wireless communication and haptic interface. The system is inherently safe and painless as it uses minimal forces to propel itself and the soft body naturally deforms around the GI tract. The success of this project could radically improve the accessibility of endoscopy in China, enabling clinicians in rural areas to perform safe and painless endoscopies with minimal training and also increase the population&apos;s accessibility to specialist clinicians via the wireless connectivity. The goals of this project are ambitious. We have defined five distinct objectives - each related to a major challenge - that will be achieved during this three-year project to realise the project vision: O1: Design and fabricate an inherently safe and comfortable soft robotic endoscope that is disposable and low cost.  O2: Develop and optimise locomotion techniques to allow the robotic endoscope to move through the human colon with minimal guidance from the operator.  O3: Create a human interface that will enable clinicians to easily control the endoscope and incorporate haptic feedback.  O4: Incorporate a high-speed, wireless tele-operation and communication system that will enable clinicians from all over the country to control the endoscope. O5: Take the device to human trials and prove its feasibility.</narrative>
