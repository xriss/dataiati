   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project uses literary comic strips to promote understanding of the role of borderland brokers in Nepal and Sri Lanka. Borderland brokers play an important but little understood role in mediating relations between the centre and periphery and in turn shaping the course of post-war transitions. These brokers include local political or military elites, traders or businessmen and women, or religious figures who mediate between centre and periphery and/or across international borders.  The project will conduct life histories of a range of men and women from borderland or frontier regions in Nepal and Sri Lanka, two South Asian countries that have recently seen wars end.   The project builds on the considerable momentum generated by two existing research projects (&apos;Borderlands, Brokers and Peacebuilding in Sri Lanka and Nepal: War to Peace Transitions viewed from the margins&apos; (funded by ESRC Dec 2015- Nov 2017) and &apos;State, Frontiers and Conflict in the Asia-Pacific&apos; (2014-18, funded by the University of Melbourne), and several academic and policy networks established through these projects. It explores the life histories of brokers in order to better understand how these figures have shaped and responded to changing post-war dynamics linked to international and domestic peacebuilding and statebuilding interventions. We will collect multiple oral histories of respondents from the two research sites and from those, choose four stories from contrasting regions in Nepal and Sri Lanka (2 from each) to illustrate. The comics will be used in tandem with policy packs and educational resources to communicate key policy messages stemming from the research.  We understand brokerage as a social relation that shapes how power is imposed and negotiated through the capacity of key individuals to mediate across social boundaries and between different scales. Brokers are &apos;network specialists&apos; whose ability to straddle multiple life-worlds enables them to act as gatekeepers who mediate power and filter access to resources. We focus on brokers who are physically located at the margins of the state.   Our starting assumption is that brokerage is central to post-war transitions. Military, political and economic brokers mediate valued resources and ideas between centre and periphery and across the borderline. In post-war transitions their roles may change; for example military actors become political party leaders or morph into businessmen, or development brokers. These figures may play a critical role in determining the extent to which borderland regions are integrated into the post-war settlement. For example, political leaders in the southern Tarai region of Nepal used their leverage to impose a cross-border blockade in protest at a new constitution. Their stories can therefore help to shed light on the shifting social, political and gender dynamics of conflict and peace, and paint a compelling picture of why conflict persists or how peaceful relationships are built.   The project will produce literary comic strips and books, illustrating first person testimonies recorded with a range of brokers including Muslim politicians in Sri Lanka who struggle to mediate between the interests of their core constituency and the demands of the central state, &apos;manpower&apos; agents who provide opportunities for marginalised villagers in Nepal to work overseas, and former para-military rebel leaders in Sri Lanka who switched allegiances during the war and went on to take up key positions in the Provincial administration.   We will aim to publish these illustrated stories in the international mainstream media and through a variety of media platforms in Sri Lanka and Nepal. The project will critically examine the potential role of literary comics in research on borderlands and brokers, generating findings that will be of relevance to a wide range of researchers and scholars working on conflict and development.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="This project aims to improve understanding of, and policy responses, to post-war transitions in Nepal and Sri Lanka. It examines how key local actors from peripheral regions - or &apos;borderland brokers&apos; - respond to, and help shape changing centre and periphery relations in post-war transitions. It adopts an innovative analytical and methodological approach to documenting the life histories of these brokers - who include local businessmen, administrators, civil society leaders or politicians - by using literary comic strips to develop narratives that are co-produced by respondents and local artists. As well as providing a novel approach for generating compelling accounts of brokers&apos; lives and the wider post-war transitions that they shape, the literary comics will also present unique opportunities to engage policy audiences and the general public. The project will therefore help to shape unfolding national and international policy debates relating to post-war transitions in Nepal and Sri Lanka on themes such as transitional justice, devolution, and inclusive post-war development.   This project builds on an existing research programme (ES/M011046/1) which examines the role of borderland regions in war to peace transitions in Nepal and Sri Lanka.  The brokers examined in this study will be selected from a wider sample of 20 identified and researched in the existing study. We will explore three core questions about borderland brokers:  How have borderland brokers adapted to, and shaped changes in conflict and peace building dynamics? How do they draw on cultural, material and political resources to negotiate changing centre-periphery relations? How have they influenced wider processes of peacebuilding or statebuilding?  These questions will inform a fourth relating to policy implications: how can policy makers better engage with the mechanisms of brokerage in order to consolidate post-war transitions?  The project will apply an innovative analytical framework for understanding post-war transitions. The margins of the state in conflict-affected countries are typically sites of institutional patchiness where the state&apos;s rule overlaps with other forms of governance. As a result, actors located at the political or economic centre will often rely on intermediaries or brokers to mobilise political support or to access markets and capital in these peripheral zones. The role of borderlands and borderland brokers are neglected in existing research on peacebuilding and statebuilding, which has tended to study these processes from the vantage point of the centre. In Sri Lanka and Nepal, stories of the state margins and borderland brokers often remain unheard by media outlets preoccupied with events in Colombo and Kathmandu. We apply a highly inter-disciplinary approach for studying these brokers which combines visual narrative, a social-biographical approach to the study of marginal histories, and political economy research in order to uncover how brokers&apos; lives intersect with their wider context.   The project will make a novel methodological contribution by using literary comics for co-producing and publishing life histories in close collaboration with research respondents, local artists and media organisations. The research will reflect on this method, and the associated benefits it can generate for researchers seeking to uncover and communicate the largely hidden narratives of these key actors. The project develops a highly original approach for influencing peacebuilding and development policy internationally and in Nepal and Sri Lanka. It will leverage existing networks established through the project which link research findings to policy debates in Sri Lanka, Nepal and internationally. The project&apos;s impact will be enhanced by PositiveNegatives&apos; extensive policy and media links and will work with both international media organisations and local news and current affairs platforms in Nepal and Sri Lanka."></capital-spend>
