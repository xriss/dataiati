   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Breast cancer burden is large and growing in Asia. In Malaysia, the breast cancer incidence has increased rapidly for the past two decades, albeit that it is still less than half of that in Europeans. The rapid increased incidence has been associated with changing lifestyle, such as decreased parity, no/short period of breastfeeding, and increasing Westernisation and urbanization. Breast cancer is now the most common cancer across all ethnicities in Malaysia, accounting for 31% of cancers in women, and it is the most common cause of cancer-related deaths. Early detection by screening can reduce breast cancer mortality. However, due to lack of funding within the national health services and lack of justification for population-based screening, only opportunistic screening is practiced. This is suboptimal and inequitable. A viable alternative approach is to improve screening strategies by identifying high-risk women who should be targeted for screening. In this proposal, we plan to bring technological advances in the understanding of breast cancer genetics to develop tools that can be used identify women who are at higher risk of developing breast cancer so that early detection and disease prevention interventions become possible. The findings of this research will inform the development of appropriate management to ensure that healthcare resources can be used efficiently for targeted screening and prevention.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">We aim to develop tools that will enable us to identify women who are at higher risk of developing breast cancer and who could be offered targeted prevention options and personalised cancer risk management. Our specific objectives are, using Chinese, Malay and Indian women from Malaysia and Singapore,  (1) to evaluate the combined effects of common breast cancer genetic susceptibility variants  on breast cancer risk using Polygenic Risk Scores (PRS) developed in European-ancestry populations. (2) to evaluate the performance of PRS developed in East Asian populations PRS for predicting breast cancer risk in South-East Asian populations (3) to construct novel, enhanced PRS using breast cancer genetic susceptibility variants in Asian populations</narrative>
