  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The United Nations&apos; 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) aim to mobilise global efforts to &apos;transform our world&apos; (UN, 2017) so as to address major challenges facing global society, such as achieving food security and nutrition for all (SDG 1, 2, 3, 8 &amp;12). We will focus on India where agricultural sector which contributes more than 17.5% to its GDP, employs 250 million people and remains the backbone of India&apos;s rural population, which comprises almost 67% of the country&apos;s 1.3 billion population. Yet, most of India&apos;s farmers still remain under poverty. Merely 4% of India&apos;s food is moved through the cold chain compared to 70% in the UK, resulting in as much as 40% wastage, particularly in fresh fruits and vegetables, between farm and market. This reduces farmers&apos; income, which in turn limits their capacity to invest and their incentive to grow more nutritious food. Whilst inadequate cold supply chain infrastructure results in large amount of wastage in fresh produce, inadequate value creation and the impact of climate change on agriculture productivity and food loss has led to increasing number of farmers suicide. Moreover, India has highest number of organic farmers globally but these farmers, who produce most of the country&apos;s high-value and high-nutrition foods, have little access to integrated cold chains. Indian farmers simply do not have financial resources to invest in precision agriculture and cold chain infrastructure development. With PM Modi&apos;s target of &quot;doubling farmers&apos; income by 2022&quot;, India necessitates a stronger case of technological intervention along with innovative business models and effective policies that double the income of farmers and maximise value for every stakeholder in the supply chain.   The project TRANSSITioN will use a food systems approach to identify relevant STFC and indigenous technologies for digitising small-scale agriculture production, connecting farmers to supply chain, reducing food loss and managing food surplus. We will also identify relevant business and supply chain finance models supporting such technological interventions and ways in which different actors across the cold food chain could be engaged to directly and indirectly shape development outcomes. We will create &quot;Sustainable Cold Food Chain Incubator Hub&quot; (TRANSSITioN Hub) in India built on STFC ground breaking technologies from RAL Space (Thermal modelling, remote sensing, drone applications, Infrared Thermography), cryogenics from ASTeC and Cryox, data science capabilities (big data analytics, artifical intelligence) of STFC and IBM Research at Hartree Centre, along with interdisciplinary team from supply chain management, business sustainability, political science, food science, agriculture and material sciences, international research and stakeholder collaboration.   The WPs will be applied to a set of two case studies starting from farms (organic and conventional) to consumption centre, co-identified with in-country partners. Hyderabad and Chennai region have been identified for the pilot project. Being host to companies such as such as Amazon, Flipkart, Jubilant Foods, Johnson &amp; Johnson and Procter &amp; Gamble, this region has become a consumer centric food logistics hub. With an established network of 50,000 organic farmers, processors, technology providers and retailers the selected region strongly aligns with the core competencies of our research agenda. Unfortunately, this region also had the second highest number of farmers suicide in 2016. Project TRANSSITioN, therefore, aims to forge a sustainable framework to meet different economic, social and commercial priorities of varied stakeholders to usher socio-economic change through value maximisation.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project TRANSSITioN will advance the interdisciplinary food system research and approach to capture the ways in which various actors within a food system are currently operating in an Indian context. Leveraging on STFC&apos;s advanced technological capabilities from RAL Space, ASTeC, Cryox, data sciences expertise of STFC and IBM Research at Hartree Centre, it would engage an interdisciplinary team of researchers from India and the UK with supply chain and logistics management, food sciences, agriculture and material sciences, international research, policy making, and rural technologies background to create a &quot;Sustainable Cold Food Chain Incubator Hub&quot; (TRANSSITioN Hub) in India. This will focus on enhancing crop productivity and resilience to climate change while reducing food wastage, creating value addition opportunities, connecting farmers to market and improving their livelihoods. The Hub&apos;s mission is to build capabilities in analysing the current state of cold food supply chain in India - the experiential objective of Hub&apos;s work programme - to evaluate transitions and transformative pathways to sustainable cold food chain systems in India. The Hub will produce an integrated research design and framework to identify, evaluate and assess relevant actors, factors and issues at different levels of the cold supply chain system, which can be considered the points of technological, social and economic interventions to directly or indirectly shape the transformation outcomes. Building upon the Hub&apos;s existing strong research network, initial research findings, strong industrial partners&apos; and government support, a vast network of farmers, we will work with multiple stakeholders, to extend and strengthen the existing networks, and meaningfully engage with them to achieve the mission of the Hub. By doing so, we will co-develop innovative technologies, run demonstration projects, identify new thermal materials, develop analytical and evaluating decision support tools to help farmers, processors, logistics service providers, retailers, policy makers and consumers directly address relevant issues and food-related aspects of the UN SDGs and the synergies and trade-offs between them. This would help the Hub to achieve objectives of digitising agriculture production, connecting farmers to supply chain, reducing food loss, managing food surplus, and developing new business and funding models for the transformation of cold food supply chain systems in India.   The specific objectives of the project TRANSSITioN are:  1. To co-develop demo-sites (incubator hub) from farm-to-consumptions centres that will test, evaluate and demonstrate the impact of STFC technologies, data science capabilities along with other indigenous technologies and interdisciplinary research for developing sustainable cold chains.  2. To map cold food chain activities, co-identify key leverage points for transformation and co-define data, technologies, partnership needs and reference cases for addressing the leverage points. 3. To develop metrics and tools for measuring socio-economic and environmental impact of the proposed technological interventions which will include a focus on improving the livelihoods of small-scale farmers and marginalised communities. 4. To extend the established network and build new innovative partnerships, propose new business and supply chain finance models that will make the cold chain viable for small-scale farmers, local retailers, rural community along with the big players. 5. Build and strengthen academic research capabilities and learning partnership with the in-country partners to create knowledge repositories, next generation researchers and practitioners in cold food supply chain systems. 6. Use our research framework and Theory of Change to drive, monitor, influence and maximise social impact of our research through two-way learning.</narrative>
