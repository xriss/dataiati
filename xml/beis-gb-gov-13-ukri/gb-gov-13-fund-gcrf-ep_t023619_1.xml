  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Aim: To support national capacity-strengthening and research in gender-responsive resource allocation, health care organization and policy decision-making for more efficient and equitable responses to refugee and host communities health needs in east, central and southern Africa.   Our project objectives are: 1. Identifying health governance and policy constraints and research priorities. 2. Identifying research priorities for health economics in the fields of resource allocation, health system constraints, and inter-sectoral opportunities.  3. Identifying capacity strengthening needs on governance and health economics to support health system responses to refugee and host populations.  4. Applying a gender analysis to our approach to resource allocation, health system priority setting, and capacity strengthening activities, in order to ensure our work is responsive to refugee populations&apos; needs and promotes equity.  5. Informed by the findings of the work packages, agree conceptual or theoretical frameworks to guide the future larger study, utilising a political economy approach 6. Developing a proposal to GCRF using interdisciplinary methods for a collaborative project to support gender-responsive resource allocation and policy-making and strengthen health system responses to refugee and host populations.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">There are over 25 million refugees globally, the highest number since the end of the Second World War. ODA-eligible countries, many in Africa, host the majority of the refugee population; Uganda alone hosts 1.36 million refugees and is the third largest refugee-hosting country in the world. The vast majority of refugees are in long-term, protracted displacement situations. At a population level, there can often be stark social and health inequities between host and refugee populations, as well as within the refugee community itself. For example, refugee (and internally displaced) women and girls are less likely than men and boys to have secure access to food, health care, shelter, nationality and documentation, and are more vulnerable to sexual violence and exploitation.  The response to protracted displacement settings has commonly been the development of separate parallel health responses in which international donor funding is directed largely towards international NGOs, and less so towards host governments; even where there are efforts to integrate refugee populations within host communities. While helping to address needs in the short-term, this approach risks weakening the public health system response and community cohesion over the longer term. For example, it can cause poorly coordinated and inefficient responses by government and NGOs, fragment national governance mechanisms, divert financing and expertise away from government, and undermine national strategic plans. Parallel approaches also mean that the opportunity to address issues of social and health inequity are limited, through the siloed application of numerous advocacy and development programmes. Overall, the current nature of humanitarian response is unsustainable as it fails to build long term national capacity to respond effectively and equitably as needs arise.    The REfugees in Africa ClusTer (REACT) aims to respond to this situation by partnering specialist researchers - in the areas of health governance, political economy, refugee health needs, health economics and gender analysis - with policymakers from the east, central  and southern Africa region - comprising Eswatini, Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, Mauritius, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe; represented collectively by the ECSA Health Community.  REACT will cluster two existing large GCRF programmes - Thanzi la Onse (Health of All), led by the University of York, focused on health economics and related research to inform resource allocation in the ECSA region; and RECAP, led by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LHSTM), focused on health in humanitarian crises.  It will include partnership of two major research institutes in the ECSA region, based in countries with amongst the largest refugee populations globally - Makerere University, School of Public Health, in Uganda; and KEMRI-Wellcome Trust, in Kenya.  The partnership will also benefit from participation of other research groups with major potential to generate knowledge to contribute to designing suitable responses to refugee health needs - the University of Addis Ababa, Ethopia; University of Bergen, Norway; and the Overseas Development Institute in the UK.  Following an initial stakeholder mapping, the REACT Cluster team will support the convening of a workshop by the ECSA-HC comprising key specialists and stakeholders from the region; representing affected populations; academia and policy-makers.  4 distinct research themes will be investigated, in work packages led by REACT Co-Investigators; collectively leading to a Working Group report.  A full submission to the GCFR Clusters Phase 2 call - highlighting areas for research, ways to strengthen capacity and research-to-policy partnerships - will be developed out of the Working Group report.</narrative>
