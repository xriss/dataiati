  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project will build on the extensive experience of the investigators in the area of energy access, mini grids and networks. This includes the extensive experience of research and development in delivering modular PV driven power generation and distribution systems in rural Sub Saharan Africa (SSA). This includes the six mini-grids (affecting ~ 20,000 people) in Cameroon, Kenya and Uganda with collaboration with rural electrification agencies and the design of multi MW grid networks in Mauritania coupled with projects delivered by partners from Kenya and Uganda. In this project, we will build on such collaborations to create new and appropriate knowledge, and capacity building, focussing on sustainable local energy networks. These include off-grid networks, their ability to work collaboratively with other small networks or with the national grid and their transition to the national grid. This proposal is structured to test and model these systems to enable African households to thrive through optimised, flexible and upgradeable mini grid networks appropriate for growth in developing countries. This will be achieved through the following objectives: 1. Develop a clear understanding and knowledge of how sustainable energy technology platforms can be optimally designed to take into account scenarios of load variations to provide replicable, efficient, resilient and reliable networks in a standalone mode. 2. Explore implications to network sizing and infrastructure due to supply needs, tariffs, metering and linking these to efficiency requirements and resilience taking into account regulatory frameworks in the two partner countries and other SSA states. 3. Understanding intermittent islanding operation of mini-grid networks and demand side management approaches to mini-grid network stability - through field measurements and modelling.  4. Explore and model options to cluster mini-grids to form wider networks with greater stability and lower Levelised Cost of Electricity (LCOE). Assess national scale implications to energy access, and network sizing, resilience and stability.  5. Critical assessment and scenario modelling of mini grid clusters connected to the utility network and how these can be utilised to provide high stability mini-grids to support the near end of line utility network. 6. Review and augment guidelines to support mini grids, connectivity to national grids taking into current understanding and enhancing through the planned studies and outputs under this project.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">To support the requirements of the call, this application will utilise existing work related to five mini grids and their networks deployed previously in Uganda and Kenya. It brings together collaborations between researchers and research users that have interest in sustainable energy systems, resilient networks and energy access. To date, it is estimated that around 1.2 billion people, representing 16% of the global population, have no access to electricity with many more having no reliable electricity supply. Most of these people live in rural areas in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and south Asian countries. Overall access to electricity in SSA is estimated to be around 15.3%, decreasing to 4% in rural areas. As 80% of the SSA population lives in rural areas, extending the grid is prohibitively expensive and rural areas are unlikely to be served through this route in the near future. In addition, load-shedding and blackouts from unreliable national grids are estimated to lower GDP growth by 2%. The lack of access to electricity in the targeted countries and beyond hampers economic activity, trapping communities in poverty. Hence, innovative and less capital intensive solutions such as sustainable energy mini grid networks will be needed to alleviate these challenges, provide growth, and invigorate rural communities.  Expansion of rural electricity solutions is compromised by low population densities and very low incomes (affordability) coupled with low tariffs set by the subsidised utility network in urban areas. It is now widely accepted that mini-grids (electrical power generation, transmission and distribution) have an important role to play in delivering electricity access to rural communities. The focus of this project is sustainable energy driven electricity networks geared to promote the short and long-term sustainable growth in Sub Saharan Africa focusing on Kenya and Uganda. This project will build on our 10 years&apos; experience of research and development in delivering modular solar photovoltaic (PV) driven power generation and distribution systems in rural areas on these countries. We will build on such collaborations to create new and appropriate knowledge, and capacity building, focussing on sustainable and resilient local energy networks, including off-grid networks and their transition to the national grid. This research will address mini grid networks in various modes - (a) isolated (b) connected to the national grid and (c) with multiple networks connected and working jointly.  Clustering mini grids will form wider networks with greater stability and lower Levelised Cost of Electricity (LCOE), while linking such clusters to the national grid could provide support the near end of line utility network. This research will be underpinned by field studies on the applicants&apos; five existing mini grids in Kenya and Uganda and will consider over 400 mini-grids in planning in these countries.</narrative>
