   <narrative xml:lang="EN">GCRF MINE DUST AND HEALTH NETWORK SUMMARY While the mining industry contributes significantly to the economies of developing countries around the world, mining activities have notable negative environmental and health impacts. Among these, the dust emitted by mining and its associated operations is a cause of increasing concern. Apart from impacting the health of mine-workers who breathe in mineral dust particles, dust is emitted from open pit mines, ore processing and metal extraction plants, ore stockpiles, ore transport containers and mine waste deposits, impacting the wider environment and communities. Lung diseases caused or exacerbated by mine dust exposure include silicosis (caused by inhaling quartz or crystalline silica), black lung disease (caused by inhaling coal dust) and tuberculosis (silica dust exposure increases the risk of pulmonary TB, particularly in gold miners). This places a huge burden on already-strained public health and social security systems. Occupational health hazards from mining are well documented, and the link between dust and lung disease was recently recognised in a class action lawsuit against the six main mining houses in South Africa, awarded in favour of mine workers who contracted silicosis and TB working on gold mines between March 1965 and May 2018 (https://www.silicosissettlement.co.za/). However, the health effects associated with environmental dust emissions, although frequently a concern expressed by communities and community support organisations, have not been rigorously studied. Meaningful data is needed to inform what strategies and policies will work best to mitigate the effects of mine dust on communities living near mines and mine dumps, the populations of which number in their millions. Gathering such data is not simple, however. There are many complexities involved, with dust sources and their effects being influenced by inter-related factors covering the health, economic, social, geological, environmental, engineering, management, and political spheres. The issues associated with mine dust are also frequently contentious and involve diverse stakeholders and interested and affected parties with different, and often conflicting priorities. Poor engagement and communication between experts and lay persons, disciplinary silos and polarised viewpoints have made it difficult to develop a holistic understanding of the complex health issues associated with environmental emissions of mine dusts, and consequently to design meaningful and integrated approaches to address such issues. It is these challenges that our GCRF MINE DUST AND HEALTH NETWORK will seek to address by bringing together researchers, stakeholders and practitioners from a variety of disciplines and professional backgrounds to identify sources, challenges and potential mitigation opportunities associated with public health effects from dust pollution arising from mining activities. Focus will be on integrating and sharing knowledge and information across different disciplines and stakeholders on potential source and dispersion pathways; potential risks to the environment and the health, quality of life and livelihoods of mining-affected communities; monitoring methods and practices; measures to manage dispersion and impacts; stakeholder engagement and communication; and governance policies, standards and regulations.  Ultimately, the GCRF Mine Dust and Health network will serve as a collaborative think-tank to inform research directions both within and across disciplines; government policy and regulations; health monitoring programmes at public clinics; industry best practice; and community healthcare and impact prevention programmes across southern Africa and, as the Network expands, the globe.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Network aims to find integrated solutions to the adverse health and environmental impact of dust emitted by mining activities. The specific objectives are: 1. TO FACILITATE A SHARED AND COMMON UNDERSTANDING OF THE INTER-RELATED HEALTH RISKS AND MITIGATION OPPORTUNITIES RELATING TO MINE DUST BY CREATING SAFE SPACES FOR OPEN DISCUSSION BY ALL STAKEHOLDERS. This objective is central to the success of this network. Research or discourse relating to mine dust has until now been carried out in disciplinary and sectoral silos with little engagement or discussion between different stakeholders, mainly due to perceived positions of distrust and competing interests. A unique three-tiered network structure involving open forums, special interest and working groups will enable constructive interactions to take place, with safe spaces for open conversations about the issues important to all stakeholders. The network will facilitate information and knowledge sharing and will actively engage stakeholders to use and implement insights gained from network activities. 2. TO DEVELOP INTERDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH CAPACITY, PARTICULARLY AMONG EARLY CAREER RESEARCHERS IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, TO PROVIDE MEANINGFUL INPUTS TO COLLABORATIVE PROBLEM SOLVING AND TO PROPOSE INTEGRATED SOLUTIONS RELEVANT TO SPECIFIC COUNTRY/POPULATION CONTEXTS. It is clear from the lack of progress made towards solving issues surrounding mine dust that a collaborative, inter-disciplinary research approach is needed to integrate and share knowledge on, for example, potential dust source and dispersion pathways; significant characteristics of dust that adversely impact the environment and health, monitoring methods and practices; measures to manage dispersion and reduce health impacts, etc. This network brings together researchers from disciplines as diverse as occupational health, immunology, engineering, medical anthropology, geomorphology, law and more. A strong emphasis will be placed on involving early career researchers and students from a range of ODA countries to equip them with the knowledge and skills to deal with challenging real-world problems. 3. TO INCREASE COMMUNITY AND REGULATORY AWARENESS OF MINE DUST RELATED HEALTH RISKS AND MITIGATION MEASURES TO DEVISE LOW-COST SOLUTIONS WHICH WILL MAKE PREVIOUSLY VOICELESS COMMUNITIES PART OF THE PROBLEM-SOLVING TEAM. Communities close to mines may not be aware of the grave health risks caused by inhaling fine dust particles, ingesting contaminated soils or dermal contact with mine dust. They also may feel they have no recourse to address their living conditions. Giving communities a voice, and similarly informing regulators of the risks and mitigation opportunities open to them will result in practical and enforceable regulations accepted by all stakeholders. The network forum will be open to members of community organisations, regulatory bodies and government organisations, and part of this objective will be to work together to devise low-cost solutions, including developing the evidence they need to translate research into policy. Such evidence will include establishing the burden of disease potentially linked to dust-exposures and the syndemic risk factors that contribute to them. 4. TO EXPAND THE NETWORK&apos;S SPHERE OF INFLUENCE AND ATTRACT FURTHER FUNDING BY INCREASING THE NETWORK MEMBERSHIP AND CONNECTING WITH OTHER RELEVANT NETWORKS AND GCRF CHALLENGE LEADERS. Our vision is for this network to eventually become a global hub of activity focussed on knowledge exchange, capacity-sharing and co-development of integrated solutions. During the funding period we will seek to grow the network by expanding membership to institutions and organisations to other ODA countries, forming partnerships with other networks and forums across the globe, and engaging with GCRF Challenge leaders. We aim to maximise impact by leveraging further funding opportunities to ultimately make this a truly global engagement network.</narrative>
