   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Syrian Civil War has created one of the worst humanitarian crises in history. Around 5 million Syrians have fled their country to escape the prolonged horror and violence of the conflict and more than one million of them are in Lebanon. Over 4000 refugees cross into Lebanon on a daily basis, overwhelming its already fragile social, political, and economic infrastructure. On reaching Lebanon, new troubles confront the Syrian refugees who must now endure the suffering and hardships of the temporary camps.   This refugee movement has put a huge strain on the resources and capacity of the Lebanese government and local communities. The Lebanese health system has seen a massive influx of additional demand and is struggling to cope. One particular aspect of the problem is the suffering of older refugees. Often at the bottom of the pecking order, the needs of older refugees are frequently neglected, unrecognised or ignored. Yet about a half of these older people are known to have chronic health problems and are at risk of dying through lack of access to healthcare. Others have advanced disease and require palliative treatments to manage pain and other symptoms.  Very little is known about how these treatment and end of life care needs are being addressed. Although some palliative care services exist in Lebanon they have limited resources and lack the capacity to deal with the level of need in the refugee camps. Yet palliative care availability and access have been acknowledged as fundamental human rights.  The main purposes of the project are therefore: 1) to strengthen research capacity to investigate end of life care issues and needs among refugees 2) to enhance related cooperation and coordination between researchers in Lebanon and the UK in order to build capacity for high quality new studies and interventions that can address these problems.  To foster such a network, the project will bring together a mixture of expertise in special workshops focussed on end of life care for refugees in Lebanon. It will conduct a rapid appraisal of the issues and look at ways to develop research responses. It will provide mentoring and training to local researchers from international experts in order to build expertise and capacity.  It will also lead to a short film on the issue to raise awareness and sensitize others to the issue.  By these means the network will contribute to the development of research, policies and plans to promote end of life care for Syrian refugees in Lebanon. The lessons learned will in turn be relevant to other similar humanitarian emergencies elsewhere.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="This proposed Lebanese and UK strategic network will create a unique framework for promoting research on culturally relevant end of life care among refugees in the region most affected by the refugee crisis, with a particular focus on the needs of older people. It will help to stabilize and promote development of a neglected area in this much-challenged context. The project will also contribute to the development of research, policies and plans to promote end of life care in other similar humanitarian emergencies.   The thematic focus of the proposed strategic network is to explore refugee camps as a space where emotion, belief, culture, society and the state intersect in the context of end of life issues.   The practical objectives of the project are:   1) to strengthen capacity in interdisciplinary research on death, dying and end of life care among refugees.  2) to enhance networking, cooperation, and coordination between academic and non-academic stakeholders  in Lebanon and the UK on this topic in order to build capacity for high quality new studies and interventions in this area.   The specific actions of the network will include: a. Two workshops on interdisciplinary research and intervention possibilities relating to end of life care for refugees, resulting in a new and innovative research proposal and intervention plan.  b. A mapping exercise to identify opportunities, challenges, known best practice and barriers to the provision of end of life care of refugees, using existing academic and non-academic  sources.  c. Mentoring of two Lebanese researchers on end of life research issues, methods and practice.   d. Production of a short film on end of life issues among refugees,  for sensitizing relevant stakeholders e. Creation of a website on &apos;End of Life Care for Refugees&apos; as a forum for ongoing academic and public exchange  f. Organising public engagement activities on end of life issue among refugees.  The proposed network will bring together an outstanding interdisciplinary team from Lebanon and the UK and from a variety of institutions, linked to an existing and highly relevant Wellcome Trust Investigator Award. The Wellcome Trust funded project is titled &apos;Global Interventions at the End of Life&apos;, which aims to generate new theoretical propositions and empirical knowledge that will lead to more sustainable and appropriate end-of-life interventions across cultures and settings (http://www.glasgow.ac.uk/endoflifestudies/)."></capital-spend>
