   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a long term condition where the body doesn&apos;t manage its blood sugars (glucose) properly. This can result in the levels of glucose in the blood being quite high. If the body is exposed to high levels of glucose in the blood for long periods of time it can injure the vascular system - both the large and the delicate blood vessels in the body. This can lead to a number of complications such as blindness, kidney damage, damage to the nerves and heart attacks. It is really important when someone is diagnosed with T2D they are supported and taught how to manage their condition to prevent these complications. Globally, the number of people with T2D is increasing with approximately 415 million people currently living with this condition. Eighty percent of people who have T2D live in low-to-middle income countries. LMICs do not have the financial resources, or infrastructure to effectively manage this increasing patient population specifically as they are already stretched dealing with the infectious diseases that are common in these countries i.e. HIV, TB. Therefore, there is great need for inexpensive but effective treatment options for patients.   Patients with diabetes manage their condition on a daily basis themselves. International experts state that patients with diabetes should be taught how to do this; structured education programmes (SEPs) equip people with diabetes with self-management skills. SEPs have been shown to improve diabetes related outcomes in patients, such as blood glucose and wellbeing. An educated and empowered patient can work more effectively with their doctor to improve and maintain better control of their condition. SEPs are usually delivered to groups of patients in the community by trained non-medical educators and thus are a relatively inexpensive &apos;therapy&apos;. In the UK researchers have developed and tested a SEP called DESMOND which has been shown to improve well-being, adherence to medication, and weight loss amongst other positive outcomes. DESMOND and is currently delivered in over 100 sites in the UK and is also used in in Southern Ireland, Australia and Qatar. To date no SEPs for diabetes have been tested in LMICs. Therefore, this provides a great opportunity to take a diabetes SEP that is proven to be effective and is widely attended in one country and transfer it to another.   The UK research team in collaboration with clinicians and academics from South Africa, Mozambique and Malawi propose to culturally adapt and translate (linguistic adaptation) the DESMOND programme for use in two LMICs - Mozambique and Malawi. The collaborative will then test the feasibility of the adapted SEP in both locations. Data will be collected on the number of people that are invited, respond to invitation, the number that attended the programme, their diabetes control (using point-of-care-testing), blood pressure and their opinion and experience of the programme. Collectively, this information will be used to help us design a formal study after the end of this programme of work. An SEP adaptation tool-kit (detailed instructions) will be developed so that other organisations can take SEPs that work in one country and adapt it for themselves. An implementation model will also be developed again allowing other organisations/health services to implement - that is make SEPs available on a large and sustainable scale.  Both of these will be freely available for the public. To ensure the success of this work we will work closely with the local diabetes associations, we will train local healthcare professionals and people from the local community to deliver the education which means that they can continue to do so well after the end of this study.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="The EXTEND Study (EXTending availability of self-management structured EducatioN programmes for people with type 2 Diabetes in low-to-middle income countries) is a 27 month collaborative programme of work with Mozambique and Malawi in addition to expertise lent from colleagues in South Africa and Switzerland. We propose to bridge the gap between evidence based structured education programme availability in Low-to-middle income countries through the following objectives;   1.Adapt an evidence-based effective and cost-effective T2D self-management SEP (DESMOND) for Mozambique and Malawi 2.Train and up-skill healthcare professionals and lay community members to deliver the SEP, thereby activating local communities 3.Develop implementation infrastructure, e.g. referral system 4.Develop toolkits detailing the processes for adapting SEPs including case studies of the work conducted in Mozambique and Malawi 5.Conduct two feasibility studies, including explorations of organisational-level barriers/enablers, to inform future evaluation(s) and implementation of adapted SEPs 6.Develop a model for the implementation of SEPs in LMIC 7.Design formal evaluation(s) for future funding applications"></capital-spend>
