   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Sustaining Ethno-Cultural Significance of Products through Urban Ecologies of Creative Practice</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">By drawing on experiences from the traditions and cultural heritage of China and the UK, and through knowledge exchange, this project examines the challenges and opportunities for sustaining designs and products of ethno-cultural significance through the creation of urban ecologies of creative practice in major Chinese cities. It will result in a joint authored report that includes: Urban Ecologies of Creative Practice: A framework for understanding the current condition and future potential, socially and economically, of culturally significant designs, products and practices in Chinese cities. This will be of interest to those in government and business sectors related primarily to The Creative Industries, with strong associated links to the themes of Humanities Contributing to Development and Urban Transformations. The project will develop a common understanding that recognises:  a. different qualities and stages of sustainment of culturally significant designs, products and practices in China and the UK; b. related rural-urban contexts, between the two countries and c. from the above, investigate commonalities, differences and opportunities for mutual learning and research development in relation to culturally significant designs, products and practices - leading to a framework defining key characteristics, strengths, weaknesses, benefits and obstacles, and future potential and opportunities for culturally significant designs and products within Urban Ecologies of Creative Practice in Chinese cities.  While there are more and more re-examinations of the quality of Chinese cities after their rapid expansions in recent years, this urban development can lead to a transition from hard power (politics, law) to soft power (culture, economy). The rich ethnic cultures in China, especially those migrating from rural areas into cities, are set to reshape the soft power, which has the potential to promote the sustainable development of cities and ethnic cultures. This research aims at how to understand and carry forward ethnic cultures in the transformation of Chinese cities through studying creative designs, products and services.  This research will be conducted in China and the UK. The project includes 6 visits - 3 by China researchers to the UK in Autumn 2016, 2017, 2018 and 3 by UK researchers to China in Spring 2016, 2017 and 2018. Each will include site visits and workshops. The latter two (one in UK, one in China) include extended workshops to develop the framework and the final workshop includes Creative Industries representatives from the private sector and government.  These visits will each result in a Summary Report and contribution to a joint website Gallery and Blog Series. In addition, joint summary reports will be produced documenting the emergent understandings of the relevance and role of the internet and digital space in the future directions of culturally significant designs, products and practices. Emerging understandings, insights and conclusions will inform the creation and successive refinements of the Framework. A summary report and Gallery contributions will document the outcomes and insights drawn from the International Studios with students.  The final project report will provide an overview of the project, the finalised framework, as well as project outcomes, conclusions, and identification for future joint research themes and opportunities.  ODA Compliance: Ethno-Cultural products and practices have a strong relationship to the notions of &apos;good work&apos; and employment thus to economic development and growth. This research will contribute to education and knowledge development, among researchers, the students, and private sector and government participants. Wider dissemination of findings through various publications will inform future research directions related to the creative industries, humanities contributing to development and urban transformations.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The overarching aim of the project is to develop an understanding of the ethno-cultural significance of products through urban ecologies of creative practice in China and the UK. This research, which will focus on the call theme of Creative Industries will be achieved through the following joint and country-specific objectives:  Joint Objectives:  - Knowledge Exchange: To provide innovative knowledge exchange mechanisms between the UK and China for understanding the cultural significance of products through urban ecologies of creative practice. - Framework: To develop a framework for understanding the current condition and future potential, socially and economically, of culturally significant designs and products in relation to urban ecologies of creative practice and to examine the benefits and potential deficits (re: ethno-cultural meanings; business viability; mutual support etc.) of such designs, products and practices existing within urban ecologies of creative practice. - Long Term Collaboration: To determine the long term affordances offered by institutional collaboration in researching the viability and future directions of culturally related creative industries both in the UK and China including the potential offered by digital technologies.  In addition, this project presents an exceptional opportunity to introduce graduate students to culturally significant designs, products and practices in a context well-positioned for international collaboration and learning, the project therefore includes:  - International Creative Labs: Two international practice-based projects will be conducted during the course of this study adopting an interdisciplinary, design-led research process. Students in China and the UK will conduct projects around common themes related to culturally significant designs, products and practices. The projects will have individual and international collaborative components and the work will be presented via a common website.  Objectives in China: Through site visits in Shanghai and Beijing:  - To determine key characteristics of selected ethnic traditional designs, products and practices that are considered to be of significance in the urban transformation of China today in terms of their ethno-cultural meanings and heritage; these may relate to design and aesthetics, materials, skills and processes etc. Site visits include two sites in Beijing and one site in Shanghai plus visits to craft enterprises in the Greater Shanghai area. - To conduct an examination of how the above designs, products and practices are being sustained in China today, especially in the context of the new urban ecologies of creative practice; and to understand how they are affected and become adapted in their transition from rural to urban, and in their responses to new opportunities and markets. Site visits include the 798 Art Zone in Beijing, and the Tianzifang Arts District in Shang Hai.  Objectives in UK: Through site visits to a variety of distributed locations:  - To conduct an examination of selected examples of well-established Industrial Heritage and Contemporary Production sites that illustrate the successful sustainment of culturally significant designs, products and practices within the UK context and international contexts. - To conduct an examination of selected examples of established Cultural Heritage and Contemporary Arts and Crafts sites that offer excellent examples of the successful sustainment of culturally significant design, products and practices.</narrative>
