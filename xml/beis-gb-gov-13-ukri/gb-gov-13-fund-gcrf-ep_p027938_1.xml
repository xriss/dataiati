   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Ultra-low-cost endoscopy for gastric cancer screening in rural China</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The overall goal of this research is the early detection of gastroesophageal cancer in rural areas of China, where this disease has a very high incidence and mortality rate, through the development of an ultra-low-cost endoscopy system (target cost &#xA3;2 per use) that will facilitate diagnostic screening in low resource settings, including remote/rural villages. With this grant, we will be able to optimise the design of our platform, develop new capabilities and run pre-clinical field validation. The project will lead to critical pilot data that will support regulatory approval for clinical trials and establish a self-sustainable initiative for gastroesophageal cancer screening in rural China. Nearly 40% of new cases of gastroesophageal cancer worldwide are concentrated in China, accounting for more than 1.1 million new cases and more than 870,000 deaths only in 2015. While the incidence of gastroesophageal cancer is about double in rural areas when compared to urban centres, the mortality rate is almost three times higher. Screening programmes have been shown to be effective in reducing the mortality rate through early detection, but are expensive and difficult to implement in low-resource settings and rural areas. We have recently developed a disposable, soft-tethered, swallowable, endoscopic capsule to enable cost effective gastroesophageal cancer screening in low-resource settings. Design innovations include water-jet actuation, a portable platform (airline carry-on size, 10kg), and disposable components. Pressurized water is ejected from the capsule to orient the endoscopic camera view. After completion of a procedure, the capsule&apos;s outer shell and soft tether are discarded, while the endoscopic camera unit is reclaimed without need for reprocessing.  While preliminary results are encouraging, several limitations still need to be addressed before we can move on to clinical trials. In particular: (a) the time to perform a screening procedure is about double of what required by standard endoscopy; (b) a trained gastroenterologist is required to drive the capsule with a joystick and to identify suspicious lesions; (c) extensive comparative trials against standard endoscopy and in-field tests in rural areas of China must be performed.  With this grant, we plan to test the hypothesis that the clinical diagnostic capabilities of an optimized version of our platform are comparable to standard gastroscopy, while the reliability, usability, and portability for rural settings are markedly improved and cost is lowered. Three main technical objectives will be pursued: (1) advance the platform design to enhance capsule mobility; (2) achieve stable positioning of the capsule in key areas of the stomach by implementing robotic autonomous control; (3) develop the imaging and vision capabilities for the capsule for mapping the 3D geometry of the environment, visual servoing, automatic lesion recognition and classification. Technical advancements will be integrated in a compact, portable, and robust platform that will be assessed in a three-tier framework: (a) engineering lab; (b) Thiel-embalmed human cadavers; (c) using mannequin models in the rural settings of Hebei province, China.  As we anticipate a number of design issues to arise during the field evaluation, we plan two design and assessment iterations. This will allow us to incorporate design improvements in the final version of the platform and acquire substantial experimental evidence.   Similar to other medical devices, regulatory approval is among the most important milestones to achieve clinical impact. A thorough risk analysis will be performed on both design iterations and the documentation required to pursue regulatory approval of investigational use in humans will be prepared. This methodology and the pre-clinical data recorded from the double three-tier assessment will speed up the transition clinical trials, should the proposed study be successful.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">We propose to optimise, assess, and validate a novel portable platform designed to enable ultra-low-cost gastroesophageal cancer screening in remote settings, with a focus on rural and underdeveloped areas of China where this disease has a very high incidence and mortality. Gastric cancer and oesophageal cancers have the highest global mortality rates among other forms of cancer. More than one third of new cases worldwide are concentrated in China. Only in 2015, more than one million people were diagnosed with this form of cancer in China and more than 870,000 have died because from the morbidity. Screening programmes have been shown to be extremely effective in reducing the mortality rate through early detection, but are expensive and difficult to implement in low-resource settings and rural areas. This is particularly relevant in China, where inequitable distribution of medical resources to urban areas (which contain 30% of the population but receive 70% of the medical resources), shortage of doctors in rural regions and greater distance to access them translate into a very large cancer survival divide. While incidence of gastric and oesophageal cancers is about double in rural areas when compared to urban centres, the mortality rate is about three times higher.  In order to reduce the larger proportion of patients diagnosed with cancer at a later stage in rural and underdeveloped areas in China, there is a pressing need to develop cost-efficient and sustainable technologies for endoscopic gastric and oesophageal cancer screening, which are the focus of this project. Leveraging our pioneering work in the field of robotic capsule endoscopes, our team has developed a novel disposable, soft-tethered, swallowable, endoscopic capsule, with the aim of enabling cost effective gastroesophageal cancer screening in rural areas of low- and middle-income countries. Design innovations include water-jet actuation for mobility and visualization, a portable platform, and disposable components. After each procedure, the capsule outer shell and soft tether are discarded, while the endoscopic camera is reclaimed without reprocessing. The miniature tethered &quot;pill camera&quot; facilitates a comfortable unsedated cancer screening exam (target cost per procedure &#xA3;2 and capital cost ca. &#xA3;400 vs &#xA3;80,000 for existing technology). The proposed platform is designed to fit in a single suitcase (airline carry-on size, 10kg).  Building upon our preliminary results, with this study we will test the hypothesis that the clinical diagnostic capabilities of our platform are comparable to standard gastroscopy, while the reliability, usability, and portability for rural settings are significantly improved. We will pursue this goal by (1) improving the range of motion of our endoscopic capsule, (2) optimizing the controllability and the stability of the capsule, (3) using the images acquired by the on-board camera to guide autonomous exploration and detection of lesions, (4) benchmarking the proposed technology with standard gastroscopy in multiple validation scenarios, spanning from laboratory testing to pre-clinical field trials in the rural setting of Hebei province, China, (5) assembling the required pre-clinical documentation to initiate clinical trials.  Our long-term goal is to develop a gastroesophageal cancer screening programme for rural China, which builds upon the technology and the experimental evidence originating from this proposal. We aim for our research to become a platform for establishing a feasible model for upper gastrointestinal cancer screening at an ultra-low cost that can be implemented in rural and poorly resourced areas. The approach can be extended to other low- and middle-income countries (nearly 70% of gastric and oesophageal cancer cases are concentrated in these areas) or equally to modern healthcare systems, where cost savings maybe achieved through performing screening in day care units.</narrative>
