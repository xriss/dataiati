   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Optimising decentralised low-cost wastewater infrastructure by managing the microbes</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Here we argue that decentralised and point of use water infrastructure and technologies are fundamental in delivering health and economic sustainability in rapidly growing cities of the Global South. Further we advocate that research on decentralisation with developing world partners has the potential to catalyse radical change in unsustainable centralised western practices and thus will be mutually beneficial. There has been significant investment by charities and government agencies in developing novel wastewater treatment technologies and many are now close to market readiness. The Asian Institute of Technology in Thailand are piloting a suite of novel market-driven decentralised biological wastewater treatment technologies that were developed with Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation funding. The technologies work but their performance is variable. There is evidence that this is caused by variability in the microbial populations at the heart of the technologies, which are poorly understood. We will work with AIT to characterise and optimise the structure and function of the microbial treatment communities. The aim will be to mitigate the risk of failure by refining the AIT designs and offering rapid low-tech remediation strategies that can be deployed by customers should failures occur.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Our aim is to enhance the design, reliability and, ultimately the marketability, of the Asian Institute of Technology (AIT) cess-to-fit system and the solar septic tank. This will be achieved through the following 6 objectives: 1. An ecological survey of 30 full-scale systems that are installed and operated in Thailand will be conducted to determine the characteristics of a well-functioning microbial community and enable correlation of microbial community composition with operational factors. 2. The ecological survey data will be used to contrast that collected during systematic perturbation of full-scale systems operating on the AIT campus to determine the limits of operation and nature of failure in the microbial communities and to enable identification of biological predictors of failure in the system. 3. Pilot-scale trials and failure testing of AIT technologies to determine applicability in the Global North context working at test sites in Scotland identified by industrial partners Scottish Water.  4. Deploying the WASTEBOT to systematically search for a mix of micro-nutrients that will enhance the metabolism of the microbial treatment community and that might be intermittently flushed into the system to promote degradation or applied to mitigate failure in the field. 5. Deploying the WASTEBOT to search for the best mix of inocula to seed a new installation or to remediate a poorly performing one. Delivery of seed sludge might form part of the services provided by the Sanitizer truck.  6. Developing a novel low-cost paper-based pathogen detection kit that can be used for routine monitoring of the treatment process of the technologies in the field and feed data into public health and epidemiological studies on the effectiveness of decentralized wastewater treatment technologies.</narrative>
