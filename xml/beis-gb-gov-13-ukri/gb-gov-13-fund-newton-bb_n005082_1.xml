   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Rapidly growing demand for seafood products for domestic and export markets is driving intensification of aquaculture sectors dominated by small-holders in much of Asia. Ensuring effective health management has become the single most important challenge for sustainable intensification of the smallholder sector just as restrictions on antibiotic use are being imposed. Farmers are increasingly dependent on a proliferating range of prophylactic products (including pre and probiotics), often of uncertain provenance &amp; efficacy. Furthermore, the emergent markets for these products lack appropriate regulatory frameworks and the economic burden of unjustified claims is likely to fall most heavily on small-holders. An independent cost-benefit assessment of the efficacy, costs and benefits of such products is urgently required. Working across a range of major commodity farmed species and system types, the project will also assess the potential for novel low-cost alternatives to contribute to improved animal health and profitability of intensified smallholder operations.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="Declining capture fisheries and growing domestic and international demand for seafood is driving intensification of smallholder aquaculture throughout much of Asia. In Bangladesh and many Indian States, aquaculture is the fastest growing food production sector. Nearly 3/4 of rural households in Bangladesh engage in some form of aquaculture production. There is a need to optimise returns from small production units although intensification brings serious health management challenges for smallholders with limited diagnostic capacity. Antibiotic use for disease control and growth promotion is increasingly constrained by spread of antimicrobial resistant pathogens and export bans if antibiotic residues contaminate the products. Consequently small-scale producers resort to prophylactic treatments, including   probiotics or live microbial feed supplements that beneficially affect the host by improving the intestinal microbial balance. However many are of uncertain provenance and efficacy as few have been subject to large-scale random controlled trials (RCT) and there is poor regulation of the quality, efficacy, and marketing of these agents. Their use further raises environmental, animal and consumer health and safety concerns.   This project will perform an independent cost-benefit assessment of the efficacy of prophylactic health products (PHPs) that are currently in use in pond aquaculture systems for a range of important commodity fish and shrimp species. It will also assess the potential for novel low-cost alternatives to contribute to improved animal health and profitability of intensified smallholder operations. It will achieve this by rigorously assessing the costs and benefits of commercial and/or novel PHPs for small-scale intensive farmers under laboratory and on-farm conditions. Results gained will improve farmer profitability through health management advice and improved regulation of PHPs.     Specifically the project aims to (a) assess the efficacy of major commercial PHPs and high-potential novel PHPs under laboratory and on-farm conditions; (b) assess costs and benefits of commercial/ novel PHPs for small-scale intensive farmers; and (c) improve farmer profitability through health management advice and improved regulation of PHPs."></capital-spend>
