   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Genomics-led improvement of biotic and abiotic stress tolerance in mustard rape for economic and environmental sustainability</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed research is a Newton-Bhabha development programme. The overall aim is to transfer and optimize UK expertise in genomics, which is the scientific approach involving analysis in parallel of the complete set of genes of an organism, for improvement of both economic and environmental sustainability of mustard rape (Brassica juncea) in India.   The crop characteristics (traits) that are the focus of the research were defined by the Indian partners in the proposal as the most important challenges faced by the crop in India. There are tolerances to the range of environmental challenges (stresses): diseases and infestations from fungi (causing white rust, stem rot, black spot), viruses (Turnip mosaic virus), pests (aphids and butterflies) and root parasites (broomrape) and conditions of high temperatures, drought and salinity. Of particular importance is that multiple stresses are often encountered simultaneously and interactions and trade-offs between tolerance mechanisms can be expected, necessitating an integrated approach across this broad range of challenges. Included in a broad correlation analysis between the traits will be an assessment of associations with variation in classes of chemicals produced by the plants that are recognised as playing roles in tolerance to environmental stresses. To enable this programme to be undertaken thoroughly and successfully, we have assembled a consortium comprising 39 co-applicant scientists representing 17 institutions.    The approach is to establish a toolkit of technologies to help understand the basis of naturally-occurring tolerances and to enable future work to enhance them.  These include the establishment of a platform enabling the association of trait variation in panels of genetically diverse mustard rape varieties with variation of both gene sequences and gene activity (expression) to enable the development of molecular markers to accelerate breeding and identify candidate causative genes for further investigation. Non-GM approaches for improvement beyond the range of existing natural variation will be established for mustard rape, including modernised resources for the traditional approaches of radiation breeding and wide crossing with related species, and the emerging technology of genome editing.  Underpinning the programme is the experience gained in developing the Brassica juncea genomic platform currently used by the University of York and University of Delhi South Campus as part of their current Crop Genomics and Technologies (CGAT) project &quot;Broadening the genetic diversity underpinning seed quality and yield related traits in mustard rape and oilseed rape&quot; will be updated to incorporate emerging genome sequences from B. juncea and its progenitor species.  The platform will be used to support the trait-focussed activities of the consortium, modelled on the University of York-led &quot;BBSRC Renewable Industrial Products from rapeseed (RIPR) programme&quot;. A particular feature will be the highly integrated nature of the research with expertise contributed by world-leaders in the respective components being shared. UK expertise will be transferred to partners in India for application in mustard rape. The benefits of scientific understanding and ability to improve traits in mustard rape accrue primarily to the Indian members of the consortium.  However, they will also be of use for improving the corresponding traits in oilseed rape for cultivation in the UK.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">We address Overseas Development Assistance (ODA) objectives to (a) build a research and innovation partnership to support economic development and welfare in India and (b) develop in-country research and innovation capacity for long-term sustainable growth. As the largest oil crop in India, mustard rape has the greatest potential to increase vegetable oil production overall, so is the logical focus crop. It fits well in crop rotations systems and has well-established supply chains from breeders to consumers. Losses from biotic and abiotic stresses can be total. Small-scale farmers have limited resources to invest in crop protection, making genetic improvement an attractive approach.    In addition to genomics and bioinformatics, we aim to mobilise UK expertise in the target traits to help address the scientific and crop improvement problems.  An important aim is to provide training to support transfer of technology and expertise to enable implementation in India. Major features will be staff exchanges (particularly staff from India learning technology in the UK by undertaking research under the supervision of the UK Co-Investigators and their research groups), collaboration and free exchange of data.  We aim to apply to mustard rape cutting-edge genomic approaches first developed for oilseed rape in order to underpin improved productivity, sustainability and profitability. The programme exploits emerging draft genome sequences, adapting and applying to mustard rape (B. juncea) the latest genomic and bioinformatics approaches developed in the UK for oilseed rape (B. napus).  For the first time, these are applied by a broad consortium of Indian experts, supported by the corresponding UK experts, to challenges facing commercial production. Specifically, we aim to:  1. Establish an updated Associative Transcriptomics platform for B. juncea. 2. Establish a genome re-sequenced B. juncea radiation panel platform. 3. Establish CRISPR-Cas9 technology in B. juncea. 4. Establish transcriptome re-sequenced resources for B. juncea introgression lines. 5. Establish a molecular cytogenetic toolkit to support trait introgression into B. juncea. 6. Establish a profile resource for key stress-relevant metabolites in B. juncea. 7. Understand the genetic and molecular basis of white rust tolerance. 8. Understand the genetic and molecular basis of stem rot tolerance. 9. Understand the genetic and molecular basis of black spot tolerance. 10. Understand the genetic and molecular basis of extreme virus resistance. 11. Understand the genetic and molecular basis of aphid and butterfly tolerance. 12. Understand the genetic and molecular basis of Brassica-broomrape interaction. 13. Understand the genetic and molecular basis of temperature and drought tolerance. 14. Understand the genetic and molecular basis of salinity tolerance. 15. Ensure effective data management to support pre-breeding. 16. Ensure effective knowledge transfer. 17. Ensure effective project management.  The research will be conducted via a set of work packages (WPs), each addressing a specific aim.  WPs 1 to 6 result in the establishment of technology platforms for mustard rape, WPs 7 to 14 aim to undertake focused research and draw upon the technology platforms to identify the genetic and molecular bases of stress trait tolerance, WPs 15 and 16 aim to empower the development and adoption of improved cultivars based on the research and WP17 addresses project management.   One of our focus traits, drought tolerance, has also been identified as a key trait for improvement in pulse crops and will be addressed in the Newton-Bhabha PORI project &quot;Drought Resilience in Indian Pulse Crops&quot;, with which we have a common partner (University of Essex). We have coordinated the development of our proposals, adjusting their scope to make both affordable within the financial constraints of the call. If both proposals are funded we will coordinate activities where appropriate.</narrative>
