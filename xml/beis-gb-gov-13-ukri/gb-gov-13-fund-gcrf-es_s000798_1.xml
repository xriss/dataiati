  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The threefold aims of this research are to (a) develop an innovative Mediation Model for Sustainable Infrastructure Development (MMSID) that builds on praxis from Mongolia&apos;s mining sector and is scalable and replicable across Chinese &apos;One Belt-One Road&apos; (OBOR) infrastructure projects in Central Asia and beyond; (b) to address the challenge of building relationships of trust, cooperation and transparency between key stakeholders in infrastructure development projects;  and (c) to enhance the capacity of communities and government to maximize economic advantages and minimize negative impacts of major infrastructure projects. With our international Co-Investigators these aims will be addressed in Mongolia, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan through the following objectives:   i. To conduct original field research in Mongolia&apos;s South Gobi in order to assess the successes and limitations of the Tri-partite Committee (TPC) approach to dispute resolution at the Oyu Tolgoi mine. This research will examine how the TPC was instituted and organized, and map who the participants were, what the needs, interests and requirements of various stakeholders in TPC were and what additional stakeholders (e.g. national government) would strengthen management ii. To compare this primary data with baseline data collected by the Co-I and PDRA in 2016-17 to determine to what extend the goals of the TPC have been realized, and how this approach might be developed into a replicable model. iii. To conduct original fieldwork with in-country research partners in 5 additional fieldsites of major Chinese-backed infrastructure projects (1 in Mongolia, 2 in Kyrgyzstan and 2 in Tajikistan) in order to scope challenges and existing barriers to cooperation between stakeholders. This will enable us to assess the nature of conflicts and challenges posed by major OBOR infrastructure projects in local settings in Mongolia, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, and which will be fed into the development of the MMSID.  iv. To facilitate cross-country learning with research and project partners to incorporate findings from these sites into a modified and scale-able version of the MMSID. v. To produce a handbook for training and facilitation of MMSID and mobile app version of the model to facilitate communication across stakeholders vi. To trial the applicability of MMSID at the 5 sites of major infrastructure development in Mongolia, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. This will be achieved by bringing TPC/Mongolian representatives to do simulation workshops at the trial sites vii. To work with user groups in Mongolia, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan (investors, government at various scale, local communities) to institutionalise MMSID through outreach and impact activities throughout and beyond the length of the project. These include interactive workshops, training events and materials, capacity building for in-country research organisations, NGOs and community groups, and knowledge exchange activities.  viii. To present outcomes of MMSID to stakeholders and diverse publics across the region and globally through academic journal articles, a research monograph, presentations at international academic conferences, an end-of-project in country conference and in-depth project reports and policy briefs translated into Mongolian and Russian.  Our 30-month project investigates how Chinese infrastructure investments transform societies, economies and landscapes in Central Asia. The project promotes inclusive economic welfare and builds a model to strengthen regional sustainable development.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project develops a dynamic Mediation Model for Sustainable Infrastructure Development (MMSID) to promote inclusive economic development and social welfare in the context of Chinese mega infrastructure initiatives in Mongolia, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. While large-scale infrastructure projects represent a key mechanism of economic growth and development, they also bring unintended and negative consequences to local populations and environments. These challenges can be compounded by specific regional contexts. This is the case in contemporary Asia where China&apos;s One Belt-One Road (OBOR), representing more than &#xA3;1 trillion in investments, is set to transform societies, economies and landscapes through infrastructure megaprojects. Opaqueness in Chinese procurement rights points to the potential for resource contestation between current rural users and state-driven contracts. This contrasts with standards established by international funders such as IFC, World Bank, ADB and OECD. The speed and scale of OBOR investments present particular social and environmental challenges to China&apos;s neighbouring states of Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia and Tajikistan. This includes project siting, use of scarce resources such as water, and land degradation. In addition, these states have limited capacity of national government agencies, weak governance institutions, historically poor inclusion of local populations in development processes, fragile, dryland and mountain environments and the prevalence of Sinophobia. These challenges result in the need to foster trust, transparency and cooperation between stakeholders to maintain social cohesion and ensure inclusive economic development. The need to find a new path which combines economic growth and investment with social inclusion is pressing for political stability in the region. In collaboration with our 2 international Co-Is based in Mongolia and Central Asia, our project addresses these needs by scaling up a pioneering dispute resolution model developed in Mongolia&apos;s mining sector. Based on this local participation and stakeholder engagement experience in Mongolia, the MMSID will be replicable, scalable and applicable to other contexts and countries anticipating large-scale investment in. Our MMSID builds upon research by the Co-I and PDRA in 2016-2017 on complaints mediated by the World Bank&apos;s Compliance Advisor Ombudsman in response to conflict over land and water appropriation and degradation at the $12 billion Oyu Tolgoi Mine. This process was led by a multi-stakeholder engagement initiative - Tri-Partite Committee (TPC) - which consisted of local pastoralists, local government and mine management. TPC&apos;s success shows great potential to scale up Mongolia&apos;s example into a replicable model in Central Asia, where there is a cultural and political affinity to Mongolia. The MMSID will be developed through a mixed-methods and participatory action approach. Appropriate methods, field sites and impact activities, have been chosen with research partners. Beneficiaries include: rural residents, local and national government, business stakeholders, international agencies, development practitioners, local and international academics. The project&apos;s 6 stages incorporate focused impact activities aimed to build long-term partnerships alongside capacity building and outputs. MMSID will be applied and disseminated through publications, knowledge exchanges, communication platforms, research uptake activities and extensive interactive trainings. The project advances understanding of infrastructure-induced transformations, encourages effective local business engagement and stresses capacity building for development of more inclusive and robust institutional, legal and regulatory frameworks. Our proposal benefits from ten months of scoping work in Central Asia which ensured research feasibility and co-design of research aims with in-country partners and will foster immediate, effective development of MMSID.</narrative>
