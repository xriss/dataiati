   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The objectives of the Development Award for the Education, Justice and Memory Network are to:   1. Support the development of sustainable and equitable partnerships in Pakistan  Feedback from our Expression of Interest application noted that partnerships across the EdJAM network are stronger in certain partner countries than in others. This is the case because of previous work in Cambodia, Colombia and Uganda thanks to the GW4 funded Transformative History Education project. Our Development Grant will support our Pakistan-based Co-I, Dr. Tania Saeed, to network and meet with civil society organisations, University and research colleagues, government organisations and others working to support teaching and learning about difficult histories and the violent past, strengthening the EdJAM network in Pakistan. These activities will also enable EdJAM to develop a network of researchers who may later be interested in and supported to apply for commissioned research under EdJAM.   2. Pilot work with a partner in Pakistan to identify and understand innovative practices for teaching and learning about the violent past  Objective 1 above, will enable the development of a strong partnership with a Pakistan-based civil society organisation with a creative and innovative idea for teaching and learning about the violent past that. Work towards Objective 2 will enable us to support that organisation to pilot their approach. This piloting enables another opportunity for proof of concept work around the areas of thematic interest for the EdJAM network - history education, heritage, and transitional justice and memory - where we have identified creative and innovative potential for learning towards SDG target 4.7.  3. Enable opportunities for the EdJAM team of Co-Investigators and partners to come together in Bristol and in Pakistan, with a focus on learning and coproduction around safeguarding and risk mitigation and management  EdJAM is an interdisciplinary, international network underpinned by the principles of codesign and collaboration. Our EoI application was developed collaboratively via email and skype communication and thanks to a whole meeting of nearly all Co-Is and partner organisations in Bristol in March 2019. This opportunity for face-to-face project development was hugely valuable. The Development Grant will enable further opportunities for the EdJAM network to come together, both in Pakistan (and the event described above) and in the UK, at a team meeting in summer 2019. We will focus the UK meeting on learning from one another and developing robust processes around safeguarding and risk mitigation and management, both important parts of the Stage 2 application and areas around which our civil society partners have expertise. We will work with colleagues at the University of Bristol (UoB) and with the services of an international safeguarding consultant to develop processes the EdJAM will follow and to share these more widely across GCRF funded work at the University. We will also spend a half day together, facilitated by the UoB&apos;s knowledge exchange team, developing our theory of change to underpin our pathways to impact.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed Education, Justice and Memory Network (EdJAM) comes together in order to contribute towards Sustainable Development Goal 4, which aims to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and to promote lifelong learning opportunities for all. A crucial part of SDG4 is its target 4.7, which specifies the kinds of skills, knowledge and attitudes that education should develop in all learners and includes knowledge and skills to promote a culture of peace and non-violence.  Current approaches to teaching about conflict and peace often fall short of meeting this challenge. Peace education often relies on generalised and universal approaches that fall flat for learners since they do not enable connections to past and present injustice or violence that affect daily lives. Formal history education is often a space where violence is perpetuated, for instance when it promotes exclusive group identities; silences cultures and experiences; or legitimises conflict and injustice. Curricula often limit opportunity for students to develop knowledge and understanding of the specific historical, cultural, political and economic roots of the conflicts and violence that affect them, much less the skills to transform these conflicts. Where spaces do exist, teachers often lack training, resources and skills to support dialogue and difficult conversations. Existing research tends to concentrate on textbooks and curricula, meaning there is limited evidence of effective teaching and learning processes in schools and other spaces where learners apprehend the past.  However, alternatives exist. Creative and innovative practices, pioneered by teachers, artists, community educators, museum curators, and young people themselves offer engaging ways to connect learning about difficult pasts with skills and commitment to realising better futures. EdJAM works to amplify, connect and share these approaches, drawing on the disciplines and practices of transitional justice, memory studies, history, heritage studies and feminism and working with leading civil society partners in Cambodia, Colombia, Pakistan and Uganda who are doing this pioneering work. This focus enables EdJAM to connect to other SDG challenges, particularly SDG 16 (just, peaceful and inclusive societies) and SDG 17 (global partnerships) and to ensure that learners in our focus countries have a chance to develop the skills and knowledge to build a culture of peace.  Our rationale for applying for a Development Award is to support the preparation of the strongest possible Stage 2 proposal for EdJAM. The Development Award : 1) responds to feedback from the Stage 1 application; 2) supports the development of sustainable and equitable partnerships and piloting innovative approaches in Pakistan, where our existing relationships are less developed than in Cambodia, Colombia and Uganda; and 3) enables opportunities for learning and the development processes for safeguarding and risk mitigation and management within EdJAM.</narrative>
