   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In my PhD research, I studied how different types of second language (L2) grammar input are processed. This involved measuring learners&apos; ability to pay attention to input in order to acquire a target grammatical construction in different input conditions and how working memory (WM) capacity influences this process. The findings showed that learners need a lot of teacher support in terms of directing their attention to the relevant aspects of input, for successful learning to take place. The findings also challenged the existing assumption that learners can develop their grammatical knowledge in an L2 without much support from the teacher. The results related to how WM capacity of learners influences input processing indicated that learners with high WM abilities are advantaged in processing input successfully.   These findings can be interpreted in relation to how learners with SpLDs, such as dyslexia learn additional languages. The existing research on SpLDs indicates that dyslexic learners have a lower WM capacity and thus they face difficulties in learning additional languages. The results of my study strengthen these findings since I observed that learners with high WM abilities are better able to process L2 input.   The aim of this project is to convey these findings to English language teachers through teacher trainers and thus make sustainable changes in English language teaching methodology at school level in Sri Lanka. The current English language teacher training programmes in Sri Lanka rarely raise teachers&apos; awareness of cutting-edge research in the field of L2 acquisition and the impact of SpLDs on language learning. Thus the training that the teacher trainers/teachers receive through this project will assist them to apply up-to-date grammar teaching methods as well as inclusive practices to help learners with SpLDs learn additional languages successfully.   The project will train ca. 100 English language teacher trainers in Sri Lanka who are based in 30 training centres and through them the project plans to disseminate my research findings to English language teachers throughout the country. The project will also raise awareness among school principals, policy planners and language testing body of the country of the importance of incorporating inclusive practices and up-to-date grammar teaching methodology in policy/curriculum design and high-stakes exams.</narrative>
