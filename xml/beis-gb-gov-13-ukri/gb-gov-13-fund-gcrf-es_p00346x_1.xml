   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Between 1990 and 2014, sub-Saharan Africa saw a 23% increase in the number of children experiencing stunting, with around 58 million children under 5 affected. Many of these children also experienced wasting, and the co-occurrence of these anthropometric deficits (&quot;multiple malnutrition&quot;, MM) entail heightened morbidity risks. At household and community level, MM can refer to the co-existence of under- and over-nutrition, a pattern observed across many low and middle income countries (LMICs), and which the 2015 and 2016 Global Nutrition Reports have noted to be &quot;the new normal&quot;.  This project focuses on MM in young children in one of the world&apos;s poorest regions, the countries of West and Central Africa (WCA).  Utilising data from existing household surveys from the 24 countries of WCA, the project will conduct quantitative analyses on anthropometric and demographic data and variables to explore the prevalence and patterning of MM. It will bring together individual and household level data from the surveys (DHS, MICS), and combine this information with macro-level indicators, of national governance, of public expenditure on health and nutrition, and of food prices, to examine the underlying, intermediate and basic causes of MM, as set out in UNICEF&apos;s conceptual framework on (mal)nutrition.  Malnutrition is associated with raised mortality risks, particularly in children; analysis of longitudinal survey data has shown that children experiencing multiple anthropometric deficits are 12.3 times more likely to die. Such children are likely to benefit most from nutrition and other child survival interventions (McDonald et al., 2013), as long as they can be indentified - which is not currently happening. Despite this, and the efforts and resources (national and international) which go to early child development programs in LMICs, a UNICEF/WHO/World Bank review of child malnutrition revealed that data on the prevalence and patterning of MM in young children are severely lacking, with no regional or global estimates of the number of children concurrently stunted and wasted. This knowledge gap is a real and ongoing problem for national governments and international agencies like UNICEF and the FAO. The analysis of existing household surveys, using advanced quantitative methods, will provide policy-relevant evidence on the determinants of MM for policy makers. We will also show how patterns of MM have changed over time, and identify key geographic and socio-demographic factors associated with MM.  The project focuses on children under 5 years of age, since this is a crucial period of physical development, and also because anthropometric data (heights, weights) on this age group are most reliable and routinely collected in national surveys. The WCA region has some of the world&apos;s poorest countries, many with high rates of child malnutrition. These countries also face on-going challenges of food security not least with respect to unstable food production in the context of increasing desertification, political and economic instability, and violent conflict (e.g. in northern Nigeria, Niger and Mali). WCA has excellent coverage in terms of the number of countries with existing survey data, all of which contain detailed, comparable data with which to investigate drivers of disparities in MM. Importatnly, the evidence generated by this project will aid assessment of progress towards the first three Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) - of ending poverty, hunger and reducing child mortality.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="Multiple malnutrition (MM) is now acknowledged as a serious threat to child survival and development, but reliable data on it are currently lacking. The aim of this project is to generate evidence of the prevalence and patterning of MM in young children (aged 0-5 years) in the 24 countries of West and Central Africa (WCA).   In doing so, this project will provide the first reliable and comparative evidence of MM in one of the world&apos;s poorest regions. It will do this by quantitative secondary analysis of existing household survey micro-data from nationally-representative surveys, including the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) and UNICEF&apos;s Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS).  UNICEF, the key UN agency charged with ensuring children&apos;s well-being, has expressed an interest in being the project partner.  It will work with the team at all stages of the project to identify data needs, and to co-produce analyses and outputs including working papers, country briefs, and academic papers.  These will support a key objective of the project, which is to generate useful and reliable information for governments and development organisations in the region to improve understanding of MM, to show how it presents in young children and is patterned across communities, and thus find more effective ways to tackle and prevent it.  Outputs produced will include country profiles detailing how the prevalence of MM in young children varies within countries, maps to show how disparities are patterned and a series of academic papers.  The project directly meets ODA requirements because: (i) analyses will use existing survey data from 24 countries on the DAC list of ODA recipients;  (ii) the WCA region contains some of the poorest countries in the world - 17 of the 24 states in the region are classed as &apos;least developed countries&apos;, 6 are lower middle income countries, and only 1 (Gabon) is an upper middle income country; and (iii) the issue of MM is recognised as a significant development challenge, since between 1990 and 2014 there was a 23% increase in the number of children in sub-Saharan Africa  experiencing stunting, with around 58 million children under 5 affected. A large proportion of these children also experienced wasting concurrently. The combination of poverty and malnutrition presents a clear developmental challenge, which this project will engage with directly, through the generating and provision of reliable, evidence.  The activities proposed  directly promote the welfare and development of children in the countries on the DAC list, through the provision of policy-relevant data on MM (which are currently lacking). Evidence and material generated by this project will enable researchers, governments and development organisations like UNICEF/UNDP/FAO to identify and track the issue of MM in some of the poorest countries of the world. Better information will inform the design of programmes and policies, which will result in more effective targeting of resources, such as maternal and child health and feeding programmes, subsidies for food, and school feeding programmes. The research team will run a workshop in the region, explaining the issue of MM, and showing local researchers and others how it can be identified, tracked and tackled early and thus prevent children&apos;s lives from being stunted more permanently. Given the associations between MM and poverty, this project tackles key issues raised by the Global Challenges initiative."></capital-spend>
