   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project builds on research and collaboration from the AHRC/PACCS/GCRF &apos;Art and Reconciliation: Conflict, Culture and Community&apos; project, specifically building on the original objectives: (a) to investigate the history and potential of artistic and creative cultural practices and objects in processes and outcomes of post-conflict reconciliation, forgetting, remembering and forgiving; and (b) to developing creative artistic practices and artifacts in relation to, and in collaboration with, particular communities. In particular, it will develop an innovative and creative partnership between the Post Conflict Research Center (PCRC), Sarajevo (Bosnia and Hercegovina) and the project investigators,  an innovative and creative conceptual and practical change in which the PCRC produced a new dissemination model, producing a pilot, bold, landmark publication - a magazine, ASBO - for the first time and gained a &apos;new life&apos;, an unanticipated yet highly successful result of the AHRC-PACCS project collaboration. This project will provide an opportunity to develop a more sustainable publication and dissemination model for the work of the youth correspondents by supporting the production and distribution of ASBO. ASBO has given a new strand of life to the PCRC&apos;s mission to foster visually-based cross-community activity and build youth capacity in the country, addressing the war of the 1990s and its aftermath. The proposed project will significantly enhance and embed this new aspect of the PCRC&apos;s role and life, sustaining employment, developing cultural life and fostering post-conflict peace and security. In doing so, it will address all three of the Additional Requirements for the AHRC Impact and Engagement GCRF Highlight Call, as follows: i) it will deliver significant cultural impact and research-led innovation, in line with UN Sustainable Development Goals&apos; (SDG) targets (SDG 4 on culture&apos;s contribution to sustainable development ; SDG 8 on job creation and also creativity and innovation; and SDG 11 on protecting and safeguarding cultural heritage; it might also contingently address SDG 12 on sustainable tourism, creating jobs and promoting local culture); (ii) it will produce outcomes of significant value to PCRC and the Balkan Diskurs Youth Correspondents Programme, including setting the foundation for a sustainable publication and dissemination strategy for their work (iii) the project has been co-designed with Velma Saric, Director of the PCRC, a peace-building organisation in an ODA LMIC country, which has no public funding.  The PCRC and the investigators will jointly implement a scheme of research and practice bringing a research-led fresh perspective. We will initiate a series of open calls for training and commissions to develop creative visual material through open studios, artist workshops and participatory-community engagement activities and events in partnership, inviting youth artists/photographers to innovate and create to bring new interpretations to in relation to the history of the country, potentially to be included in ASBO. This will offer young people and PCRC the opportunity and inspiration to make decisive creative interventions, and to enhance the cultural landscape of post-conflict Sarajevo and Bosnia and Hercegovina, fostering engagement with art and memory. The joint project will also permit further research and development of evaluation methods and approaches inherent in the original project, which will also benefit a range of funders, including UNDP, which also advised on project design.</narrative>
