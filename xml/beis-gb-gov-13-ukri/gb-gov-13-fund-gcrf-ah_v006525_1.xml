   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Supporting Just Response and Recovery to COVID-19 in Informal Urban Settlements: Perspectives from Youth Groups in Sub-Saharan Africa</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project works with Slum Dwellers International and its Youth Federation members in six Sub-Saharan African cities to understand the inequalities and injustices associated with COVID-19 and associated responses in informal settlements. This will inform a normative analysis of how such injustices might be addressed in immediate response planning, but also in ways that create resilience to future outbreaks as well as to other risks faced by the urban poor. The medium is a series of video-diaries informed by ethical analysis and co-designed and produced with youth groups in the cities. These will be the foundation for a series of briefs shared through SDI with local authorities, in a two-way exchange of knowledge with the youth groups which will also include the dissemination of health information to vulnerable population groups. Cross-learning between the cities is aimed both to capacitate the youth groups in peer-to-peer exchange, but also reveal underlying ethical issues associated with the pandemic and its responses that occur out of different histories of pre-existing structural injustice and attempts to remedy those.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">To understand the ethical and justice issues arising from the impact of Covid-19 and related control measures on vulnerable groups, particularly youth, in informal urban settlements in Sub-Saharan Africa.  To support the co-production of pandemic response plans between informal, urban communities and local authorities that take into account the ethical and justice issues at stake, and guide long-term recovery trajectories towards more equitable and inclusive resilience to multiple shocks and stressors.   To support youth representatives in advocacy to address injustices arising from COVID-19 and associated responses, and engage in the capacitation of youth groups in data collection, analysis and production.  To disseminate information about Covid-19 within informal settlements through engagement with Youth Federations.  To support a process of cross-learning between Youth Federations which supports a long-term comparative research programme as well as academic synthesis of wider relevance to international agencies and urban governance networks.</narrative>
