   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Identifying the health systems changes necessary to sustain and scale up the integration of mental health services into primary care in Lagos, Nigeria</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS  Mental and behavioural disorders account for about 14% of the global burden of disease (GBD) and nearly 20% of this burden is from sub-Saharan Africa (SSA).  When untreated, mental and behavioural disorders lead to severe disability causing enormous social and financial burden on families and the society .Despite the huge burden of mental health problems, about 85% of people with severe mental illness in SSA do not receive any form of treatment. Integrating mental health services into primary health care (PHC) has been advocated by the world health organisation (WHO) as the most viable means of closing the treatment gap in SSA. The WHO recently introduced the Mental Health Gap Action Programme (mhGAP) and its accompanying Intervention Guide, to guide the integration of mental health services into primary care in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs)    LAGOS STATE, NIGERIA CONTEXT:  Lagos State in Nigeria with about 20 million people  accounts for 10% of the total Nigeria population and were it to be a country will rank as the 20th most populous country in the Africa. To scale up mental health services, Lagos State set up the Mental Health Advisory Committee (MHAC) in 2012 to conduct a situation analysis, proffer solution and map out implementation plan to reduce the burden of mental illness in the state. The MHAC made efforts to strengthen the mental health system in the state with the adoption of task shifting policy, upgrading of the primary care facilities, creation of mental health desk in the Ministry of Health and launch of the state mental health policy. In 2013, the Mental Health in Primary Care (MeHPriC) project was initiated with pilot implementation in 10 PHCs. In 2017, there was adoption and further scale up of the project to 57 flagship PHCs and interventions for psychosis and epilepsy included.    STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM A recent review of efforts made to integrate mental health into primary care based on mhGAP in LMICs showed that  with the linear model of intervention development, efficacy testing and implementation, there has been problems with sustainability over time and in real world setting . In our Lagos MeHPriC project, there are already signs of lowering of benefits as the interventions moved into real world use (voltage drop) and deviation from manualized protocols (programme drift). As there are policy and ethical implications of developing effective heath programmes without sustainability and scale-up, an understanding of the factors and processes that influences sustainability and scale up of an evidence-based intervention is needed for proactive planning  A review of the dataset from current mental health focused projects in LMICs like MHaPP , Emerald and PRIME (showed that none had focussed on sustainability. A recent review of 41 studies across 26 countries in SSA suggest that community engagement, community resources and community mobilisation may have unique influences on sustainability [13]. But this study had not featured health system factors.  OVERALL AIM:  This feasibility study aims to identify the strategies to facilitate the health system changes necessary to sustain and scale up mental health services in primary care in Lagos, Nigeria.   SPECIFIC RESEARCH QUESTIONS TO BE ADDRESSED BY THE FOUNDATION GRANT  1) what is the state of implementation of the MeHPriC Project and what are the factors that are currently underlying its implementation?; 2) what are the dynamic interactions between the different components of the programme as regards contexts (inner and outer), implementation processes, implementation actors and intervention outputs and outcomes?;  3) how do these components influence the sustainability of how do these components influence the sustainability of the programme 4) what strategies may be required to facilitate the changes necessary for sustainability and scale-up</narrative>

In Phase 1, We will review policy documents and conduct in-depth interviews with selected policy makers to develop hypotheses, assess whether the target indicators for the project are met, identify how they are met, identify the key contextual facilitators and constraints and the way they affect the outcome.  2. In Phase 2, we will conduct a quantitative survey amongst the stakeholders including policy makers and administrators, programme managers, PHC health workers and recipients of care. They will complete scales to assess organisational readiness to change, sustainability and perceived intervention acceptability and feasibility  3. In Phase 3, we will conduct a brief evaluation of the implementation and through in-depth interviews, we will examine the stakeholders&apos; perception about the health systems constraints to delivering, scaling up and sustaining the intervention. We will also observe selected PHC facilities to enable us to understand the factors that act as facilitators or barriers to sustenance of the intervention delivery.  4. In Phase 4, we will conduct a Theory of Change (ToC) workshop that will draw mainly on the results from the analysis of the earlier phases in combination with scientific knowledge and programme experience to identify health system changes that will improve sustainability in the delivery of the intervention. 5. In Phase 5, we will analysis and present the project report to the funders and the stakeholders   RESEARCH IMPACT: 1. The individual care recipients will benefit from sustained level of evidence-based interventions leading to better outcomes and improved quality of life.  2. This study will enhance the health workers knowledge, motivation and attitude in providing effective mental health interventions in a sustainable way.  3. The programme implementers will be able to identify and include sustainability components to their design and implementation of complex interventions.  4. Evidence generated in this study will be shared with the WHO team to inform potential strategies for a sustainability and scalability of mental health interventions in LMICs.  5. The project will inform Policy makers on methods of sustaining beneficial interventions thereby maximizing the judicious use of funds</narrative>
