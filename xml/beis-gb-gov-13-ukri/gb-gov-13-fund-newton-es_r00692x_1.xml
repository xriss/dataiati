   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Ageing Well in Urban Environments: Developing Age Friendly Cities and Communities</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Population ageing and increasing urbanisation are two dominant societal trends of the 21st Century. By 2030 two-thirds of the global population will be living in cities and at least a quarter of those urban populations will be aged over 60. Developing urban environments that support and promote healthy living for older people has become a key driver of urban policy and interventions at a local and national level, resulting in planning design concepts and guidelines to support an ageing population. However, current urban planning and development models have overlooked how environments can support a sense of place, articulated through supports for active living, social participation and making a positive contribution to the community. Ageing successfully at home and in the community requires people are able to access &apos;assets and resources&apos; to support healthy ageing, e.g. transport, adequate housing, healthcare services, and leisure opportunities alongside social networks and opportunities for lifelong learning.  Responding to these challenges, this research intends to answer the following research questions: How do older adults experience ageing and sense of place across different urban, social and cultural contexts? In what ways can urban environments support the rights of older people to age in place? What would age-friendly cities and communities look like if they are to support the sense of place needs of older adults living across different urban and cultural contexts? In answering these questions, this research builds upon an existing ESRC Urban Transformations grant (ES/N013220/1) being undertaken exploring how sense of place is experienced by older adults living in 18 neighbourhoods (of varying densities and income levels) across six case study cities in the UK (Edinburgh, Manchester and Glasgow) and Brazil (Pelotas, Porto Alegre, and Brasilia). The aim of the proposed research is to expand transnational understandings of ageing in urban environments to three case study cities in India (Delhi, Calcutta, Hyderabad). This will offer a unique insight into how older adults experience ageing and place across diverse and transformative urban environments in India, providing opportunities for knowledge exchange, allowing for comparative analysis within and across case study cities in India, UK and Brazil, and identifying clear routes to policy and practice. We will use a range of methods to achieve the project aims including sense of place surveys and semi-structured interviews alongside experiential methods including &apos;go along&apos; walks, photo diaries and community mapping exercises to capture the place-based needs of older adults.  A community-based participatory approach will be adopted to the research, bringing together all stakeholders in a process of collaborative dialogue and co-design to challenge the hierarchical power relationships that exist when planning &apos;for&apos; and not &apos;with&apos; older people. The results will be used to co-create place-making tools and resources which are essential for designing age friendly environments for older adults in India that work across different cultural, social and welfare contexts. Findings will be disseminated to community, policymaker, practitioner and academic audiences through ongoing and end of project knowledge translation activities. Opportunities are built into the project design to allow for researchers from India, UK and Brasil to come together to exchange findings, share methodological insights and shape the research process.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project has four core aims:  (i) to investigate how sense of place is experienced by older people living in transformational urban environments in India; (ii) to translate these experiences into policy and practice guidelines and toolkits for age friendly cities and communities that support sense of place amongst older adults living in India; (iii) to compare and contrast the experiences of older adults ageing across transformational urban contexts in India, UK and Brazil to understand social and cultural interpretations of ageing; and (iv) to better articulate the involvement of older adults as active placemakers in policy and design processes by involving older adults at all stages of the research Addressing these aims, the project has the following interconnected objectives: Objective 1: to establish and compare how older adults from transformational urban contexts in India construct sense of place with a focus on identifying opportunities, challenges, facilitators and barriers to social participation, healthy living and being active and engaged in the community.  Objective 2: to translate the data obtained from objective 1 into sense of place maps and designs for age-friendly cities and communities in India. Mapping will provide a valuable visual representation of how a community values, understands and interacts with place and to identify the important features within the urban environment that signal cultivation of ageing-the-right place.  Objective 3: to compare and contrast the findings emerging from objectives 1 and 2 with the experiences of older adults living in the UK and Brazil (collected through ES/N013220/1). The emphasis will be on establishing an understanding of how social, material and cultural dimensions of place differ across different urban contexts and their implications for the design of age-friendly cities and communities.    Objective 4: to translate the findings from objectives 1-3 into policy and practice guidelines for enabling and designing sense of place for older adults living in India reflecting the requirements of older adults from different urban and cultural contexts. The guidelines will be directed towards identifying urban design and planning principles for practitioners, urban regeneration professionals and policy makers to guide the development of age friendly cities and communities.</narrative>
