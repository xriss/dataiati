   <narrative xml:lang="EN">People are getting older and not just in Western countries. Societal pressures from extended life expectancy are now emerging in low-income countries. We don&apos;t really know what ageing looks like in low-income countries, and many people don&apos;t know their exact age. We will work on methods to determine people&apos;s exact ages (demographic information) in a community in Uganda and build up a picture of its older people&apos;s functional and cognitive health. At the same time, we will involve the same people in a community arts project to explore their self-perception of ageing.  Ageing populations across the globe will lead to a rise in frailty, disability and dependency. Solutions to these problems must be financially, socially and environmentally sustainable to avoid prejudicing life chances of current and future populations. In addition proposed solutions must have buy-in from the older population themselves.   Through this grant we will establish an exciting multi-disciplinary partnership network of academics, artists, non-governmental and governmental organisations in Cambridge and Uganda with a community of older people in Uganda. This partnership will provide a framework to explore demographics, the healthy ageing phenotype, and self-perception using historical demography, psychology, public health epidemiology, and visual arts in order to build up a holistic picture of ageing in a community in Uganda. We will co-develop ideas with a community of older people to produce a multi-disciplinary demographic, phenotypic and functional capacity and visual representation of what ageing means to them. We hope that this forms the basis of a future research grant application.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="The objectives of this project include; 1) Establish an equitable partnership of academics, academic and practising artists, non-governmental and governmental organisations in Uganda and the UK, linked with a community of older people in Uganda a) To link multi-disciplinary researchers in Cambridge and Uganda interested in demographics, phenotypes of healthy ageing and self perceptions of older people b) To develop a shared understanding of academic language required to work in a multi-disciplinary way in this field   2) To collect pilot demographic, health and functional capacity and self-perception data on ageing  a) To develop and pilot data collection tools for demographic assessment of older people and very old people in Uganda (culturally, language and historically appropriate) b) To development and pilot data collection tools for phenotypes of older people in Uganda (clinical, access to health and other services, frailty, cognition, co-morbidities including HIV) c) To pilot visual/ performing arts activities for older people to express their perceptions of older age  3) Establishment of a long term interdisciplinary collaboration for ageing in Africa a) To establish engagement of government, multi-lateral agencies and NGOs working with older people in Uganda e.g. Ministry of Gender, DFID, Irish Aid, WHO, HelpAge International b) To development of a larger Global Challenges Research Fund proposal around a multi-disciplinary approach to Ageing in Africa c) To support a Masters student in Fine Art and develop a PhD application for a Ugandan student for Cambridge-Africa THRIVE programme"></capital-spend>
