   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Around the world, people, mainly women, leave their home place in lower income countries to take care of people and look after other people&apos;s homes in higher income countries. This project investigates one group of migrant care workers, women from the Philippines, who live and work in London and Hong Kong, two important destinations for Filipino migrant care and domestic workers.  Our aim is to use art events and public exhibitions to increase migrant welfare in the places they live and work and enhance the benefits of migration for themselves, their families and their home country. The work that these migrant domestic and care workers undertake elsewhere enables them to build houses and invest in the future of family and loved ones who are left at home. More broadly their remittances collectively account for a significant percentage of GDP in their home country. Scholars debate whether those remittances contribute to longer term development. However, they generally agree that the development benefits of migration would be substantially greater if migrant rights to a fair wage and good working conditions were protected and if migrants invested not just in personal consumption but in sustainable social and economic enterprises.    Working closely in collaboration with our non-academic partners, community based and charitable organisations in London, Hong Kong and Manila, we will run a series of art events and public exhibitions about Filipino migrant care workers. Migrant care workers themselves will be centrally involved in producing and curating the art events and exhibitions. First, using photographic and collage techniques with objects and images from social media, camera phones, posted photographs and personal collections, we will ask migrants to illustrate both their experiences as migrant care workers living abroad and their contributions to development in their home country. We will use the images they produce to engage migrants in conversations both about their everyday concerns and welfare needs and about their future aspirations for themselves, their families and their home country.  Second, working with both migrants and our non-academic partners, we will select some of the images they produce to be professionally printed and displayed in a series of public exhibitions to be held in each city. We will also commission two original pieces of art work from Filipino visual artists residing in London and Hong Kong respectively to contribute to the exhibition.    Together, the images and art works created and displayed at those events and exhibitions will help to raise public awareness about the vital work that these migrant care workers perform and help us show that by protecting migrant rights and ensuring their welfare we enhance the welfare of those that they care for both in home and in host countries. The art and public exhibitions, together with the workshops we organize around the exhibitions, will also generate discussions among migrants and with policy makers and collectively enable them to identify new ways to increase the longer term benefit and development impact of migrants&apos; investments.    Scholars and activists have for some time now actively sought to challenge the view that migrant care and domestic workers are simply &apos;maids to order&apos; . That has led to a better appreciation for the skills these women acquire and the creativity they exercise in overcoming different sorts of social boundaries and cultural barriers. However, those migrant care workers are still largely left out of conversations about migration and development in their home country.  Through novel use of art and public exhibitions this project will bring these creative and resourceful people into that conversation and jump start those long overdue dialogues about development.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="The Curating Development project will employ artistic interventions, curatorial research practice and public exhibitions to explore migrants&apos; aspirations for and contributions to development. It will work with Filipinos, mainly women doing care and domestic work, living in London and Hong Kong. These people remit what they can save of their wages home and thus contribute to national prosperity, but have little say in development policy or planning. By using community arts to record and define their contributions to national development in the Philippines, we will bring their voices and visions to policy-makers and the public. Our project makes visible the &apos;pressures of global mobility&apos; emerging through the increasing reliance of lower and middle income countries on migrant remittances and the potential vulnerabilities of people who migrate as well as the people who come to depend on their migrant labour. Academics have debated the extent to which migration is a driver of development or of underdevelopment, but our approach transcends this debate. Our two, interlinked aims are: a) to define how, when and under what conditions migrants can contribute to development and b) to examine how art and curation can increase the benefits of those development contributions and enhance migrants&apos; welfare.  With our non-academic partners - Kanlungan (London), Enrich (Hong Kong) and the Scalabrini Migration Center (Manila) - we will:  1) Assess the existing range of Filipino migrants&apos; contributions to and investments in their home country through community based visual arts workshops.    2) Elicit reactions to this artwork to catalyse conversations among Filipino migrants and with public policy makers about alternative investment possibilities in different social and economic enterprises and identify potential obstacles they face in making those investments.    3) Curate and exhibit the resulting images to raise public awareness of migrants&apos; contributions internationally and facilitate discussions with academics, activists and development policy makers nationally and internationally.  Key outcomes from meeting these objectives will be:  1) The stimulation of new ways of thinking about and deploying visual arts and curation to intervene in the specific issues and debates about migration and in development practice more broadly.  2) The production of a range of both academic and public dissemination outputs on migration and development including art and other visual images, exhibition, web and social media, as well as articles and special journal issue, in collaboration with scholars, activists, artists and policy makers internationally.  3) The preparation of a standard grant application for research into migration, development, curatorship and alternative ways to look at the outcomes of mobilities with a global rather than single-nation scope."></capital-spend>
