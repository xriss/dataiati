   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Mobile Phone enabled Diagnostics for Infectious Disease Diagnosis: Low Cost Tools for Digital Health in East Africa</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Infectious diseases remain a primary cause of morbidity and mortality in many Low and Middle Income Countries, which suffer from limited health infrastructure, poverty and political insecurity, increasing the transmission of a broad range of human and animal infectious diseases. Our vision for our network is that our new mobile phone enabled low cost DNA sensor technology, based upon using paper microfluidics, will bring both health and economic benefit to East Africa, including both Uganda and Tanzania, as well as other countries in Sub-Saharan Africa in future. The new diagnostic technology will I particular strengthen laboratory diagnostic capacity, which is a main focus for cooperation according to the WHO Cooperation Strategy for Uganda for example.  We have already demonstrated the connectivity through apps and the cloud, accessing secure data storage and artificial intelligence/machine learning decision support tools to help healthcare providers make the correct diagnosis for multiple infectious diseases from the same sample. We now predict, that by using this technology, end users will be enabled to perform infectious disease diagnosis in humans and livestock using different samples, including water, milk and blood. In doing so we will be able to determine, quantitively, transmission pathways between animals and humans (whether this be through shared water sources or unpasteurised milk) - thereby helping address the following Sustainable Development Goals, SDGs, 2, 3, 6 and 15. This will provide healthcare technologists and epidemiologists better understanding of the impact of these diseases in veterinary care, as well as in human infection in the specific environment in Uganda and Tanzania - with resulting economic and health benefits, reducing poverty - address SDG 1. We aim to use this activity as a case study to both exemplify the broader impact of mobile diagnostics on digital health platforms, to inform Governments, NGOs, Charities, Universities, Industry as well patients and the public more generally, as well as to build a wide network of stakeholders in mobile diagnostics platforms to identify and overcome barriers to deployment of digital health solutions in Uganda and Tanzania, and beyond.  Our network will address one of the major health challenges highlighted by both Tanzania and Uganda, through the development of low-cost quantitative diagnostics and screening tools, enabling timely investigations of the factors contributing to the persistence of infectious diseases. In addition to delivering impact on increased health and economic benefits, the outcomes from the network will significantly decrease the impact of infectious diseases on women, who currently have a disproportionate burden. They not only provide the main support for young families, including responsibility around caring and cooking for children, and providing education, but also provide 80% of the labour for rural agricultural activities. Illness in women leads to a direct loss in the family&apos;s income, and prevention of disease can subsequently provide additional economic benefit (SDG 3, 5 &amp; 10). Similarly, if children are ill, they are often taken out from school, again resulting in a loss of income as well as missed education opportunities (SDG 4). In the case of human disease, as of 2017, malaria was the 3rd leading cause of death in both Uganda and Tanzania. By enabling delivery and connectivity of diagnosis in rural communities, using digital health, our network will allow local communities and governments to both increase the efficiency of treatment (through increased decision support) as well as build and implement surveillance strategies to prevent epidemics and re-emergence of diseases.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The network will bring together the &quot;triple helix&quot; of academic knowledge, clinical practice and manufacturing capability to better understand the challenges of developing and implementing digital health in the diagnosis of infectious disease in remote and under-served communities in East Africa. This project has been built upon existing collaborations as well as initial &quot;soundings&quot; during a workshop at The 2nd Uganda National Biomedical Engineering Conference, from individuals who helped frame the 5 themes of the network, that we will explore in the first year: I. Understanding Digital Health for Infectious Disease in Low Resource Settings II. Understanding Data Integrity and Security in Digital Health in Africa;  III. Exploring the Relationship between Data and Healthcare Policy; IV. ICT Devices for Data Acquisition and Communication in East Africa;  V. Capacity Strengthening - Educational Training underpinning Mobile Health. The main objective of the network arising from these themes will be:  1. To demonstrate that we can expand our existing collaborations to create a network that contains the necessary breadth of expertise to address the five challenges listed as themes above;  2. to demonstrate strong network governance, including intellectual leadership around the organisation and structure of the network, enabling its smooth operation, including the collection of data and views from across all participants.  Important in this process will be a clear mechanism by which participants in the network can change the topics (initially outlined as five themes) in a democratic, constructive manner. Data science is rapidly evolving, and the network must be able to reflect this;  3. To hold two events that bring together relevant key stakeholders from the &quot;triple helix&quot; of academic knowledge, clinical practice and manufacturing capability to better understand the challenges of developing and implementing digital health in the diagnosis of infectious disease in remote and under-served communities in East Africa - with mobile phone enabled digital health.  4. To engage with the wider stakeholder&apos;s community, including patient associations, charities, NGOs to ensure that outcomes are endorsed and deliver impact.  5. To foster the early career researchers in the network and beyond, establishing a framework for capacity strengthening within the context of mobile diagnostics, exploring in particular mechanisms for regulation and ethics, beyond technical capabilities.  6. To deliver a report, to be disseminated to Governments, charities and NGOs. Our explicit aim is to foster the sharing of insights and experience not only from across disparate disciplines but also within and between teams, based in different sectors and different countries;  7. To further expand of our network, underpinning the sustainability of the collaboration.  8. To deliver strong &quot;impact pipelines&quot; ensuring the flow of information and the translation of ideas to industry and to clinicians.</narrative>
