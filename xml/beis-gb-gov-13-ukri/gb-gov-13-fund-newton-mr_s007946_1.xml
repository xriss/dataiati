   <narrative xml:lang="EN">MIND-ECON: The longer term, average &amp; distributional effects of mental health interventions &amp; the causal impact of mental illness on economic outcomes</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">South Africa has a high burden of mental illness, with around a third of adults suffering from a mental disorder at some point in their life. Around three-quarters of people with mental disorders such as depression, anxiety and alcohol use never access mental health treatment. Untreated mental illness is the third largest contributor to the national burden of disease. Mental illness also contributes to the national burden of disease associated with chronic communicable diseases (such as HIV) and non-communicable diseases, such as diabetes. Including mental health care as part of chronic disease care in primary care clinics is seen as a way to improve access to mental health treatment, as well as improve chronic disease outcomes.  A trial, called MIND, is currently being run in the Western Cape looking at different ways of providing brief mental health counselling in primary care services for patients with depression or alcohol use disorders who also suffer from diabetes or HIV. The aim of MIND is to examine the most effective and cost-effective way to provide mental health counselling services through community health workers. The MIND trial will collect information on patients&apos; mental health at three points in time to look at whether there are changes in patients&apos; level of depression and hazardous/harmful alcohol use as a result of the counselling.  We are proposing to build on the MIND trial in the MIND-ECON study. We will analyse existing data from the MIND trial and collect additional information from patients at a further time point (2 years), so that we can examine the long-term effects of the counselling intervention. We will also examine whether the counselling had different effects on patients&apos; depression or alcohol disorder, depending on their socio-economic status. We will measure socio-economic status by creating an index based on household characteristics (e.g. the type of house the patient lives in, type of toilet, their source of drinking water and energy for cooking) and asset ownership (e.g. whether they own a fridge, stove, TV, etc.). We will also look at the impact of changes in mental health on an individual&apos;s employment, productivity, and other economic outcomes such as out-of-pocket payments.   In addition to patient economic outcomes, we will further capture information from other members of the household so that we can learn what impact patients&apos; mental illness has on the family and those who care for them and what coping strategies are used to deal with the burden of mental illness.  Very little is known about the long-term impact of psychological counselling on mental health in this context and even less is known about the impact of mental health on economic outcomes or on the caregiving burden. MIND-ECON will provide valuable information on the relationship between mental health and economic outcomes, as well as how mental health outcomes from the counselling may be affected by socio-economic status.   MIND-ECON will be an efficient way to collect further much needed data since it builds on an existing study. Issues that are sometimes risky in trials, such as whether the study can recruit enough patients, are already in place. We will seek the needed additional ethical approvals to collect information from the patients and the members of their household.  We will use state-of-the art methods to analyse these data and will draw on a range of expertise in this UK-SA collaboration, which will also support capacity development. We will use MIND&apos;s existing stakeholder advisory group consisting of policymakers, staff from the HIV and diabetes clinics, and mental health patient groups to help us ensure that our findings can feed directly into changing policy and practice and have a large impact. We will ensure our results are widely publicised to various audiences and through different media. We will seek to influence policy in South Africa and globally on improving access to mental health care.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This study proposes to add substantive value to an existing, cluster-randomised control trial in South Africa on the delivery of mental health counselling for chronic disease patients with common mental disorders, by (1) collecting additional information from patients at a further time point thus providing longer term follow up at 24 months, (2) adding a household survey, as well as (3) undertaking analytical work not initially foreseen or feasible based on the original trial design, due to limited funding.   More specifically, this extension of the original trial will allow achieving the following objectives:  1) Evaluate the longer-term causal impact of mental health counselling interventions on mental health  Few mental health intervention studies incorporate a longer-term follow-up beyond the actual intervention [14]. This is a major limitation as it leaves the question unanswered as to how sustained any short-term effect may be, which in turn opens up any longer term health benefit and cost-effectiveness assessment to considerable speculation. To fill this gap, we will examine the longer-term treatment effect of the counselling interventions carried out in the MIND trial. The health outcomes to be examined include: depression, hazardous/harmful alcohol use and health-related quality of life.  2) Evaluate the distributional health impacts of the mental health counselling interventions, both in the shorter and longer run, and by different socioeconomic groups  A further evidence gap exists in terms of the extent to which mental health interventions have the potential to reduce health inequities, i.e. to narrow the gap in mental health outcomes between lower and higher socioeconomic groups. Within the existing MIND trial, we have collected various indicators of socioeconomic status (SES), that we will use to construct an SES asset index computed from household ownership of assets, access to services and housing type. We will examine the degree to which socioeconomic status acts as a moderator of the treatment effect, and if so, in what direction. This is important, in that the a priori expectation might be that higher SES groups are better placed to reap the benefits of a counselling intervention. In this case the expected positive average effect of the intervention(s) might come at the cost of widening the pre-existing mental health differences between the better and worse off.  3) Evaluate the short term and longer-term causal impact of mental health on individual economic outcomes  The primary objective is - for the first time in South Africa - to provide credible, causal evidence on the impact of mental health on a range of relevant economic outcomes. Outcomes will include employment status, productivity loss, and out of pocket payments.   Although evidence abounds on the association between mental health and economic outcomes, there is a dearth of causal empirical evidence about the impact of mental health on economic outcomes in low- and middle-income country settings [8], and a complete absence of such evidence in the South African context [15,16]. Assessing the extent to which mental health impacts on economic outcomes is important, as it can add substantive weight to the case for investing in mental health - investment that to date is widely judged as inadequate to the challenge at hand [29].   4) Evaluate the longer-term causal impact of mental health on the household economic and caregiver burden   Our final objective will be to assess the economic and psychological caregiver burden of mental illness in the household. Our economic outcomes will be household expenditure and catastrophic health spending, economic coping strategies (e.g. borrowing or selling assets) as well as the opportunity costs of caregiver time. Mental health outcomes for the primary carer will be assessed by measures of the care giver burden and psychological distress.</narrative>
