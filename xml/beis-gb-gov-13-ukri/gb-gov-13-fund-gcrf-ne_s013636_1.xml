   <narrative xml:lang="EN">International - Raising the value of biodiversity-friendly cocoa and carbon storage: ensuring sustainable incomes around Gola Rainforest National Park</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Tropical forest and agriculture compete for the same land, but the benefits are distributed to different people. Two key benefits from tropical forest are the continued existence of tropical nature, which enriches our lives, and the storage of carbon in living trees, which regulates our climate. These benefits accrue to people around the world. In contrast, most of the benefits from agriculture (food and income) accrue to the farmers themselves, plus local and national consumers and local and national economies.  The consequence is that land-use decisions in any given location will mostly be made by the beneficiaries of agriculture rather than the beneficiaries of tropical forest, for obvious reasons:  farmers know that they benefit from converting forest to agriculture and are able to convert their desires into action, while the beneficiaries of tropical forest are global but individually only benefit a little and also find it difficult to convert their desires into action. The result is that tropical forest continues to be converted to agriculture.  One way to try to right this imbalance in decision-making is to use what are called &apos;market-based instruments&apos; to make the conservation of tropical forest at least as profitable to local communities and to agribusinesses as farming. Two such instruments are carbon-credit payments and premium-pricing for agricultural goods. For instance, consumers of airline flights and &apos;Rainforest-Friendly&apos; chocolate bars pay extra, and the generated income streams are directed to countries and their local populations to compensate them for not converting forest to farmland.  However, the big challenge is to verify that these payments are indeed resulting in the conservation of forest that is high in carbon and biodiversity. Until recently, this challenge has been largely insuperable because of the technical difficulties of measuring forest carbon and biodiversity in ways that are auditable and low-cost. Recently, though, major advances in satellite remote-sensing are making it possible to track changes in forest cover, repeatedly and at a low cost per image (in many cases, free to download).  The remaining challenge is to interpret these data-rich images in order to quantify changes in the amount of aboveground biomass (to measure change in carbon stocks) and in the amount of biodiversity that those forests contain. This challenge requires on-the-ground measurements to generate the data that can be used to interpret raw data from satellite-based sensors.  This is what we propose, working in the 908 km2 forested buffer zone of the Gola Rainforest National Park (GRNP) in Sierra Leone, where cocoa, a potential driver of deforestation, is the main cash crop. So far, only a small portion of farmers receive a higher price for &apos;Rainforest Friendly&apos; cocoa, and payments for carbon are jeopardised if forest clearance in the buffer zone continues unabated. Satellite-based mapping would inform sustainable development plans that allow cocoa expansion to be directed to areas of low carbon and biodiversity, and ongoing satellite-based monitoring would make it possible for anyone to easily verify whether carbon stocks and biodiversity are being protected. Carbon payments and premium-pricing for Rainforest-Friendly cocoa would therefore be safeguarded and expanded, improving the welfare of the 22,000 people living in the buffer zone while also reducing pressure on forest.  This project has been co-designed with GRC-LG who manage the GRNP and who identified the need for a better decision-support system. The current method of verification for carbon payments via five-yearly surveys is inefficient and does not account for biodiversity. GRC-LG has strong links with the Sierra Leone government, placing this work in a strong position to influence the management of other forest-carbon projects in West Africa.

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">We propose to produce a methodologically transparent and continuously updated decision-support tool to support the not-for-profit company, Gola Rainforest Conservation Limited Group (GRC-LG) in Sierra Leone, which has identified a need to be able to audit and externally verify the effectiveness of REDD+ carbon-credit payments and premium-pricing for Rainforest-Friendly cocoa. These payment streams will thus be safeguarded, allowing sustained support of the livelihoods of 22,000 people living in and around the Gola Rainforest National Park.   Using advanced approaches already fully developed by partners, a decision-support tool will be developed to generate robustly quantified, spatially explicit, and auditable targets for forest conservation that can be written into REDD+ conservation contracts. We will combine our existing expertise in satellite image analysis and high-throughput biodiversity assessment to generate high-resolution and continuously updated maps of land-cover class, aboveground carbon stocks, and biodiversity in the 908 km2 &quot;leakage belt&quot; of the Gola Rainforest National Park. The data required for Objectives 1 and 2 are already in hand:   1.  Aboveground-biomass model:  In 2012, 190 km2 of the Gola landscape was surveyed by airborne LiDAR, which overflew 697 0.16-ha plots used for field measurements of aboveground forest carbon. We will pair these airborne and ground datasets with spaceborne radar and optical datasets to parameterise a deep-learning model and predict aboveground biomass across the entire Gola landscape, following methods recently published by the Coomes group (Asner et al. 2018).   2.  Land-cover class model:  We will also use satellite multispectral and SAR products, paired with an existing ground-truth dataset of land-cover classes (Wilebore, 2015; Lui and Coomes 2015), to generate an up-to-date land-cover classification map across the Gola landscape.   3.  Biodiversity model:  We will use Malaise traps to collect arthropods at 150 sample points, stratified over land-cover classes in the Gola buffer zone. The samples will be converted to site X species tables via the efficient method of metabarcoding, and the resulting point data will be interpolated across the landscape using joint species distribution modelling to predict the distribution of arthropod biodiversity as a function of remotely sensed environmental covariates. Arthropod biodiversity is closely correlated with plant biodiversity (Zhang et al. 2016), which expands the taxonomic representativeness of this dataset.   4.  Publication of maps and underlying models:  The above maps and underlying models will be published on the RSPB data portal (and on appropriate long-term data archival services) to make the methods transparent and to allow near-real-time, third-party-verifiable tracking of the state of biodiversity and forest biomass.    5. Scenario modelling with Gola Rainforest Conservation (GRC-LG):  The above outputs will be combined to identify and map areas where the expansion of cocoa and subsistence farming will be least detrimental to carbon stocks and biodiversity. These maps will then be used by the non-profit company GRC-LG to guide land-use planning in the leakage belt by producing different development scenarios on cocoa and agricultural production, carbon stocks, and biodiversity state. The scenarios will be the basis for participatory landscape planning, so that REDD+ and cocoa premium-pricing income streams can be safeguarded for the long term and those income streams used to improve livelihoods, to finance sustainable crop intensification, and to direct cocoa expansion to areas of lower carbon and biodiversity value.</narrative>
