   <narrative xml:lang="EN">As part of delivering the UoB&apos;s GCRF strategy (as detailed in the business plan), we aim to translate the outputs of three GCRF projects through this GCTA. The three projects were selected through an open internal competition.  Project 1- SAFER PREPARED- Anastasios Sextos This project aims to work with local government and academic institutions to co-design and co-deliver a pilot generic App and GIS-based WebApp tool to reduce seismic risk of school buildings in DAC list countries and improve the resilience of educational communities to cope with the disruptions, damage and loss that result from a major earthquake.  This is effectively a feasibility study where the existing App and WebApp that has been hard coded for Nepal can work with different data sets as per the structural typologies of schools and earthquake hazard maps that exist (or can be developed) for other DACs. The objectives of this proposal are to: 1)Upgrade the existing SAFER App (for surveying school buildings) and WebApp (for risk assessment of the gathered portfolio of buildings), which are currently focussed on Nepal, to a generic tool and implement them at a wider scale. It is noted that the workflow is that the SAFER App is used first, in offline mode to harvest data, data are transferred once wifi is available while the Web App is the decision-making tool for the country stakeholders.  2)Translate, as a feasibility study, the PREPARE research outputs (focussed on housing) to assess the seismic vulnerability of school buildings in Malawi through a widely available platform. 3)As a feasibility study, integrate newly-developed Probabilistic Seismic Hazard (PSHA) maps for Malawi, incorporating active fault data, into the App/WebApp. 4)Pave the way for the commercialization of the App/WebApp for quick visual inspection and risk assessment of school buildings as well as for a social enterprise beyond the award.  PROJECT 2 - Mobile phone App Development for Drought Adaptation in Drylands (MAD DAD) - Katerina Michaelides This project aims to develop an App to provide users with seasonal forecasts of water scarcity (in the soil and groundwater) with uncertainty estimates at their location in Kenya. The objectives are to:  1)Develop, test and deploy an Android mobile phone App that allows users to see short-term (seasonal) and long-term forecasts of water scarcity and food insecurity in their area.  2)Encompass understanding of gendered use of technology and its impact on equitable access to information and decision-making in the deployment of the app. According to USAID East Africa, &quot;Access to information&quot; has been highlighted as one of the key components that boosts resilience and economic impact in the region, enabling communities to take control of their activities and plan for their livelihoods  PROJECT 3 - Environmental DNA Surveillance for Improved Aquaculture Production - Martin Genner This project aims to improve tilapia fish production in Tanzania by providing environmental DNA-based surveillance information to focus the developing aquaculture sector on large-bodied, high-yielding species, in addition to providing advice and information on where to obtain pure stock and appropriate feed and rearing conditions for favoured large-bodied species. The project will focus on and interact with smallholder aquaculture as this is responsible for most tilapia production in the country. Larger industrial farms are well resourced and owners already well informed about sources of appropriate broodstock. The objectives are to:  1)Enhance national capability to identify the tilapia species used in small scale aquaculture in Tanzania. 2)Develop national capacity to use robust DNA monitoring to detect small- bodied invasive species that compromise fish production. 3)Notify farmers and hatchery workers of the species status of their stocks, enabling informed decisions about stocking methods, while informing policy at the national level</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In this GCTA we propose three projects to tackle significant environmental challenges; earthquakes, droughts and food security in DAC countries in the East African region.   Project 1 will focus on seismic risk mitigation in Malawi. In DAC countries, the lack of resources hinders effective seismic mitigation strategies and as a result, earthquakes can result in devastating human and school infrastructure loss. Malawi is one of the countries in the East African region that suffer greatly from this challenge. This is because traditional masonry structures are unreinforced and seismically vulnerable, there is rapid population growth and urbanization, and large earthquakes of M7.0 or greater can occur in the East African Rift (EAR). In Malawi Schools are often the only community buildings in a village and are used as refuges post-disaster. In addition to that, Malawi lack the means to predict seismic risk. To tackle this challenge, we will employ a two-pronged approach. First, we will deploy the seismic risk assessment tools developed as part of the PREPARE project in Malawi. This will enable the reliable assessment of seismic hazard (i.e., the probability that an earthquake will occur in a given geographic area, within a given window of time, and with certain ground motion intensity). Second, we will translate and contextualise the simple, low cost, easy to use tool developed as part of the SAFER project in Nepal for the pre-earthquake assessment of school buildings and the informed prioritization of school strengthening in Malawi.   PROJECT 2 will focus on adaptation to droughts in Kenya. Severe water shortage is one of the most pressing development challenges in the East African region, having been struck by 10 droughts since 2000 which led to three severe famines affecting millions of East Africans. As such there is a pressing need for relevant, timely, and practical information about water resources, particularly for rural agro-pastoral populations which are distant from decision-making centres. We propose to develop an App for this purpose. The App will provide users with seasonal forecasts of water scarcity (in the soil and groundwater) with uncertainty estimates at their location, allowing farmers to take appropriate decisions about crop variety for that season for example.   PROJECT 3 will focus on improving aquaculture production in Tanzania. The population of Tanzania is projected to increase from 56 million in 2018 to 129 million by 2050, resulting in unprecedented demand for fish protein. Tilapia aquaculture is proposed as an important solution to meet the increased demand. However, it has not yet expanded in line with demand, with access to appropriate broodstock and education cited as key concerns limiting expansion. A key issue is the widespread contamination of ponds by an invasive small-bodied tilapia species (the blue-spotted tilapia), which is indistinguishable as young fish from large bodied species (e.g. Nile tilapia). Elimination of this contamination has been recognised by the Tanzanian Government as a critical step to improve food production as the industry expands. This project will provide environmental DNA-based surveillance information to focus the developing aquaculture sector on large-bodied, high-yielding species, in addition to providing advice and information on where to obtain pure stock and appropriate feed and rearing conditions for favoured large-bodied species.</narrative>
