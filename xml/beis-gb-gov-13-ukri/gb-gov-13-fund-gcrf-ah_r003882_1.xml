   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The main aim for the project will be to explore how a multidisciplinary partnership, bringing together user-led design skills with technical and medical expertise, can help improve healthcare support for rural communities in India. Currently, the number of health workers in rural India is below the minimum level recommended by the World Health Organisation (WHO). The WHO proposed several strategies to improve the resources for health in areas such as rural India including how to harness information and communication technology (ICT) more effectively, and how to build &quot;greater resilience and self-reliance in communities&quot;. This project will explore how user-led design research methods such as &apos;design thinking&apos; can be used to harness ICT more effectively to create new solutions that are culturally and contextually appropriate, affordable and effective.  Design thinking uses methods such as rapid ethnography to understand people&apos;s everyday lives including their behaviours, motivations, beliefs and values. Design thinking also uses fast prototyping of ideas and gaining feedback from end users and stakeholders. The aim of &apos;design thinking&apos; is to generate several possible solutions that meet the needs of users, but are also technically feasible and economically viable.  The project is a collaboration between the Cardiff School of Art and Design at Cardiff Metropolitan University; the Schools of Engineering and Medicine at Amrita University, India; and the Centre for eHealth at the University of Agder, Norway. The project will also harness knowledge from key participants and stakeholders in India including healthcare workers, non-governmental organisations, governmental policy makers and technology companies.  The objectives for the project are to: 1. Understand and document the current situation and challenges faced in rural villages in India with regards to healthcare, including the cultural context. 2. Establish a multidisciplinary research network of international experts in the fields of user-led design, medicine, computer science and technology to share knowledge and exchange ideas in relation to healthcare support for the developing world. 3. Train researchers and health workers in India on how to employ user-led design research methods such as &apos;design thinking&apos; to generate new ideas and possible solutions. 4. Run an interactive &apos;design thinking&apos; workshop with key stakeholders and international experts to discover key challenges and opportunities; generate ideas for possible new solutions; and evaluate their potential benefits as well as their feasibility and viability. 5. Create a plan for developing possible solutions further, through future collaborative projects.  6. Disseminate findings from the project to the academic community, policy makers, the healthcare community in India, and technology companies.  The longer-term aim is to develop and deploy ideas generated from the research in several rural communities in India to improve their healthcare support. The plan is to use the insights gained from the project to apply for a large collaborative project grant. The project will strengthen the capacity for research and innovation at Amrita University, Cardiff Metropolitan University and the University of Agder. In addition, the project will train volunteer health workers, and non-governmental agency workers, who are working with rural communities in India, in how to gain insights and generate new ideas to improve healthcare provision. Insights gained from the project will be shared and discussed with the National Rural Health Mission in India and the state government in Kerala, in relation to possible policy implications, and opportunities for further development. The project will also show how multidisciplinary networks, combining international and local expertise from a range of complementary fields, can be used to tackle very complex problems such as healthcare provision for rural communities in India.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="The focus of the project is to improve the health and well-being of people living in rural communities in India through the establishment of a multidisciplinary international collaboration and the application of user-led design research methods such as &apos;design thinking&apos;. Key collaborators in the project will be the Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering at Amrita School of Engineering, Amrita University, Coimbatore, India; Amrita Institute of Medical Sciences, Amrita University, Kochi, India; Amrita Kripa Charitable Hospital, Wayanad, India; the Centre for eHealth and Care Technology at the University of Agder, Norway; and the Cardiff School of Art and Design at Cardiff Metropolitan University.  Improving the health and well-being of rural communities in India is a complex problem that requires an understanding of a range of different factors including social context, technical possibilities, medical expertise, healthcare resources and economic constraints. Design thinking is an approach to innovation that has been very successful over the last twenty years in tackling such complex problems by exploring the interrelationships between these key factors. It is multidisciplinary by nature. Design thinking focuses on understanding the needs of people, and exploring how technical possibilities can meet those needs while also understanding how economic constraints affect the viability of possible solutions. The main objectives of the project will be to explore how design thinking approaches can be used to develop new healthcare solutions in rural India; establish multidisciplinary collaboration; train key personnel in how to use design thinking techniques and tools; investigate the implications for policy and strategy; and share the ideas developed and lessons learnt.  The main objectives for the project will be achieved through: 1. Understanding and documenting the current situation and challenges faced in rural villages in India with regards to healthcare, including the cultural context. 2. Establishing a multidisciplinary research network of international experts in the fields of user-led design, medicine, computer science and technology to share knowledge and exchange ideas in relation to healthcare support for the developing world. 3. Training researchers and health workers in India on how to employ user-led design research methods such as &apos;design thinking&apos; to generate new ideas and possible solutions. 4. Conducting an interactive &apos;design thinking&apos; workshop with key stakeholders and international experts to discover key challenges and opportunities; generate ideas for possible new solutions; and evaluate their potential benefits as well as their feasibility and viability. 5. Creating a plan for developing possible solutions further, through future collaborative projects.  6. Disseminating findings from the project to the academic community, policy makers, the healthcare community in India, and technology companies.  The Cardiff School of Art and Design have been undertaking internationally leading user-led design research for over a decade, and for the last five years have focused on developing new healthcare solutions in sub-Saharan Africa (including Malawi, Zambia and Namibia) using &apos;design thinking&apos; approaches.   The Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering and the Amrita Institute of Medical Sciences at Amrita University have been working in collaboration with Amrita Kripa Charitable Hospital and the non-governmental organization Amrita SeRVe (Amrita SeRVe, 2016) to help develop self-reliant villages in the Wayanad district of Kerala, India.   The Centre for eHealth and Care Technology at the University of Agder in Norway are internationally leading experts in remote healthcare solutions covering aspects of user-centred design and technology research and have successfully deployed mobile health solutions across Norway in collaboration with local health authorities."></capital-spend>
