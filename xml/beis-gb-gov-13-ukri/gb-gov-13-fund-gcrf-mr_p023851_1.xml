   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Understanding non-communicable diseases (NCD) and the role of infection in Africa: building a partnership to generate big data</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">&quot;Non-communicable diseases&quot; (NCD) are increasing in Africa. They are a diverse group of conditions, not directly caused by infections and are most often long-term and lifestyle-related, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, cancers, asthma and kidney disease. The reasons for the increase in these diseases are complex but include increasing urbanisation, overweight/obesity and lifestyle risk factors, such as smoking tobacco, high alcohol intake and reduced physical activity. The increase in NCD, is occurring alongside a high level of infectious disease (such as HIV and tuberculosis) and under- or mal-nutrition, which often exacerbates these conditions and leads to very poor health outcomes and shortens lives. In Africa, deaths from NCD in adults now exceed deaths caused by infectious diseases. To truly understand the severity and extent of these diseases requires investigations using detailed information from a general population, referred to as population-based research.  Population-based research (as opposed to hospital-based research) is particularly important in Africa as relatively few people use formal health services, especially in the early stages of illness.  The unique and valuable data collected in repeated cycles of population-based research help us to determine the amount and causes of disease; the risk (or chance) of death from these conditions; how these diseases develop in individuals; and how the disease changes over time (for example, age and sex of people most commonly affected).  To understand NCDs in Africa better, and to help inform African policy makers and researchers, we propose an African NCD Longitudinal Data Alliance (ANDLA). ANDLA will bring together population-based research data from multiple partners working in existing study sites across Africa to create large, harmonised datasets that are robust and powerful enough to address important research questions that individual study sites would struggle to answer on their own.  ANDLA will provide a dynamic and sustainable platform of population-based data collected over time (longitudinal-data). The data will be standardised and made available in an easily usable form, and will focus on NCD and their risk factors. It will be a unique large-scale data resource for understanding NCD in Africa now and in future decades, to inform and shape effective policy in populations with limited resources and a large and growing amount of these disease.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">i)  To create a partnership across multiple demographic sites and cohorts in Africa, providing technical support and expertise to harmonise data on risk factors for and health outcomes associated with NCD for collaborative analyses. ii)   To produce multi-site and site-specific analyses on mortality levels and changes related to baseline cardiometabolic risk factors.  iii)  To produce multi-site and site-specific analyses on prevalence and incidence of fatal HIV-related cancers.  iv)  To ensure dissemination of findings to national and international bodies. v)   To explore sustainable funding models for future primary data collection and data pooling. .</narrative>
