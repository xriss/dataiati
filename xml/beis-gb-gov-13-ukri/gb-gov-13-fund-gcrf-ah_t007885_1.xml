   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project focuses on Colombia, with specific reference to symbolic reparations, which are a fundamental part of the peace process. Symbolic reparation for human rights abuses includes the act of listening to victims, the recording of testimonies, and the preservation of archives of this material. The role of symbolic reparations in transitional contexts is increasingly being recognised as just as important as material reparations, due to their potential to promote redress, foster solidarity, reweave a community&apos;s social fabric, and restore the dignity of victims and survivors. Within this context, archives of human rights and historical memory have a particularly important role to play, given that they are instruments for recording testimony and experiences of the conflict. Moreover, they are formally recognized in Colombia as one of the mechanisms for transitional justice, to ensure the guarantees for the victims of truth, justice, full reparation and non-repetition. Informed by these recommendations, our project engages with four NGOs which have created their own archives. The archives with which we will work are often fragmented; are often housed in unofficial catalogues or spaces; are often vulnerable, both to material deterioration, due to environmental factors such as humidity and heat, and to digital loss, due to inadequate digital backups; are at risk due to the continuation of armed conflict in some areas, and threats to local community leaders and curators of these same archives; and are in need of organization and preservation. This project aims to address this need by providing a robust mechanism for the archiving of these resources. We do so through a tailored, participatory approach, in which we work with the NGOs in a genuinely collaborative manner throughout. Firstly, we will undertake meetings with these NGOs to understand fully their needs, and start to develop the concepts informing our proposed toolkit. This will involve interviews and questionnaires with them, as well as wider discussion, around the issues they have encountered when: recording testimony from victims; collating testimonies; and preserving testimony and other memory materials.  Following on from this, we will design and develop a toolkit, entitled The Memory Box: Toolkit for the Curation and Preservation of Human Rights and Historical Memory Archives. This toolkit will contain pedagogical and practical materials, encompassing how to undertake memory workshops; how to undertake archiving workshops; best practice for the digitization of resources; and the basic elements needed for successful archival preservation.  A pilot version of this toolkit will be prepared, and then launched and tested with the four NGOs collaborating with us on this project. At this pilot stage, an event will be held with each NGO to test out the toolkit, discuss how it would work or be adapted for their particular context or needs, and flag up any particular concerns or needs for amendment to the toolkit. Subsequently, building on the feedback gained at these pilot events, we will refine the toolkit, and produce the finalized version. We will then formally launch the finalized toolkit, which will enable these and other NGOs to develop best practice for the management of their own archives, the tools for them to begin to manage their own processes of curation, and the best practice for the digitization of their resources. An important next step in our project is to set in train a series of steps to ensure the understanding of, and societal use of, these archives and resources within the context of the armed conflict in Colombia, and we will organize public-facing events to enable the visibility, sharing and societal use of these existing archives. Finally, we will launch a network of managers and curators of Human Rights and Historical Memory Archives to ensure legacy and continuing impact.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="The objectives of this project are informed by theories of international development as they relate to transitional justice, in particular notions of victim-centred transitional justice which envisage participation as a necessary step for the empowerment of the beneficiaries of policies, and by Colombia-specific approaches to transitional justice, which officially recognise human rights archives as instruments for recording testimony and experiences of the conflict, and as one of the mechanisms for ensuring truth, peace, and the consolidation of democracy.  Within this framework, the first and most important objective of the project is to contribute to peace-building in Colombia, and by extension in other post-conflict communities, by supporting the collection and preservation of materials and testimonies related to women victims/survivors of the conflict. This is informed by an understanding of the collection and preservation of archives as a fundamental component of symbolic reparation, and as mechanisms to help promote redress, foster solidarity, reweave a community&apos;s social fabric, and restore the dignity of victims and survivors.  The subsequent objectives then contribute to achieving this overall objective, comprising:  Secondly, to work with NGOs that are involved in collating and preserving testimony and memories, in order to understand their needs and, in so doing, to establish a series of required resources, and to develop best practice for the curation of archives. It will involve designing, in partnership with the organizations, the tools for them to begin to manage their own processes of curation and digitization.   Thirdly, to enable the visibility, sharing and societal use of these archives, through face-to-face events and via digital means. This will enable us to promote public understanding of the importance of the curation and preservation of Human Rights and Historical Memory Archives. It will also facilitate and promote the societal use of these sources, as a way of furthering understanding of the role of archives as a part of symbolic reparation.  Fourthly, to enable future collaborations between the beneficiaries of the project, both amongst the specific NGOs with whom we will work; with other similar organizations in Colombia; and with other organizations working with memory, human rights, gender, and archives internationally. This will necessitate the creation of a network of managers and curators of Human Rights and Historical Memory Archives at national level, which will also promote the sharing of best practice regarding the role of Human Rights and Historical Memory Archives in transitional justice in other national contexts, particularly with other countries of the Global South, through targeted submissions to the International Association of Women&apos;s Museums and to the Latin American Regional Forum of the Federation of International Human Rights Museums."></capital-spend>
