   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Understanding how viral innate immune evasion strategies affect adaptive immunity, and the application to vaccine development</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The main objective of this study is to deepen our understanding of the innate immune response to vaccination and how this impacts on immunological memory. Vaccines are important tools to prevent disease, but vaccines against several serious diseases such as HIV, malaria and dengue are still not available. Improved understanding of how to elicit strong immunological memory responses via vaccination is required. The link between innate and adaptive immunity is currently not well understood, but work in our laboratory has demonstrated that mutants of vaccinia virus (VACV) that lack specific innate immunomodulatory proteins are more immunogenic and efficacious vaccines. For example mutants lacking immunomodulatory proteins N1 or K7 enhance either CD8+ T-cell or NK-cell memory responses, respectively. We wish to understand these observations mechanistically and use this knowledge to improve the design of future vaccines. The detailed aims are to identify innate responses that occur during the first hours and days of infection and which correlate with enhanced (or decreased) immunological protection to subsequent challenge. This requires a greater understanding of the primary and innate immune response to VACV in vivo than is currently available. Therefore, the first part of this study (sections 1-4) will address the development of CD8+ T-cell or NK-cell memory by VACV proteins N1 and K7. Specific objectives to be addressed first are: 1) Which cells are infected by VACV initially and how do VACV immunomodulators N1 and K7 affect this? 2) How do VACV immunomodulators N1 and K7 affect cytokine production at the site of infection and which cells are producing these proteins? 3) How do VACV immunomodulators N1 and K7 affect recruitment and spatial distribution of leukocytes at the site of infection? 4) How do VACV immunomodulators N1 and K7 affect antigen presentation? In the second part (sections 5-7) we will screen other VACV immunomodulators, using a panel of mutant viruses already available in our lab, for those affecting immunological memory responses. In particular, we will look for alterations in CD4+ T-cell responses to complement the tools we have already for analysis of CD8+ T-cell and NK-cell memory. The specific objectives are: 5) How do VACV immunomodulators affect the development of leukocyte memory cell populations, specifically the CD8+, CD4+ and NK cells? 6) How do VACV immunomodulators affect leukocyte effector functions following challenge with antigen? 7) How do VACV immunomodulators affect anti-VACV antibody production? Finally, we will use the information gained from these studies to design vaccines rationally that induce greater immunological memory to enhance their efficacy.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Vaccines are one of the best means to prevent infection and the spread of disease. Although more than 60 vaccines exist, vaccines are still needed against infections such as HIV, malaria and dengue that comprise a huge burden on global health. Contributing to this problem is our incomplete understanding of the type of immune response that provides optimal protection and how this is best evoked by vaccination. In this study vaccinia virus (VACV), the vaccine used to eradicate smallpox, will be used as a model to improve current understanding of the immune response to vaccination and this information will be used to design more potent vaccines.  There are two arms that make up our immune system. The first is the &apos;innate&apos; immune system, which is quick to respond to infection but is not pathogen specific. Innate immunity helps to control the infection whilst the &apos;adaptive&apos; immune response develops. Adaptive immunity is specific to the invading pathogen and is required for complete pathogen clearance. Importantly, the adaptive immune response endures as a long-lived memory immunity that protects from subsequent infection. It is the development of this long-lived, pathogen-specific memory immunity that provides the basis for vaccination.  The importance of the innate immune response in successful vaccination is becoming clear, although exactly how it contributes to memory immunity is not well understood. Cells in the body are able to detect the presence of invading microorganisms and respond by producing molecules such as cytokines and interferons - so named as they &apos;interfere&apos; with viral infection. As well as limiting virus replication, these specialised proteins attract white blood cells (leukocytes) to the site of infection so that they can kill pathogen-infected cells and stimulate the activation of leukocytes that control the adaptive immune response. Viruses have counter-measures that limit the production and action of these anti-pathogenic and immune-activating molecules and VACV has numerous mechanisms to achieve this. Work in our laboratory has demonstrated that engineering VACV to remove the genes whose protein products act to limit the innate immune response, such as cytokines and interferons, can improve the potency of VACV as a vaccine. These data are valuable because they highlight the importance of innate immunity in shaping and influencing the memory immune response.  The question we aim to answer is how does the removal of these innate immune inhibitory genes from VACV positively impact on memory immunity? By answering this question we will not only be able to improve the vaccine potential of VACV, but also enhance current understanding of how the innate immune system shapes memory immune responses, information that can be used to design better vaccines in general. VACV is a good model to answer this question as it is a well-studied virus where numerous tools are already available, it has already been used as a successful vaccine for the eradication of smallpox and there is a robust mouse model of VACV infection and vaccination. Furthermore VACV is a popular candidate as a vector for the vaccination against other diseases, such as HIV and malaria, thus the data generated by this proposed study can be directly used to improve the vaccine potential of this virus.</narrative>
