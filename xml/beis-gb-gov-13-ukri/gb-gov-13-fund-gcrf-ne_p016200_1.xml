   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Poorly constructed buildings are often the largest cause of injury, trauma and death in the event of a natural disaster. Most families rebuild houses relying on their own resources, with little or no external support. They &quot;self-recover&quot;. An analysis of statistics shows that the impact of aid agencies on housing recovery rarely reaches more than 20% of affected families and is frequently in single figures (Parrack, 2014). Moreover, much of that support is in the form of temporary housing intended to last only a few years. Therefore, we know that 80%, or more, self-recover.  The potential impact is huge: any one emergency can leave hundreds of thousands of families homeless, with women and girls disproportionately affected (Bradshaw, 2015). As things stand, these homes are too often rebuilt using the same pre-disaster bad practice that caused so much death, injury and economic damage in the first place.  Currently, shelter professionals lack understanding of the recovery process and therefore of inherent opportunities for appropriate and effective support. Families choose when and how to rebuild based on little-understood circumstances. Empowering them in the exercise of informed choice is integral to assisting self-recovery. There are neither tools nor knowledge to effectively support this at scale. The challenge for the humanitarian community, as well as national and local organisations, is to support this inevitable process of self-recovery.  While efforts are made to include Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) into many emergency and recovery shelter interventions, these activities are often very narrow in scope, frequently limited to the printing of simple guidance sheets. These have very little impact on resilience of self-built housing stock. We know that simply informing people about risk - poor engineering, construction, and hazard risk  -  does not result in changed behaviour (van Wijk 1995), or in better, safer homes and communities. We also know there are no universal solutions. Evidence from post-disaster needs-assessments shows that families rapidly rebuild their homes with little or no knowledge of safer building techniques or the environmental factors that may increase their vulnerability. However there is evidence that demand for technical assistance can be very high soon after a rapid onset disaster. Only 12% of respondents interviewed for a CARE Nepal survey were able to name any techniques for improving seismic performance of a house, but 60% listed building safety as a top concern.  Currently, the international aid community lacks skills to adequately contextualise each unique situation, arrive rapidly and reliably at key technical messages and effectively transmit and promote those messages in a way that allows informed choice and ensures maximum acceptance by the affected population. Current post-disaster programmes do not systematically or effectively address the motivations (want), resources (can) and abilities (know-how) of beneficiaries in the process of self-recovery.  Through the multidisciplinary research of scientists, engineers and humanitarian practitioners, this proposal addresses the needs of those who self-build. It specifically addresses two important gaps: - Technical best practice - what key construction and siting messages will make a substantial improvement to self-building in different contexts? - Changing current practice - getting the message across; what communication and promotion methods really work; learning from current technology transfer and public education approaches.

  <capital-spend percentage="The overall objective of this project is to lay the foundation for, and develop, a longer-term programme of multi-disciplinary research to achieve resilient homes and communities in countries at high risk of natural disasters. The programme includes research institutions, humanitarian organisations, civil society and private sector expertise with a global presence. The overarching goal of this longer-term programme is to develop substantive knowledge of, and support to, the inevitable self-recovery process after sudden and slow-onset natural disasters: communities will be more resilient and family homes will be safer and better able to resist hazards, avoiding injury, death and economic loss.   This project will be the first step in a longer-term collaboration to develop and disseminate a broad understanding of support to self-recovery after disasters, its implementation in practice and its impact. Through research, consultation, first-hand case-studies and initial development of tools and guidance, this preliminary project will set the groundwork for achieving the over-arching goal. Subsequent years will test and refine the tools and approaches developed, further contextualising these to different hazards, building typologies and cultures.   The project will research, review, evaluate and test assumptions and map actors, processes and the flow of resources in the self-recovery process to establish and design a practice-based research programme, leading to fundamental change and improvement in post-disaster building practices. In order to lay the foundation for this longer-term programme, the specific objectives of this proposal are:  1. To create a strong network of multi-disciplinary actors to collaborate on research, development and dissemination of knowledge, tools and good practice. 2. To identify key gaps in knowledge and understanding of self-recovery after disasters in order to inform future research. 3. To take a multidisciplinary approach (physical and social science, engineering and humanitarian) to develop a joint understanding of how scientific, engineering and construction knowledge currently support the self-recovery process and how this can be improved in future.  4. To propose an analysis methodology for understanding self-recovery after disasters that cause widespread damage to housing; this will identify drivers for, and barriers to, self-recovery and inform decision-making about how humanitarian actors can intervene to effectively and meaningfully support self-recovery and construction of safer houses. 5. To identify and develop implementation tools and guidance needed to undertake programmes that support self-recovery of safer shelter and create prototypes of some of these tools.  6. To disseminate and share widely the findings of the research through existing humanitarian and academic networks, through the network of CARE country offices in LDC/LMICs and through workshops and conferences.  Specific activities to achieve these objectives include:  1. Establish a steering group drawn from academic and humanitarian organisations, and private practice.   2. Two multidisciplinary case studies of post-disaster responses and scope the potential for a third. These are likely to be Philippines (Typhoon Haiyan), Nepal (2015 earthquake) and Vanuatu (Cyclone Pam), subject to confirmation.  3. A series of internal workshops in the UK to set criteria and monitor progress. Although these are internal working meetings, they will also include external stakeholders and members of the steering group. 4. Two science, engineering and humanitarian symposia, one in UK, one in a LDC/LMIC country (potentially a case-study country). Particular effort will be made to include participants from the global south. 5. Technical advice and support to self-recovery programmes in disaster response through CARE International&apos;s country offices."></capital-spend>
