   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In partnership with the Chinese National Museum of Ethnology (CNME), the UCL Institute of Archaeology research team will trace the development and reception of the &apos;China Craft&apos; exhibition from Nov 2018 to Oct 2020. This project focuses on how traditional ethnic-heritage crafts across China can be developed and remade in collaboration with the &apos;cultural creative&apos; industries. In particular, it seeks to contribute to the wellbeing and economic sustainability of local communities, particularly in rural areas. The UCL team of researchers will function as a critical friend for the project. We regard the China Craft project as a vibrant space for remaking both ethnic-heritage, but also the practice of exhibition-making itself. The project knits together a network of individuals and institutions with diverse interests and pursuits - academic, commercial, curatorial. It therefore creates a space for encounter and communication, as well as a means of studying how the cultural creative industry, known in China as wenchuang, functions. Since China joined the UNESCO Creative Cities Network (UCCN) in 2004, the creative sector has been playing an increasingly significant role in the growth of China&apos;s economy. The wenchuang economy refers to a set of cultural, artistic, technological and service industries, which have been incorporated widely into the economic strategies of cities across the country, linked closely with city branding, urban planning and the development of tourism.&apos; Following the notion that heritage is constantly &apos;in the making&apos; (Harvey 2010; Svensson and Maags 2018), we see the engagement with heritage in the wenchuang industries as an ongoing process of &apos;creative remaking&apos;, where heritage is given new forms and meaning, resulting in reconfigurations of the values of authenticity and creativity. By tracing the CNME&apos;s interactions with the other involved actors (V&amp;A Shenzhen, Yunnan Minzu University), we explore how China&apos;s wenchuang industry functions on both the local and international levels and attempt a critical understanding of its engagement with heritage. This &apos;remaking&apos; process ranges from the interactions between local craft people and ethnologists in Yunnan, to the manufacturing of heritage-inspired design products in the cities of Jingdezhen and Yiwu, and then to the V&amp;A&apos;s newly-built outpost in Shenzhen, which will be collaborating with the CNME in staging craft-themed design weeks.  The primary data for this project will come from a combination of workshops and ethnographic fieldwork to be held at each of the partner sites. Workshops will be conducted over a week-long period and will focus on creating an atmosphere that fosters dialogue and collaboration.   One of the main goals of the project is to create opportunities for dialogue among local craft people, museum/heritage professionals, academics, and designers. The research would benefit the craft people in local communities by incorporating their pursuits and concerns more significantly into the exhibition-making process. Through the non-hierarchical dialogues in the workshops, we aim to deepen their involvement in the China Craft project, from providing their knowledge to co-creating the exhibition. Most importantly, it would facilitate discussions on ways to develop a sustainable relationship between local ethic communities with the creative industry.   In keeping with the dialogic spirit of the project, we will be producing a series of podcasts that trace the development of the China Craft exhibition and explores some of the key debates about heritage and the creative economy in China today. For exhibition-developers, a downloadable booklet illustrates our workshops and exhibition-making process. Finally, our WeChat network will keep the public up-to-date with all the latest news about the project and allow you to communicate with the project team.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="1. Trace the development of the CNME&apos;s China Craft exhibition as a case study of wenchuang (cultural creative industry) in China, through interviews and participant observation. China Craft is a three-year project, launched by the NME that seeks to explore Chinese craft heritage and its potential for creative adaptation. In partnership with the CNME, we will act as critical friend to try and embed a craft ethos in the exhibition-making process.  2. Trace the broader network of partners involved in the creation of the exhibition, including Kunming University in Yunnan, the V&amp;A&apos;s Design Society in Shenzhen, and factories involved in the production of craft products in Jingdezhen and Yiwu. This will provide an overview of how wenchuang functions on a local and, in the case of the V&amp;A&apos;s outpost in Shenzhen, an international level. The China Craft project perfectly links the themes of heritage, design and the creative economy. It maps out a broad geographical layout and engages a large network of practitioners from across the heritage industry and creative economy.   3. Visit each of these sites for week-long periods to conduct workshops about the exhibition-making process. These workshops will encourage dialogue between actors from the various partners and create spaces for challenges to be dealt with through the process of creative remaking. In total eight workshops are planned. The workshops will adopt an open dialogic approach, emphasizing creating conditions of equality among the different stakeholders involved in the exhibition-making process. This will promote greater trust and more sustainable relationships between the different partners involved.   4. Present in the finished exhibition a new way by which ethnic heritage is conceived and displayed in China, not as fixed and essentialist but as dynamic and connected to contemporary design practices.   5. Produce an online downloadable guide to this exhibition-making and workshop process, which imbeds a craft-ethos into exhibition development in China that champions creativity, openness and the power of making.  6. Create an accompanying ten-episode podcast that charts the exhibition-making process from start to finish, which encapsulates the project&apos;s focus on dialogue and making.   7. Establish a WeChat network of curators, designers, makers and crafts people in both China and the UK, which builds to future collaborations beyond the two-year lifespan of the project."></capital-spend>
