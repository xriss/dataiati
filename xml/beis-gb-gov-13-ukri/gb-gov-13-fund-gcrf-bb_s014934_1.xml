   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Across Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) approximately 660 million hectares of land is degraded, leading to low land productivity, poor and variable biomass production, inability to graze livestock and lack of resilience of agriculture to climate extremes. Land degradation is a major factor in the instability of crop and livestock production, leading to a significant burden of food and income security.    Extensive forest areas of East Africa have been converted to grasslands and to agriculture, largely driven by the expansion of crop-livestock farming, a preferred livelihood option in these regions to minimize the impacts of climatic risks. Once land is converted for agriculture, a combination of low input of nutrients and high grazing pressure, with social and climatic changes leads to this land becoming degraded. Once degraded is it extremely difficult to recover the functionality of the land leading to a downward spiral of productivity and resulting in systems that are less resilient to climate extremes. Local farmers, who rely on livestock for their livelihoods, seek new land for grazing within natural ecosystems. As a consequence, high livestock densities have led to larger loads of nutrients and sediments entering water systems and are releasing greater emissions of harmful greenhouse gases.  Land restoration must be a priority if we are to secure future food supplies, and protect high carbon and high biodiversity ecosystems across East Africa. This project seeks to explore the use of a novel combination of different local grassland plants species, coupled with new livestock management models to help farming communities in Kenya to recover degraded grazing lands. Working in partnership with local farmers and community based organisations, the project team aims to improve grassland productivity, thereby increasing the quality of livestock fodder, and nutrient content of manure. This will lead to restored functionality of soils for future plant production and a greater degree of resilience to future climate shocks.   Specifically, this interdisciplinary project will use a multi-scale approach to:   1) Study the primary productivity and state of degradation of land at two contrasting sites of the densely populated highlands of Kenya;   2) Explore the biological and socio-ecological characteristics of these different sites and use complimentary field and plot scale studies to identify the mechanisms involved in a process of successful restoration using plant biodiversity and;   3) Explore alternative management and regulatory scenarios with local farmers and stakeholders, highlighting the benefits for livestock production and for ecosystem conservation.  4) Engage key stakeholders to understand restoration needs and constraints and to build the necessary capacity  Halting and reversing land degradation in Africa is urgent given the projections of human population increase, the large proportion of the African population living in a rural setting, and the prominence of agriculture as a source of income across the continent. Single interventions such as increasing mineral fertiliser use or the supplementation of livestock feeds are unlikely to be sufficient to achieve nutritional security given the large scale of the problem, and the increases in productivity and new land that may be required. Protecting natural ecosystems such as forests and grasslands, and restoring soil resilience is also needed to reduce negative feedbacks on the regional climate system including livestock production of greenhouse gases and buffering negative impacts of climate change on the water cycle.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="The overarching goal of this project is to elucidate the underlying biological mechanisms behind successful restoration of degraded grazing lands in the highlands of Kenya, supported by an understanding of the required governance of resources required to sustain success. Specifically, we seek to exploit plant biodiversity and livestock management for the recovery of degraded lands, thereby increasing the quality of livestock fodder, livestock productivity and nutrient content of manures.   In order to achieve this aim, the project has a number of specific objectives:  1) Identify states of degradation and their association with soil and ecosystem functioning, and livestock management in Kenyan highlands to derive practical metrics  Each degradation state is associated with specific soil and vegetation characteristics. Based on an improved understanding of these characteristics farming communities will be able i) to select landscapes that can be restored, ii) learn how to monitor a recovering soil, and which plant species may be able to help the process and iii) to know key properties that dictate whether or not an ecosystem is recovering or degrading. For each degradation state, we will understand soil, vegetation and management by conducting complementary soil and vegetation mapping and household surveys.  2) Identify the role of plant functional diversity in building soil functioning to support plant production and high feed quality in degraded grasslands  We will experimentally test how a range of plant species with contrasting functional traits perform in degraded soils and characterize their impact on multiple soil functions that underpin the restoration of degraded grassland soils; further, using the same pool of plant species, we will experimentally test the potential for different trait-based groups and their combinations to enhance the functioning of degraded Kenyan soils during initial stages of restoration, ultimately benefitting plant production and feed quality. Combined with information from 1, these experiments will identify interventions with potential to accelerate the restoration of degraded grassland soils in this region of East Africa.  3) Define opportunities to manage landscape level interactions to support restoration and communities livelihoods through a validation of alternative scenarios  Using information from 1 and 2, we will quantify livestock productivity and investigate how productivity and grassland degradation states are explained by management, and land tenure and governance arrangements. We will build scenarios for experimentation with local communities in Kenya and use the information derived in 1 and 2 to stimulate the discussions. Scenarios and simulation models will be used to quantify investments needed, benefits and trade-offs in the use of resources resulting from different restoration pathways, and to map the institutional and governance arrangements required for successful restoration.  4) Engage key stakeholders to understand restoration needs and constraints and to build capacity  Information gathered from the initial workshop and during the 2-years project will be fed into the research cycle to enrich the research and maximise the chances of achieving impacts on the ground. Critical gaps in knowledge and capacity will be covered by targeted training and knowledge exchange events. Each member of the research team will allocate time to participate of these activities including sessions with the local and the national media. These activities are targeted to land use managers and livestock keepers, to natural resources management authorities, and to undergraduate and postgraduate students to prepare the next generation for the future challenges."></capital-spend>
