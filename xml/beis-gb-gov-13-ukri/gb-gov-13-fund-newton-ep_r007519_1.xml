  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed research brings together the research strengths from the UK and China in collaboration with leading organisations and industry partners to design resilient floating offshore Renewable Energy (ORE) systems with a focus towards floating wind, that withstand the extreme typhoon conditions in China.  The vision of the project is to establish an enhanced met ocean characterisation for the South China Sea, allowing to inform the development of a resilient and robust approach for ORE systems enabling industrial readiness. With the main aim directed towards floating offshore wind (FOW), innovative porous offshore wind platforms will be assessed to determine effective configurations of designs, and associated damping mechanisms through mooring systems and wave absorption. The proposal will explore advanced numerical modelling approaches that account for complex coupled behaviour, yet are efficient enough to support engineering iterations. The effective identification of spatial and temporal environmental extreme events will be fundamental for robust and efficient designs. The engineering focus lies on the quantification and validation of the load reduction potential of the novel floating offshore wind platform innovations, which have been promising in early preliminary studies by the applicants.  The detailed environmental load assessment combined with novel engineering design, advanced coupled computational modelling and risk-based optimisation methods will provide an understanding of the nonlinear coupled response behaviour and how novel platform design can reduce these extreme loadings to foster more resilient and economical floating offshore wind installations. The FOW designs will be evaluated through a risk-based design optimisation algorithm to tailor the configurations to the level of environmental exposure and acceptable risk.  Whilst the primary benefits will be realised in China there are also clear benefits to the UK, in that the future offshore floating development will very likely be delivered in partnership with UK plc companies that are already very active in the offshore wind sector and are very supportive of the proposed work, as it offers innovative design solutions and interesting routes to a dynamic market.  Specific objectives of this proposal are:  i) to assess the offshore floating wind environmental conditions in detail to inform the engineering design and computational modelling, as well as the strategic electricity infrastructure planning; ii) to enable innovations and address barriers hindering the industrial roll-out of FOW in China through fundamental collaborative research; iii) to develop advanced numerical modelling for complex coupled aero-hydro-elastic behaviour of floating offshore wind turbines employing CFD and PIC methods; iv) to optimise floating offshore wind installations for typhoon-prone areas, assessing the configuration and stability of aero-hydro-elastic coupled floating offshore systems in Chinese environmental conditions; v) to develop an integrated design methodology for floating offshore wind platforms that yields more resilient and robust designs, using risk-based reliability methods; vi) to establish an Innovation network spanning research and industry through capacity building and targeted UK-China industry forums; vii) to establish a UK-China Centre for Offshore Energy (UKC-COE) with the remit of enabling environmental friendly energy generation in an international development context.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project will enhance the design and development of floating offshore renewables, in particular offshore floating wind as commercially viable electricity infrastructure through a risk based approach allowing to build resilience against extreme events. The socio-economic challenge is the increasing energy need in emerging economies, such as China, which causes grave air pollution and CO2 emissions. The project work focusses on China, where heavy air pollution alone is estimated to have caused 2.2million premature deaths. Sustainable energy generation, thus replacing coal-fired power plants is one of the solutions to address this problem. In China specifically, the energy demand is at its highest along the industrialised and densely populated coastal regions. The challenge for a renewable energy supply is that the solar, wind and hydro resource are primarily located in the NW and SW of China and electricity transmission via the grid is already constrained. The Chinese government therefore has identified offshore wind energy as one of the primary energy resources with a potential of over 500GW of installed capacity, capable to produce up to 1,500 TWh of electricity per year, which would offset as many as 340 coal-fired power stations. Whilst initial installations in shallow waters near the coast have been made, over 1/3rd of the resource is located in deeper water (&gt;40m) and will require floating installations.   Offshore wind energy generation is currently more expensive than fossil fuels in China, and the risk of typhoon damage is high. The project has a fourfold approach: 1.Enhanced environmental modelling to accurately determine extreme loadings; 2. Assessment of novel, porous floating offshore wind structures and active damping mechanisms; 3. Enhanced numerical modelling techniques to efficiently calculate the complex coupled behaviour of floating wind turbines; 4. Risk based optimisation of devised designs and engineering implications.   This combined approach is carried through distinguished scientific research expertise and leading industry partners in the field of offshore wind. To maximise the impact and benefits of this research the project places large emphasis on knowledge exchange activities, industry liaison and the establishment of cross-country research capacity to foster the global commercial realisation of offshore floating wind energy.  The project is an interdisciplinary, cross-country collaboration with leading research Universities and industry partners. The academic expertise from the University of Exeter, the University of Edinburgh and University of Bath in the areas of Environmental assessment and modelling, Hydrodynamic design, Advanced computational modelling and risk based reliability engineering is matched with Dalian University of Technology and Zhejiang University as two of the leading Chinese research institutions in Ocean Engineering and Offshore Renewable Energy.  Whilst the project carries out fundamental engineering research, strong industrial partnerships in both countries will facilitate industry advice and subsequent research uptake. The strong industrial UK support for this project through the ORE Catapult, DNV-GL, ITPE is matched with wider international support through EDF (France) and DSA (Canada), as well as the Chinese project partners MingYang Wind Power Ltd (3rd largest wind manufacturer in China), the National Ocean Technology Centre, NOTC, (institutional responsibility for marine spatial planning) and the &apos;Shanghai Investigation, Design &amp; Research Institute&apos;, SIDRI (State-owned offshore wind project developer in China), demonstrates the timeliness and industrial relevance of the proposed research. All partners are committed to support the establishment of a long-lasting research base to develop resilient and cost effective offshore floating wind energy systems through collaborative research and innovation efforts, as well as capacity building and knowledge exchange.</narrative>
