  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">A Novel High Intensity Short Interval Dance Intervention for Non Communicable Disease (NCD) Prevention in Asian Indian Adolescent Girls - THANDAV - a pilot study. This proposed developmental grant protocol will take place in India with a duration of 18 months. We will test a personalized exercise and education intervention, aided by digital technology to deliver this novel &apos;THANDAV&apos; (Taking HIIT And Dance to Adolescents for Victory over NCDs) intervention.   The principal research question will be - Can a culturally appropriate high intensity short duration (10 min) dance intervention become sustainable exercise in Asian Indian girls aged 10- 17 years to improve their physical fitness and  prevent NCDs? The burden due to NCDs has reached explosive proportions with the largest increases happening in low and middle-income countries like India. Exercises levels are abysmally low in India with women being less active than men. The benefits of physical activity in adolescents and youth are well established, with most global guidelines recommending at least 60 minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity per day. Evidence suggests that adolescence is the time of steepest decline in physical activity, thus making our chosen cohort high-risk age group for diabetes and other non-communicable diseases.  The age of onset of type 2 diabetes in India is in the age group of 25- 34 years. Hence, efforts to promote physical activity among adolescents and youth are essential.  The barriers to exercising in females include time constraints and exercise not being &apos;culturally acceptable&apos;.  Dance is a socially and culturally accepted form of activity in India. We hypothesize that the short duration and fun element of the THANDAV intervention, coupled with the cultural and social acceptability of dance, will aid the long-term sustainability of such an intervention, which is vital for NCD prevention. We aim to investigate the development, feasibility, acceptability of the intervention and resulting improvements in physical activity and fitness levels in adolescents. The primary outcome will thus be increases in physical activity as measured by step count leading to improvement in fitness levels as measured by heart rate of adolescent girls. After assessing the methodology and impact of the intervention through this pilot study, we plan to apply for the full trial grant wherein we will evaluate the sustainable impact of the THANDAV intervention with an improvised digital design on tangible metabolic health outcomes in a randomized controlled trial mode. The outcomes in the full trial grant will be metabolic parameters including weight, body fat, blood pressure, glucose, lipids, insulin along with important outcome measures including sustainability and scalability.   MDRF has been collaborating with multi-disciplinary investigators from the University of Dundee (UoD), Scotland (UK) since 2017 as part of a 4-year NIHR Global Heath Research Unit on Global Diabetes Outcomes Research. The India-Scotland Partnership for Precision Medicine in Diabetes (INSPIRED) project aims to improve the understanding of genetic, lifestyle and environmental factors underlying the high burden of diabetes and its complications. The THANDAV proposal is an extension of this existing collaboration with Dr. Colin Palmer being the Co-Investigator from University of Dundee (UoD), Scotland (UK).</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">THANDAV - Taking HIIT ANd Dance to Adolescents for Victory over NCDs  To test the feasibility and acceptability of a novel, culturally-appropriate, 12- week dance based HIIT (High Intensity Interval Training) intervention and to measure its impact on physical activity and fitness levels in adolescent girls (Intervention group (n=50) receive THANDAV routine and Control group (n=50) do not receive THANDAV or any other intervention) with the ultimate goal of NCD prevention. The following will be evaluated at baseline and post intervention in the intervention vs control group:  a.   step counts (marker of physical activity) and heart rates (marker of fitness)  b.   changes in body weight and body fat.  c.   the engagement, usability and preferences of the THANDAVITES (users of the on-line THANDAV website)</narrative>
