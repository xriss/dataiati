   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Tuberculosis (TB) is a major cause of the global disease burden. We plan to investigate whether the human immunity to tuberculosis as a result of BCG vaccination is different after individuals complete treatment for latent TB.  This will allow us to test whether BCG can protect individuals following clearance of the tuberculosis bacterium. We would develop a partnership between UK and Brazilian researchers to undertake the following:    Review and summarise any published studies of BCG assessing protection after treatment for latent TB. We will use this information and expert views to try and quantify the impact of vaccinating people after TB treatment.  We would organise two workshops, one in Brazil and one in the UK that strengthen the existing collaboration between partners. We will use these workshops to develop our pilot study and to plan the grant application for a major trial.  We would ensure there are training opportunities in the UK for Brazilian students, and UK students in Brazil.  We will undertake a pilot study in Brazil to investigate the feasibility of undertaking a trial over a 6 month period. The pilot study would examine immunological changes after BCG vaccination in 40 people immediately following the completion of treatment for latent TB.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="The overall aim of this collaboration is to develop a partnership that would bring together two major programmes of work in epidemiology in the UK and immunology in Brazil to inform the development of a major trial that would assess whether the efficacy of BCG vaccination in individuals with latent TB infection (LTBI) is improved by treating pre-existing latent infection.  The partnership will undertake a systematic evaluation of the published evidence in this area, develop capacity and a joint coherent working plan, and undertake pilot work.  Specific objectives include: To undertake a feasibility study to determine whether a randomised controlled trial of the efficacy of BCG vaccination can be undertaken in individuals who have completed treatment for LTBI compared to untreated individuals  To investigate the immunological response to BCG vaccination in individuals who have completed treatment for latent tuberculosis infection compared to that in untreated latently infected individuals, and those with no evidence of latent tuberculosis."></capital-spend>
