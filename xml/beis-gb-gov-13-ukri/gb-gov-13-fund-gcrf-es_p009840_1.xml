   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Touristic Competition, Securitisation, and the Creation of (In)Securities in Guatemala</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The United Nations has declared 2017 the International Year of Sustainable Tourism for Development and has highlighted sustainable tourism development as one of the key Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) under SDG8 &apos;Decent Work and Economic Growth&apos;. The proposed Fellowship contributes to these global efforts by highlighting the role of one global tourism competition practice - touristic securitisation - in creating new (in)securities in Guatemala, and thus contributing to and/or challenging the goals of sustainable and ethical tourism development. It does so by focusing on three cross-cutting themes: intersecting inequalities, the role of new technologies, and the increasing role of non-profit development organisations in tourism in the global South. The project has the following key objectives: - Influence global and Guatemalan tourism knowledge and policies by raising awareness of the ways diverse touristic securitisation practices can contribute to but also challenge sustainable and ethical tourism development, as well as co-produce alternative tourism security practices with tourism stakeholders for more sustainable and ethical touristic futures. - Develop an embodied analysis of touristic securitisation which highlights how tourism security practices are informed by and informing of diverse intersecting inequalities, thus supporting efforts at mainstreaming gender (and other inequalities) in tourism policy and development, and encouraging practices which lead to greater gender equality. - Provide a social science account of the increasingly important role of new technologies in touristic securitisation, highlighting their contribution to and/or challenge of sustainable and ethical tourism development, thus complicating the simplistic assumption of &apos;smart tourism&apos; = &apos;safe tourism&apos; and raising awareness of the need for ethical, legal, and social analyses of socio-technical touristic securitisation practices. - Raise global and Guatemalan awareness of the increasingly important role of non-profit development organisations as tourism actors, especially the ways in which their own touristic practices may (unintentionally) challenge the development of sustainable and ethical tourism in the global South, and develop official guidance for these organisations. - Contribute to general knowledge regarding tourism development and competition in Guatemala, as well as the different dimensions of touristic securitisation, especially by publishing my PhD thesis as a book, by publishing three academic journal articles, and by hosting and/or attending international and national conferences/symposiums. - Consolidate and expand my academic and policy expertise in the area of touristic securitisation, which, as recent global events have suggested, will certainly become an increasingly important topic and global challenge in the coming years. - Maintain and grow my global and Central American network of scholars, practioners, and non-governmental organisations working on similar topics, increasing knowledge exchange and co-production.  - Refresh and improve my Spanish language skills, obtaining certification of Spanish as a second language (DELE C1), which would increase my ability to engage with Latin American policy-makers, scholars, and communities in the years to come. - Engage and share learning with the North West Doctoral Training Centre and the Economic and Social Research Centre, as well as the Violence &amp; Society UNESCO Centre, Security Lancaster, the Institute for Social Futures, and the Centre for Mobilities Research at Lancaster University.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Tourism is the world&apos;s largest industry and a key tool of development. This is especially the case in the global South, which is thought to have a touristic competitive advantage and is increasingly tourism-dependent. While the ability of countries, organisations, and individuals to attract and satisfy tourists is of acute developmental concern, the link between tourism and development is not to be taken for granted. There are different models of tourism, with some deemed more economically developmental and beneficial to locals than others. In seeking to make tourism work for development, the United Nations World Tourism Organisation calls for &apos;sustainable&apos; and &apos;ethical&apos; tourism forms. However, as evermore countries turn to tourism as a development tool, competition to attract and satisfy tourists has exploded and intensified. In this highly competitive environment, truly sustainable and ethical tourism is made harder to achieve and maintain. A key global challenge, then, is how, in an increasingly competitive environment, can sustainable and ethical tourism be encouraged and supported? In taking up this challenge, this project turns to the global tourism competition practice of touristic securitisation, or the practice of securing tourists in attempts to secure tourism economies and development. In many places in the global South, sustainable tourism is hampered by questions of personal security. Indeed, tourist flows are highly affected by perceived risks and concrete insecurity events. Likewise, the ability of any one place to attract tourists is deeply connected to the perceived and actual personal (in)securities of tourists. While many experts offer advice on how to create personal security for tourists and, thus, hopefully improve tourism destination competitiveness, the practices involved in the securitisation of tourists/tourism can also create new insecurities which defy the principles of sustainable and ethical tourism. In seeking to encourage and support sustainable and ethical tourism, this project raises awareness of the diverse ways touristic securitisation practices can contribute to and/or challenge the goals of sustainable and ethical tourism, as well as co-produces alternative touristic security practices for more sustainable and ethical touristic futures. It does so in the context of Guatemala. Located in Central America, Guatemala is better known for poverty, violence, and insecurity than for tourism. Nevertheless, the Guatemalan government has firmly set its sights on becoming one of the world&apos;s most visited destinations. The project builds on ethnographic research on the everyday practices of global tourism competition in the small colonial city of La Antigua Guatemala (Antigua), Guatemala&apos;s main tourism destination. For people living and/or working in Antigua, questions of touristic (in)securities dominate everyday life. Indeed, Antigua-locals clearly highlight how tourists&apos; perceptions or experiences of insecurity in Guatemala put their economic security at risk and, thus, they aim to protect tourists in an attempt to protect their own livelihoods. In focusing on touristic securitisation practices, the project highlights how they are informed by and informing of intersecting inequalities, are increasingly enrolling new technologies, and how non-profit development organisations are playing important and under-recognised roles in touristic securitisation. While many of the touristic security practices employed in Antigua do indeed create greater security for (often foreign) tourists, others create new insecurities for both tourists and locals, thus defying the principles of sustainable and ethical tourism, and ultimately the use of tourism as a tool of development that can increase local wellbeing. Following, the project argues for an approach to touristic securitisation that de-centres the tourist and instead focuses on providing security for all.</narrative>
