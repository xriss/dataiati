   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Objectives: 1. To establish a centre comprising a multi-disciplinary, cross-cultural team of researchers, game developers, media technicians, policy makers and educational leaders with advanced skills in the use of frontier technologies in education settings and innovative communication strategies for addressing GBV at the global level and in specific socio-cultural contexts. We will do this by building capacity and supporting research career development through training at graduate, post-graduate; and early academic career levels 2.To utilise integrative mixed methods research to investigate distinctive and predominant forms of GBV in China, Pakistan, Uganda, Jamaica and the UK and factors that increase violence against women and girls. Working with both victims and perpetrators of GBV, researchers will establish what issues and problems exist, their etiology, how they develop (by incident and by lifetime), the role of upbringing, culture and gender identity and other factors that mitigate or reinforce GBV. Data analysis will include newly developing approaches such as SKAD (Sociology of Knowledge Analysis of Discourse) and Situational Analysis. The management of data analysis will be supported by the use of CAQDAS (Computer Assisted Qualitative Data Analysis). Using the knowledge derived from this research, country teams will determine the particular focus to be addressed by prosocial games and how these games will need to be modified to meet the specific needs of each country.   3.To develop anti-violence prosocial video games grounded within psychosocial theory for attitude and behaviour change and aimed at changing cultural, social, religious and other attitudes towards GBV in the five partner countries: Uganda, Pakistan, China, the UK and Jamaica. These prosocial gaming interventions will be used in schools and colleges to directly confront negative gendered attitudes, to raise awareness of GBV and to foster empathy towards victims of GBV 4.To work with education institutions in the partner countries to build education leadership skills for the design of curricula and context-suited educational interventions on GBV in order to provide the framework to support the introduction of prosocial computer games (pt.3) within schools and colleges. Targeting policy makers, school leaders, teachers and students, this objective seeks to promote understanding of and respect for the rights of women and girls and to emphasise the importance of accountability at individual and community levels in ensuring the safety and security of all community members, women and girls in particular. We will collaborate with third sector organisations and educationalists to identify best practice in games&apos; use. 5.To a) investigate psychosocial and cultural predictors of gender inequality and violence against women and girls in the participating countries; b) to investigate the impact of prosocial computer games on attitude/behaviour change, growth in empathy capacity and non-adversarial conflict resolution skills and, c) to produce robust scientific country-specific evidence of the effectiveness of prosocial gaming. We will do this by training researchers in advanced skills for survey instrument design and cultural validation and advanced statistical analysis. 6.To develop a Policy Hub to guide overarching and targeted actions at the strategic and operational levels across the five countries and to feed emerging results from research into policy formulation systems. We will provide training in policy development, analysis and evaluation and enhance skills to review progress made towards SDGs relating to gender equality and GBV 7.We will create The IDEA, a global media hub of Impact, Dissemination and Engagement Activities to underpin and reinforce social and behavioural change. The IDEA will work with civil society organisations in the creation of Public Engagement Plans and technical skills in the use of social media techniques for influence.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">VISION - To create a global research centre dedicated to research and serious gaming interventions designed to prioritise the rights of girls and women to live a life free from violence and to prevent violence against those most vulnerable (UN Sustainable Development Goal no. 5; UK Aid Strategy obj.4). The inter-disciplinary, cross-cultural, trans-continental research and partnership platform we will establish will result in a cadre of social scientists and game developers from four ODA-listed countries and the UK, skilled in the development of frontier technologies, advanced research methodologies and policy formulation focused on changing the social and cultural drivers of gender-based violence. This will be known as The DARE Centre: the Centre for the Development, Application, Research and Evaluation of Prosocial Games for the Prevention of Gender-based Violence.  International women rights agreements and domestic laws on gender-based violence (GBV) constitute an important step towards its prevention and elimination. However, there is an implementation gap between policy directives and what happens on the ground and unless people understand why regulations should be observed, they can be ineffective. Furthermore policy-led approaches do little to address the underlying cultural attitudes and values that drive GBV. Therefore, key to reducing violence against women and girls are innovative educational and social strategies which recognize the changing world we live within and challenge GBV related attitudes while they are being formed. Targeting children and youths seems crucial for transforming societies and creating a lasting change to the situation of women worldwide. Based on a unique partnership between institutions in the UK, China, Jamaica, Pakistan and Uganda, (the DARE countries) the Centre will build on the University of Huddersfield&apos;s existing domestic violence prevention project &apos;None in Three&apos; (www.noneinthree.org), to expand the social/cultural impact of prosocial games for the prevention of GBV globally. As evidenced by a growing body of research, the development of game technologies has created new outlets for the perpetration of GBV. However, given the appeal of novel technologies to younger generations, technological advancements may also be utilised for prosocial purposes to empower victims and catalyze action against violence. In recent years, researchers and educators have become increasingly aware of the potential benefits of prosocial video games. Unlike other media, video games scaffold children&apos;s experience using narrative and audio-visual content, as well as rules and objectives regulating players&apos; behaviour. A recent meta-analytic study revealed a significant association between playing a prosocial video game and positive social outcomes (Greitemeyer &amp; M&#xFC;gge, 2014). Violent video games, in turn, lead to a bias in the perception of what counts as aggressive, which evokes aggressive behaviour. Importantly, appropriately designed prosocial video games can enhance moral reasoning and foster empathy in a way that the mere presentation of facts through other media outlets cannot accomplish. Empathy reduces aggression and leads to prosocial actions, which strengthen social bonds and integrates societies. Indicative areas of work for the DARE Centre include: China - promoting a culture of protection against sexual abuse and prevention of trafficking; Jamaica - challenging the commoditization of sex and its relationship to the commercial sexual exploitation of children and promoting a culture of personal accountability among men and boys; Pakistan-improving child protection systems in relation to child marriage and honour killings, Uganda-domestic violence, the prohibition of Female Genital Mutilation and child marriage and, the UK-interpersonal violence within adolescent relationships. These activities all seek to prevent gender based violence and elevate the status of women and girls.</narrative>
