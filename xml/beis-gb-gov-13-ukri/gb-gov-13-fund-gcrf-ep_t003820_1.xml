   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Objective 1.  Establish an open, international, interdisciplinary GCRF Global Engagement Network to advance capacity for early warning, risk mapping and risk management of water-associated diseases. Such a network will add value to existing efforts by integrating the power of different specialities to address a common problem. By combining information acquired from the molecular level (genetics) to the regional scale (such as can be collected by remote sensing), it will be possible to address the issue of geo-referenced risk of exposure to water-associated diseases in a more complete and more penetrating manner than ever before. Because the environmental component of disease risk is subject to control by fluctuations in climate, the issue of resilience to climate change also arises, a topic that can be addressed through modelling, using the results obtained by the network for risk forecasting, together with expected changes in intensity and frequency of extreme weather events. Objective 2.  Organise two meetings of the network core members over a two-year period. The core members will include scientific experts as well as key stakeholders, and the meetings will develop the technical side of the programme. The technical meetings will review and synthesise the state-of-the-art science in the field of water-associated diseases. They will then consider how the science can be advanced by an integration of disciplines to combine conventional microbiology and epidemiology with geo-referenced environmental data collected by remote sensing. Together with other stakeholders, they will develop a plan for making the prototype early warning system and risk assessment map, to be implemented in a carefully-selected location. Objective 3.  Organise two related training courses, back-to-back with the core-member meetings, one in Brazil and one India. The training courses will exploit the opportunity provided by the presence of the technical experts to deliver the capacity development aspect of the proposal. The training to be provided will have three principal components. The first is the scientific background of risk mapping related to water-associated diseases. The critical requirement for an inter-disciplinary approach will be emphasised. The second component will discuss how to apply the geo-referenced risk maps in real-life situations, where existing political and public-health infrastructures must be taken into account. The final element will be enabling instruction so that participants will be able to apply for their own funding by responding to calls for proposals (for example under GCRF) accessible to the international community. An experienced research programme manager will deliver this important component. Objective 4.  Organise an open, international symposium, including both scientists and stakeholders, in the UK.  The international symposium will be held towards the end of the second year of the project, and is intended to showcase the achievements of the network and to demonstrate what can be achieved by the new, multidisciplinary approach to risk management of water-associated diseases. It will be an open meeting held in the UK, to which the media will be invited. It will articulate the legacy of the project. It will also establish the ways and means for the network to be maintained in the future. Objective 5.  Establish a network website for information exchange and for use as a vehicle in related outreach activities. The website is seen as the key vehicle for day-to-day communication between the network members; for attracting new members; and for disseminating the early results of the network activities. The assistant to the Network Director in Brazil will be responsible for maintaining the website.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The ONWARD Network (Open Network for Water-Related Diseases) is dedicated to forecasting, early warning and risk mapping for water-associated diseases through use of remote sensing, field observations and mathematical modelling. Our vision is to enable cost-effective, regularly updated, geo-referenced early warning for areas vulnerable to water-associated diseases, which in turn will enable preventive measures to be deployed in a timely manner to minimise the probability of epidemics. Our long-term vision is to establish a system that will be applicable broadly, in a variety of localities and for a variety of diseases. By &quot;water-associated&quot; disease, we mean a rather broad class, including diarrhoeal diseases such as cholera; skin diseases associated with water-borne bacteria or metazoan parasites; vector-borne diseases such as malaria and dengue fever; and others such as hepatitis. Any or all of them will be relevant to the activities of the network. The &quot;water&quot; involved may be fresh, or brackish or coastal seawater. The network will respond primarily the GCRF Challenge of Global Health (infectious diseases), and secondarily to that of Resilience to Environmental Shocks and Change (since outbreaks of water-associated diseases are affected by extreme weather events, expected to become more frequent as a result of climate change).  The network will also address UN Sustainable Development Goal 3, Target 3d, to &quot;Strengthen the capacity of all countries, in particular developing countries, for early warning, risk reduction and management of national and global health risks.&quot;  According to the World Health Organisation, some two billion people use faecally-contaminated drinking water, putting them at risk of death or chronic poor health from water-borne infectious diseases such as cholera, dysentery, typhoid and polio. Provision of safe drinking water is hostage to the influence of extreme weather and flooding. Apart from the fatalities, the effect of a chronic burden of lower-level infection by water-associated diseases is antagonistic to the maintenance of a healthy work force and to the well-being of society in general, to the detriment of sustainable development. For example, cholera kills an estimated 95,000 people every year, but it also makes another 2.9 million seriously ill with a debilitating disease. Hence the need to address, in addition, the resilience of communities to perturbations of the safe drinking water supply under extreme weather events associated with a changing climate. Before now, our ability to develop early warning, risk reduction and management of national and global health risks due to water-associated diseases has been limited by mutual isolation of the scientific communities whose collective effort is required to make progress. Forecasting outbreaks of water-associated diseases and their geo-referenced risk mapping is a complex matter for which the collaboration of experts from several disciplines (ranging from environmental biochemistry, genetics, molecular biology, social sciences and epidemiology to remote sensing and modelling) is needed if we are to make real advances. Hitherto, the required experts have rarely encountered each other in a scientific setting. A multidisciplinary network is essential to foster exchange of ideas between them, and so build a collaborative approach to a difficult problem by uniting them behind a common target. We believe that progress in early warning, risk forecasting and risk management of water-associated diseases will be possible through the combined efforts of specialists in the stated disciplines. Establishment of a related network is the perfect way to bring this about. An international team of outstanding experts, as well as related stakeholders, has been assembled to undertake the work. The network will be an open one. As well as the research activity, there will be a component of capacity building delivered through two training courses.</narrative>
