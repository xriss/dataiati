   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The overarching aim of this proposal is to create a network of researchers on biting midges, sandflies and blackflies and the pathogens they transmit with a view to improving scientific collaboration. The primary justification for this network is that these three vector groups share many similar technical challenges in research in addition to being susceptible to global loss of critical mass in research. These challenges span a wide range of areas including studies of vector ecology, disease epidemiology and insect genomics. By bringing the groups together we intend to make each more sustainable in addition to improving links to other vector groups. To achieve this aim we have the following objectives: 1. To enhance core experimental planning, execution and analysis for study of these three vector groups. A key challenge in initiating studies of biting midges, sandflies and blackflies is in initiating research with a solid underpinning of knowledge when this is restricted to a few specialist scientists. For inexperienced workers, this is a daunting task, not least because it requires considerable experience to be realistic in plan science realistically. An exacerbating factor for all groups, is that the underpinning taxonomic framework for studies tends to be weak and largely based upon morphological expertise of variable quality and accessibility. This is the single biggest current challenge in producing studies that are robust and comparable.          2. To enhance transferable skills in workers to increase resilience during fluctuations in funding. All three neglected vector groups suffer from substantial fluctuations in funding according to their requirement in disease control efforts. This is currently particularly true of blackfly research where the number of entomologists involved in research has declined in recent years dramatically. We intend to provide methods for workers in these groups to both transfer between these three groups but also to additional vectors.   3. To fund pump prime studies that will validate techniques which will be transformative in the study of all three groups and underpin ODA applications. The primary aim of the projects funded within the network will be to provide a solid base in validated research techniques that can then be exploited by multiple groups in a wide range of future ODA applications. These techniques will be examined under field conditions relevant to the epidemiology of disease and assessed across multiple vector groups. This approach will benefit the communities rather than specific researchers and timely release of results in an open access format will be a feature of studies that are funded.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The vector-borne disease challenge this network addresses is to develop multidisciplinary techniques that can be used in research across three neglected vector groups: biting midges, sandflies and blackflies. These groups are responsible for the transmission of internationally important pathogens worldwide and disproportionately impact upon countries receiving official development assistance from the UK. At present, communication between communities studying midges, sandflies and blackflies is almost non-existent for a wide variety of reasons, mostly associated with differences in the type of pathogens each group transmits and the host in which they cause disease. The single most important bottleneck shared in research of all these haematophagous insects, however, is their small body size. This imposes constraints on a vast range of research areas from behavioural ecology to genomics and often precludes recruitment of new workers due to their perceived difficulty as subjects. When combined with fluctuations in funding that are an intrinsic factor in pathogen research this creates a significant challenge in retaining a critical mass of researchers, particularly in countries where medical and veterinary priorities change rapidly. By bringing together workers in two countries where research is relevant to development, we can make significant progress in translating techniques across all three vector groups and build a more resilient research base for these groups. The network management board contains acknowledged and established experts on biting midges, sandflies and blackflies and early career researchers with an equal gender balance. We will initially base the project in Bangladesh and Brazil where there are existing communities of workers on all three groups that remain entirely disconnected. We have therefore recruited management leads for both Brazil and Bangladesh who will work with the Director and co-Director to bring together workers through project meetings. At these meetings, we will use workshops to train students and early career researchers with a pragmatic approach in establishing a sufficient baseline of expertise to improve working practices. Areas that we feel can be significantly improved are in experimental design, taxonomy of insect fauna and practical fieldwork projects. We have also focussed on epidemiological techniques that share similarities between the groups including the analysis of surveillance data on spatial and temporal levels.  As part of the network, we will also fund six catalyst projects of up to &#xA3;100k across two calls. The aim of these projects will be to provide validated approaches for techniques that can be used across the three vector groups and potentially extended to others. There will be a clear emphasis during these projects in providing data quickly to as broad a proportion of the community as possible as the aim is to underpin larger collaborative applications. There will be a requirement for at least a proportion of each study to be conducted in either Brazil, or Bangladesh, or both countries. The development of south-south relationships will be a feature of the project as communities studying these vector communities in the two countries have few current lines of collaboration and face similar logistical issues in implementing research in the field. The use of students and early career researchers in these research projects will be encouraged and each will have a high profile on the network website to enhance career prospects.</narrative>
