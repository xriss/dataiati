  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Colombia is the second most biodiverse country in the world with a rural population of small-holder, low income farmers. As the demand for meat and dairy increases, livestock farming continues to expand onto land that is not apt for farming, causing environmental damage through forest clearance, loss of biodiversity and land degradation. Different national initiatives aim to encourage more sustainable farming that support farmers&apos; livelihoods, and protect the environment and its rich biodiversity. Silvo-pastoral farming is one of those initiatives as it combines forestry and grazing. The international Centre for Tropical Agriculture CIAT runs two interrelated projects, &quot;Livestock Plus&quot; and &quot;Sustainable Amazon Landscapes&quot; to encourage the adoption of silvo-pastoral farming. However, farmers find silvo-pastoral farming changes the landscape of their farm in ways that conflict with their ideas of what &apos;a good farm&apos; should look. These social factors, in combination with possible economic and agronomic influences, may limit the uptake of sustainable silvo-pastoral practices.   This interdisciplinary project brings together cultural geography, environmental economics and agricultural ecology to investigate the cultural and socio-economic reasons for low adoption of silvo-pastoral livestock farming practices that have been designed to protect and restore biodiversity in Colombia. It will also quantify the benefits of silvo-pastoral farming for plant and insect biodiversity, both for their intrinsic value but also the contribution it may make to support long-term sustainable production. In doing so, this research will provide evidence to underpin effective policy that allows intensification of livestock farming while supporting environmental priorities. This may encourage farmers to adopt more sustainable and biodiversity enhancing silvo-pastoral systems.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">General Research Objective:  To understand farmer cultural scripts on farm landscape and their role in farmer adoption and help quantify the biodiversity benefits of silvo-pastoral systems and forest in Colombia, with a view to contribute elements for an intervention that can address the conflict between cultural scripts and sustainable, environmentally-friendly livestock intensification.  Specific Research Objective:  1. Understand farmers&apos; cultural scripts on farm landscapes and the household factors, including gender, which determine whether they adopt or not silvo-pastoral livestock farming systems and conserve forests 2. Quantify the benefits of silvo-pastoral systems for plant and above-ground invertebrate biodiversity and examine how these benefits interact with local forests   Collaboration Objectives: 1. To add value to CIAT&apos;s silvo-pastoral project by building in biodiversity  2. To contribute to CIAT&apos;s capacity to understand farmers&apos; decisions to adopt silvo-pastoral systems that can be extrapolated to other CIAT projects 3. To contribute to CIAT&apos;s engagement with wider national plans including the ColombiaBIO initiative, the National Restoration Plan, the National Policy for the Integral Management of Biodiversity and its ecosystem services and the National Board for Sustainable Livestock.  Strategic Objectives: 1. To lay the foundations of an extended collaborative project expanding onto other ecosystem services 2. To identify a pathway to link 3 CIAT current projects (Livestock Plus, Sustainable Amazonia Landscapes and Vision Amazonia) and roll-out the protocols delivered by this project throughout the wider Amazonia region 3. To produce scientific evidence to support public policy decision-making seeking to harmonise livestock intensification and biodiversity protection priorities</narrative>
