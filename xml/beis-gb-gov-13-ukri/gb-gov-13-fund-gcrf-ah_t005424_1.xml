   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Culture for Sustainable and Inclusive Peace (CUSP) - Development Award</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Please note. We use the word &apos;women&apos; to refer to people who self-identify as women.   This Development Award (DA) has the following aims:  A. Strengthen and capacitate the research base on conflict transformation and cultures of peace through mutual design of full Network Plus application B. Capacitate all partners to carry out decolonising research C. Develop partners&apos; capabilities to progress the Network Plus proposal and/or the knowledge and know-how to actively pursue funding calls  To achieve these aims, the DA will pursue the following objectives: 1. Collaborate online across borders towards the development of a full proposal for the Network Plus call, also addressing reviewers&apos; feedback. Prepare for interview. 2. Meet in person in the spring of 2020 so that  a. Should the CUSP proposal be successful, all partners can meet to: i. strengthen existing relationships and build new ones ii. carry out peer training in decolonial research theories and practices iii. set in place governance and management structures  iv. plan forward for Network Plus next stages  b. Should the CUSP proposal not be successful, non-academic LMIC partners can meet to:  i. receive peer training on the requirements of GCRF funding (e.g. in relation to accountability, ethical requirements, safeguarding, due diligence, data management)  ii. draft a common funding strategy  iii. feedback LMIC partners&apos; responses to UKRI, so that LMIC partners&apos; knowledges and practices may be taken into consideration to complement current requirements and procedures.  Objective 1. Resources will be allocated to all partners to develop a full proposal for the CUSP Network Plus that effectively draws on all partners&apos; strengths and that responds to partners&apos; knowledge and expertise, ensuring that all are aware of what CUSP will enable them to do as well as what it will not. All CUSP partners have been engaged in collaborative projects for several years, but they have never been brought together as the specific constellation envisioned by the Network Plus proposal. Since the partners already know and trust each other, the writing up of the full proposal can be carried out remotely via computer-mediated tool. Drawing on digital tools already used effectively in some partnerships (e.g. Gaza) will minimise the environmental impact of international travel and the challenges of restrictive visa regulations. Using digital tools at this stage will also allow to retain funding to pursue Objective 2 later in the DA lifetime, as this objective (in its articulations) is central to ensure legacy and positive impact of the DA, whether the CUSP Network Plus proposal is successful or not.   Objective 2. A meeting in person will ensure a thorough practical induction of all partners if the CUSP proposal is successful, guaranteeing that all are aware of what the Network can do (and cannot do) and what it will require of all partners. It will also be a space for peer training on decolonising research practices. Should the CUSP application not be successful, the meeting will give LMIC non-academic partners the knowledge and know-how to actively engage with future GCRF funding calls, giving precedence to female participants (SDG 16 and SDG 5). Being aware of avenues for funding and of funding requirements and procedures will strengthen LMICs&apos; organisations, empowering them to initiate collaborations and to become reliable and knowledgeable partners for future funding calls. At the same time, the meeting will also become a safe space to discuss, debate and critique current funding requirements, and to identify potential strategies for a more inclusive approach by future funding calls. The result will be akin to what Bartlett et al. (2015) advocate in relation to Indigenous and non-Indigenous knowledges: adopting a &apos;two-eyed seeing&apos; approach that draws on best practices from a range of different traditions.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Development Award (DA) progresses the Culture for Sustainable and Inclusive Peace (CUSP) Networks Plus proposal to full stage application. Concurrently, the DA sets in place structures and strategies should CUSP proposal be successful and strengthens the capabilities of partner non-academic organisations should the proposal not be successful. By focusing on capability building for funding applications, the DA will have a positive impact regardless of the outcome of the CUSP proposal.   CUSP draws together well-established partnerships between academic and non-academic institutions and organisations in LMIC countries that experience situations of protracted crisis and/or fragile environments. It focusses on the needs, experiences and capabilities of young people, and develops avenues for leadership by women. CUSP addresses the call &quot;Preventing Conflict, Building Sustainable and Inclusive Peace&quot; to identify strategies for conflict transformation through arts and cultural work. Led by the University of Glasgow in collaboration with Keele University, CUSP works with partners in Ghana, Mexico, Morocco, Palestine, Zimbabwe to identify and share successful grassroots conflict transformation practices and to encourage arts and cultural work as ways to promote conflict transformation, economic growth, and (digital) tourism.   The DA will allow partners to:  A. Strengthen and capacitate the research base on conflict transformation and cultures of peace through mutual design of full Network Plus application B. Capacitate all partners to carry out decolonising research C. Develop partners&apos; capabilities to progress the Network Plus proposal and/or the knowledge and know-how to actively pursue funding calls  To achieve these aims, the DA will pursue the following objectives: 1. Collaborate online across borders towards the development of a full proposal for the Network Plus call, also addressing reviewers&apos; feedback. Prepare for interview. 2. Meet in person in the spring of 2020 so that  a. Should the CUSP proposal be successful, all partners can meet to: i. strengthen existing relationships and build new ones ii. carry out peer training in decolonial research theories and practices iii. set in place governance and management structures  iv. plan forward for Network Plus next stages  b. Should the CUSP proposal not be successful, non-academic LMIC partners can meet to  i. receive peer training on the requirements of GCRF funding (e.g. in relation to accountability, ethical requirements, safeguarding, due diligence, data management)  ii. draft a common funding strategy  iii. feedback LMIC partners&apos; responses to UKRI, so that LMIC partners&apos; knowledges and practices may be taken into consideration to complement current requirements and procedures.  Should the CUSP proposal be successful, the meeting of all project partners will ensure: that all the necessary structures and procedures are put in place at the earliest possible time; peer training on decolonising research; relationship and trust among partners who have not yet worked together are achieved; short, medium- and long-term planning.  Should the full CUSP proposal not be successful, the meeting will draw together non-academic LMIC project partners, allowing them to build new synergies. It will offer peer-training to foster a clear and practical understanding of the requirements of UKRI funding; awareness of channels to actively pursue funding calls; and strengthen organisations&apos; structures so they can become reliable partners for future funding. The meeting will also lay the ground for the development of new funding applications according to needs and priorities collectively identified. Participation of women from LMIC organisations will be actively encouraged. Finally, partners will feed back the discussion to UK funders, highlighting practical and cultural challenges funding requirements and processes pose and identifying ways to make calls more inclusive</narrative>
