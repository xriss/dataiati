  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Over 4 years, this integrated proposal aims to reduce uncertainties in air quality prediction and forecasting for Delhi by undertaking process orientated observational and modelling analyses and then to derive sensitivity relationships linking air pollutant concentrations and emission controls. This new knowledge will be critical to formulate effective mitigation solutions for reducing air pollution over Delhi and surrounding regions. PROMOTE brings together a cross-disciplinary team of leading researchers from India and the UK to deliver these aims by addressing three key questions: Q1 What contribution is made by primary and secondary aerosols to the overall air pollution burden in Delhi during summer and winter conditions? Q2 How do the interactions between boundary layer dynamics and long-range transport of air pollution contribute to the local air quality of Delhi?   Q3 By taking account of local, urban and regional sources, what are the most effective emission controls for mitigation interventions that will lead to significant reductions in air pollution and exposure levels over Delhi and the wider National Capital Region?  Specific research objectives that address our three key questions are: O1 To examine the contribution of secondary aerosols to the air pollution burden in Delhi during distinct meteorological seasons by developing a new representative model scheme for subtropical urban environments (Q1); O2 To investigate how boundary layer interactions lead to high air pollution events during pre-monsoon and stable winter fog periods affecting Delhi (Q2);  O3 To quantify local, urban and regional contributions to Delhi&apos;s air quality through an improved understanding of aerosols, long-range transport and boundary layer processes (Q2); O4 To undertake an operational and diagnostic evaluation of the SAFAR air quality forecasting system for Delhi incorporating improved organic aerosol, aerosol-fog and boundary layer process representations (Q1, Q2); O5 To develop the first coupled local-urban-regional modelling system for predicting high resolution concentrations of PM2.5, PM10, NO2 and other pollutants with source attribution and then to quantify sensitivity response relationships for developing effective mitigation strategies for Delhi (Q2, Q3); O6 To synthesise and translate the outcomes of PROMOTE with other APHH projects for providing datasets for exposure and health studies and contributing to a roadmap for implementing effective local and regional mitigation strategies to meet current and future compliance and health requirements in Delhi and NCR (Q3). Through our analysis, we will deliver new knowledge on how local, urban and regional (LRT) sources of air pollution affect Delhi&apos;s air quality. With an improved OA scheme and improved understanding of BL dynamics, sensitivities between air pollutant concentrations and changes in local (e.g. traffic, industrial) and regional (LRT) contributions will be quantified with a new coupled multiscale modelling system for recommending interventions and mitigation options for Delhi.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Title: Process analysis, observations and modelling - Integrated solutions for cleaner air for Delhi (PROMOTE) Air pollution has been widely recognized as a major global health risk. Given that 1 in every 10 total deaths can be attributed to air pollution (World Bank 2016), there are major implications for the cities of the world. As part of the Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP), Delhi is subject to air pollution from a complex mixture of sources. As a consequence of the complex emissions and meteorology of the region, particulate matter (PM as PM10 and PM2.5), nitrogen oxides (NOx, NO2), sulphur dioxide (SO2), carbon monoxide (CO) and black carbon (BC) all peak during post-monsoon periods and remain elevated during winter making the National Capital Region (NCR) one of the most polluted areas. Open questions remain regarding the inability of models to accurately predict air pollution during winter time fog events and quantifying incoming air pollution from large distances into Delhi. Over 4 years, PROMOTE aims to reduce uncertainties in air quality prediction and forecasting for Delhi by undertaking process orientated observational and modelling analyses and to derive the most effective mitigation solutions for reducing air pollution over the urban and surrounding region. PROMOTE brings together a cross-disciplinary team of leading researchers from India and the UK to deliver the project aims. Its investigations will address three key questions: Q1 What contribution is made by aerosols to the air pollution burden in Delhi? Q2 How does the lower atmospheric boundary layer affect the long range transport of air pollution incoming into Delhi? Q3 What are the most effective emission controls for mitigation interventions that will lead to significant reductions in air pollution and exposure levels over Delhi and the wider National Capital Region?  To address the three key questions we will: 1 Examine the contribution of secondary aerosols to the air pollution burden in Delhi during distinct meteorological seasons by developing a new representative model scheme for subtropical urban environments; 2 Investigate how boundary layer interactions lead to high air pollution events during pre-monsoon and stable winter fog periods affecting Delhi;  3 Quantify local, urban and regional contributions to Delhi&apos;s air quality through an improved understanding of aerosols, long-range transport and boundary layer processes; 4 Test the Delhi&apos;s air quality forecasting system incorporating improved understanding of aerosol pollution and atmospheric boundary layer processs; 5 Develop the first multiscale modelling system for predicting high resolution concentrations of PM2.5, PM10, NO2 and other pollutants and then provide the analysis for developing effective mitigation strategies for Delhi; 6 Synthesise and translate the outcomes of PROMOTE with other APHH projects to provide datasets for exposure and health studies and contribute to a roadmap for implementing effective local and regional mitigation strategies to meet current and future compliance and health requirements in Delhi and NCR.  Through our analysis, we will deliver new knowledge on how local, urban and regional (LRT) sources of air pollution affect Delhi&apos;s air quality. With an improved understanding of aerosols and lower atmosphere dynamics, sensitivities between air pollutant concentrations and changes in local (e.g. traffic, industrial) and regional contributions will be quantified with a new multiscale modelling system for recommending interventions and mitigation options for Delhi.</narrative>
