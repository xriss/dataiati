   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Understanding antigenic diversity, zoonotic potential and immunological prevention of avian influenza viruses affecting poultry</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Avian influenza viruses (AIVs) of H5 and H7 subtypes continue to cause severe economic losses to poultry production in China, and are increasingly isolated from humans and are therefore considered zoonotic viruses with pandemic potential. AIVs are hyper-endemic in poultry production systems in China; effective control of these viruses in poultry is complex, with interventions including culling, movement restrictions and vaccination. Genetic diversity in AIV surface glycoproteins, haemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) play a critical role in altering influenza virus antigenicity, virulence, and cross-species transmission. Development of novel, more effective control methods requires improved understanding of the mechanisms underlying escape from current vaccines. We therefore propose systematic analysis of the HA and NA genes of contemporary AIVs in China to identify the molecular determinants that are critical for enhancing potency and efficacy of vaccines, as well as those that are associated with heightened zoonotic risk. Specifically, we will investigate: - The extent of antigenic diversity among contemporary H5 and H7 viruses circulating in China. - Which antigenic epitopes in the HA antigen of H5 and H7 viruses are critical for vaccine effectiveness. - Immune escape variants in China that pose a heightened risk of zoonotic infection. - Direct delivery of HA antigen to antigen presenting cells (APCs) to elicit a more rapid and protective immune response against AIV than currently available conventional inactivated vaccines. The above questions will be investigated through implementing the following specific objectives: 1. Mapping antigenic diversity and identify broadly cross-protective antigenic sites in the HA antigen across different variant clades/sub-clades of H5 and H7 AIV for vaccine matching. 2. Identifying key molecular markers in the HA of H5 and H7 AIV linked to an increase in zoonotic potential. 3. Enhancing potency and protective efficacy of AIV vaccines by developing novel mechanism for delivery of HA antigens to APCs. The research outcomes will aid in the understanding of: - The role of antigenic diversity in vaccine failure and of each antigenic site in providing protective immune responses. This will help the development of vaccines tailored towards affording protection against emergent diversified viruses circulating in poultry in China.  - The evolutionary processes modulating zoonotic potential of H5 and H7 viruses allowing development of evidence-based disease control strategies and policies to mitigate the threat of AIV to both humans and poultry. - The effectiveness of targeting antigen to immune cells for induction of rapid and stronger immune responses, empowering better control against infectious diseases affecting both humans and other livestock.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Increasing poultry production is crucial for maintaining food supplies to feed the ever-increasing human population, and to meet the Sustainable Development Goal on food security and sustainable agriculture. However, emergence, re-emergence, and continued prevalence of avian influenza viruses (AIVs) in recent years threaten the sustainable growth of the poultry sector. Control of AIVs in areas of hyper-endemicity is primarily achieved through vaccination. However, effectiveness of most conventional poultry vaccines is intrinsically sub-optimal; these vaccines generally only mask clinical signs and mortality, while still allowing infected animals to shed infectious viruses. Existing vaccines may consequently result in continued circulation and evolution of AIVs, and improved vaccines are therefore required that produce robust, sterile immunity against clinical disease and silent transmission, thus breaking the endemic cycle within farming systems.  The proposed research aims to gain insight into viral factors that contribute to vaccine failure which may enhance the ability of AIVs to cross species barriers from birds to mammals. We will utilise next-generation vaccination technologies and develop robust and effective vaccines that elicit strong and durable humoral and cellular immune responses against AIVs that cause severe economic losses in poultry. Our specific objectives are to investigate: (i) what changes in contemporary AIV of H5 and H7 subtypes infecting poultry can be implicated in vaccine failure, or are critical for inducing protective immunity in vaccinated birds; (ii) how do molecular changes in the virus surface increase the ability of the virus to transmit from poultry to humans; (iii) the delivery of protective antigens to chicken immune cells to potentiate more robust protection against AIV.   Achieving these objectives will provide unique data sets enabling: (i) selection of vaccine strains that match with the field viruses to provide greater protection in vaccinated birds; (ii) assessment of the likelihood of increased zoonotic infection risks to humans from the currently circulating AIV viruses in China; (iii) development of novel vaccine technologies that utilises attenuated live viruses as vaccine delivery vectors, such as recombinant herpesvirus of turkey (HVT). The efficient production and controlled delivery of protective AIV antigens to immune cells will drive induction of rapid, strong and life-long humoral and cellular immunity in chickens.  The ready availability of better disease control tools will aid in the reduction of poultry production losses and thus be important for global food security and improved animal welfare, whilst also reducing possible zoonotic transmission to humans. Thus, the proposed research partnership will provide direct benefits to farming communities and substantial indirect economic, public health, environmental and social benefits on a global scale.</narrative>
