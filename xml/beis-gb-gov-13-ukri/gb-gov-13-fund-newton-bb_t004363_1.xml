   <narrative xml:lang="EN">CEPAMS Newton Fund: Sino-UK excellence with impact on the Sustainable Development Goals</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The John Innes Centre&apos;s track record in China is very significant indeed. Just one year after Deng Xiaoping&apos;s opening reforms were initiated in 1978, the first Chinese scientist to arrive at JIC was Zhihong Xu. Professor Xu went on to be President of Peking University and Vice-President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Since that time, hundreds of Chinese scientists have received their training at JIC. Today, the very best Chinese scientists maintain their close association to JIC. Their work has had real impact on China&apos;s food security and health. In 2014, JIC established the Centre of Excellence for Plant and Microbial Sciences (CEPAMS) with the Chinese Academy of Sciences. CEPAMS has been a scientific and diplomatic success story. Building on JIC&apos;s long association with China, CEPAMS has seeded excellent, productive research collaborations, established new, world-leading laboratories and nurtured the Sino-UK bilateral relationship. This new project builds on past success to launch a second phase focussed on the impact of CEPAMS on the sustainable development goals in the developing world. The second phase of CEPAMS will involve collaborative research projects between JIC and CAS scientists plus dedicated CEPAMS laboratories in Beijing and Shanghai. The work of both will be explicitly linked to the UN Sustainable Development Goals and underpinned by an emerging Africa-Britain-China initiative. One theme of research in this new project will explore the anti-cancer properties of some plants used in traditional Chinese medicine (Skullcaps). A better understanding of these plants could lead to improved efficacy (health outcomes) of traditional medicines and also improved commercial impact of these medicines on the Chinese economy. In addition to JIC and CAS, this theme will also recruit the expertise of the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew to explore medicinal plants in other developing countries and involve African partners. Another theme will look at the close association between plants and microbes and how this association can be both harmful and beneficial. A better understanding of these associations could lead to future growth in crop yields, reductions in crop disease and fewer chemical treatments for crops (e.g. fertilizers and pesticides). The research will look crops that are of growing importance in China (and other developing countries) including oats, tomatoes and kiwi fruit</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The overarching objective of the CAS-JIC Centre of Excellence for Plant and Microbial Science (CEPAMS), as set out in its vision statement is that &quot;excellent strategic plant and microbial science transforms global nutrition and health&quot;. CEPAMS achieves this through the collaboration between CAS and JIC - its mission statement is &quot;to maximise the synergy of CAS and JIC research, working together for excellent science and global public good&quot;The specific purpose of this proposed second phase of CEPAMS is to realise a change in strategic direction for CEPAMS such that its focus on the application of science is strengthened - as set out in CEPAMS second aim &quot;to apply our understanding of plants and microbes to improve crops, protect the environment and benefit human health in the UK, China and the developing world&quot;. The specific objectives of this proposed second phase are therefore: 1. To undertake ground-breaking research and development in the plant and microbial sciences that directly addresses sustainable development goals for Chinese and global benefit. 2. To strengthen the capacity of Chinese science and the application of that science towards the sustainable development goals for Chinese and global benefit. 3. To strengthen the capacity of African science and the application of that science towards the sustainable development goals for African and global benefit. 4. To share the results of CEPAMS&apos; research with partners, other scientists and knowledge exploiters through high-quality scientific meetings and bespoke fora. 5. To ensure the highest quality of scientific governance, leadership and management for CEPAMS. These five objectives correspond to the five workpackages of the second phase of CEPAMS.</narrative>
