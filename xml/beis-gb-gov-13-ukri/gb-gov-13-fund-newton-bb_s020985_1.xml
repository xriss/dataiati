   <narrative xml:lang="EN">RED APPLE is looking to develop and implement technological innovation in the China and UK apple production systems to increase yield and quality as well as reduce supply chain losses.  The project is testing two technologies: 1) spectral cameras that can identify plant stresses due to, for example, water or nutrient imbalances or pest and disease; 2) traceability systems that can transfer appropriate information to stakeholders along the supply chain to maintain higher quality levels and reduce losses.  The findings from the first technology are expected to increase yields and quality in a sustainable manner, reducing inefficient inputs of fertiliser and pesticides.  The second will ensure not only the reduced losses but also that quality attributes can be linked to particular producers as well as production techniques.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="China is the largest global producer of apples (43mt/yr). Problematically it is less efficient than other large production areas (producing less than 20t/ha compared to c30-50t/ha) and suffers wastage of up to 30% in the supply chain.  This has negative associated impacts on potential for economic growth and rural development.  The overall objective of RED APPLE is to improve yield and quality and reduce wastage in the apple supply chain, thereby reducing economic and social risks associated with apple production in North East China. This will be achieved through integration of remote sensing 4D (3D space + 1D time) observation, decision support systems (DSS) to guide production practices, and effective knowledge transfer to primary producers and end-users. Implementation of effective traceability systems (from primary production to retailer) will reduce chain losses and provide the basis of quality certification.  Economic benefits of adoption of these new innovations will be demonstrated to stakeholders, and potential barriers to, and facilitators of, adoption identified and incorporated into targeted education and dissemination strategies.   Specific technical objectives of RED APPLE are as follows: Objective 1. data integration within a supply chain linked to UAV and satellite based remote sensing technology for 4D apple tree growth and pest/disease monitoring;  Objective 2. use of digital decision support systems, integrating technical and socio-econ indicators,  and smart agricultural aerial spraying for precision orchard management;  Objective 3. evaluation of different technologies to track apple production from field to packhouse to table;  Objective 4. use of the Responsible Research Innovation (RRI) &amp; economic analysis approaches to demonstrate and maximise technology diffusion and uptake, maximising sectoral growth and farmer welfare.   The technological innovation of RED APPLE is applicable in China and the UK.  Once developed and tested, the technological innovations will be scaled up to other Chinese fruit crops (e.g. pears and citrus).  The results will facilitate identification of global opportunities for technology exploitation in areas of production facing similar production efficiency problems."></capital-spend>
