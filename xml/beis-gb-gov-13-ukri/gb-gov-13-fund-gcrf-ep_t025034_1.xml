   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The GCRF Challenge Cluster Participatory Futures directly addresses the challenge of Equitable Access to Sustainable Development as identified by the UKRI GCRF strategy: &quot;Partnerships should be transparent and based on mutual respect... equitable distribution of resources, responsibilities, efforts and benefits... recognising different inputs, different interests and different desired outcomes.&quot; As a central component to this challenge area, the proposed cluster looks to the Sustainable Development Goal 17, Partnerships for the Goals, to ensure that innovation and knowledge is shared between countries via strong global partnerships. This goal is gravely underrepresented in development-related research and yet critically underpins and determines the quality, impact and sustainability of outcomes of our research and practice.  This project recognises the need for a critical examination of what we mean by partnership, how these are enacted within development practice, and how we might learn and enable the research community to &quot;partner better.&quot; The practices, tensions and experiences relating to the ongoing challenges of partnership working are largely overlooked in reports and papers of interdisciplinary, transboundary projects. Compounding this problem, the evidence of the impacts of &quot;projectitus&quot; (short-termism in planning without concern for the longer-term implications of research or interventions, and  &quot;research fatigue&quot; amongst over-burdened communities), the examples of unintended detrimental consequences of well-intentioned research and of abandoned and failed initiatives and the rise of post-development literature as a response to the western dominated nature of development, continues to amass.  Despite the increasing affluence and capacity of the Global North, people in the south still suffer disproportionately from disease, poverty, war, famine and climate change. We have come together in recognition that partnerships and participation represent a fundamental but complex component of all GCRF. We contend that without genuine and equitable partnerships at the foundations of our research, the potential impact, relevance, and sustainability of the research will forever be limited or negated. Partnerships not only determine the very design and implementation of research, but the outcomes.  As innovation is a requirement of GCRF and part of wider research and development working, creating and maintaining successful and equitable partnerships is advantageous, leading to new insights and perspectives, engagement with harder to reach countries and populations, leading to new possibilities for sustainable impact.  By moving partnerships to the foreground, the Participatory Futures Challenge Cluster will bring together strands of early successes and recognised failures in GCRF research to address the problem of equity in sustainable development. This project is fuelled by critical insights and analysis of completed and ongoing projects, and ultimately driven by a focus on proposition and solution. Phase 1 of the Cluster will include: (1) an ethnography of cluster projects to analyse partnership practices in terms of equity, participation, and impact; (2) a synthesise of research findings and outputs; (3) the development of a framework and proof of concept case study in accessible forms (written report, documentary, media); and (4) a transition pathway to tools of translation, education, impact, and influence to mainstream international research. These outputs predicate the objectives of a larger project (Phase 2) focused on rolling out this framework through concurrent projects led by different disciplines in multiple distinct regions beyond those reflected in this cluster.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The GCRF Challenge Cluster, Participatory Futures, directly addresses the challenge of Equitable Access to Sustainable Development as identified by the UKRI GCRF strategy, and the Sustainable Development Goal 17 (Partnerships for the Goals) as an essential component of this issue. This goal is gravely underrepresented in development-related research and yet critically underpins and determines the impact and sustainability of outcomes. This project seeks to re-examine 5 GCRF projects to evaluate the way partnerships have been conceptualised and practiced across diverse research contexts.  The Cluster programme provides a unique opportunity to stand back from an individual project to look at practices and processes that are common to a body of work and will allow us to innovate from them. Drawing from the five diverse projects, Participatory Futures aims to investigate and reflect on the nature of partnerships that underlie international development related research. Using past and current experiences, we will: (i) provide evidence of &quot;best,&quot; ethical and equitable pathways and barriers to cooperation and impact; (ii) co-design a framework for multi-discipline participatory global challenge research; (iii) demonstrate the proof of concept through case study; and (iv) establish pathways to impact through tools of translation, education and influence to international research. Our overall aim is to draw together learning and experience from the Cluster in order to support an urgently-needed proposition of framework and proof of concept to improve and influence the possibilities for sustainable and participatory partnerships in global interdisciplinary research. This will be a comprehensive contribution with direct applications to research, theoretical scholarship, higher education, and aid and development organisations. The objective includes the creation of a transition pathway linking existing and new projects within a framework that enables (in Phase 2 of this Cluster project) the realisation of genuine Participatory Futures. Specifically, the project is designed to reach the following objectives:  1. Conduct an ethnography of five projects to investigate and analyse research and partnership practices from the cluster projects and analyse in relation to efficacy and impact. This will include an analysis of how partnerships were formed and how power dynamics function in collaborations; how open the projects were to different knowledges (community, indigenous, men&apos;s, women&apos;s, Southern, Northern), how these different knowledges were brought into the project, how &quot;the project knowledge&quot; was produced, who the beneficiaries were, and how this was understood and valued by partners. 2. Review and synthesise the clustered projects&apos; findings and reports, websites, materials, media, outputs (to include articles, presentations, events, etc.) and assess in terms of sustainable partnership working derived from objective 1. 3. Develop a framework and proof of concept case study, based on the relevant elements from the 5 cluster projects to form the foundation for, and promote good practice. 4. Develop the transition pathway to impact through tools of translation, education, and influence to mainstream international research through follow-up large scale research project designs; and cross-disciplinary and cross-sector knowledge exchange and research translation initiatives.  Building from Phase 1, this project would lead towards a larger, three year, project in Phase 2, whereby we would:  1. Expand the Challenge Cluster beyond Africa to further counter the uni-directional tendency of global challenge research to work with projects and partners in South America, Asia, North America and elsewhere in Europe.  2. Test the practices under the diverse conditions of differing disciplinary research 3.      Develop new understandings and provide new case studies and pathways to impact of best practice partnership working.</narrative>
