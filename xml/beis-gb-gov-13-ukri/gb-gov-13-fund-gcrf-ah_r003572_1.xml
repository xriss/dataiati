  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Networking New Opportunities for Artists in East Africa aims to stimulate and guide new thinking amongst visual art practitioners working in Uganda, Kenya and Rwanda, scoping and developing career pathways that will impact positively on their livelihoods. We aim to contribute to building capacity for high quality visual art activity in the creative economy of the East African Community, meeting EAC and international development goals.   To achieve this the network aims to develop dialogue and actions related to specific priorities and opportunities identified in a British Council commissioned report (2013). These priorities were confirmed through discussions between the PI and the report&apos;s author and face-to-face discussions with stakeholders, network partners and potential participants and beneficiaries.  The network aims to stage three events, two in Uganda and one in Kenya in 2018. These will be collaboratively managed with project partners and Co-I organisations 32 Degrees East, Ugandan Arts Trust, an established arts organisation with a track record of delivering such events; the British Academy in Eastern Africa, with significant experience of interdisciplinary work with artists; and the Fine Art department, Makerere University, a long standing provider of fine art higher education in the EAC with graduating 140 students each year. The network aims to interact with partners and stakeholders with the capacity and appetite to engage with new approaches to artists&apos; development. These include The British Council, funder and policy maker with a high profile for supporting arts organisations and artistic exchange across East Africa;  grass roots artists&apos; organisation UCASDR, who reach out to artists and artisans working on the ground in deprived city areas; the National Museums  - in Kenya, who have worked with contemporary art, often in collaboration with international organisations and Uganda who wish to work with contemporary artists; The African Arts Trust, a charity supporting African art organisations with extensive experience and networks. Whilst some of these organisations already work together, many do not and the network aims to establish sustainable dialogue between all of them. Network events aim to share knowledge across disciplinary and national boundaries and stimulate further sustainable collaborative research. The workshops aim to move understanding of the issues addressed to new levels of focus and development, considering the impacts on artists&apos; careers of opportunities through:   - developing a more sophisticated level of critique for art  - partnerships and collaborative practice  - public-realm projects in non-traditional gallery settings, using digital technology platforms and other innovative modes of production - mentoring, entrepreneurship skills and on-going professional development  - new relationships with audiences and potential markets  The project aims to deliver six temporary artworks sited in the public realm and created by East African artists (including artists at an early stage in their careers). In the educational context (Makerere) the network aims to explore how research brings benefits and impacts beyond academia, share research expertise and knowledge of curriculum developments, widespread in the UK but absent in East Africa that support young artists&apos; careers.  We aim to sustain activities through structured dissemination, using the web, social media and articles, reaching new audiences and beneficiaries and establishing a foundation for further dialogue, exchange and collaboration. By raising awareness and discussion of these issues and by instigating concrete examples of new opportunities for artists, the network aims to promote amongst policy makers and the public, understanding and appreciation of the value of artists and the visual arts within East African society. This will build capacity and contribute to meeting the goals set out in policy and legislation.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This interdisciplinary research project Networking New Opportunities for Visual Artists in East Africa draws together visual artists, arts organisations, funders, policy makers, academics and other stakeholders in the visual arts from Uganda, Kenya and Rwanda.  Through hands-on, collaborative workshops and the creation and exhibition of temporary new artworks it will explore how new opportunities and career pathways can be developed for artists working in East Africa. The goal is to help them build sustainable livelihoods, an international development priority, and to build capacity in the creative industries in East Africa.  A recent report for the British Council states &apos;East African countries are set on a path to become middle income countries in the next twenty years.&apos; The creative industries are an area of growth. &apos;We are getting better at understanding and valuing the impacts of a strong creative industries sector... underpinned by excellence and distinctiveness. The creative economy will play a central role in delivering the next phase of growth, increasing prosperity and enabling a greater diversity of cultural expressions to reach new audiences and for people to make a living from their creativity. Whilst the extraction of poverty remains the No1 priority, there is growing realisation that the creative and cultural aspirations and needs of citizens cannot wait forever to be met&apos;. The Uganda National Culture Policy (2005) asserts that &apos;Cultural industries have the potential to promote livelihoods...create employment opportunities and produce economic gains at all levels, promoting creativity and expressing messages that foster understanding and peace&apos;. The policy&apos;s key interventions include &apos;promoting and supporting budding creative artists: ...visual arts...have the potential to reduce income poverty if their quality and quantity is deliberately enhanced&apos;. &apos;Collaboration amongst stakeholders&apos; and &apos;the setting up of networks in culture&apos; are stated priorities. The East African Community Creative and Cultural Industries Bill (2015) was seen as a boost for artists, but very little has happened since. The proposed Creative and Cultural Industries Development Council that was to lead developments has not been established. There continues to be minimal investment in the creative cultural industries: in Uganda there is still no provision for teaching creative arts subjects in schools.  Within this context, the network will address challenges facing artists who want to build sustainable careers and decent livelihoods. It will partner with leading organisations working in the field:  the British Council in East Africa, the African Arts Trust, 32 Degrees Ugandan Arts Trust and grassroots organisations. Working in collaboration with these partners it will develop a series of network workshops which will facilitate artists and arts organisations to scope and define tangible new opportunities and career pathways. The make-up of the network and the design of its events has been developed through intensive discussion in Africa with its prospective participants, many of whom will lead workshop events. Each workshop will be given innovative focus through a series of temporary artwork commissions, sited in high profile sites in the public realm close to the workshop venues, each created by an East African artist specially for the event.  The network will develop thematic challenges identified by its participants, addressing these from multiple perspectives, sharing the knowledge and experience of East African scholars, artists, art professionals, policy makers and audiences, and the international research team. Working together in three workshops in two cities, each workshop led by a different organisation, bringing new voices and approaches to bear on the problems, participants will devise, debate and concretise opportunities that can achieve real and tangible  impacts on artists&apos; lives and on the creative  economy in the EAC</narrative>
