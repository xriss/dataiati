   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Our network is well established and has been aware of the growing issue of poultry sector contamination from the environment/community and vice/versa. Our previous studies in both Thailand and China have been limited in size and often biased (limited to resistant bacteria only). Therefore, there is clearly a critical need for a holistic and integrated approach to understand that transition of zoonotic pathogens (particularly MDR human pathogens) between animal and human sectors in Thailand and China.  This project addresses this critical need with the following objectives:   The objectives of this study are to:   To determine the prevalence of carbapenem resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) and mobile colistin resistant positive Enterobacteriaceae (MCRPE) trends and their contamination in retail chicken and duck meat.   To determine the prevalence of EHEC/ETEC in the Chinese and Thai chicken/duck industry, environment and human normal flora and community acquired infections.   To examine dominant bacterial clones of SEC common to our sampling sites and compare prevalence and sector contamination between between China and Thailand.  To assess the impact of colistin withdrawal in both China and Thailand on MCRPE i.e. will colistin resistance decline.     To determine the prevalence of SEC in insects in China and Thailand and how much do they contribute to the contamination of meat and spread of SEC in chicken and duck farms.  To examine the seasonal variation of SEC across our sampling sectors and does this correlate with the GI cases in China and Thailand.     To measure the impact of introducing Tradition Chinese Medicine (TCM) to replace antibiotics on SEC AMR levels.  To determine the impact of using bacteriophages against key/dominant SEC strain types.  To examine if we can develop peptides to decontaminate retail meat prior to packing.    To utilize mathematical models to inform a quantitative understanding of the transmission dynamics of SEC in China and Thailand in both humans and animals.  To implement mathematical models to prioritise potential interventions, and predict future trends under different intervention scenarios.  To measure the economic implications of these interventions accounting for potential impact on human health and on the Chinese and Thai chicken/duck meat trade.    To develop mathematical models to predict the socioeconomic impact (dissemination in the animal and humans) of CRE and MCRPE on the Chinese health sector and economy in the medium to long term (2020, 2030).</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The world&apos;s population is increasing, particularly in low-middle income countries and by 2050 as a global community we will have to feed an additional 2 billion people. This population explosion will place greater emphasis on meat production, particularly poultry. It is estimated by the world bank that by 2030, China, India and SE Asia will supply 80% of the world meat trade which will include national consumption and international export. The question is - how will this be met? Poultry farming will need to intensify to meet these global needs with the inevitable increase in antibiotic consumption used in animal feeds despite reservations from world authorities (WHO, FAO etc.). The AMR prevalence in chicken is considerably higher than other animal sectors due to the use of uncontrolled animal feeds and the potential for cross-contamination, either during growth or at slaughter. We use antibiotics to fatten and increase poultry growth yield yet this too in causing serious antibiotic resistance in human pathogens.   Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is now deemed to be the biggest global threat facing humanity in the 21C. AMR has taken center stage as a global health issue yet most non-specialists are unaware the impact AMR will have on global populations and the potential it has of taking the treatment of infections back to the &quot;dark ages&quot;. Hitherto, most studies around the world studying the impact of AMR have been small, one dimensional and often biased - too focused on AMR bacteria as oppose to studying the whole bacterial population. To understand the impact of AMR in the poultry sector we have established a network in Nth Thailand and mid-Eastern China (Shandong) and will undertake a comprehensive sampling strategy to examine key human food pathogens (Campylobacter, Salmonella and E. coli) in farms, the environment (water, flies, wild-birds) and community (human normal flora) and infections (urinary tract infections and gastroenteritis).   Our Study (called CUT-SEC) has a comprehensive sampling platform:  work package (WP) 1, chicken and duck sampling from hatcheries to slaughter; WP2, flies and wild birds; WP3, water samples and seepage; WP4, domestic animals on or near farms; WP5 Normal human rectal flora; WP6 community infections. We will analyze at least 70 samples every 3 months to examine seasonal variation and sample from Nth Thailand and Shandong. Bacteria will be analyzed by basic microbiology techniques and selected to be whole genome sequenced where we can interrogate the bacteria&apos;s whole DNA and compare it to other bacteria to see if they have spread from one sector (e.g. flies) to another (e.g. humans). This study will also sequence all the bacteria in the human gut to understand the dynamics of AMR bacterial populations. We will also undertake controlled experiments in chicken farms to monitor the spread on SEC and use mathematical models to understand how AMR pathogens spread in animals and their impact on human infections.  The impact of this CUT-SEC will have immense consequences for the animal, human and economic sectors in Thailand and China. Our network is well established, has a proven track record of working together in Thailand and China and expertise to undertake this exciting and challenging proposal.</narrative>
