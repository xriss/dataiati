   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Dengue virus is transmitted to man by the bite of an infected mosquito. Infection is usually not life threatening either causing no symptoms, resulting in a mild flu-like syndrome or leading to an unpleasant but limited disease called dengue fever. However the infection can have more serious consequences with a significant number of infected individuals developing what is called dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF), which can be fatal in up to 20% of patients unless they receive expert medical care. This disease is common in tropical and subtropical countries where around 2.5 billion people are at risk of infection. It is estimated that 390 million infections occur per year of which around 25% develop into dengue disease. In Thailand millions of people become infectioned each year and in some years hundreds of thousands of those infected go on to develop life-threatening DHF. Dengue circulates as four related viruses. Infection with one serotype will not provide protection against other serotypes. Therefore it is common to get a dengue infection on more than one occasion. In fact, those experiencing a second infection with a different serotype are more likely to develop DHF. This suggests that pre-existing immunity can have a detrimental effect. This feature is an obstacle to vaccine development. Because of the scale of the problem, there is an urgent need for a vaccine. However it has proved an enormous challenge. After almost 50 years of effort two phase III trials showed limited protection. In this study, we will interrogate the development of acute antibody responses as well as memory B cell responses. We will also study the antibody response in dengue-infected individuals who do not develop the disease. The antibody profiles will be compared with the responses found in dengue-infected patients. In addition, the contribution of antibodies recognizing the dengue non-structural protein 1 in the pathogenesis and protection will be studied. The study will provide useful information to direct vaccine design and monitoring.</narrative>
