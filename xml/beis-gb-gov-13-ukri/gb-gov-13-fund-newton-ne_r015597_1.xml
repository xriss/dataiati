   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Making soil erosion understandable and governable at the river basin scale for food, water and hydropower sustainability in Latin America</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Aim The project aims to develop, validate and make globally available a transformative approach for controlling soil erosion at the river basin scale in developing countries, by reversing the socio-technical processes that currently generate negative impacts on food, water and hydropower availability. This approach will bring together relevant local knowledge and scientific knowledge from physical-chemical, biological and social disciplines. Specific objectives: 1. Installing an action-research process in the Chilean training-hub river basin: To start building four inter-dependent capacities in each river basin for the envisaged, long-term transformation: (a) shared leadership from key actors, and common will of relevant actors to jointly innovate towards a sustainable future with soil erosion&apos;s impacts under control; (b) a clear, trans-disciplinary understanding of the complexity of the basin&apos;s specific soil erosion processes, and a well-specified innovation strategy; (c) a strong device for measuring soil erosion&apos;s base line and its expected evolution; and (d) a multi-disciplinary team with methodological skills and international networks to ensure the transformation&apos;s continuity over time. 2. Making soil erosion&apos;s reversal understandable from scientific and political perspectives: To start building three global-scale capacities for the effective dissemination of the transformative approach to be developed: (a) scientific validation of the project&apos;s systemic and participatory approach for reversing soil erosion, from physical-chemical, biological and social perspectives; (b) a facility for methodological transfer and training, sharing experiences and networking; and (c) a multi-actor Task Force to foster the dissemination of the approach in the developing world and to provide it with political support and sufficient funding. 3. Establishing local capacities to innovate towards soil erosion reversal: To consolidate the required transformative capacities in each river basin, by: (a) setting up management systems for the strategic and operational guidance of the innovations to be implemented; (b) completing base-line measurements of soil erosion processes, and establishing mechanisms for monitoring the expected innovations&apos; results and impacts; (c) conceptual and technical design of specific innovations according to the strategy; (d) mobilising local, national and international resources and gradually implementing the innovations; and (e) strengthening the links of the river basin endeavour to international networks, both scientific and institutional. 4. Establishing a global capacity to make soil erosion governable in Latin America: To consolidate the global-scale initiative by convening and establishing a Global Alliance for Soil Erosion Control, with a mandate to provide scientific, methodological, political and financial support to river-basin interventions all over the developing world.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Soil is a fundamental resource yet every year some 10 million ha of cropland are lost to soil erosion, mostly due to unsustainable agricultural and forestry practices. Erosion impacts overall sustainability in two ways: (a) reduction in farmland for food production, and (b) discharge of sediments and associated contaminants into water courses polluting water supply, fisheries and aquaculture, and reducing hydropower capacity due to reservoir siltation. Soil erosion and its environmental impacts sit centrally within the Energy-Food-Water-Environment Nexus. New approaches to land management change are required to reduce socio-economic impacts of soil erosion but in spite of its significance, soil erosion is insufficiently understood in its social dimensions, and is almost non-governed in Latin American DAC countries. Two factors may explain this: (a) erosion is often slow and &quot;invisible&quot;, or accepted as the norm, and (b) erosion is highly complex, emerging from interaction of socio-economic and natural processes, with interconnected feedbacks between external and internal drivers. Working in collaboration with researchers from Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico, the Chile-UK partnership aims to develop a new integrated approach for understanding and governing soil erosion at the river basin scale. Our multidisciplinary team combines innovative scientific measuring methods and advanced Latin American approaches for socio-cultural intervention to provide a new framework within which soil erosion challenges in Latin America can be addressed.</narrative>
