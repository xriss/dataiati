   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This proposal seeks funding for a Strategic Network to identify research gaps and formulate a research agenda on Public Private Partnerships (PPPs) in developing countries across four sectors: education, health, housing and water. PPPs increasingly play a significant role in the financing and delivery of public services. They are deemed to offer potential for addressing inequalities in provision and access to public services across the Global South. As such, they are promoted as an important development financing mechanism in support of the Sustainable Development Goals (see SDG 17.3 and the Addis Ababa Declaration of the Third United Nations Financing for Development Summit, July 2015).  The occurrence of PPPs, however, is not new. They first emerged in the Global North in the 1980s as part of a wider strategy of infrastructure development. PPPs were presented as a means to raise finance without increasing public sector debt. They were also heralded as a way to avoid perceived public sector inadequacies through greater involvement of private sector agents with alleged efficiency and cost effectiveness advantages. By the late 1990s, PPPs were being promoted across the Global South by a number of bilateral and multilateral agencies as the solution to growing demands for public services and the advocacy efforts in favour of PPPs have strengthened in the last few years.  Yet, there remains an acute lack of scholarly work on the effects of PPPs within and across sectors in the developing world. Critics have argued that there is insufficient evidence to support many of the claims and assumptions surrounding the presumed benefits of PPPs and their wider ability to contribute to poverty reduction or to address inequalities. Another concern in drawing conclusions regarding the effectiveness of PPPs is that PPP research has tended to remain in sector-specific silos and has failed to address cross-sectoral linkages, challenges or insights. This constrains evaluations of PPPs in general as a means to overcome inadequacies in the public sector. Further, PPP is a loose term that covers a wide range of arrangements across different sectors and it is open to a diverse range of interpretations (IOB, 2013; Languille, 2016; Romero, 2015). This needs unpicking in an attempt to draw lessons regarding PPP outcomes in the developing world. Finally, both the current promotion of and opposition to PPPs largely fail to address some fundamental questions regarding the nature and history of both the public and private sectors in particular regions and countries. The complexities of what constitutes the public and private sectors (types of actors), the nature of PPP partnerships (types of relationships), and their outcomes including with regard to equity (types of impacts) remain to be investigated.  This network seeks to address the need to understand PPP processes across sectors, how PPPs are implemented in practice and what the nature of their effects are in terms of dynamics of inequalities. The network will bring together academics, policy makers, development practitioners and other stakeholders to build capacity to interrogate PPPs as a solution to development challenges. In particular, it seeks to foster cross-sectoral and interdisciplinary fertilization by drawing on academic and non-academic expertise of varying disciplinary and sectoral origin.  The network will be organised around two hubs located in India and South Africa, with the co-ordination of network activities located in the UK. It will engage in scoping exercises, hold various consultative meetings and a final full network meeting. It embodies an early-careers and capacity building element through a doctoral student mentoring component and will engage in an active communication strategy both within the network and beyond through a website, intranet, other forms of social media, and provision of web-links to network activities.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="The overall aim of our Strategic Network is to build inter-sectoral and inter-disciplinary collaboration on PPPs that will identify and foster future research. The network will focus on four sectors (education, health, housing, water) and on in-depth work in two countries with significant PPP engagement (India and South Africa). It will also draw on broader regional consultation from within these two countries. The network aims to refine a research agenda on PPPs and attempts to locate these relationships conceptually within the political economy of development and comparatively across sectors. It will seek to advance new methodologies for cross-country comparisons and broaden knowledge on PPPs beyond sector-specific specialisms. The specific objectives of the network include: 1) to bring researchers together for discussion of cross-sectoral and cross-country PPP policies and outcomes; 2)  to generate multi-disciplinary, cross-sectoral and cross-sites research agendas that are contextually rooted; 3) to connect researchers with policy makers and civil society representatives (non-academic stakeholders) for cross-fertilising dialogue on PPPs; and, 4) to build capacity for younger researchers to understand key PPP debates and develop new research agendas; 5) to strengthen capacity in the country hubs for cross-sectoral and cross-country comparative analysis on PPPs.  Key questions to be reviewed through the network activities as possible future research themes are:  a. In what ways do PPPs increase or decrease inequalities and how does this vary across sectors, countries and regions? b. How do forms of accountability (horizontal and vertical) associated with PPPs differ from those associated with more conventional forms of public sector provision and what new social relationships have been forged through PPP regimes? c. What impacts are emerging from post-Brexit changes in international trade and investment regimes on the regulatory frameworks in which PPPs operate?"></capital-spend>
