   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Our specific objectives are to: (1) estimate the proportion of people living in the same household with
infected people who become infected, (2) assess whether the risk of getting infected and developing severe symptoms are
influenced by personal and nutritional characteristics and immunity to COVID-19; other infections (HIV, TB, malaria) or their
treatments; and the household environment (3) assess whether the use of personal protective equipment is acceptable,
feasible, and effective among people living with infected individuals (4) describe the experiences of caregivers of COVID-19
infected individuals (5) estimate the costs and lost income associated with home-based care for infected people. Study
findings will help to identify high risk households/areas and design appropriate social safety nets for affected households.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Sub-Saharan African countries have adopted COVID-19 prevention methods similar to those used in developed countries although their people live in a different context. The spread of COVID-19 in African households and people&apos;s adherence to preventive measures are not known, but this information is required to develop appropriate prevention measures. We aim to determine the intensity of COVID-19 spread in households located in urban medium-density, urban high-density and rural-high density areas in Malawi, Africa, factors that promote the spread of the disease and the impact of the disease on people&apos;s lives. Our specific objectives are to: (1) estimate the proportion of people living in the same household with infected people who become infected, (2) assess whether the risk of getting infected and developing severe symptoms are influenced by personal and nutritional characteristics and immunity to COVID-19; other infections (HIV, TB, malaria) or their treatments; and the household environment (3) assess whether the use of personal protective equipment is acceptable, feasible, and effective among people living with infected individuals (4) describe the experiences of caregivers of COVID-19 infected individuals (5) estimate the costs and lost income associated with home-based care for infected people.  Study findings will help to identify high risk households/areas and design appropriate social safety nets for affected households. Our research team&apos;s existing collaboration with policy makers and local health department will facilitate the use of research findings to strengthen the fight against the disease.</narrative>
