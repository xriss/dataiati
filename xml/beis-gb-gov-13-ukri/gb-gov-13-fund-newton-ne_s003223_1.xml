   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Droughts impact lives and livelihoods around the world, particularly in those regions with limited resilience to extreme events. In South-East Asia (SEA), pressures from climate and land use change, increasing populations and development impact water resources, even in Thailand which is considered to be one of the wealthier countries in the region. A number of recent drought events in Thailand have impacted food supplies, energy production and the wider economy, underlining the vulnerability of the country. The agricultural sector is particularly affected by water shortages and a better understanding of drought in Thailand would underpin mitigation actions that improve resilience and livelihoods.  Drought monitoring can improve preparedness and management, and whilst drought information provided through existing operational services provides a useful tool for water managers, there is limited understanding of how these indices relate to impacts. This appreciation of the links between drought indicators and impacts is limited by the availability of both consistent hydrometeorological datasets and impacts data collected from agricultural stakeholders. An improved understanding of this indicator-impact link would enhance the management and communication of drought, increase resilience and reduce vulnerability.  The STAR project will address these research needs through the following objectives: 1) engage stakeholders in informing and co-designing drought monitoring practices, ensuring collaboration during and post project; 2) develop new drought monitoring and characterisation indicators for Thailand based on stakeholders&apos; needs; 3) improve understanding of drought impacts on agriculture and assess adaptive capacity in a case study catchment; 4) increase drought resilience and capacity through better communication of drought risks and associated impacts.  STAR aims to enhance resilience to drought for all of Thailand although some activities will take place within a catchment-based context. The Ping catchment is a major tributary of the strategically important Chao Phraya river, identified for its importance within the agricultural sector and vulnerability to drought. Approaches are likely to be scalable within Thailand and the SEA region more generally.   The project is structured in four Work packages (WPs), with stakeholder engagement embedded in each of them: WP1 will identify those principally responsible for drought management and communication. The PingSTAR Network, a collaboration of diverse stakeholders within the Ping catchment, will be initiated and run through the duration of the project and beyond. WP2 will assess the drought hazard in Thailand, utilising and co-developing a range of hydrometeorological indicator datasets for drought identification and characterisation, a major legacy of STAR that will be disseminated as per the Pwthways to Impact. WP3 will work within the Ping catchment to better understand and quantify the agricultural and socioeconomic impacts of drought. Through a combination of social network analysis, collating existing sources and undertaking interviews in the field with farmers, a rich record of impacts will be databased and analysed. Finally, WP4 will bridge the national and catchment scales, establishing the relationship between drought indicators and impacts through a case study in the Ping catchment before assessing the scalability of such approaches more widely in Thailand and South-East Asia. Visualisation tools will be developed to allow stakeholders to better understand the link between drought indicators and impacts, and a capacity-building, knowledge-sharing workshop with national and regional stakeholders will consolidate the research outcomes of the STAR project and consider how the developed approaches could be applied more widely for enhanced drought resilience.</narrative>

  <capital-spend percentage="Drought is the world&apos;s costliest natural disaster, and its frequency and severity is increasing in both developed and developing countries. A better understanding of drought severity, duration and impacts is thus vital to increase resilience to this natural hazard. This is especially important in developing countries where drought impacts have consequences not only on the economy, but also on food security, health, livelihoods and well-being of citizens. Thailand&apos;s development has been constrained by natural disasters. In recent years, droughts have been the most frequent natural disasters and so have become the climate phenomenon of greatest concern. The water-dependent agricultural sector is particularly sensitive to drought, being severely affected in recent events.   Since drought is a slowly evolving natural disaster, its negative impacts can be mitigated through effective drought monitoring and warning, together with tailored communication for stakeholders, allowing a more proactive approach to their management. The lack of comprehensive hydrometeorological and socioeconomic databases in Thailand that would allow further development in understanding of drought processes and facilitate timely warning remains a crucial gap in research. Furthermore, while most emphasis has been given to the development of drought risk indicators, insufficient attention has been paid to drought communications, and the content and timeliness of the information that is shared between decision makers and disseminated to the public. Focusing on the agricultural sector, this project aims to develop an insight into the characteristics of drought and impacts on food production and farmers&apos; livelihoods, and to facilitate enhanced levels of drought resilience in agriculture using a participatory approach. This project will:  1) engage key stakeholders from the national to the local level in informing and co-designing drought monitoring practices, ensuring collaboration among themselves during and after the project;  2) develop new drought monitoring and characterisation indicators for Thailand based on stakeholders&apos; needs;  3) improve our understanding of drought impacts on agriculture and assess farmers&apos; adaptive capacity to droughts in a case study catchment;  4) increase drought resilience and build capacity through a better communication of drought risks and the associated impacts for agriculture.  STAR is aimed at improving resilience for Thailand as a whole, but the work is undertaken at different scales, with some activities having national coverage while others focus on finer-scale case study research. The case study work focuses on the Ping catchment, one of the two main branches of the Chao Phraya river. STAR will enhance coordination between institutions and communities to improve drought resilience in the Ping catchment especially, but will evaluate the transferability of the methodologies and findings to other catchments and regions of Thailand, and more widely will assess the potential for transferring the knowledge to support drought monitoring efforts elsewhere in south-east Asia."></capital-spend>
