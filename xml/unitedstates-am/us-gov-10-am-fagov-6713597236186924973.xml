    <narrative xml:lang="EN">The United States&apos; strategic goal in Armenia is to help it succeed as a secure, prosperous, and democratic country, at peace with its neighbors, more closely integrated with the Euro-Atlantic community, and able to resist Russian and other external pressure. U.S. assistance to Armenia will encourage the development of a democratic and prosperous Armenia more oriented towards the Euro-Atlantic community. U.S. assistance will support governance and rule of law programs aimed at increasing transparency and responsive governance capable of implementing economic and political reforms, promoting judicial reform, and developing a robust civil society, greater media professionalism, and greater citizen access to local governance. U.S. economic assistance will contribute to regional integration, strengthen private-sector competitiveness, improve the investment climate, counter Armenia&apos;s pervasive culture of corruption, promote U.S. exports, advance energy-sector regulatory reforms and energy efficiency upgrades, and support energy diversification. Assistance will enhance regional security by continuing to support safety enhancements and emergency planning at Armenia&apos;s aging nuclear power plant and supporting confidence-building measures designed to build business and civil-society linkages with Turkey and Azerbaijan. U.S. assistance will also complement U.S. diplomatic efforts to resolve peacefully Armenia&apos;s long-standing conflict with Azerbaijan over Nagorno-Karabakh.Through U.S.-funded efforts that promote regional integration, market development, and European harmonization, Armenia&apos;s dependence on Russian energy and remittances from Russia will be reduced. U.S. assistance will build resilience and reduce vulnerability to Russian aggression, increase European integration, and provide continued support for enduring programs.</narrative>
