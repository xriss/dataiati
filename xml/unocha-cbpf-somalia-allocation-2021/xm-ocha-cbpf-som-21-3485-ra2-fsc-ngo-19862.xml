   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Improved Immediate Access to Food for Vulnerable IDPs in Dayniile District, Mogadishu in Banadir Region</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The planned FSL project intervention will support targeted cluster-specific priorities that conform to the Humanitarian Response Plan for 2021 and the 2nd SHF 2021 Reserve Allocation round for Food Security and Livelihoods. The project will support 12,960 people (2,160 IDP HHs) in Dayniile District in Mogadishu, Banadir Region assessed to be in acute food insecurity, &#x2018;Crisis&#x2019; and &#x2018;Emergency&#x2019; phases of IPC 3 and 4, through Unconditional Cash Transfers at the multipurpose rate of $60/HH/Month as per CWG&#x2019;s recommended food transfer value (100%) for Banadir of the food MEB. This will provide the target persons with immediate access to food in order to cushion them from hunger, reduce/prevent malnutrition and any potential mortalities. 

The 2,160HHs will be registered from the health/nutrition centres within the IDP camps, based on their malnutrition levels as shown by the MUAC, and then in consideration of other indicative vulnerabilities such as households led by women/children, households with abandoned children, households with economically deprived widows/orphans and households with lone elders, disabled and sickly persons. The Households will receive unconditional cash relief for Four (4) consecutive months and thereafter improvement in the conditions of beneficiaries monitored constantly by health/nutrition staffs at the selected centres to continuously screen children of the targeted HHs to know any improvement on their malnutrition levels and concluded with a Post Distribution Monitoring at the final project Month. 

The Project target locations include the following IDP camps in Dayniile Al cadaala, Al-khayrat, Aala-fuuto, Barwaaqo, Buulo Warbo, Cawle, Ciid, Ciiltire, Danwadaag, Dhiblawe, Dhawaxweyn, Durdur, Fareey, Golweyn, Gorgor, Halgan, Iskaashi, Kalamashawrto, Kulmis, Makka iyo Madiino, Manaas, Marwo, Maslax, Sabiid, Tiyeglow, Warta nabadda amp Xusni.

CPD plans to use the first one month of the 5-months&#x2019; project period to undertake Food Consumption Score Survey, community engagement, beneficiary selection, verification and registration as well as procurement of the services of Mobile Money Transfer Company (Hormuud&apos;s EVC). The beneficiary selection will be done through a Community-Based Target process (CBT) as recommended by the Somalia Cash Working Group (CWG). 

The next 3 months will be used for UCTs to the identified 2,155 HHs while the fifth month will be used for PDM and the final round of the Food Consumption Score Survey. The comparison of the two Food Consumption surveys will help indicate the improvement in access to food for the households According to the FCS&apos;s value, indicating the change in the percentage of households with &#x201C;poor&#x201D; FCS (0-21 scores), &#x201C;borderline&#x201D; FCS (21,5 - 35 scores) and &#x201C;acceptable&#x201D; FCS (35,5 scores and above). The UCTs to the 2,155 HH would be done through Hormuud Mobile Money Transfer (EVC) since it has wide coverage in the target areas and most of the target beneficiaries subscribe to it.

The project will also provide for continuous community engagement during the implementation process to ensure feedback from the beneficiary community necessary for determining the effectiveness of the response and emerging gaps that will require a humanitarian response. The project will also mainstream gender and protection components in order to ensure it supports inclusiveness of both genders but in particular, make women a priority in the design as direct beneficiaries. Covid-19 preventive measures and health guidelines will also be mainstreamed in the project implementation. 

CPD has previously implemented several projects in the target project area of Dayniile, the most recent of which was funded by SHF and GAC-Canada and has immense knowledge of the project target area. CPD currently manages a hybrid-powered (solar and Genset) borehole (N 2&#x2019;&#x2019; 03.804, E 45&#x2019;&#x2019; 14.954) in Kahda which neighbours Dayniile, drilled in 2013 by CPD providing free water to the nearby IDP communities.</narrative>
