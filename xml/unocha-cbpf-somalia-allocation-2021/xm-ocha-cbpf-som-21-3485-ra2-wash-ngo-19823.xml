   <narrative xml:lang="EN">More than 80 per cent of Somalia was facing moderate to severe drought conditions when the Gu&#x2019; rains started in some parts of Somalia. Due to prolonged drought water availability has deteriorated. Since January, extreme water shortages, widespread reliance on water trucking and high-water prices have been reported in most pastoral and agro-pastoral areas The combined impact of drought and floods are likely to exacerbate the already critical food security situation in Somalia. A fifth of the population, up to 2.8 million people are now projected to face high levels of acute food insecurity and hunger2. According to the Somalia Humanitarian Needs Overview 2021, one million children are acutely or severely malnourished. cases of Acute Watery Diarrhea (AWD) and suspected cholera have spiked in Somalia.  According to OCHA June Bulletin a total of 211 new suspected cases (104 female and 107 male) and five deaths were reported between 31 May to 6 June3, with 145 (68.7 per cent) being children under 5 years of age. The cases were reported from 22 districts in Hirshabelle, South West states and Banadir region. According to South West state MOH/WHO latest report indicated that in 2021 over 700 cases of AWD were reported in Bayhaw CTU in Baidoa. According to the recent assessment conducted by CCCM/WASH cluster and local authority in South West State 1031 households in Baidoa have been displaced to Baidoa town due to insecurity and drought. The actors have also increased their presence along main supply routes, preventing the smooth entry of basic commodities into the town, negatively impacting the livelihoods of local residents and pushing food prices up. On 5 June, the local authority appealed for immediate humanitarian assistance for the new IDPs. Rapid assessments conducted in early June by NGO partners and the WASH, Health and Food Security clusters show that essential needs include emergency latrines and water trucking/access. 
In the context mentioned above GRRN will implement a WASH cluster-specific intervention aiming (1)Improve access to safe water through extension of  3 water distribution networks to  drought affected settlements/ communities.
 Rehabilitation of 1 strategic borehole water sources and installation of water distribution networks (pipeline extensions, water points installation) at settlements/sites hosting newly displaced populations (communities including persons with disabilities should be consulted on location and designs of water facilities). Rehabilitation of 11 shallow wells with hand pump to provide water to drought affected IDPs in Baidioa. Construction  of  212 new disaster and gender sensitive  communal latrines that are lockable from inside with both hand washing and lighting. 15% of this latrines(32) will targeted people with disabilities  in new settlements hosting newly displaced population. Facilities should be culturally appropriate, safe for users of all ages and gender and accessible to persons with disability - 15% of facilities should be accessible to PWDs.
 Hygiene promotion campaigns focusing on hand washing with soap and 2000 hygiene kits distribution, including female specific hygiene items (sanitary materials). Latrine construction and hygiene promotion activities should be implemented through market based programming to enable the local market. GRRN WASH technical designs adhere to SPHERE standards/Somalia WASH cluster guidelines, mainstreaming protection and disability, gender considerations per IASC guidelines for GBV Interventions in Humanitarian settings, WASH Chapter as well as the environmental protection considerations and securing access to the elderly and those with special needs as per Handicap International Guideline. This project will target 15,625 beneficiaries( 7,500 women,5000 men,1,875 girls and 1,250 boys) which 75% of recently displaced IDPs  5% returnees and 20% host communities.</narrative>
