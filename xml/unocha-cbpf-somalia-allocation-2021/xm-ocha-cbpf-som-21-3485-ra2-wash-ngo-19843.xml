   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The lack of adequate clean water remains a major indicator of environmental health conditions such as AWD/Cholera that claims many lives and particularly children under the five years of age. The proposed WASH intervention aimed to reach a cumulative total of 13000 beneficiaries (4,290 men, 3,510 women, 2,340 Boys, 2,860 girls) to contribute to the reduction of mortality and morbidity precipitated by poor access to WASH services in Badhadhe.
In Badhadhe most water sources have been contaminated and access to clean water is not a guarantee. To address this, the proposed intervention aims to Rehabilitate 1 strategic borehole with an elevated water tanks and a network of distribution systems in WARAQ to provide clean and sustainable water. 3-Shared water kiosks will be constructed and will be managed by trained Water management committees who will report to the management of the main boreholes. In consultations with the relevant stakeholders including women and PWD, the project will initiate a piping system from the main water sources to the identified and agreed sites for the water kiosk to ensure women and girls do no travel long distance to fetch the water and the path to the facilities are accessible. 16-Non-rehabilitated shallow wells will be chlorinated in RASKAMBONI division.This intervention will enhance water storage capacity through provision of cluster approved jerry cans for household water storage.
The project will also ensure that water delivered for use by the IDPs is tested and treated at the source and at the household level through distribution of Aqua tabs. Rehabilitation on the borehole will focus on: replacement of faulty Submersible pump and equipping with appropriate solar pumping systems, elevated water tank and distribution systems that connect to 3 water kiosks. Additionally, there will be provision of borehole consumables and chlorination. This will ensure provision of sustainable and equal delivery of safe water.
In consultations with the diverse local community members including women and people living with disability, appropriate measures to address the devastating sanitation situation in the area will be drawn to reverse the conditions. The project envisages to design and construct gender sensitive and culturally appropriate 175 emergency latrines with hand washing facilities in the Hosingo, WARAQ and Kulbiyow locations to eliminate the tradition of open defection and promote better sanitation practices by the target population. 15% of the sanitation facilities will be reserved and designed for people living with disability. 75 sanitation kits will also be provided to the sanitation groups.
The proposed intervention will also promote good hygiene practices focusing handwashing with soap through dissemination of hygiene messages at communal and IDP settlements. 10 gender balanced hygiene promoters will be trained on basic hygiene practices, chlorination, proper handling of domestic water, personal health and environmental care. 1800 standard hygiene kits (Sanitary material, 800gram soap, 10 straps of aqua tabs, bucket and 2-20L jerry cans) will be distributed in HOSINGO, WARAQ and KULBIYOW. 800 Kits will be secured from the WASH Cluster hub in Kismayo while the remaining (1,000) including female specific sanitary kits will be secured locally through MBP approach and each HH will secured the Kit through voucher from the local vendor. 1000 Culturally appropriate IEC materials for hygiene, PSEA and COVID-19 will be designed and distributed. To utilize the capacity of the local markets, significant amount of this activities will be implemented through market based approaches including the sourcing of suitable construction company from the local market through market assessment. All actions will be implemented in strict compliance with Ministry of Health&apos;s recommendation to prevent spread of COVID-19 pandemic.</narrative>
