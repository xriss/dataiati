   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Enhanced Emergency WASH Services for Vulnerable Tafta Tag and Hashiwer IDPs  and Suriyo Village Non-IDPs in Garbaharey District.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The goal of this project is that 2020 IDP and 450 non-IDP households in Garbaharrey District of Gedo Region have access to immediate lifesaving  WASH services through life-saving sanitation and hygiene awareness creation, as well as access to immediate, safe water, sanitation and hygiene facilities within the settlements and communities, and these facilities are also sustainable, inclusive and equitable. A population of 14,820 (3268 men, 3402 women, 4075 boys and 4075 girls )  will access life-saving water and life-saving and hygiene and sanitation interventions from WASH infrastructures established in the community.  
The first output will ensure that there is improved access to water infrastructure for 450  vulnerable non-IDP households (596 men, 620 women and 742 boys and 742 girls ) in Suriyo village, Burdhubo Town, Garberhery District. The water infrastructure will ensure that there is equal and sustainable access to safe water facilities in their community. This intervention will involve the establishment of a complete water supply system for the village. This will include the construction of a shallow well, the establishment of a 2500 meter PVC pipe network to distribute the water from the shallow well up the tank and then to the 2  village kiosks, construction of a 20,000-litre concrete water storage tank and installation of a solar water pumping system to the shallow well to pump water to the elevated tank which will then distribute water to 2 water kiosk in strategic locations in  Suriyo village. This will enhance the security of women and children as they collect water from a location near their homesteads. The design of the water kiosks constructed will ensure that women, PWD and children have access to 16 taps that will allow them to collect water faster and with ease.  
3 locals will be identified and trained on the operation and maintenance of the system during and beyond the project period while a WASH committee will be established and trained on general management of the water system which includes the collection of revenue and managing the maintenance of the water systems. 
Output two will ensure that 2020 IDPs households-12120 persons (2672 men, 2782women, 3333 girls and 3333 boys) living in Tafta tag and Hashiwer have access to improved hygiene and sanitation facilities and will benefit from hygiene promotion to address the occurrence of AWD cases in the camps. 20 latrines structures will be constructed. The structures will be gender-segregated, with lockable doors from inside and have handwashing facilities. The site selection for the latrines will ensure that the latrines are situated in a location with a supply of water to allow for hand washing by the latrine users and also a well lit and secure location.  Awareness creation of good hygiene practices will be conducted by locals trained as hygiene promoters. 1000 IDP households in the two camps will also be supported to have immediate access to water through the provision of water vouchers. These include 6000 persons &#x2013;1323 men,  1377  women and 1650 boys and 1650 girls.  Additionally, 1000 IDP households will be provided with vouchers that will allow them to acquire hygiene kits from local traders.  
A total of 1450 IDP and Non-IDP households  ( 8700 persons-1258men,1309 women, 1567 boys and 1567 girls)   will have access to lifesaving water through the established water infrastructure and provision of water vouchers. This 10 -month project is proposed to commence on the 1st of September  2021 and end on 31st May  2022.</narrative>
