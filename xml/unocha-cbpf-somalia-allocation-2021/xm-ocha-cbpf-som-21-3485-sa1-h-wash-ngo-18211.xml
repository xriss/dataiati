  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project will contribute to improving equitable access to quality life-saving curative and preventative health services through the support of one static health facilities and two mobile outreaches. There will be two  integrated health mobile teams in the districts, The integrated health mobile teams will provide outpatient consultations, routine immunizations, maternal healthcare, disease surveillance and health promotion as well as systematic identi&#xFB01;cation, referral and treatment of acutely malnourished cases by providing integrated, psychosocial and gender based violence referral including clinical rape management while also ensuring integrated mental health services in all the outreach and facility teams , the team will also conduct promotion of adoption of good hygiene and sanitation practices will be done, providing treatment for all age groups, both male and female. The health interventions will improve early identification and prevention of malnutrition and access to primary health care, and therefore reduce excess morbidity and mortality. 
The proposed WASH intervention seeks to improve access to lifesaving and sustainable water, sanitation and hygiene among communities affected by the drought in Kismayo district Lowe Juba region. The project will also contribute to the reduction of mortality and morbidity, related to the poor access to WASH services for most vulnerable communities living in underserved and hard to reach areas in as a result of occasional persistent drought among populations in Kismayo district. This will be achieved through increased access to adequate, safe and sustainable water following the rehabilitation and construction of water infrastructure proposed under this project, improvement of access to gender sensitive sanitation facilities in flood prone settlements and promoting a culture of good hygiene practices in order to reduce the related protection and disease risks especially among women, girls and children in the targeted locations. As an initial lifesaving intervention, WASDA will prioritize provision of vouchers for clean water services for 1,306 Household in the drought affected areas in Kismayo as well voucher for hygiene kits including women sanitary towels to 800 extremely vulnerable households to increase their household water storage capacity thereby reducing the frequent trips to water points, which will as a result reduce congestion at the existing facilities.WASDA will construct 30 emergency latrines in the affected population considering 15% of the latrines for disable people, it will  also  establish and capacity build water committees as well as rehabilitate 2 strategic water infrastructures and installation of solar hybrid power to the targeted locations in Kismayo while also ensuring the protection concerns of women and girls hence contributing to the standard allocation strategy. The combined water supply will benefit 4,800 individuals. To ensure improved quality of the water both at households and supported water point The WASH component will also provide targeted locations in Kismayo while also ensuring the protection concerns of women and girls hence contributing to the standard allocation strategy</narrative>
