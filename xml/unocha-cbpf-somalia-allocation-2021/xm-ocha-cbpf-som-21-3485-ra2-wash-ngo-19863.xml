   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Emergency Water, Sanitation and Hygiene Intervention for Vulnerable and Displaced Communities in Adado District</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The WASH project for Adado District is designed to support a total of 16,500 people (2,750 households) rural destitute pastoralists, including 9,464 IDPs (disaggregated by gender), and drought-affected water deficit pastoralists in hard-to-reach areas. The action will improve access to adequate, safe drinking water supply that meets the minimum recommended amount for a household facing emergencies (7.5&#x2013;15 litres per day as per SPHERE Standards). The project&apos;s approach is based on WASH cluster recommendations for 2021 where WASH requirements will be based on market programming, allowing the rehabilitation of critical water points to meet the water requirements in identified water deficit IDP and pastoralist households. The project will respond to the currently identified WASH gaps brought by the rising threat of the declared drought in Somalia. Adado District has experienced a poor long rains 2020 season (Gu season) which has created a water deficit now being felt by pastoralists in hard-to-reach areas of the district that rely on water purchased from boreholes. 

Rehabilitation and upgrading of water infrastructure: The project proposes to rehabilitate 3 strategic boreholes that support rural pastoralist households including being the water source for water vendors who truck the water to the rural areas. These will involve installing a solar power system to ease the gen-sets in use and reduce the cost of abstracting the water in two of the boreholes in Horseed and Xinjalab settlements while increasing the daily total yield (144 CUM per BH).  The project will also increase the water storage capacity by constructing two 60 CUM overhead tanks in the 2 boreholes (i.e. at Biyo Gudud and Xinjalab settlement).  The Berkads are currently used as water storage points for community purchasing water from vendors in the 7 selected settlements during the current drought. The project will provide capacity building for the 15 water management committees through training of 30 members on Operations and Management, and another 54  water point operators on water chlorination (from 3 rehabilitated boreholes, 12  Berkad operators, and additional 12 boreholes targeted only for chlorination). The chlorine will be sourced from UNICEF RSH in Adado Town.  Water testing and quality monitoring shall be undertaken for the duration of the project in all the supported boreholes.  
Sanitation and Hygiene: The project will construct 53 gender and disability latrines for the 5 IDP Camps in Adado District (with 10 latrines being allocated for the PWDs. A total of 25 Hygiene promoters consisting of 10 men and 15 women shall be trained on hygiene and deployed to the 5 targeted IDP Camps. Hygiene promoters&apos; training will aim at creating awareness and elimination of open defecation and promotion of uptake of latrine use within the Camps and improve general hygiene within Adado.  The project will also work with UNICEF Emergency WASH Regional Supply Hub in Adado Town (which CPD manages) to provide hygiene kits to women in the IIDP camps.

The centrality of Protection: The design of the water infrastructure as done ensures water delivery pipelines to water kiosks for women to collect water near their settlements as opposed to the collection of water at the boreholes as is the current practice. Women and girls shall also be prioritized for protection measures including having designated water collection points and also the planned hygiene kits. The market assessment to be conducted shall ensure to obtain information on the cost of accessing water, sanitation, and hygiene kits proposed that ensures value-for-money and ensure they are not exploited. The MEAL plan to be developed for the project monitoring shall monitor the specific data and information that pertains to protection for women and girls in all the planned project components.
Disability: The project shall ensure the constructed service points are disabled-friendly, to ease access for disabled persons</narrative>
