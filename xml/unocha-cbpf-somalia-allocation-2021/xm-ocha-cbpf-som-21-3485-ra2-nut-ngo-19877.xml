Services at the facility will be integrated health and nutrition services with the health services responsible or review of all the patients and the antenatal clinics. Nutrition services will be run through outpatient department for treatment of acute severe malnutrition in children under the age of 5years. ADA will also implement a robust community education for the general community on health and hygiene promotion in order to support a healthier lifestyle. A total of 4 villages will be targeted (Manarani, Kuday, Kaamboni and Madawa), targeting to reach 3,495 men, 5,244 women, 2,625 boys and 2,394 girls.
The program will support through 3 static sites in Koday, Manarani Kaamboni as well as outreach in Madawa integrate the outpatient department on the daily triaging of the walk in patients and will refer any cases of malnutrition to the outpatient therapeutic support programs where necessary nutritional decision and treatment will be undertaken.Outpatient department will also be responsible for undertaking all the immunization services for children 0-59 months and pregnant women who visit the facility. The immunization department will work closely with the nutrition teams to identify children who missed their vaccination and those who defaulted. We will utilize the community health volunteers through the nutrition program to trace. promote and encourage immunization. 
The nutrition services will also include distribution of micronutrients to pregnant amp lactating women, deworming and provision of vitamin A to children under 5 years. Infant and young child feeding counselling will be done at the facility for mothers at the antenatal and post natal clinics as well as at the outpatient therapeutic program for mothers will children in the nutrition program. 
Mothers of children in the programs will also be trained on family led MUAC and will be taking lead in identifying the children with malnutrition and referring them to the nutrition programs at the facilities. 
ADA will work with the care takers of the children in the programs and ensure that caretakers sensitized/educated through the Nutrition, Health, Hygiene (NHHP) preventative, and promotional support including infant young child feeding (IYCF) support for care givers. These caretakers will be the community champions and will lead by example using the practical knowledge to encourage the other community members on proper health, nutrition and hygiene practices. 
ADA will work with a network of community volunteers that will aid in the identification of minor illnesses and detection of the malnourished children in the community and consequent referral of the cases to the facility. The community volunteers will also help the health and nutrition teams in tracing for defaulters in the immunization program and the nutrition programs.
due to absence of supplies  for targeted supplementary feeding program (TSFP) in the area due to challenges in security and means of transportation, ADA plans to use the extended Admission criteria (EAC) platform to manage Moderate Acute Malnutrition. ADA is currently not EAC partner with UNICEF however we shall seek partnership in the program and continue to undertake referral to the program.
ADA will conduct capacity building trainings for the staffs on Integrated ,management of acute malnutrition and infant young child feeding to the health workers staffs 15 and 8 respectfully. The trainings will have at least 55% female participants to ensure good gender representation. 
At all levels, ADA shall work with the ministry of health and local leadership at the village levels for continued support, timely problem identification and strategy for better service delivery and use the existing government and universal protocols for the management of the clients and</narrative>
