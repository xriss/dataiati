Buubi primary school, 22. Gacama fale Primary school) 

These Programme specific activities will include provision of school feeding to 2,700 (1,350 boys and 1,350 girls), distribution of TLM to 6,000 (3300 boys and 2700 girls), Payment of emergency teacher incentives for 70 (42 Men and 28 women), training of teachers on TiCC and CEC on school management and Child protection and child rights, construction PVC water tanks for 11 schools, Additionally, TASS will rehabilitate 5 existing water cisterns (barkads) in 5 drought affected schools. this will contribute to the improvement of the water storage capacity of the school and also ensure schools have sustained clean water, construction of gender segregated and disability friendly latrines for 10 schools, distribution of hygiene supplies including menstrual hygiene management, Hygiene promotion training and hygiene promotion campaigns targeting schools. 

The project will provided school-based child protection in line with Edu-CP response framework including: Community awareness sessions on school safety + child rights, Provision of sanitary materials for 1,200 adolescent girls, Operation of child right clubs, training of CP focal points (1 male and 1 female per school), who will oversee child protection activities in the school such as PSS, Child right clubs, child safeguarding and do safe referrals and the provision of structured recreational activities at schools.

The proposed project is integrated Education/CP/WASH project but TASS will implement the education components and will compliment with World Vision International (WVI) who are implementing community level WASH and Child protection components. The two projects will be linked together for example in protection, children with protection concerns will be referred to WVI to provide specialized CP services including case management and in WASH the two projects will ensure children have access to good hygiene and sanitation in both at school and at home, additionally, WVI will be constructing and rehabilitating water sources and community latrines hence this would help reduce the acute water shortages in the communities and reduce the pressure on WASH in Schools since the targeted community will have their own clean water and latrines and will not use the school&#x2019;s WASH resources.</narrative>
