   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Strengthening emergency GBV services for the most vulnerable internally displaced populations through gender-based violence response in Daynile and Kahda districts in Banadir region</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The objective of this intervention is to strengthen case management through direct service provision for survivors of gender-based violence (GBV) by complementing and coordinating HLP with NoFYL, and child protection interventions with SWDC as well as coordinating CCCM and shelter interventions with HINA that was allocated under the current 2nd reserve allocation. IRDO will implement the GBV project targeting the following IPS camps In Daynile IRDO will work in Ceelgaras, Hodman and Shaciir IDP camps while in Kaxda it will operate in Kunturwareey,  Sarmaan an bariyow IDPs camps. 

The project aims to provide immediate lifesaving assistance to 600 vulnerable populations ( 380 Women,200 girls, 10 Men, 10 Boys) through access to comprehensive case management and psycho-social support (PSS), including emergency care, referral to medical teams trained in clinical management of rape (CMR), access tailored material assistance that includes dignity kits provided to 1000 (800 Women, 200 Girls) GBV Survivors and vulnerable women and girls basic emotional support and psychological first aid through GBV case workers , Provide transport cost to 280 ( 200 Women, 80 Girls) GBV survivors to access compassionate, competent and confidential clinical care and follow up on the services. 

In order to reduce GBV risks and contribute to the safety and dignity of women, girls and others at risk of GBV, IRDO will provide cash for protection to 138 (98 Women, 40 Girls) GBV survivors and other vulnerable women. A number of recent studies have shown the potential of cash voucher assistance (CVA) can improve protection outcomes for women and girls in terms of meeting the costs of fleeing an abusive situation, renting safe housing or temporary shelter. Thus, meeting basic needs such as buying food or clothing thereby reducing the likelihood of risky coping strategies, such as transactional sex or forced marriage.

IRDO will collaborate with the local authorities to identify and target the beneficiaries. Assessment on the gender dynamics will be undertaken, to the potential GBV risks and protection benefits associated with the introduction of the cash voucher assistance, as well as ensuring mitigation of associated risks, including risks of Gender-based Violence (GBV) in order to meet the specific needs and ensure the safety, dignity, and inclusion of diverse groups. 

IRDO will mobilize 20 PSS counselors for 4 days to deliver one on one and group psychosocial support and counseling for traumatized women and girls in the IDP camps. The counselors together with community mobilizers will sensitize the community and provide basic psychological support to the GBV survivors, early or forced marriage and vulnerable girls.

In order to enhance access to post-rape treatment drugs, PEP kits will be received from UNFPA upon submission of the signed request form from IRDO and will be facilitated through the Ministry of Health (MoH)

PSS support will be provided to women and girls in safe spaces to support each other by networking, get information regarding GBV available services risk reduction through engaging community protection groups and distribution of dignity kits to vulnerable women and girls aimed at preserving their dignity which is essential to maintaining self-esteem and confidence to cope in stressful and potentially overwhelming current humanitarian situation.


The six months project is anticipated to increase accessibility, quality and coordination of GBV services for floods and conflict affected communities in Middle Shebelle region. IRDO will consider the needs of women, girls, boys and men separately and focus on identifying gaps and trends to improve programming and identify the GBV risks, analyses and develop action plans to reduce the risk and prevent the GBV and other protection issues in the community.</narrative>
