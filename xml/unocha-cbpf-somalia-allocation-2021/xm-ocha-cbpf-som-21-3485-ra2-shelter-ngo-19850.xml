   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project is intended to strengthen the protection and lifesaving of displacement affected communities in the assessed IDP sites in Kaxda and Daynile districts in Mogadishu through Shelter amp NFIs response as per cluster-specific objectives. This project is part of complementarity integrated multi-sectoral packages including CCCM and Protection (HLP, GBV, CP, amp GP) with other humanitarian organizations to jointly implement this package for these districts CCCM amp HLP for NoFYL, IRRDO for GBV, SSWC for GP, and CP for SWDC to address acute humanitarian needs of same sites and same populations. The project is prioritizing most vulnerable IDP families including women, girls, persons with disabilities and women headed households. In order to ensure centrality of protection the project will use community participatory approach in collaboration with different levels of the community including marginalized groups as well as camp committees who have already participated during assessment survey and project designing stage.
This project is specifically designed to directly assist 9,420 people (1,570HHs) selected from 15 IDP sites (5  in Kaxda and 10 in Daynile districts) through survey assessment conducted by HINNA in terms of their vulnerability criteria in shelter and NFIs assistance including women: 1,507, men: 1,507, boys: 3,203, and girls: 3203. The IDP sites assessed include: (1) Baarliin, (2) Ciidyare, (3) Bismillaah, (4) Yaaqle 2 and (5)Saacid in Kaxda district, and (1)Duco-waalid, (2)Hadii la yaabo Yasinka, (3) Maalincad, (4) Iimey, (5) Yaa Allah, (6) Guryasamo, (7) Ismahurto, (8) Maansoor, (9) Banooda, (10) Oromada in Daynile. During the survey assessment, the target IDP communities of this project have collectively demanded in-kind distribution of NFIs and direct construction of ESKs intervention rather than the cash-based approach that can contribute to local inflation and poses security risks. They have also mentioned that IDPs and landowners have jointly agreed three to five years of land tenure with the presence of the existing camp committees and local authorities.
In summary, the project will directly construct 1570 ESKs and distrribute1570 NFIs to same beneficiaries of 1570hhs (9,420 individuals) as each IDP family will receive one constructed shelter and one NFI kit. At the onset of the project, 200 from community levels will be mobilized and sensitized on project scope and information as well as the beneficiaries&#x2019; selection process. PCM/PDM exercise will be conducted four to six weeks after the construction and distribution to know more about the future preference of IDP communities. A Complaint Response and Feedback Mechanism (CRFM) will be set up so that anyone with complaints about the beneficiaries&#x2019; selection process or any other issue will be able to complain. A hot-line will be available for anyone to forward his/her complaints. Secondly, complaints will be channeled through CRFM desk attendants and HINNA MampE team on the ground, settlement leaders and community elders. The project will consider the protection mainstreaming of gender and GBV related issues, as well as disability inclusion is matter in both the response and it&#x2019;s monitoring to ensure safety and dignity as well as accountability to the affected target populations.</narrative>
