  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Population in Jowhar district is previously affected by livelihood crisis due to the consecutive failure of the Deyr 2018 and Gu 2019 leading to drought conditions in area then following severe flood in 2019/2020 and ongoing catastrophe caused by desert locust which has further exacerbated to deplorable livelihoods of Jowhar district, Therefore, higher vulnerability and eroded household assets due to consecutive shocks experienced and needs timely response to avoid further deterioration in food security situation and spikes in malnutrition &#x2013;given previous drought context with deterioration of IPC and increase in GAM prevalence. 
Humanitarian Needs 
The 2020 Deyr (October-December) rainfall season is likely to be below-average to average across the country, which could lead to drought and trigger a worsening of the humanitarian situation if the 2021 Gu (April-June) season rainfall is also delayed or performs poorly.
Key Drivers
	Severe riverine and flash floods have caused significant population displacement and damage to property, infrastructure, farmland, and crops.
	Desert Locusts continue to pose a serious risk of damage to both pasture and crops until at least the end of 2021.
	COVID-19 mitigation measures have led to increased food prices, a decline in remittances, and fewer employment/income opportunities in urban areas.
According to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, floods in the Middle Shabelle region displaced a total of 66,000 people across 27 villages, destroyed over 40,000 hectares of cultivated land and damaged sanitation and hygiene facilities.
Somalia is increasingly vulnerable to climate change, with climate-related events &#x2013; mainly drought and flooding &#x2013; have increased in frequency and intensity throughout the country, exacerbating humanitarian needs and undermining community resilience.
Food Security: 
The populations in need of livelihood assistance include flood-affected riverine, drought-affected pastoralists, agro-pastoralists, farmers, IDPs, returnees, hosting communities, and the urban destitute. There is also an urgent need for seeds to replant crops destroyed by the floods and the rehabilitation of the flood-affected irrigation infrastructure for the flood recovery programme. There is also a need for increased agricultural input, seeds, and fertilisers M/Shabelle &#x2013; to facilitate planting for the agro-pastoral communities prior to the rainy season and veterinary services for the animals of pastoralists. To support the acute food security crisis-affected farmer households in 10 villages (Cabdi-Galadi, Guumbe, Geedo-Barkaan, Lama-Waab, Maryam Keynaan, khalafow, Cali-Waraabey, Moiko, Barrey, Gafay) under Jowhar district, PDA will provide selected 2,524 farmers households composing 15,144 men, women, and children including people with disabilities, IDPs, and minorities through: 
1. provision of agricultural input to 2531 farmers households shared equally men and women for the deyr season. Each farmer will receive:
 seeds (20 kgs maize) 
 Legume seeds (10 kgs cowpea/ 12 kgs mung beans)
 Assorted vegetables seeds (240 grams)
 Irrigation support (3 hours)
 Basic farming tools (hoe and forked hoe)

2. Lead farming training:
To keep the sustainability of the project outputs and increase the production of the beneficiaries, PDA will train selected 200 lead farmers from the target farmers shared equally men and women on the best technologies and methodologies to increase their livelihoods production and pass their knowledge to the farming pest practices to their fellow farmers.

3. Post distribution monitoring will be conducted.</narrative>
