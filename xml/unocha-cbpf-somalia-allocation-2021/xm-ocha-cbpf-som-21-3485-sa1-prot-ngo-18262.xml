   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The situation of people affected by displacement and disasters remains precarious with respect to physical safety and dignity. As a result of destitution, women, men, girls and boys, are exposed to particular and various forms of violence, exploitation and discrimination. Frequent protection risks reported on the ground include (i) GBV, (ii) forced evictions, (iii) exposure to explosive hazards and (iv) child rights violations, such as child recruitment by armed groups and early marriage. Displacement increases the risk of family separation, and currently, there is an estimated caseload of 8,000 unaccompanied or separated children in Somalia. Furthermore, due to the loss of men&#x2019;s livelihoods, displaced women are increasingly taking on the role of breadwinners, which exposes them to the increased risk of domestic violence.
In a country where violence has been ongoing since 1991, persons with disabilities face extreme hurdles in being recognized, accessing resources and feeling valued in their community. This is particularly true for children and women with disabilities. Persons with disabilities in Somalia are side-lined in every aspect of humanitarian response and are being denied their economic, social and cultural rights. Reports show that persons with disabilities in Somalia are often denied access to water, food, sanitation and accommodation through lack of explicit inclusion
Accordingly, Somalia marginalized minority communities are facing disaster human and humanitarian situation, extreme poverty and hunger which can lead is causing slow collective death, as members of these communities, especially women youth and children are suffer most from various forms human rights abuse, social and economic deprivation, including hunger and malnutrition, inadequate healthcare, limited access to education, and low self-esteem etc. Due to the above reasons, the minorities are the neediest group of people facing worst starvation, highest poverty rates, massive displacement, huge unemployment figures, highest illiteracy levels and horrific health and sanitation status. Unlike other clans from dominant groups, minorities lack international support due the prolonged Somali conflict which creates an environment where minority groups are vulnerable and abnormally displaced from their homes. Therefore, they suffer grievous human rights violations, which included extra judicial killings, appropriation of lands and properties, and forced displacement from their lands to IDP or refugee camps situated along the Somalia Ethiopia border. 
Population estimates indicate that of the 9.3 million people in Somalia, over 400,000 (4.3% of the population) are aged 60 or over.4 Nearly half the population 3.7 million people are now in crisis. Amongst them are approximately 160,000 people aged 60 and over (UNHCR) Practices and approaches that neither recognize their potential nor incorporate their needs place older men and women in a vulnerable situation. Older people&#x2019;s vulnerabilities stem from lack of opportunities, services and exclusion. There is also growing feminization of the older population as women outlive men leaving many widowed older women. However, gender bias and discrimination can place older women in a very vulnerable situation with few projects targeting older women. Whilst many of the challenges faced by older persons are also faced by other community members, for instance water storage, collection of firewood and limited opportunities for livelihoods, the implications of these challenges can be much greater for older men and women, due to age-related vulnerabilities.</narrative>
