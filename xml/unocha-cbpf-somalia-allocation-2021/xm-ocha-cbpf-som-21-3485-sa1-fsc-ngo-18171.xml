  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project aim at improving livelihood for the affected people in Puntland  through cash for  work activities in water catchments/ berkads as well as provision of  fodder seed with the aim to support household access  livelihoods and other core services within the district to improve their lives and that of their dependents. The intervention aims to ensure that lives are saved and human suffering is reduced through provision of food security production inputs to targeted beneficiaries in order to ensure immediate access to inputs and subsequently to food for the most vulnerable populations. Due to the Current biting  droughts , this project  will target a total of 650 HHs approximately 3,900(585 men, 975women, 1,170 boys and 1,170 girls in drought affected people in Garowe. Female-headed HHs and young adolescents girls will constitute approximately 60% of beneficiary households. This weighting towards female-headed households is because they are considered more vulnerable due to their restricted options for paid labor. Once a household has been identified as a beneficiary, the project will primarily target women and who have lost livelihoods as result of water shortages within the households to receive  cash for work vouchers by rehabilitating harvesting structures and Berked  as result of the water shortage, Women have been targeted as beneficiaries since they typically make household food purchases and determine meal distribution within the household. Furthermore, The proposed project will target those households in the most critical situations. Not all households are at the same level of destitution or crisis. There are, for example, some households that do not have productive assets but receive remittances from relatives abroad. Beneficiary identification and selection will be managed by KAALO and facilitated by the existing  villages and elder Committees (CRCs), which are comprised of IDPs leaders, community elders and key stakeholders
Criteria for targeting is as follows: priority will be given to recently displaced (within the past year) female headed HHs, HHs with vulnerable members including pregnant women, children lt5, elderly, sick and/or disabled persons. Individual households (both IDP and local community) will be targeted and selected based on established criteria for vulnerability as mentioned above. 

1.	Rehabilitation of two water catchment to immediately access to cash for work to 300 HHs for 2 months , These will be constructed during selected months to enable over 1800 beneficiaries (300HHs) including men, women, boys and girls (gt18 years of age) get Cash for work to cover food. KAALO will distribute 100 sets of hand tools per village for two locations. Each set is composed (4 shovels,3 hoes, 12 empty bags, 3 pickaxes, and 6 wheelbarrows).These activities are targeted equally for men and women and include rehabilitation of water catchments.
2.Provision of fodder inputs to 300 Vulnerable farmers (benefitting 1800 vulnerable persons) through which each HHS will get 7 kg of of fodder seeds to enable access to food. In line with FSC guidance, each household will receive 7kgs which includes: Soudan Grass (7kg). 
3.
