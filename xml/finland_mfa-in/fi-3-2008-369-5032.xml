The villagers are jobless and circle of debt turn the rural families in poor situation of all areas of basic needs! This situation pushes them to search for better life and migration from villages in to the urban areas like a Mumbai. Due to increase of migration_ they become slum and street dwellers that they never thought about it. We have conducted survey in 32 villages.
