  </title>
  <description>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), adopted in September 2015, represent the most ambitious sustainable development agenda ever agreed by UN Member States. These comprehensive set of 17 goals and 169 targets offer a transformative agenda for all countries, in which people and the environment are placed at the heart of development.
While we as Caritas Family applaud the goals, it is imperative that they are translated into meaningful action. We are led by the light of hope; we know, however, that hope only becomes reality when followed up with deeds.
Caritas Organizations have helped to influence governments and the United Nations throughout the creation of the SDGs, to ensure that Agenda 2030 reflects the real needs of the communities with whom we work. We will continue to engage with governments to ensure that the SDGs are reflected in national plans through a participatory process that seeks to &#x201C;leave no-one behind&#x201D;.
Caritas Kenya has taken an initiative to commence Caritas Community Dialogues on SDGs with the objective to contribute to the delivery of the SDGs and enhance accountability with a key focus on development processes by the devolved County Governments. The overall framework on devolution needs constant dialogued reviews to facilitate development of dynamic devolution policies and operational guidelines that contribute to effective monitoring progress while ensuring existence of a multi-stakeholder and inclusive process that guarantees wider citizen participation in public matters as well as identifying synergies among the County governments and other church development entities in addressing contextual Diocese needs. The government acknowledges the role of Caritas Kenya in development work and has recommended on the formation of FBOs Coalition on SDGs which Caritas has been mandated to spearhead by the Ministry in Charge.</narrative>
