   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The food security situation has been on a worsening trend in the Arid and Semi-Arid (ASAL) counties in Kenya attributed mainly to the poor performance of the October -December 2020 short rains and the March - May 2021 long rains. Both seasons were characterized by late onsets, below average cumulative quantities, and poor distribution both in time and space.
Assistance will be targeted at the worst affected areas which are currently not supported by any partner. A community-based targeting approach will identify people who will receive assistance. These will include female headed households with children under 5 years; pregnant or lactating mothers with children under 5 years; female headed families with no source of income; families with severely or moderately malnourished children or child (under 5 years); households headed by persons living with disabilities with no source of income and child headed households.
