   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Strategic Sector Cooperation on Food Between Denmark and Kenya, Phase II

The Strategic Sector Cooperation on health is a peer-to-peer cooperation between the Danish Veterinary and Food Administration and the Kenyan Ministry of Agriculture Livestock.The main objective of the Strategic Sector Cooperation is to improve the Kenyan food control system in the entire value chain, involving compliance of food business operators and risk assessment for the benefit of human health and increased export potentials. Food safety is a major challenge in Kenya. Food for the domestic market is often produced and distributed without sufficient hygiene provisions and contamination levels and pesticide residues are also not under sufficient control. As a result, the population is exposed to food constituting a health risk and exports of food from Kenya faces severe obstacles on the world market because of difficulties in complying with import requirements of major markets. 

Building on the lessons learned under Phase 1, The second phase of the SCC will continue efforts to: a) help build a national food safety quality system based on the European Multi Annual National Control Plan; b) identify problems and solutions for better food safety in the dairy and horticulture value chains through piloting activities in the Clean Milk and Clean Horticulture Hubs; and c) facilitate public-private collaboration and partnerships to solve complex challenges</narrative>
