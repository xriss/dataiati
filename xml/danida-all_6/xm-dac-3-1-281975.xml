   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Anti-corruption Programme (ACP) was approved in 2019 for a period of four years (2019-2022) and with an overall budget of DKK 100 million. 
The programme objectives are to enhance the effectiveness of anti-corruption efforts through strengthened cooperation, advocacy, monitoring and research in key organisations and networks at national and international level. 
The programme has three clusters to strengthen the role of governments, civil society and the private sector respectively with eight different partners. The design of the ACP was a response to an acknowledgment within the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that international cooperation and initiatives to fight corruption increasingly constitute an important supplement to anti-corruption efforts at the national level, and to help developing countries mobilise their own resources to realise the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
The ACP was built around a number of existing international partnerships, but also sought to identify new ones that could generate new learning and experiences to be shared broadly. The latter include Maritime Anti-Corruption Network (MACN), Global Anti-Corruption Consortium (GAAC) and the United Nations Convention against Corruption Coalition (UNCAC Coalition). Support to United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC)&apos;s global anti-corruption efforts is also a new component that was introduced in the ACP as part of an enhanced focus on strengthening the normative anti-corruption framework.</narrative>
