   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The LDCs/SIDS Trust Fund was established by the Human Rights Council (HRC) with its resolution 19/26 of 23 March 2012 to support the participation of Least Developed Countries (LDCs) and Small Island Developing States (SIDS) in the work of HRC, and thus contribute to the universal participation of the UN Member States in HRC, which is an essential factor for the protection and promotion of human rights and the enhancement of HRC effectiveness. 

The Fund is managed by the Human Rights Council Branch of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) and provides funding for the following activities: 
&#x2022;	Targeted training courses and capacity-building activities, including e-learning, on the international human rights system, international human rights law and the rules and functioning of the HRC and its mechanisms;
&#x2022;	Travel and accommodation for government officials to participate in HRC sessions;
&#x2022;	Fellowship programmes for government officials from LDCs/SIDS to undertake three-month work placements relating to the work of the HRC; and
&#x2022;	Induction training sessions for government officials of LDCs/SIDS to provide them with information on the multilateral human rights system as well as focused, practical training related to the work procedures of the Human Rights Council and its mechanisms. 

Denmark supported the Fund with a core contribution of 3 million DKK in the period 2017-19.</narrative>
