   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Humanitarian Policy Group (HPG) at the Overseas Development Institute (ODI) are commissioning a two-year research project to improve understandings of how Islamist armed non state groups (ANSAs) govern territories that they control, and what factors influence this. The aim of this research is to provide pragmatic, policy-relevant recommendations for engagement. The project will forge strong links with aid groups on the ground, the broader field of researchers and academics working on insurgent governance, as well as policy makers and donors. It will directly contribute to the practice of aid work in volatile environments as well as the growing focus on working and thinking politically, and on the ways in which understanding localised political settlements is essential to working effectively in fragile contexts.</narrative>

     <narrative xml:lang="EN">The main product will be a synthesis report at the end of the project. In the interim, each case study will have dedicated output in the form of a summary paper (12-14 pages for the field-based case studies, and 6-8 pages for the lighter touch case studies). The analysis and dissemination phase will focus on engagement with policymakers to ensure the research findings have a practical impact. This will include private roundtables and events. The project will also see to produce a high level of policy engagement and reactive analysis, such as editorials, academic/policy interventions (participation in relevant conferences, events, etc.) and journal articles.</narrative>
