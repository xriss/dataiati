   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The road sector programme (RSPS) supports Tanzania&apos;s poverty alleviation strategy by contributing to a broad social and economic development of the country. RSPS supports reforms of finance systems based on road user funding of road maintenance, introduction of district-based road maintenance systems, strengthened road administration at all levels, including support for environmental and gender issues, training of contractors for maintenance and direct support for the restoration of degraded roads .
RSPS phase 1 from 1997 to 2001 included: Rehabilitation of Tanzania&apos;s probably the busiest highway route from Dar es Salaam to Mlandizi (55 km), rehabilitation of 150 km priority feeder roads in the coastal region, support to development of sustainable road maintenance in one district, including establishment of district based road administration, training of small contractors, as well as building local village committees to take responsibility for local infrastructure not financed by public funds. Addition technical assistance was provided to road administrations with special focus on road maintenance. An arbitration case brought by the main road contractor was settled in 2006. A claim for redress from Kammeradvokaten against the supervising engineer is pending final arbitration court negotiation.
RSPS2 from 2001 was completed in 2006. The strategy of Phase 1 was continued with expanded geographical coverage and increased focus on local roads. RSPS2 included rehabilitation of 129 km main road between Chalinze and Melela and parts of the road between Chalinze and Tanga, secondary roads in two regions: Coast and Iringa. Feeder roads in four districts: Rufiji , Kisarawe , Iringa Rural and Mufindi and village roads in Rufiji and Iringa Rural. Technical assistance was provided to the local highway authorities, the Environment Agency of the Ministry of Public Works, and the Ministerial unit which oversees the districts and local councils in 4 districts.</narrative>
