   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The overall ESP3 development objective is: &#x201C;Inclusive and sustainable growth through improved environmental management and climate change mitigation and adaptation&#x201D;. This development objective is well aligned to the various goals and objectives outlined in current environmental and natural resources policies, including the National Medium Term Development Plan (RPJMN) and the climate change and energy policies.

Component 1 aims at supporting the effective implementation of consolidated environmental management and climate change policies by combining support to three thematic areas, at both national and decentralized level. The component objective is: Improved local impact from implementation of policies and environmental management, also in the field of climate change mitigation and adaptation. 

Component 2 immediate objective is EE, EC and RE policies effectively implemented with a focus on the local government level, and experiences from pilot projects used to strengthen national policies, strategies and climate changes planning.

Component 3 immediate objective has been defined broadly to accommodate the differences in scale, scope, aim, and entry level of the sub-components: Climate change mitigation through natural resources management including community based NRM approaches.</narrative>
