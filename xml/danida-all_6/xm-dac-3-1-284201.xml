   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The MFA is in the process of formulating organisation-strategies for its partners within the area of human rights and democracy and switch to core support. The organisation-strategies respond to a formal requirement for accountable management. More importantly, they form the basis of the MFA&#x2019;s dialogue with these partners and serve to enhance setting of priorities and reporting of results. The strategies will serve as a flexible and adequate basis for the grants set out in the financial Act and be aligned with the organisation&#x2019;s own strategies.

The objective of this assignment is threefold:

- To prepare an organisation-strategy for DIGNITY (2019-2021) that identifies 2-3 priority areas as well as a priority related to organisational effectiveness. The organisation-strategy will be prepared according to the Guidelines for Management of Danish Multilateral Development Cooperation

- Prepare a set of management arrangements that includes provisions for reporting, accounting and budgetting for the grant

- Assist the MFA in conducting the consultation process with relevant departments of the Ministry as well as with DIGNITY.</narrative>
