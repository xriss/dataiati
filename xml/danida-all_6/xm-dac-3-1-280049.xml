   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Strategic Sector Cooperation in Work safety and Labour Despute settlement Between Denmark and Myanmar, Phase II

The Strategic Sector Cooperation on health is a peer-to-peer cooperation between the Danish Ministry of Employment and the Myanmarese Ministry of Labour, Immigration and Population. The main objective of the Strategic Sector Cooperation is to ensure safer and healthier work places and improved labour dispute settlement in Myanmar. Continued progress on structural reforms, including reforms on labour market institutions are a prerequisites for continued strong growth in Myanmar. New labour laws are under revision awaiting parliamentary approval, but faces considerable challenges within implementation of Occupational safety and health, and Dispute settlement. 

Phase II of the sector cooperation will build on the work done under and learn from lessons learned from Phase I to strengthen the capacity for work place inspections and for dispute settlement at work place level to support the implementation and enforcement of Myanmar&#x2019;s legislation regulating labour organization and settlement of disputes. With growth in Myanmar expected to remain strong and a growing labour force, the project will contribute to ensuring that jobs are decent and that labour market institutions are effective, accountable and transparent. In Phase II there will be a stronger focus on the workplace level to improve dispute settlement through township conciliation bodies, established in most of Myanmar&#x2019;s 315 township, but mostly inactive especially outside Yangon.</narrative>
