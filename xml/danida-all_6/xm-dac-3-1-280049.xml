   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Strategic Sector Cooperation on Occupational safety and Labour dispute settlement is a peer-to-peer cooperation between Danish Ministry of Employment and the Myanmarese Ministry of Labour, Immigration and Population. Through the project, the Myanmarese ministry will improve its capacity for work place inspections and dispute settlement at work place level to support the implementation and enforcement of Myanmar&#x2019;s legislation regulating labour organization and settlement of disputes.


A Strategic Sector Cooperation (SSC) is a partnership aiming at improving sector framework conditions in a partner country. The initiative is a flexible and adaptive instrument for exchanging experiences, learning and capacity building, which builds on a consolidated strong relationship and trust between the involved authorities. The commitment to finance the Danish authorities&#x2019; participation is sequenced in phases; an inception phase of approximately one year resulting in a project document; followed by phase one, two and &#x2013;if need be &#x2013; a phase three during which the cooperation is deepened and developed. All SSC partnerships are supported by a sector advisor at the embassy, who impel progress and stir the partnership in the direction agreed upon.

Annually, the SSC projects deliver a report on project progress and results achieved. Progress on selected outputs are displayed in openaid.</narrative>
