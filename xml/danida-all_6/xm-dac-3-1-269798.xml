   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Reduced Green house gas emissions in 6 target countries progressing low-carbon transformation of their energy systems through energy efficiency improvements.

-Strengthened information systems and planning frameworks for promoting and implementing EE policies and measures;
-Policy makers and governments are enabled to identify, design, implement and evaluate priority EE policy measures;
-Priority EE policy measures form part of Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs).</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The International Energy Agency (IEA) is an autonomous organisation within the framework of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), which works to ensure reliable, affordable and clean energy for its 29 member countries, 6 association countries and beyond. The IEA has expertise covering the full spectrum of energy issues and advocates policies with energy efficiency at the centre of the energy system. 

&#x2022;High quality data for development of energy efficiency indicators in end-use sectors at national, regional and local levels across all six target emerging economies;
&#x2022;Significant knowledge of the potential role of energy efficiency in Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs); significant number of technical government staff trained on energy modelling;
&#x2022;Improved design of at least three existing or new national or regional energy efficiency policies; strengthened implementation of at least three existing or new national or regional energy efficiency policies;
&#x2022;Strengthened knowledge and uptake of the use of digitalisation for policy design, implementation and evaluation; development of technology roadmaps.
&#x2022;Energy efficiency is highly relevant for SDG7 &#x201C;Affordable and Clean Energy&#x201D; and SDG13 &#x201C;Climate Action&#x201D;;
&#x2022;Unlocking energy efficiency is key to obtaining the longterm goals of the Paris Climate Agreement;
&#x2022;The largest developing economies constitutes the gravity in future energy demand;
&#x2022;Denmark is leading energy efficiency within the OECD and home to leading Energy efficiency technology suppliers; increasing the Energy efficiency markets benefit growth and job creation.
