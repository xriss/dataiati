   <narrative xml:lang="EN">International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) is an impartial, neutral and independent humanitarian organization working globally to protect and assist the victims of armed conflict and other situations of violence. The project is an un-earmarked contribution to the ICRC made within the framework of the Strategy for the Cooperation between Denmark and the ICRC in 2019-2023. In 2019-2023 Denmark&#x2019;s priorities for ICRC are: 1) protection, humanitarian assistance and compliance with International Humanitarian Law (IHL), 2) leveraging synergies between humanitarian and development efforts, 3) coherence in the areas of stabilisation and security, and 4) technological transformation and increased effectiveness. Monitoring of Danish priority areas is based on ICRC&#x2019;s own reporting on its strategy for 2019-2022.</narrative>
