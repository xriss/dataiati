   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Danida Business Partnerships (DBP) was launched in 2011 with the objective to contribute to economic growth and social development in developing countries through financial support to business-to-business co-operation between companies in Denmark and companies in Denmark&#x2019;s partner countries. The support focuses on transfer of expertise and technology from the Danish partner to the local partner in order to strengthen competitiveness and corporate social responsibility (CSR) in developing countries. The Danish embassies in partner countries are responsible for the administration of DBP. 

The Guidelines and the General Conditions dated May 2013 set out the terms and conditions for support under DBP. Companies in Denmark and in partner countries can apply for support to identification of a partner, development of a business case, and to implementation of the business plan. The financial support is based on the principle of reimbursement of expenses for activities as described in the application and budget approved by the Embassy. The financial support under DBP in the implementation phase covers 50 percent of costs for preapproved activities up to a maximum of DKK 5 million for technical assistance, training, equipment, CSR activities, other activities and auditor expenses. BDO Statsautoriseret revisionsaktieselskab was contracted by Danida to examine reimbursement claims from partner companies. 
On 28 June 2013, the Embassy in Jakarta approved an application from Smoke Solution ApS and PT Tanso Putra Asia for financial support under DBP implementation phase within a total maximum amount of DKK 4,262,935 to carry out activities as specified in their application dated 27 June 2013. Previously, on 5 October 2012, the Embassy approved support under the preparation phase within a total amount of DKK 663,632. The partnership was initiated on 1 July 2013 and the support under DBP is scheduled to end in December 2017. The Embassy has reimbursed the partners&#x2019; expenses documented by biannual and audited reimbursement claims with a total amount of DKK 3,835,595 covering the period from 1 July 2013 to 31 December 2016. 

Because of a question from Smoke Solution ApS to the Embassy about auditing of the reimbursement claim for the first six months of 2017, doubt arose as to whether the payments were made in accordance with the rules. It appears that different companies registered in Indonesia have incurred the expenses claimed by the partners, but reimbursement has been paid to Smoke Solution ApS. 

Based on this, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Danida) has decided to engage KMPG under a contract to perform an audit of the support paid by Danida to the partnership between smoke solution ApS and PT Tanso Putra Asia. 

The purpose of the audit is to enable the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to determine if the financial support paid to Smoke Solution ApS is in accordance with the terms and conditions for support under Danida Business Partnerships and whet</narrative>
