   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The aim of the project is to continue contributing to the improvement of assistance and protection to unaccompanied and separated children in Morocco. The intervention foresees on continued work on improving direct assistance services in the field and in parallel support key Ministries and institutional actors to proactively engage on migrant children&#x2019;s protection, ensuring sustainable solutions and the country ownership.

IOM proposes to address these challenges through a four-folded action aiming to:
1) engage key institutional actors in Morocco on the protection of national and foreign unaccompanied and separated children, improving their response to children&#x2019;s needs in different Moroccan regions. 
2) Support CSOs already active on child protection and/or vulnerable migrants&#x2019; assistance in Morocco to efficiently assist and protect unaccompanied and separated children in different Moroccan regions.
3) Raise awareness of stakeholders in Morocco as well as migrant children on child trafficking and the risks connected to irregular migration of unaccompanied and separated children in Morocco.
4) Foster international dialogue and cooperation on migrant children&#x2019;s protection &#x2013; with a focus on unaccompanied and separated children</narrative>
