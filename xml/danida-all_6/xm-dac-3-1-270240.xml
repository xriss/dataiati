   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Innovating for Impact in Sesame in Burkina Faso project aims to boost the organic sesame value chain while developing a traceability system in order to create sustainable livelihoods and strengthen the resilience of smallholder farmers. Led by ICCO Cooperation in partnership with OLVEA and Afrique Verte Burkina, the project will capitalise and upscale sesame production in Burkina Faso by addressing the systemic constraints on the production side of the value chain, contributing to (self) employment by realising increased product income (47% over 4 years) for 8,000 smallholder farmers (30% women and 5% youth).
The Danida Market Development Partnerships programme (DMDP) is designed to support commercially oriented partnerships for sustainable market development in developing countries. In addition to reporting on individually determined outputs and outcomes, all DMDP projects report on five key programme indicators. These five indicators are the same for the whole project portfolio, enabling strategic and programme level monitoring, and aggregation of results.
At the programme level, three key outcomes which are related to three of the five key programme indicators, have been chosen for results reporting: Outcome 1: Increased employment (decent jobs) for women, men and youth. Outcome 2: Increased income opportunities from improved market linkages. Outcome 3: Additional capital raised (investment leverage).</narrative>
