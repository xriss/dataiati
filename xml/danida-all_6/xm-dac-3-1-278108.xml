  </title>
  <description type="1" xml:lang="EN">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The challenges related to plastic waste are expected to grow exponentially, exacerbating environmental pollution and climate change. The Waste-to-Value project contributes to tackling this challenge whilst improving livelihoods for men, women and youth in Kwale, Mombasa, Kilifi and Lamu counties on the coast of Kenya. The project is implemented by the partnership consortium of WWF, Plastix, Jil Plastics, Mr Green Africca and PETCO. Building on strong experience in commercial plastic value chains in Kenya, the project will create income opportunities in plastic collection and decent jobs in sorting and processing (including opportunities for women and youth &#x2013; SDG 8). The commercial objective is to turn plastic waste, otherwise discarded in the natural environment, into a valuable commodity. The project will contribute to developing an effective value chain for recycled plastic by connecting collectors, sorters and processing to appropriated and high-end innovative plastic recycling expertise, technology and facilitate access to market on the Kenyan coast.
The Danida Market Development Partnerships programme (DMDP) is designed to support commercially oriented partnerships for sustainable market development in developing countries. In addition to reporting on individually determined outputs and outcomes, all DMDP projects report on five key programme indicators. These five indicators are the same for the whole project portfolio, enabling strategic and programme level monitoring, and aggregation of results.
At the programme level, three key outcomes which are related to three of the five key programme indicators, have been chosen for results reporting: Outcome 1: Increased employment (decent jobs) for women, men and youth. Outcome 2: Increased income opportunities from improved market linkages. Outcome 3: Additional capital raised (investment leverage).</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The development objective is to improve livelihoods for men, women and youth in Kwale, Mombasa, Kilifi and Lamu counties on the coast of Kenya by creating 250 job in plastic sorting (70% youth), and 50 decent jobs in plastic processing (50% women), as well as 500 people with increased income opportunity in plastic collection (300) and plastic related social enterprises (200) (SDG 8.3, 8.5, 8.6 &amp; 8.8), as well as reduce the environmental impacts from plastic waste (SDG 8.4). The commercial objective is to turn plastic waste otherwise discarded in the natural environment into a valuable commodity by developing an effective value chain for recycled plastic, connecting collectors, sorters and processing to high-end and innovative plastic recycling expertise and technology (SDG 8.1, 8.2).</narrative>
