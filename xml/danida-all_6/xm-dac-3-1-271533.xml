  <description type="2" xml:lang="EN">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">SheDecides was launched at the start of 2017 as an urgent reaction to the Global Gag Rule. It has rapidly evolved from two words, to a one-day conference into a global movement to advance the fundamental rights of girls and women to decide freely and for themselves about their bodies and their sexual lives, including whether, when, with whom and how many children they have. Since March 2017, the term SheDecides has become an urgent rallying cry leading to the formation of a global movement, now generating national and regional movements to mobilise all those who define themselves as Friends of SheDecides to maintain the momentum. SheDecides has grown from a fundraising initiative into something much greater. SheDecides boldly stands up and speaks out to demand a society where bodily autonomy is a fundamental right that is not up for negotiation. The SheDecides Manifesto is an articulation of this vision: A new normal where girls and women decide about their bodies, their lives, their futures. Without question. 

2 March 2018 will be SheDecides Day, as it marks the one year since the transformation of SheDecides from a fundraising mechanism and hashtag into the rallying call of a unique movement, with support all over the world, and generating action in countries. SheDecides Day will be kicked-off during the 2018 flagship event in South Africa on 1 March 2018. The overall aim of the flagship event is to broaden the SheDecides movement, to advance the vision of the manifesto in East and Southern Africa, strengthening national ownership and regional support for the fundamental rights of girls and women to decide freely and for themselves about their bodies and their sexual lives, including whether, when, with whom and how many children they have.
