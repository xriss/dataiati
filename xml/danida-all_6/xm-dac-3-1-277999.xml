   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Strategic Sector Cooperation on Energy is a peer-to-peer cooperation between the Danish Energy Agency and the Indian Ministry of New and Renewable Energy. The cooperation will provide Danish expertise and assistance to Indian authorities to help establishing the framework conditions needed for the roll out of offshore wind power.

 With the approval of the programme &quot;Indian-Danish Energy Partnership (INDEP)&quot;, which has a comprehensive approach to integration of renewable energy and flexibility in the power system, the Strategic Sector Cooperation has narrowed its focused to off-shore wind. The Strategic Sector Cooperation has focused on off-shore wind since 2019.

A Strategic Sector Cooperation (SSC) is a partnership aiming at improving sector framework conditions in a partner country. The initiative is a flexible and adaptive instrument for exchanging experiences, learning and capacity building, which builds on a consolidated strong relationship and trust between the involved authorities. The commitment to finance the Danish authorities&#x2019; participation is sequenced in phases; an inception phase of approximately one year resulting in a project document; followed by phase one, two and &#x2013;if need be &#x2013; a phase three during which the cooperation is deepened and developed. All SSC partnerships are supported by a sector advisor at the embassy, who impel progress and stir the partnership in the direction agreed upon.</narrative>
