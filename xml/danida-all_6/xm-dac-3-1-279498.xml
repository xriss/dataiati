   <narrative xml:lang="EN">CISU &#x2013; Civil Society in Development &#x2013; is an independent association of 270+ Danish civil society organisations (CSOs). All members are, together with partners, actively engaged in development work in Asia, Africa, Latin America, or Eastern Europe - either as their main engagement or as part of their activities.

The Civil Society Fund supports interventions carried out in cooperation between Danish organisations and their partners in Asia, Africa, Latin America, or Eastern Europe and covers interventions working towards all 17 UN Development Goals. The Civil Society Fund supports cooperation between a multiplicity of actors to achieve:
&#x2022; Sustainable improvements in poor people&#x2019;s living conditions, participation in society, fulfilment of rights and securing of equal opportunities. 
&#x2022; Strong, independent, and diversified civil societies through interventions at all levels, from organising the community to cooperating globally. 
&#x2022; Strong popular participation and volunteering in Danish development cooperation in terms of Danes getting directly involved in development interventions and in the pursuit of the UN Sustainable Development Goals. 
Accordingly, the Civil Society Fund contributes to enabling poor and vulnerable groups to make their own efforts towards improving conditions which they see as important, relevant, and necessary, and which &#x2013; structurally and in the longer term &#x2013; help advance their lot in society at the local, national, and global level.
