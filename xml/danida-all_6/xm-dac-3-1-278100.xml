   <narrative xml:lang="EN">MORE-HONEY will promote the development of an equitable honey value chain in one of the poorest regions of Uganda. The project will contribute to the achievement of SDG 8 by increasing incomes for 2,000 smallholder farmers who will benefit from increased skills and access to reliable and profitable markets. More specifically, the project will promote technological innovation in the value chain (SDG 8.2), create decent work opportunities for women and men (SDG 8.5) and support income increase for smallholder farmers, including young people (SDG 8.6). It will thus contribute to the achievement of SDG 1 (Ending poverty) by increasing household income for poor farmers, and to SDG 5 (Gender equality) by promoting the economic independence of women. The project will promote local economic development through GBL, Swienty Commodities&#x2019; and the Kahlwax&#x2019;s commercial objectives of increasing the quantity, quality and traceability of honey and wax sourced from Uganda.  
The Danida Market Development Partnerships programme (DMDP) is designed to support commercially oriented partnerships for sustainable market development in developing countries. In addition to reporting on individually determined outputs and outcomes, all DMDP projects report on five key programme indicators. These five indicators are the same for the whole project portfolio, enabling strategic and programme level monitoring, and aggregation of results.
At the programme level, three key outcomes which are related to three of the five key programme indicators, have been chosen for results reporting: Outcome 1: Increased employment (decent jobs) for women, men and youth. Outcome 2: Increased income opportunities from improved market linkages. Outcome 3: Additional capital raised (investment leverage).</narrative>
