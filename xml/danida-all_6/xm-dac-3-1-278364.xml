   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Danish contribution is supporting the creation of Technical Assistance Facility within the Climate Investment Funds (CIF), aimed at supporting clean energy investment in growth economies through Multilateral Development Banks. Focus will be on creating and enhancing investment-enabling framework conditions for renewable energy and energy efficiency which are particular relevant to increasing predictability and security for investors. 

The CIF was established in 2008, 14 donor countries including Denmark have contributed over $8 billion in support of scaling up mitigation and adaptation action in developing and middle-income countries. The CIF is held in trust by the World Bank, and the fund is disbursing grants, highly concessional loans, and risk mitigation instruments to recipient countries through multilateral development banks (MDBs).
