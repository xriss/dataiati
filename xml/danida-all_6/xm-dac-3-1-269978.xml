   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Ascend will recruit 20 team members for a program running from January 24 through October 31, 2018. During that time the team will complete a series of five mountain-based training expeditions (in Panjshir, Badakhshan, and Bamyan), spend 100 hours in intensive leadership training, make 40 public speaking appearances (mostly in schools), and give 5,160 collective hours of their time as volunteers in their communities. The 20 Ascend climbers will reach an estimated 400 beneficiaries through volunteering and 3,000 more through public speaking engagements, in addition to their personal impact as role models in their families and communities. At the completion of the 2018 climbing season, team members will shift focus to reaching out and mentoring young women through volunteering, teaching fitness, and conducting basic climbing instruction.</narrative>
