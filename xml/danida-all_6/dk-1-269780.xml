   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The objective of ESMAP&#x2019;s 2017-2020 BP is to contribute towards realising SDG 7, that is; 1) ensuring universal access to affordable, reliable and modern energy services, 2) Increasing substantially the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix, and 3) Doubling the global rate of improvement in energy efficiency. Taking account of the global challenges, ESMAP&#x2019;s comparative advantages, and its goals of influencing public investment and catalyzing private investment, ESMAP&#x2019;s work program focuses on specific priorities within the broader thematic areas, where ESMAP can make a difference in the short to medium term and have a disproportional influence on long-term outcomes.

Under the thematic area Energy Access, ESMAP aims to create enabling conditions for large-scale national energy access efforts, accelerate private sector investments in off-grid electrification, extend energy services to the rapidly growing urban poor in slums/informal settlements, and transform the cooking sector to accelerate adoption of cleaner stoves and fuels. Under the thematic area Renewable Energy, ESMAP aims to ensure that: 1) all developing countries understand their resource potential, 2) the blockages to the integration of high penetrations of renewables are removed and expanded; and 3) private sector finance is crowded in to scale-up solar power. Under the thematic area Energy Efficiency, ESMAP aims to: 1) integrate energy efficiency in planning, implementation and management of projects that improve urban services, and 2) promote energy efficiency and its integration with renewable energy and other sustainability aspects in buildings. Under the cross-cutting area Energy Sector Governance, Markets and Planning, ESMAP aims to establish strong financial health of the power sector, strong system planning, clear sector and market rules, and predictable regulation allowing return on investment. ESMAP support through the ABGs allows the WB regional energy teams to respond to client de</narrative>
