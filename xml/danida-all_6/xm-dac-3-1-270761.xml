   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Danida provides grants to research collaboration projects in which Danish researchers and researchers in the Danida priority countries collaborate on formulating and implementing research projects. The grants - which are up to DKK 12 million over a period of up to five years - are allocated as a result of a competitive application process. Applications can be submitted by research institutions in Denmark, Ghana, and Tanzania, and the institution in these countries are responsible for the management of the grant, if awarded.  
Research collaboration projects managed by South institutions with Danish research partners have been implemented since 2008 in addition to the research projects managed by Danish institutions with partners in the South. Vietnam, Nepal, Ghana, and Tanzania have been included in this &apos;South-driven&apos; modality. Since 2015 only Ghana and Tanzania are included. 

The annual call for proposals is based on pre-defined research themes that are selected and formulated by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in consultation with relevant partners in Denmark and in the South. 

The overall purpose of the Danida funding of competitive research projects is to contribute to developing research capacity in the South, and to produce research results that may be helpful in addressing the Development challenges of the South.</narrative>
