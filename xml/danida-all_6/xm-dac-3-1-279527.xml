  <description type="2" xml:lang="EN">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Strategic Sector Cooperation on off-shore wind aims to mitigate climate change while fostering technological development and sustainable economic growth by supporting a green transition in the Chinese power sector through:

-A strengthened regulatory framework for offshore wind development, including spatial planning, de-risking processes and efficient tendering procedures that leads to clear pathways for China.
-Strengthened provinces in best practice in tendering a full-scale offshore wind farm
-Improved capacity within institutions tasked to regulate certification and standards for offshore wind components
-Improved capability in enhancing performance of selected operating offshore wind farms in China
-Strengthened Chinese developers regarding site allocation and investment environment.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Strategic Sector Cooperation on offshore wind is a peer-to-peer cooperation between the Danish Energy Agency and the Chinese National Energy Administration. The cooperation will contribute to an enabling regulatory framework for offshore wind in China and contribute to an increased share of offshore wind power in the power mix and enable China to reach its mitigations targets. 


A Strategic Sector Cooperation (SSC) is a partnership aiming at improving sector framework conditions in a partner country. The initiative is a flexible and adaptive instrument for exchanging experiences, learning and capacity building, which builds on a consolidated strong relationship and trust between the involved authorities. The commitment to finance the Danish authorities&#x2019; participation is sequenced in phases; an inception phase of approximately one year resulting in a project document; followed by phase one, two and &#x2013;if need be &#x2013; a phase three during which the cooperation is deepened and developed. All SSC partnerships are supported by a sector advisor at the embassy, who impel progress and stir the partnership in the direction agreed upon.

Annually, the SSC projects deliver a report on project progress and results achieved. Progress on selected outputs are displayed in openaid.</narrative>
