The pooled fund is open to CKU&#x2019;s member organisations who can apply for up to DKK 1 million for smaller development projects. Projects funded by the CKU Pooled Fund are implemented in partnership with local (and often faith-based) partners from the Global South. Support through the CKU pooled Fund is granted to projects that seek to create meaningful changes and development in local societies. In addition, funding can be spent on capacity building of local partners as well as on CKU activities that support the overall purpose of the fund.

Due to its nature as a pooled fund operational results are general and aggregated. The MFA contribution is thus reflected in the overall results reporting by the partner.&#xA0;&#xA0;For more information on the CKU Pooled Fund please refer to the hyperlink below.
