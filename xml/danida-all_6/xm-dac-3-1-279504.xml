   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Globalt Fokus - Puljebevilling, since 2019.
A strong civil society is a cornerstone of a democratic society. To ensure the right of citizens to organize themselves and freedom of expression and association is fundamental to the legitimacy of any society. Civil society thus constitutes the cohesive force as well as the driving force in the development of society and has through history played an absolutely crucial role in the fight for rights and justice. Thus, civil society is one critical and constructive factor in the development of sustainable democratic societies where the social contract between citizens and state are constantly being tested and renewed.

It is within this framework, Global Focus, as a platform of 80 Danish civil society organizations work to bring together Danish CSOs that engage in development cooperation and humanitarian assistance. Global Focus aims to help member organizations become better at delivering on their core competencies to develop a strong and powerful civil society in Denmark and around the world. Global Focus is also the Danish member of CONCORD Europe, the Association of Development Organizations in Europe, as well as participating in other networks and alliances throughout the world.</narrative>
