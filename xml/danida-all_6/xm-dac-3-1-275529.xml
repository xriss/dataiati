   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Strategic Sector Cooperation on Circular Economy and Solid Waste management is a peer-to-peer cooperation between the Danish Environmental Protection Agency and the Indonesian Ministry of Environment and Forestry. Through the project, the Indonesian ministry will reduce the negative impacts of insufficient waste handling on livelihoods, health and environment through implementation of sound waste management and circular economy initiatives.

A Strategic Sector Cooperation (SSC) is a partnership aiming at improving sector framework conditions in a partner country. The initiative is a flexible and adaptive instrument for exchanging experiences, learning and capacity building, which builds on a consolidated strong relationship and trust between the involved authorities. The commitment to finance the Danish authorities&#x2019; participation is sequenced in phas-es; an inception phase of approximately one year resulting in a project document; followed by phase one, two and &#x2013;if need be &#x2013; a phase three during which the cooperation is deepened and developed. All SSC partnerships are supported by a sector advisor at the embassy, who impel progress and stir the partnership in the direction agreed upon.

Annually, the SSC projects deliver a report on project progress and results achieved. Progress on selected outputs are displayed in openaid.</narrative>
