   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Strategic Sector Cooperation on maritime affairs is a peer-to-peer cooperation in Kenya. During the inception phase, the cooperation will determine the project&#x2019;s specific focus and the main partner authority resulting in a partnership agreement, a project document containing project outcomes, outputs and activities. Potential areas of cooperation are: good maritime governance and green shipping.

A Strategic Sector Cooperation (SSC) is a partnership aimed at improving sector framework conditions in a partner country. The initiative is a flexible and adaptive instrument for mutual exchange of experience, learning and capacity building, building on a consolidated strong relationship and trust between the involved authorities. The commitment to finance the Danish authorities&#x2019; participation is sequenced in phases; an inception phase of approximately one year resulting in a project document; followed by phase one, two and &#x2013;if need be &#x2013; a phase three during which the cooperation is deepened and developed. All SSC partnerships are supported by a sector advisor at the embassy, who impel progress and stir the partnership in the direction agreed upon.

Annually, the SSC projects deliver a report on project progress and results achieved. Progress on selected outputs are displayed in openaid.</narrative>
