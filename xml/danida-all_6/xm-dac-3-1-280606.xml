   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Strategic Sector Cooperation on Energy Between Denmark and Ethiopia

The Strategic Sector Cooperation on Energy is a peer-to-peer cooperation between the Danish Energy Agency and the Ethiopian Ministry of Water, Irrigation and Energy. The Strategic Sector Cooperation on energy in Ethiopia aims at improving the framework conditions of the Ethiopian energy sector in general and improve a sustainable planning of energy consumption.The Ethiopian energy system is 96% based on hydropower generation with only limited variable renewable energy such as wind and solar in the system. The target is to increase the wind power capacity. With high dependency on hydropower, the country is very vulnerable to climate changes, limited water resources and geo-political disputes over the Nile. This is why the integration of variable renewable energy into the Ethiopian energy system is central for the continued development. 
The Danish Energy Agency will contribute to reach this goal.</narrative>
