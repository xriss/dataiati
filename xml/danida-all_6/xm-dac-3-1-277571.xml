   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Strategic Sector cooperation on Occupational Health and Safety is a peer-to-peer cooperation between the Danish Working Environment Authority and The Bangladesh Department for Inspection of Factories. Through the project, the Department for Inspection of Factories will improve the quality of inspections, with focus on essential Occupational Safety and Health issues, enforcement of the law, motivation of companies and activation of Safety Committees.

A Strategic Sector Cooperation (SSC) is a partnership aiming at improving sector framework conditions in a partner country. The initiative is a flexible and adaptive instrument for exchanging experiences, learning and capacity building, which builds on a consolidated strong relationship and trust between the involved authori-ties. The commitment to finance the Danish authorities&#x2019; participation is sequenced in phases; an inception phase of approximately one year resulting in a project document; followed by phase one, two and &#x2013;if need be &#x2013; a phase three during which the cooperation is deepened and developed. All SSC partnerships are sup-ported by a sector advisor at the embassy, who impel progress and stir the partnership in the direction agreed upon.

Annually, the SSC projects deliver a report on project progress and results achieved. Progress on selected outputs are displayed in openaid.</narrative>
