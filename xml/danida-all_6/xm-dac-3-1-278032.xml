   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project aims to promote improved postharvest management for maize, including large-scale adoption of tarpaulin and hermetic bags to store maize in a safer manner. It is expected that about 5,850 farm households will adopt good post-harvest practices, including the use of hermetic bags, while up to 90,000 farm households will adopt the usage of hermetic bags to safely store grains free from pest damages and storage pesticides. The farmers will thereby increase their food safety, extend their food security by 1-2 months or increase their income by selling their safely stored maize when prices are higher. The commercial objective is to enable two manufacturers of hermetic bags (AtoZ and PPTL) to establish sustainable supply systems, thus generating employment and income opportunities along the input and distribution value chain. The project will directly contribute to SDG 8.2 to achieve higher levels of economic productivity through diversification, technological upgrading and innovation.
The Danida Market Development Partnerships programme (DMDP) is designed to support commercially oriented partnerships for sustainable market development in developing countries. In addition to reporting on individually determined outputs and outcomes, all DMDP projects report on five key programme indicators. These five indicators are the same for the whole project portfolio, enabling strategic and programme level monitoring, and aggregation of results.
At the programme level, three key outcomes which are related to three of the five key programme indicators, have been chosen for results reporting: Outcome 1: Increased employment (decent jobs) for women, men and youth. Outcome 2: Increased income opportunities from improved market linkages. Outcome 3: Additional capital raised (investment leverage).</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project contributes to: End hunger (SDG 2) by ensuring increased access for rural households to safe and nutritious food all year round through the reduction of postharvest losses (SDG 12), and to economic growth by increasing employment and income (SDG 8) through the adoption of PHM practices and respective technologies by smallholder farmers as well as through the production and dissemination of PHT by commercial companies.</narrative>
