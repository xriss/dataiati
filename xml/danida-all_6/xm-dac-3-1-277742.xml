  <description type="1" xml:lang="EN">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The overall objective of the Sahel PSP II is to contribute to stability, justice and security for the population in the Sahel Region, through two thematic programmes, one focusing on strengthening justice and rule of law, and the other on improving stability and security. 

The objective of Thematic A (TPA) is to strengthen justice and rule of law in compliance with human rights principles&#x201D; by (i) enhancing the accessibility, efficiency and accountability of criminal justice systems; and (ii) enhancing local communities&#x2019; involvement in conflict prevention and resolution in the Liptako-Gourma border region.

The objective of Thematic Programme B (TPB) is to improve security through effective delivery of security services under democratic control, with greater popular trust and in compliance with human rights and international humanitarian law.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">Engagement objective: Increased security of the population against risks of serious human rights and international humanitarian law violations during the FC-G5S operations.

The Theory of Change is the following:

If Denmark provides support to the design, implementation and monitoring of human rights compliance measures such as screening, vetting and accountability by the FC-G5S, 

Then the rights of local populations will be protected during military operations, reducing vulnerability and reinforcing the trust between civilian and military, 

Consequently, further radicalisation will be prevented, which in turn contributes to human security and stability in the region.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">Engagement objective: to strengthen the regional governments&apos; capacity in the Sahel region to combat illicit trafficking and transnational organized crime by enhancing the accessibility, efficiency and accountability of criminal justice systems.

The Theory of Change is the following:

If Denmark provides funding for technical advisory services, training, equipment and mentoring, to develop regional police and judiciary cooperation, 

Then those institutions will be able to better fulfil their mandate to protect the population and uphold the rule of law, 

Thereby making security services more inclusive and effective, building capacities to counter cross-border threats, and strengthening the resilience of the Sahelian people</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">Impact indicator : Ibrahim Index of Africa Governance (IIAG)

Project objective: Strengthening of the democratic control and oversight of the defense and security sectors in Burkina Faso, Niger and Mali.

The Theory of Change is the following:
If the national and regional oversight capacities of the security sector are developed,
And if, the possibilities of the population to be heard by the security institutions are reinforced,
And if effectiveness, professionalism, respect for human rights and gender considerations of the security institutions operating in the Liptako Gourma Region are improved,
Then, the confidence and trust by the population of the neglected cross borders areas in the governmental security institutions will increase, leading to more efficient and effective ability of security institutions to respond to people&#x2019;s needs and priorities. Thereby leading to a virtuous circle creating a conducive environment for human security, justice and stability to prosper, especially in the Liptako Gourma region.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">Impact indicator : The violence is reduced and social cohesion reinforced in the communities of the Liptako-Gourma border area.

Project objective: Enhance capacity of nomadic and sedentary populations to prevent and manage local conflicts in the Liptako-Gourma border area, through information-sharing, early-warning, mediation and cooperation with decision-makers to implement solutions.

The Theory of Change is the following:
If the capacities of the nomadic and sedentary populations to prevent and manage local conflicts related to cross-border transhumance and livestock theft are strengthened,
If, the populations interact through structured information sharing, early warning and mediation mechanisms,
And if, solutions for cross-border transhumance corridors demarcation and livestock theft are developed and implemented in cooperation with decision-makers, at the local, national and regional levels, 
Then relationships and trust among the populations and with the decision-makers will improve, contributing to reducing conflict over natural resources and petty crime, such as livestock theft and destruction of property, contributing to overall stability and improve security providers&#x2019; operations in the field.</narrative>
