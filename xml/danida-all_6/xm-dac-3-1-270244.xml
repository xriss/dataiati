   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The WE SolVE project aims to support DMDP goals and objectives by tackling the twin problem of 1) the lack of employment and economic opportunities for women in rural Tanzania, and 2) the lack of access to clean energy, especially in rural Tanzania. It involves a unique global partnership between Signify (formerly known as Philips Lighting), BRAC and Solar Sister. Together, the partners are committed to piloting and testing an innovative business and technology model, designed to overcome critical financial, knowledge, cost and capacity barriers faced by last mile agents of clean lighting goods and Signify. The development objective is to create inclusive and sustainable economic growth and productivity (SDG 8), generation of new income (SDG 1) and new decent, green and appropriate employment and livelihoods for women (SDG 8.5) in rural Tanzania. The commercial objective is for Signify Lighting to enter the Tanzanian energy market and establish an East African clean lighting (SDG 7) business unit with local employment (SDG 8) and with a commercial return on investment.
The Danida Market Development Partnerships programme (DMDP) is designed to support commercially oriented partnerships for sustainable market development in developing countries. In addition to reporting on individually determined outputs and outcomes, all DMDP projects report on five key programme indicators. These five indicators are the same for the whole project portfolio, enabling strategic and programme level monitoring, and aggregation of results.
At the programme level, three key outcomes which are related to three of the five key programme indicators, have been chosen for results reporting: Outcome 1: Increased employment (decent jobs) for women, men and youth. Outcome 2: Increased income opportunities from improved market linkages. Outcome 3: Additional capital raised (investment leverage).</narrative>
