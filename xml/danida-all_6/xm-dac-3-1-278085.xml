   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Kafa Biosphere Reserve in Ethiopia, the origin of Arabica coffee, is increasingly challenged by the lack of sustainable employment, income and innovation for green development and adaption to the impacts of climate change. Therefore, the consortium, consisting of two commercial partners (Lebensbaum and Twisted Leaf) and two NGOs from the green sector (NABU and Forests of the World), aims at unfolding and structuring the up to now non-commercialised garden coffee value chain. The project will create local self-sustaining and environmentally-friendly business models around the commercialised garden coffee value chain by developing new products (organic Kafa garden coffee, organic sparkling coffee leaf beverage and coffee husk briquettes). This will contribute to increasing the market value and access of garden coffee. Ultimately income will be diversified, and jobs created. This will serve as an inspiring model for local development and contribute to a climate-resilient green economy in Ethiopia.
The Danida Market Development Partnerships programme (DMDP) is designed to support commercially oriented partnerships for sustainable market development in developing countries. In addition to reporting on individually determined outputs and outcomes, all DMDP projects report on five key programme indicators. These five indicators are the same for the whole project portfolio, enabling strategic and programme level monitoring, and aggregation of results.
At the programme level, three key outcomes which are related to three of the five key programme indicators, have been chosen for results reporting: Outcome 1: Increased employment (decent jobs) for women, men and youth. Outcome 2: Increased income opportunities from improved market linkages. Outcome 3: Additional capital raised (investment leverage).</narrative>
