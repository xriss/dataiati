    <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Fund builds longer-term capacity through programs providing technical assistance to local and national civil society organizations. Continued Danish support of the technical support and capacity building mechanism of the Fund is intended to allow the Fund to move forward in addressing unmet needs that have surfaced through ongoing outreach, evaluation of the Fund, and through analysis of highly competitive proposals to the Fund for which there were insufficient resources to support.  These focus areas include: responding to hate crimes and bias-motivated violence targeting LGBTI persons; capacity-building for transgender civil society organizations; support for approaches that continue to mainstream LGBTI issues within the human rights community and agenda, and to build alliances with key stakeholders; and continued need for legal support, and judiciary engagement and education.</narrative>
