   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The third contribution builds on the achievements developed and implemented by Denmark&#x2019;s first and second contributions to the Fund. 

The Global Equality Fund is a public-private partnership that supports innovative and impactful civil society programs that promote and protect the human rights of LGBTI people around the world. The GEF&#x2019;s global reach is significant with extensive local networks supporting civil society organizations and human rights defenders in more than 90 countries. Drawing its strength from the support and partnership of a diverse international coalition of dedicated governments, businesses and foundations, the GEF amplifies local LGBTI voices and movements committed to creating an environment in which human rights and equality are fully embraced and enjoyed by all.

The Danish funding supported the Art &amp; Global Health Center (ArtGlo) in Malawi. ArtGlo engages health care workers and people training as health workers at training institutions in an interactive workshop program in order to directly impact the quality of services and treatment provided to minority groups, including LGBTI people.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Fund builds longer-term capacity through programs providing technical assistance to local and national civil society organizations. Continued Danish support of the technical support and capacity building mechanism of the Fund is intended to allow the Fund to move forward in addressing unmet needs that have surfaced through ongoing outreach, evaluation of the Fund, and through analysis of highly competitive proposals to the Fund for which there were insufficient resources to support.  These focus areas include: responding to hate crimes and bias-motivated violence targeting LGBTI persons; capacity-building for transgender civil society organizations; support for approaches that continue to mainstream LGBTI issues within the human rights community and agenda, and to build alliances with key stakeholders; and continued need for legal support, and judiciary engagement and education.</narrative>
