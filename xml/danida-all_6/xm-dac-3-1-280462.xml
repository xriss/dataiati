   <narrative xml:lang="EN">WH is an engagement under the Peace- and Stabilisations Programmes objective 2) Resilience and Recovery. 

The WH are supported through the NGO, Mayday Rescue and the specific project, BATAL 24 is supported in cooperation with UK. 

The White Helmets are a community-based volunteer emergency service. Their first order effects are responding to the bombardment of the civilian population and delivering essential community-based resilience support. In establishing an effective capability for responding to emergency events - primarily in response to aerial bombardment - the programme established a distributed and decentralized network of community-based teams. The training and equipment needed to respond to emergency events resulted in the creation of capacity (in terms of personnel, training and equipment) to deliver a broad range of community-based essential service delivery effects. Thus a White Helmets team in a local community will prioritise their efforts to respins to a bombardment to include search and rescue, fireflighting and emergency medical response (first order effect), but when not doing so, the teams actively delivering community resilience effects , such as rubble clearance, repairs to local utilities (water, power, roads, sewerage), community engagement advice and information, UXO/explosive haxard clearance, emergency disposal of the dead, and support to the displaced.</narrative>
