   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The establishment of the WBA as a pre-eminent, not-for-profit, global institute that develops, funds, houses and safeguards the quality of corporate SDG benchmarks. The WBA will produce a set of publicly available, free, corporate sustainability benchmarks, ranking companies on their sustainability performance and contribution to achieving the SDGs.

Upon completion of the consultation phase, the World Benchmarking Alliance was
launched as an institution at the UN General Assembly week, on September 24th, 2018. It
formally transitioned on January 1st, 2019 from having its operations run by the Secretariat
of the Index Initiative, to WBA as a legal entity.</narrative>
