   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The overall objective of this project is to create viable and sustainable jobs and improved income for men, women and youth in Mindanao (Philippines) through a business partnership between coconut smallholder farmers and Biogrow (top producer of ecological cocopeat substrates). The partnership between IRDF and BioGrow and Livelihoods Venture, will valorise coconut by-products (husks) and promote the development of a local cocopeat and coco fibre industry. As a result, this project will contribute to SDG 8 through: 1) diversified and secured livelihoods for 3,000 coconut farmers households, 2) the establishment of fibre-processing units providing local jobs, 3) the creation of chips/crush mills with local employment opportunities, and 4) the setting up of women centres creating opportunities for 1156 women on fibre valorisation. Additionally, this project will create jobs directly in Biogrow plant and through subcontracting.  
The Danida Market Development Partnerships programme (DMDP) is designed to support commercially oriented partnerships for sustainable market development in developing countries. In addition to reporting on individually determined outputs and outcomes, all DMDP projects report on five key programme indicators. These five indicators are the same for the whole project portfolio, enabling strategic and programme level monitoring, and aggregation of results.
At the programme level, three key outcomes which are related to three of the five key programme indicators, have been chosen for results reporting: Outcome 1: Increased employment (decent jobs) for women, men and youth. Outcome 2: Increased income opportunities from improved market linkages. Outcome 3: Additional capital raised (investment leverage).</narrative>
