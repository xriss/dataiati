   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Strategic Sector Cooperation on Sustainable and Smart cities is a peer-to-peer cooperation between Aarhus Municipality and the City of Tshwane. Through the project, the City of Tshwane will improve its technical capacity in relation to integrated urban planning and development of safe and inclusive neighborhoods and public spaces, promotion of non-motorised traffic, storm water management and improved water supply. 

A Strategic Sector Cooperation (SSC) is a partnership aiming at improving sector framework conditions in a partner country. The initiative is a flexible and adaptive instrument for exchanging experiences, learning and capacity building, which builds on a consolidated strong relationship and trust between the involved authorities. The commitment to finance the Danish authorities&#x2019; participation is sequenced in phases; an inception phase of approximately one year resulting in a project document; followed by phase one, two and &#x2013;if need be &#x2013; a phase three during which the cooperation is deepened and developed. All SSC partnerships are supported by a sector advisor at the embassy, who impel progress and stir the partnership in the direction agreed upon.

Annually, the SSC projects deliver a report on project progress and results achieved. Progress on selected outputs are displayed in openaid.</narrative>
