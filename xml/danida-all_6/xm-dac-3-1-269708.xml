   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project has reached 7,652 beneficiaries against an original target of 7,060. Beneficiaries and households have been provided with improved access to water, multi-purpose cash assistance and protection services for children, youth and parents. Through proper coordination with clusters and local organizations working in Ninewa and Kirkuk governorates, Mission East was able to identify gaps in specific neighborhoods, villages and cities where other service providers were not able to reach. The flexibility of Mission East&#x2019;s approach, combined with the expertise of local partner organizations, enabled a quick response to the humanitarian needs found in specific locations which in turn brought a positive impact on the life of beneficiaries, as well as earning the trust of the community, clusters, government and donors.</narrative>
