   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Strategic Sector Cooperation on Energy is a peer-to-peer cooperation between the Danish Energy Agency and the Indonesian Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources. Through the project, the Indonesian Ministry will improve the energy framework conditions in order to reach national and international targets for electrification, renewable energy and energy efficiency. 

A Strategic Sector Cooperation (SSC) is a partnership aiming at improving sector framework conditions in a partner country. The initiative is a flexible and adaptive instrument for exchanging experiences, learning and capacity building, which builds on a consolidated strong relationship and trust between the involved authorities. The commitment to finance the Danish authorities&#x2019; participation is sequenced in phases; an inception phase of approximately one year resulting in a project document; followed by phase one, two and &#x2013;if need be &#x2013; a phase three during which the cooperation is deepened and developed. All SSC partnerships are supported by a sector advisor at the embassy, who impel progress and stir the partnership in the direction agreed upon.

Annually, the SSC projects deliver a report on project progress and results achieved. Progress on selected outputs are displayed in openaid.</narrative>
