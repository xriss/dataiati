   <narrative xml:lang="SV">Insatsen omfattar st&#xF6;d med 80 MSEK till andra fasen av Health Pooled Fund (HPF2) under 2017-18 i &#xE5;tta av tio delstater i Sydsudan. Sverige bidrog under 2012-16 med 185 MSEK. Programmet &#xE4;r ett utvidgat st&#xF6;d till SRHR, prim&#xE4;r- och referensv&#xE5;rd i fall av f&#xF6;rlossningskomplikationer, med fokus p&#xE5; kvinnor och barn som bygger p&#xE5; det nationella dokumentet &quot;Basic Package of Health and Nutrition Services&quot;. &#xD6;ver h&#xE4;lften av Sydsudans p&#xE5; ca 11 miljoner bed&#xF6;ms f&#xE5; h&#xE4;lso- och sjukv&#xE5;rd genom HPF2. 

HPF utformades 2012 som en givargemensam fond med UK, Kanada, EU, Australien och Sverige i syfte att bist&#xE5; den sydsudanesiska regeringen att bygga ett offentligt h&#xE4;lsossystem med starkt &#xE4;garskap av den sydsudanesiska staten. Australien har d&#xE4;refter l&#xE4;mnat Sydsudan och ersatts av USA som en av givarna i fonden. Genomf&#xF6;randet sker i n&#xE4;ra samarbete mellan nationella och internationella civilsamh&#xE4;llesorganisationer (NGOs), och myndigheter p&#xE5; decentraliserad niv&#xE5;. P&#xE5; grund av den p&#xE5;g&#xE5;ende interna konflikten och den sydsudanesiska statens begr&#xE4;nsade kapacitiet och resurser har fokus f&#xF6;r HPF2 skiftat fr&#xE5;n h&#xE4;lsosystemsst&#xE4;rkande ansatser, som att bygga system f&#xF6;r upphandling och distribution av l&#xE4;kemedel, personal och finansiella system till genomf&#xF6;rande av h&#xE4;lsotj&#xE4;nster, delvis i humanit&#xE4;r form d&#xE4;r situationen kr&#xE4;ver. Trots stora utmaningar och tack vare ett flexibelt uppl&#xE4;gg har HPF under f&#xF6;rsta fasen uppvisat goda resultat.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The intervention covers the period from April 2016 to March 2018 with an non-cost extension from April 2018 to October 2018 which was an overlapping period with the inception for HPF3.
The intended impact under the HPF2 program is to move towards a government-led health system that save lives, indicated by reduced maternal and under-5 mortality. It is not likely that the overall goal will be achieved during the short course of the second program phase.  The intention is that the HPF2 will contribute towards the progress of the three key outcomes as follows (details in the logical framework):  - Outcome Result 1: Increased access, use and quality of health services across all levels, particularly for women, children and vulnerable groups, - Outcome Result 2: Strengthened health system under the stewardship of County Health Departments (CHDs), - Outcome Result 3: Increased access to nutrition services particularly for pregnant women and young children.  Examples of interventions that will contribute to achieve these outcomes are in the theory of change described as: - Increased uptake of child spacing to increase child survival rates and improve child health (access to contraceptives); better nutrition. - Increased number of functional facilities and equipment; increased availability of skilled personnel, - Increased procurement, supply management of health products and commodities; - Increased demand creation at household, community and facility level; strengthened community systems, - Increased training and quality assurance (supervision, mentoring of health workers); increased education at community, household level; improved health seeking behaviour (e.g. early ANC visits from 25% visit 4 to over 50%.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">Outcome Result 1: Increased access, use and quality of health services across all levels, particularly for women, children and vulnerable groups,Key achievements (Data taken from the programme Health Management Information System (HMIS):&#x2022; Women with 4 or more ANC visits rose from 24% in 2012 to 28% at the end of the programme. This achieved the programme target with 27%.&#x2022; Number of children with diarrhoea (top 3 child mortality cause) who were correctly treated with oral rehydration therapy reached the program target of 91%.&#x2022; Rates of the pentavalent (combination) vaccine (3 doses) rose from 28% in 2012/2013 to 49% in 2017/2018 surpassing the program target with 42%.&#x2022; Children &gt; 1 year receiving measles vaccination increased from 38% in 2012 to 60% in 2018 (programme target unknown)&#x2022; Percentage of births attended by skilled personnel rose from 5% in 2012/2013 to 13% at the end of the program.&#x2022; The rates of women receiving at least two doses of intermittent preventative therapy for malaria increased from 21% to 57% and two doses of tetanus toxoid as part of ANC services from 11% to 25%.&#x2022; 28,595 Couple Years of Protection (CYP) were achieved primarily through the provision of three-year sub dermal implant during HP 2.&#x2022; Quality of Care assessment tool was developed to specifically monitor child and newborn health using MNCH indicators developed by the WHO among other global health agencies. The tool has 24 different assessment areas and it was rolled out at the beginning of HPF2. The scores ranged from 18% to 71% with under performing health facilities being subjected to further monitoring after improvements being made. &#x2022; The Quality of Care Tool furthermore looked at number of health facilities having basic sanitation infrastructure (WASH). The overall target of 129 health facilities having basic WASH infrastructure was met, at the end of the programme 194 health facilities had basic WASH infrastructure. &#x2022; The HPF2 emergency response fund had &#xA3;2 million earmarked.&#x2022; Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) averted: In total, 2,909,648 DALYs were averted due to interventions implemented as part of HPF2.&#x2022; Deaths averted: In total, 37,497 deaths were averted due to interventions implemented as part of HPF2 in South-Sudan&#x2022; 44 facilities providing basic emergency obstetric and neonatal care (EmONC) exceeding target of 39.&#x2022; 29 HPF-supported hospitals providing comprehensive emergency obstetric and neonatal care.&#x2022; Number of facilities distributing family planning services with a minimum of three modern methods rose from 66 in mid-2016 to 123 in the final year of HPF2. &#x2022; Total number of contraceptive methods distributed dropped BY 50,000 the last year of HPF2 compared to the previous year, possibly due to the increased use and demand for long-term contraceptive methods.
Outcome Result 2: Strengthened health system under the stewardship of County Health Departments (CHDs) Key achievements (Data taken from the programme Health Management Information System (HMIS):&#x2022; Establishment of the Human Resource Information System (HRIS) in all HPF supported counties in collaboration with Ministry of Health. However the process was hampered in one state due to continuous fighting.&#x2022; 411 Human Resources officers trained on Human Resources Information System management and reporting.&#x2022; Provision of technical assistance to MoH and CHDs in supply chain management of drugs. At the end of the program health facilities experienced an improvement in availability of drugs due to timely deliveries.&#x2022; PFM: Salary harmonisation amongst NGOs was successfully carried out and implemented in 52 out of 55 counties. HPF funds could be paid directly to the government, however not through the GRSS financial system.&#x2022; Gender and social inclusion (GESI): 31% of health committee members were women (target 33%).&#x2022; By the end of HPF2 the percentage of health workers who were female increased 3% up to 35% in one year, still below the target of 44%&#x2022; The IPs carried out trainings for 564 health workers and put gender-based violence (GBV) protocols in place in health facilities&#x2022; The proportion of facilities transmitting monthly drug consumption reports steadily increased, reaching a rate of 90% at the end of HPF2.&#x2022; Stock levels for tracer medicines availability was consistently over 80%.&#x2022; Significant support was provided for the implementation of the MOH&#x2019;s HMIS, especially through training and preparation of guidelines and manuals. Training was provided for staff of IPs, SMOHs and CHDs in quality data capture and data cleaning. Quality assurance of the HMIS data included supervisory visits, HPF review meetings with county partners, spot checks and verification by IP and HPF staff.&#x2022; All 23 lots in HP2 produced one comprehensive health plan and budget (government and all partners combined).&#x2022; Despite outbreaks of unrest during 2013 and 2016, 70 programme steering committee meetings and 5 state oversight committees were conducted during HPF and HPF2.
Outcome Result 3: Increased access to nutrition services particularly for pregnant women and young childrenKey achievements (Data taken from the programme Health Management Information System (HMIS):&#x2022; Facility; 265,837 Growth Monitoring Promotions (GMP) for children under five increased from 265,837 in 2015/16 to 834,348 by end of the programme.&#x2022; Cure rate of outpatient nutrition programme for children &gt;5 increased from 20% to 80%.&#x2022; The number of children under-five nutrition outpatients discharged cured rose from 20% to over 80%.&#x2022; Death rate fell from 40% to 10% in HFP supported facilities.&#x2022; Child outpatient curative consultations increased by over 100% from 1,233,061 in year one to 2,587,779 in the final year. &#x2022; 20 million consultations over all has been provided to children under give years of age at the end of the program, exceeding the target of 8,252,350.&#x2022; 1,602 health workers have been trained in CMAM and MIYCN, of which 660 were female.&#x2022; 287,900 caregivers, pregnant and lactating women has participated in nutrition and MIYCN messaging sessions.</narrative>
