   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Provision of emergency life-saving integrated child protection services for new displaced children from Jabal Marra in Sortony, in North Darfur and Nertiti and Fanga Suk in Central Darfur.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project aims to provide lifesaving child protection services for 23,904 vulnerable children (9,562 boys 14,342 girls) affected by recent Jebel Marra crisis and displaced in Sortony/North Darfur and Nertiti, Rokoro/Fanga suk in Central Darfur. UNICEF will support establishment of 6 new CFS (Sortony 3, Rokoro 3) and strength 9 existing ones (Nertiti 6, Fanga Suk 3). 

The CFS (Child Friendly Spaces) will run in 3 shifts to cater need of boys and girls from all age group. Basic psychosocial support (PSS) will be provided to children who experienced traumas, personal tragedies and threats due to conflict in their areas of origin. Through CFS, children will receive necessary PSS to rebound from difficult experiences. At CFS, trained animators will identify children with special psychosocial need and make necessary referrals. In addition, a PSS mobile team will be in place to reach out with basic PSS at home and other basic services. Particular attention will be given to children exposed to GBV and grave child rights violations. Their referral to provision of appropriate medical services will be ensured and specialized PSS provided. 

In addition, monitoring and reporting of grave child rights violations (MRM) will be establishment/strengthening in accordance with the Security Council Resolution on Children and Armed Conflict (CAAC) in Sortony and Nertiti (strengthening) in Fanga Suk (establishment) children identified as victims of those grave violations will be referred to necessary services. 

Local family tracing and reunification (FTR) team, composed of social worker, CBCPN (Community based Child Protection Network) members, IDP local leader and CP officer of the selected implementing partners, will be conducting fast track activities to identify UASC, document and conduct FTR, mediation and reunification. The UASC (Unaccompanied and Separated Children) will be involved in the FTR process since high number of children knows their address and their area of origin. Emergency tracing will be prioritized to maximize opportunities for immediate reunification and take advantage of fact that relatives may be nearby. Although adolescents UASC will be included in the tracing programmes, younger UASC tracing will be prioritized as they are more exposed to violence, abuse and exploitation. Families who have lost children will inform of the action they can take to find their missing children. FTR will not be pursued if it puts children at risk such as ongoing military operations in the area, in that case alternative care will be explored and supported. 

Temporary community-based care will be supported since in Darfur caring for extra children from extended family or neighborhood is a culturally accepted situation. The FTR local team will identify all displaced children without extended family links, persuade the community to care for those children who were displaced alone and are void of extended family or neighbors. The FTR local team will conduct regular family visit to prevent violence, exploitation and abuse of those UASC placed in community-based care, especially when UASC are spontaneously taken by families from a different community. Placing children in families from different communities will be discouraged and used only as a measure of last resort. 

To mitigate and prevent child protection risks that children and their families might face in the new displacement locations, various community for development activities will be conducted through community CBCPN members, including house-to-house visits awareness raising sessions, focus group discussions, tea time talks and celebration of regional and international days. Different communication materials, such as leaflets, banners, booklets and posters will be either distributed to IDPs or displayed in all services facilities, including CFS, clinics, nutrition centers, schools, distribution and water collection point.</narrative>
