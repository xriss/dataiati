   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Core-pipeline; Access to essential PHC services for the IDPs and returnees  in 34 prioritized  localities in Greater Darfur, Abyei, and Blue Nile states through availability of emergency medicines and medical supplies.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The availability of free-of-charge medicines is vital to ensure the access to affordable essential health care services for the people in need of humanitarian aid, as well as addressing the imminent public health threats. Last few years&#x2019; experience proved the medical core-pipeline managed by WHO has been a significant support for 26 sector partners (9 INGOs, and 17 NNGOs and MOH), especially for the prompt coverage of the essential health needs of the new conflict induced IDPs, until additional resources were made available. The 2016 project aims to continue to facilitate timely access to quality emergency medicines and supplies for the delivery of PHC emergency services by the health facilities run by national and international NGOs and MOH (only in areas not accessible for health partners). The project focuses on 7 commonly prioritized localities and 27 additional sector specific prioritized localities affected by conflict and displacement where 11 INGOs and 21 NNGOs are operating. 21 out of the total prioritized localities are also affected by El Nino and the subsequent health impacts increased risk and vulnerability to vector and water borne diseases and in general to communicable diseases. 
The WHO core-pipeline medicines is integral part of the health sector surge capacity helping to immediately fill in the gaps created by a) medicines shortages created by delays in medicines and supplies procurement encountered by partners NGOs, with a focus and priority on SHF projects b) acute, unexpected events (new displacement, outbreaks of larger scale) with consequent additional caseload supporting the SHF NGOs c) if necessary, the core-pipeline supports the establishment and short-term functioning of additional temporary PHC clinics and treatment centers in response to acute crisis, including public health events (outbreaks) that surpass the local response capacity. 
Most of the supplies will be procured internationally from WHO pre-qualified suppliers in forms of emergency kits meeting the international quality standards and donors requirements.  WHO will procure Rapid Response Kits (RRK) jointly designed by INGOs, WHO and MOH adapted to the protracted nature of Sudan IDP crisis and to the local morbidity profile (most common diseases). The essential list of medicines for PHC care (WHO) was used as basis, and the inclusion of essential medicines for chronic diseases that are life-saving but un-affordable in long term displacement situations has been a recommendation from the intended beneficiaries (IDPs and conflict affected communities) and the direct service providers.  The kit include a balanced mix of medicines responding to the demographic specificities with almost 70% women and children and their specific health need paediatric formulas for children bellow 5 years of age, medicines for ante, post natal and family planning consultations , and essential (first line treatment) medication for adults acute and chronic diseases. 
To support timely investigation  and initial response to outbreaks specific laboratory confirmation kits, along with Diarrheal Diseases kit, and Interagency emergency health kits (IEHK) that could be used for treatment centres for measles and pertussis outbreaks have been included. After the suspension of ICRC operation in Sudan, WHO has filled in the gap for the supplies necessary for the surgical treatment (free of charge) of civilian war trauma surgical care. For this purpose, trauma surgical kits will be procured and distributed when necessary to referral health facilities. To   ensure timely delivery of medicines and supplies, the emergency stock from WHO Dubai logistic hub will be used to shorten the procurement period. The medicines and supplies will be divided between the targeted states WHO ware houses.  NGOs will be informed on their availability through cluster mechanism and decision for support is done based on request, justification,  and cluster members (at state level) agreement.</narrative>
