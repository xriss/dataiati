   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The ongoing conflict in Darfur led to serious health and social consequences. Millions of people fled their home villages and displaced to relatively safer areas competing host community on minimal resources existing. Both IDPs and host communities suffer a lot due to disruption of basic health services. The major victims of this unfavorable situation are children who represent more than 50% of total affected population. With poor access to safe water and proper nutrition, children are at risk of outbreaks of communicable diseases especially vaccines&#x2019; preventable ones. UNICEF is running huge emergency operations in Darfur and other conflict-affected states. Many partners -including the government and NGOs- are supported by UNICEF to implement health activities in these hot spots. 
A joint mapping of priority localities was recently conducted by the health cluster&#x2019;s members. Based on this prioritization exercise, six localities in Darfur have been identified as high priority ones. They are registering a remarkable gap in PHC services provision including maternal and child health services. Kutum (North Darfur), Nertiti and Rokero (Central Darfur) localities have been selected among those six high priority localities. They are suffering from the protracted conflict and recently affected by huge influx of IDPs from Jebel Marra. The decision to focus on these three priority areas is based on the mapping of on-going response to Jebel Marra conflict as well as the capacities (and further needs) of partners (NGOs) present in the field.
This core-pipelines&#x2019; projects targets 439,508 people (including host community members and IDPs) in  Kutum, Nertiti and Rokero localities with a special focus on the needs of children below 15 years who  represents more than 52%  of total population. Relying on its efficient procurement system, Additional localities to  be reached include Sheria ( Central Darfur) Umbaru (North Darfur) and Kerenik( West Darfur).  UNICEF is procuring essential drugs&#x2019; kits and supplies (IMCI, PHC kits and ORS) to meet the increasing population&#x2019;s needs in these priority areas. Partners supporting health interventions in the selected priority areas can access these supplies by submitting their needs to UNICEF. The partner request will be reviewed to ensure that it fits into the health sector agreed objectives and response strategies. Then a program cooperation agreement (PCA) will be signed between UNICEF and the partner to formalize the commitments of each parties.
UNICEF will use this SHF funds to secure the basic core-pipelines (essential drugs&#x2019; kits) for selected localities to avoid interruption of provision of the life-saving PHC services (control of outbreaks and common diseases management) and enhance the access of vulnerable populations (IDPs and host communities) to these services. In practice, these core-pipelines-along with vaccines- are estimated to absorb up to 70% of total health budget and more often beyond the capacity of most of the implementing partners (NGOs essentially). Through this project, UNICEF is planning to procure 270 IMCI kits, 258 PHC kits and 264 ORS box to cover the targeted population&#x2019;s needs over 12 months. These supplies will be distributed to the implementing partners &#x2013;mainly NGOs. For vaccines, other funding sources (CERF and bilateral grants) will be used to avail the annual needs in these targeted localities.
An effort was made to ensure effective complementarity with supplies from WHO and UNFPA pipelines, considering the comparative advantage of each of the concerned UN agencies.</narrative>
