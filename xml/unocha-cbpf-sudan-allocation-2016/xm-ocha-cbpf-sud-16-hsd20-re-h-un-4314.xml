   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Response to Acute Watery Diarrhea outbreak in 6  states continuously reporting cases in Sudan,</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The request is in response to the ongoing AWD outbreak that has started in August 2016 in Kassala and rapidly spread to Gedaref, Sennar, Blue Nile, Gezira, and Khartoum states. The proposed project activities  focus in providing life-saving treatment for an estimated 2000 cases of AWD cases in targeted states until the outbreak is controlled early identification and treatment of cases, , besides saving lives,  has a major impact on controlling the outbreak  by reducing the spread of bacteria into the environment and through the rapid identification of pockets of dissemination. 
The planned activities are directly contributing to this goal and includes: additional technical support (epidemiologists, public health Officers) for the affected states Outbreak Response Teams  to provide advice for surveillance/early warning, alert investigation, data analysis,  implementation of the response, and monitoring  along with constraints and solutions identification.
Better surveillance and activation of silent sites with daily reporting in affected localities to promote early detection of cases but also identify trends and ways of dissemination. Early treatment centres close to the affected communities are essential to ensure prompt access to life saving treatment this includes additional skilled staff and medicines and supplies risk communication through health facilities and media essential for early referral improved health care seeking behaviour, and community participation. 
The health sector activities of WHO are complemented by the UNICEF health part at community level in support to the response of the federal and states MOH. The proposed intervention will be also complemented by WASH  interventions essential to identify the risks of spread of the outbreak and the sources of dissemination through systematic water quality testing that will also guide the actions related to access to safe water and proper sanitation. This would break the chain of transmission of the diseases. 
The response has been already initiated and WHO had provided substantial support to the states and federal MOH efforts, especially when the rapid spread of the outbreak challenged the local capacity. The country office surge capacity had been already exhausted (Jabal Mara IDP crisis, South Sudanese refugees) and WHO had borrowed supplies and operational support from the regional office while negotiating the use of SHF reserve funds. As the process had been relatively lengthy, we are requesting the eligible date of the expenditure as of 1st October 2016.
The intervention targets the 6 states (26 localities)  still reporting cases and a comprehensive health response and containment package will be implemented.  Some flexibility during implementation will allow the initiation of response in the states at high risk such as South Kordofan, and East Darfur in case AWD is confirmed.  Few activities related to surveillance and case confirmation will be implemented in these 2 states within this request.</narrative>
