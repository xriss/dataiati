   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Provision of Sustained Integrated Emergency Primary Health Care and Nutrition Services to  newly arrived  South Sudanese Refugees Affected by the current  Crisis in South Sudan and Host communities  Bilel Locality, South Darfur State.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project aims to ensure the provision of both lifesaving treatment of common ailments and promotion of positive health seeking behaviors focused on maternal, new-born and child health among targeted newly arrived South Sudanese refugees and surrounding host communities in Bilel locality, South Darfur. NCA has been operating the Bilel PHC and nutrition centers since 2004. The ongoing conflict in South Sudan has resulted in an influx of refugees to Bilel and therefore increased the caseload on the facilities in the area. Currently the Bilel clinic is staffed with two medical assistants, three midwives, two vaccinators and three nurses as medical staff. NCA has been supporting the most vulnerable communities in Bilel with PHC and its nutrition programme. Bilel clinic gives necessary curative and preventive services to IDPs and host communities through SHF 2016 first allocation funds. But, due to the large influx of South Sudanese refugees, the clinic and the nutrition centre face challenges in sustaining services with the limited budget. This support will enable the provision of timely lifesaving treatment for various health challenges and malnutrition in PLW amp children under five. The promotion of preventative measures will be shared with children and pregnant women on immunizations, provision of ante-natal, delivery, post-natal, emergency obstetric referrals and health education sessions. The nutrition component will target PLWs and children under five through MUAC screening to identify malnutrition cases among refugees. Identified MAM and SAM cases will be referred to the nutrition centre run by NCA. SAM cases with medical complications will be referred to stabilization centres, at Nyala hospital. Regular awareness sessions focusing on behavioral change on nutrition with the target population will be conducted. The project will target 4,313 newly arrived South Sudanese refugees including: 1,510 men, 1,562 women, 600 boys, 641 girls and 8,687 host community members (2,887 men, 4,331 women, 729 boys and 740 girls) with provision of PHC services. Special attention will be given to children and PLW due to their increased susceptibility to communicable diseases. 1,474 PLWs will receive reproductive health (RH) services that include a package of: ANC, delivery at clinic, PNC care and immunization services. Children lt1 year will receive immunization against preventable diseases. Raising men&#x2019;s awareness and increasing their involvement in health/hygiene promotion will be carried out during monthly community health committee (CHC) meetings which involve 70% men and 30% women. The project&#x2019;s nutrition component will focus on the identification and referral of MAM and SAM cases for newly arrived 400 PLWs and 700 under five children (South Sudanese). Nutrition education activities will be conducted. Currently, NCA is running one OTP, one SFP and one PHC clinic in Bilel locality. By the end of October 2016, the project funded by SHF second allocation 2015 funds to run the nutrition centre will end, hence this project will be vital to ensure the continuation of such activities. The project will work towards strengthening of CBIs such as CHCs who will provide a link between NCA/SMoH&#x2019;s integrated health sectors and be the link between beneficiaries and NCA/SMoH. Monthly meetings provide accountability platforms for them to raise needs for the target beneficiaries including special cases. NCA supported clinic infrastructures continue to take into consideration accessibility issues among vulnerable groups. Toilets are constructed and separate for men and women. 
During the monthly meetings, feedback is provided and updates on the programme direction is shared with the participation of CHC members whose views are considered necessary.</narrative>
