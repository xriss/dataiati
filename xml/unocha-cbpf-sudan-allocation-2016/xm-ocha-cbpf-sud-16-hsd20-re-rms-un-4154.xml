   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Integrated life-saving essential primary health care including maternal and
child health care and referral services for South Sudanese refugees in
East Darfur</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The armed conflict in South Sudan has displaced thousands of civilians internally and continues to cause an outflow of refugees into neighboring countries, including Sudan. The situation continues and since January 2016, Sudan has received the largest number of new arrivals with over 58,000 reaching East Darfur state. In East Darfur, actions were taken to support the SSRs in Khor Omer and in El Daein locality. More recently, additional new arrivals were reported in East Darfur as a result of outbreak of fighting in Raja town, Western Bahr al Ghazal state. An Inter-Agency Initial Rapid Assessment (HAC, UNHCR, OCHA, UNICEF, WFP, IOM, UMCOR, SRCS and ARC) reported approximately 6,000 individuals (1,064 households) in the area, of whom the majority are women and children. This number is expected to increase up to 10,000 during the up-coming months. In the health sector, although no major disease outbreaks were reported during the rapid assessment mission among children under-fives, UNICEF, WHO, UNFPA, UNHCR will pair up with the American Refugee Committee (ARC) to ensure the delivery of life-saving primary health care and referral care to the refugees, directly in the camps (Al Nimir and El Ferdous) and through the available health infrastructures around the refugees camps (host communities). UNICEF contribution will basically focus in making the key primary health care supplies (PHC and IMCI kits) available on the ground to treat common child illnesses, as well as measles vaccines to reduce the risk of measles outbreak and Long Lasting Insecticide Treated Nets (LLINs) for preventing malaria among the refugees population, while also replenishing the core pipeline to be able to address health needs of expected SSRs new arrivals during the eight months of the intervention. 
UNICEF plans to utilize the SHF reserve fund for procuring and distributing essential emergency health supplies (PHC kits, IMCI drug kits, Zinc) and measles vaccines to health facilities run by the SMOH and ARC, and also procure Long Lasting Insecticide Treated Nets (LLNIs) for preventing malaria among the new SSRs arrivals. Expected 6,500 children under-15 years are expected to have access to quality PHC services in Al Nimir and El Ferdous SSRs camps and surrounding host communities, while also receiving measles vaccination to reduce the measles outbreak risk and expected 10,000 SSRs will receive LLINs to prevent malaria. The main implementing partners will be the SMOH and ARC already present in the areas.</narrative>
