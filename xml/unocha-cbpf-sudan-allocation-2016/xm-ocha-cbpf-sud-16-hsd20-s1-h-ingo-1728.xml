   <narrative xml:lang="EN">After the expulsion of INGOs from Nertiti in 2009, very few humanitarian NGOs have remained in the locality, and the suffering of the IDPs has increased due to disruption in provision of essential services. 
Thousands of civilians have been displaced from the Jebel Marra area in Sudan&#x2019;s Darfur region since mid January2016 as a result of increased hostilities between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the Abdul Wahid faction of the Sudan Liberation Army (SLA/AW). Hostilities continue to be reported in the Jebel Marra and prospects for the newly displaced remain uncertain. Displacement could increase if hostilities continue.
Estimates for Central Darfur vary between 3,350 and 50,000, out of which more than 20,000 persons sought refuge in Nertiti town, Thur village and Guldo. This has increased the caseload of the IDPs in these areas and put more burdens on limited existing essential services.
Islamic Relief Worldwide has been implementing WASH, health and Food security including school feeding. Programs since 2012 through a permanent office in Nertiti managed by and expat program manager
The proposed project aims to reduce the suffering of the IDPs women, children, host community and nomads in Thur, North camp and Nomads area of Nertiti town of Central Darfur State from communicable diseases.
