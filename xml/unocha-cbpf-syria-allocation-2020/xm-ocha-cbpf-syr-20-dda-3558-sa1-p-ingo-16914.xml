   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Emergency Explosive Ordnance Risk Education assistance for vulnerable groups and at-risk communities in Aleppo</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The overall goal of this project is to reduce the number of victims of landmine and unexploded ordnance accidents in the Aleppo governorate. DRC dedicated Risk Education (RE) field teams will raise awareness of the risks of Explosive Ordnance (EO) and promote safe behaviors for communities living in contaminated areas. Collaborations with Community Focal Points (CFP), national NGOs engaged in RE and Community Liaison (CL) will be pursued 1. to ensure RE activities have maximum reach and impact, 2. are informed by assessments, and 3. subject to regular testing by and with communities and their representatives. 

The approach will focus strongly on developing a technically sound Behavior Change Communication (BCC) strategy. This refers to a conceptual and methodological risk-management approach to managing the risks posed by explosive hazards in the light of
three imperatives: 1. ensuring the safety and security of DRC staff, service providers and contractors 2. continuing operations and ensuring institutional integrity, and 3. fulfilling the humanitarian mandates to assist vulnerable populations, especially those people who are affected by EO contamination. Design of innovative and effective RE safety messages and the content will be based on quality assessments, undertaken with the help of national NGOs, and will be subject to regular piloting and review to ensure their relevance and efficacy.  All activities will be undertaken under strict quality assurance and control from the DRC RE Programme Manager (PM). 

Within the SHF, Aleppo is considered a priority location for protection and, more specifically, humanitarian mine action (HMA) activities for Syria. Aleppo governorate is contaminated with victim-activated devices such as landmines, explosive remnants of war as well as IEDs that maim and kill civilians almost daily. Because of the massive proliferation in both rural and urban settings, many across the governorate find themselves forced to enter potentially dangerous areas as they are trying to continue or return to their personal and professional lives. This intervention will target specifically those at high risk of EO accidents including IDPs and returnees, those involved in construction (including (I)NGO Shelter amp WASH staff and contractors) and agriculture activities, as well as the younger generation growing up in surroundings often littered by landmines and explosive remnants of war (ERW).

DRC will facilitate strong synergies with its existing programming in Aleppo, where RE will be mainstreamed into protection activities on the ground (including PSS, child protection, and youth programming), Quality Education as well as in its Shelter amp WASH and soon starting Economic Recovery programme. 

DRC represents the only HMA actor in Syria and is this year expanding its RE and CL activities across Syria. Simultaneously, DRC is in the process of signing a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MoFA) that will facilitate the start of the first comprehensive HMA program in Syria including survey, marking and clearance of explosive ordnance also envisioned to be situated in Aleppo. The works done by the RE teams within the SHF will serve this cause incredibly well, as experience, existing knowledge, and networks will greatly facilitate the start of more extensive survey and coordination and communication with relevant actors in Aleppo.</narrative>
