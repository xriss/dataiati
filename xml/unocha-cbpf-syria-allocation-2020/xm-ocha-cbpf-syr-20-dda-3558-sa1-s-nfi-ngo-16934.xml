  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Al Mayadin and Khasham are located in eastern country side of Deir Ez Zor province, and are considered in high severity of needs due to low availability of basic services while at the same time high levels of returnees who lost their livelihoods. These locations also typically have overburdened and weak health systems and lack sufficient primary and / or secondary health care, in addition to poor education options with overcrowded schools, poor and damaged water and sewage networks as well as limited livelihood opportunities. Moreover, most of the population are being farmers and totally depend on incomes from agriculture activities as is a fertile and prosperous farming area and Euphrates river considered the main source of water to irrigate crops but at the beginning of May this year, Turkey deliberately has been continuing reducing the rate of the Euphrates River flowing into the Syrian lands in the rate of 70%, where the current percentage of water flowing into the Syrian territories is estimated 150 cubic meters of water per second out of 500 cubic meters (Syria share) which reflected negatively on the society&apos;s economy situation particularly on agriculture activities, in addition to the issue of providing drinking water to the residents along with reduced hours of electricity generated from the Euphrates and Teshreen stations.
Moreover, due to the armed conflicts took place in the areas of Al Mayadin and Khasham, 80% of the population has been forced from their homes feeling the insecure situation and many families have been displaced multiple times, and after the areas controlled by the Syrian army and security situation become calm and stable and the normal life returned gradually to Al Mayadin and Khasham areas, consequently, since the beginning of 2018, the displaced families from these areas started returning back to their origin homes where 13,950 spontaneous displaced families returned back to their homes in Al Mayadin and Khasham comprises only 38% of the total displaced population where 62%, the remaining displaced  families (24,000 HHs) are still living at the displacement areas, of which 7,450 HHs returned back to Al Mayadin city and  6,500 HHs returned back to their origin areas in Khasham areas. The top three priorities of population in these underserved areas are rehabilitation of basic services, food assistance and livelihoods support notably to farmers and herders. At the same time, the areas continue to experience considerable population movement especially returnee movements which put further pressure on the severely overburdened public facilities. where humanitarian needs are driven by drastically reduced financial means and by difficulties in reaching markets. 
and as part of the humanitarian needs of the residents in particular the returnees and with the priority of the shelter sector and eligible intervention provision of critical NFIs this response project has been designed to support affected people with disabilities with aid facilities as well to support children of/and mothers headed families through provision of winter clothes.
This is a proposed response plan to assist 10,600 beneficiaries of which 600 persons including children are with disability through the following activities:
Provision of 100 wheelchairs to children with disabilities from 4-12.
Provision of 250 wheelchairs to people with abilities men and women.     
Provision of 400 crutches ( A pair/person)to men and women with disabilities benefiting 200 persons..	
Provision of 50 hearing aid facilities to people with hearing disabilities.
Provision of 8,000 winter jackets for children of mothers headed families including children with disabilities.
