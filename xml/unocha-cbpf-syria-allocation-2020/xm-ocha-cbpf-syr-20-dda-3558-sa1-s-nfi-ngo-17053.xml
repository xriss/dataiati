   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Humanitarian Assistance for Returnees and Affected people by Rehabilitate their privet apartments</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project main goal is to contribute towards the resilience and cohesion of communities and households by improving housing in the targeted communities. The project aims to support to sustainably rehabilitate housing to affected and returned families in the most vulnerable areas. The response modalities used will include in-kind and direct assistance to implement small-scale rehabilitation works for private apartments of returnees and affected people in the targeted areas .
Since the conflict in Syria before ten years all of the population has been forced to the flee their homes often multiple times which affected the quality of life and exposed them to multiple risks and violations of their rights, there have been countless deaths, devastating injuries, illness and no humanitarian dignity.
The results of the crisis variables and the secure stutes of many areas and cities in Syria have led to various needs.
These results are obvious particularly in areas that are receiving newly returnee families. Despite the large destruction and damage to facilities and buildings, an active returning movement of IDPs has been noticed to rural Areas. According to HNO 2020, an estimated of 5.65 million people, including IDPs, returnees, host communities and Palestine refugees are in need of shelter support, representing a 20 per cent increase from 2019. The need for rehabilitation of damaged houses and infrastructure across the country is at a scale that goes beyond the Sector&#x2019;s humanitarian focus, as well as its capacity.
In the belief that shelter projects should be individual-centered, focusing primarily on enabling and assisting household self-recovery.
