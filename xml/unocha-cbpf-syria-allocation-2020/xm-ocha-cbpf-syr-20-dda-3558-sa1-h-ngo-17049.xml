   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Project of providing medical services and health care in Al-Raqqa Governorate</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The current crisis in Syria, especially in the eastern region and the Raqqa governorate, as it was a battlefield between the warring parties, affected various aspects of life, especially in terms of health. Including electricity, fuel, safe drinking water and basic sanitation services, which led to an increased exposure to disease outbreaks, and most health centers became out of service, especially government hospitals that were providing free services to citizens. The prices of medical, health and pharmaceutical services have increased significantly.
The community in Raqqa governorate suffers from difficult living conditions, including medical shortages, health problems caused by malnutrition, epidemics and diseases, and the scarcity of health centers in some areas. The urgent need for clinics and dispensaries, high prices for surgeries, low per capita income and loss of income sources.
The situation above has deprived many people of life-saving surgeries and medical treatment because of their inability to afford high costs. So many people lost their lives and many became disabled.
The Syria Hope Association is one of the main partners of UNICEF and the United Nations Development Program, and we have several project proposals with other organizations, including health, livelihoods and education. We have a cadre in the association with high experience in project management.
We in this project will provide life-saving health care (surgical and hospitalization for some cases), which will enhance people&apos;s lives, and gender equality will be respected by implicitly in terms of the project it will provide services to all those in need regardless of gender.
Through this project, the Syria Hope Association aims to cover all expenses of life-saving surgeries and treatment of people in need of health care services, and health care services will be provided to the host community and IDPs
In order to provide services in the best way, the association will adopt a referral system to ensure proper diagnosis of patients and an understanding of their medical condition. The referral system will include Diagnosing patients and conducting a social survey of patients to ensure that their standard of living requires the provision of health services. Based on the recommendations of the specialist doctors, after which the patient is referred to hospitals for surgeries or for treatment of need. Our association will cover the costs of surgeries, treatments and medications. It monitors and monitors the patient&apos;s condition through the monitoring system to ensure that the required procedures and the best medical results are achieved.</narrative>
