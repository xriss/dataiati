   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Protection of civilians in Syria through Explosive Ordnance Assessment Support in Rural Damascus</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The overall aim of the UNMAS Syria Response Programme (SRP) is to minimize the threat of explosive ordnance for communities most at risk through effective sector coordination and the implementation of humanitarian mine  action activities in line with Sectoral Objective of enhanced protection as detailed in the 2020  Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP). In accordance with the OCHA&#x2019;s First Standard Allocation 2020 priorities and specifically, as per Protection sector main objective to reduce the impact of explosive hazards, the SRP will provide an Explosive Ordnance Assessments (EOA) capacity in Rural Damascus through non-technical and technical means of survey in order to support the safe implementation of humanitarian operations.

1) This project is designed as such that we will work in the selected locations in Rural Damascus in line with the Protection sector&#x2019;s eligible locations, which match mine action priorities and for which access is already approved. 7 Sub-districts are listed in the &quot;locations&quot; tab, but includes communities such as Kafr Batna, Al Alyia, Al Kasir, Al Deirya, and Darayya, 

2)    Since 2019, UNMAS has been in constant discussions with the Government of Syria (GoS) mine action counterparts concerning potential survey/clearance locations.
These locations have been selected by UNMAS based on the Humanitarian Need Overview (HNO) 2019 severity scale, further informed by available accident data of explosive ordnance incidents and available data on contamination levels extrapolated from explosive weapons usage reports and damage reports in the communities. In 2020 1Q, UNMAS and GoS have mutually agreed on high-priority locations in rural Damascus and Homs, of which 10 locations in rural Damascus match the eligible locations of the Protection Sector. Accordingly, the proposed locations in this proposal have already been approved from GoS, thus ensuring UNMAS&#x2019; access. 
 
3) This EOAT will be an extension of existing EOAT funded from another donor. They have already started working on-site in Rural Damascus since 13 Aug. This SHF funding will be used to extend this EOAT beyond current funding expiry, estimated around Nov.-Dec. 2020, for 6 operational months within 12 months project. Thus UNMAS is confident of their immediate start of operations, upon securing this SHF funding, less another force-majeure circumstance such as COVID19.

4) The EOA has two main components as part of its work process, Non-Technical Survey (NTS) and Technical Survey (TS). NTS covers the gathering of information through focused discussions with people that would have information on the location to ascertain the weapon platforms used and potential scope of contamination. The TS will enable the team to do an intrusive search into the area/infrastructure and confirm physically the absence/presence of explosive ordnance. Both components of the process are required to complete the assessment.

5) When and if explosive ordnance items are found and identified, the team will ascertain if they are remnants/parts that no longer contain any active explosive component, or are abandoned items of ordnance that have not been primed or fused, and therefore do not present a danger when moved. These items will be removed from the area/infrastructure and UNMAS will liaise with competent national authorities to have these handed over for destruction. If during the EOA work,  items of explosive ordnance are found that cannot be moved, then the area will be marked as &#x201C;unsafe&#x201D; to caution safety of  any humanitarian organizations&#x2019; work in the areas. 

6) Contamination data and information will be uploaded in the UNMAS Information Management System for Mine Action (IMSMA), analyzed and made available for further sharing with the Humanitarian Country Team (HCT) and humanitarian community.

7) The 10 personnel of the EOAT (5 internationals and 5 nationals, Budget item 1.1-1.7) are 100% dedicated to this project, and not working on any other activities</narrative>
