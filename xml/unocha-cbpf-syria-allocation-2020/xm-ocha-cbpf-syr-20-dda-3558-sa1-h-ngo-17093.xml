  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">According to HRP 2020 reports, rural area of  Homs including (Al-Dar-ALKaberah, Ar Rastan and Maihn......) are considered in high severity of needs due to low availability of basic services while at the same time high levels of IDPs. These locations also typically have overburdened and weak health systems and lack sufficient primary and / or secondary health care, in addition to poor education options (overcrowded schools), poor and damaged water and sewage networks as well as limited livelihood opportunities. the previous violence actions and harsh living conditions result in a very low quality health environment and causes health declines of individuals suffering from those cruel events. On the other hand, host communities, IDP&apos;s, and returnees to Rrural of Homs are lacking livelihoods or any income resources. Thus, they can&#x2019;t recover from health declines they are facing they can&#x2019;t even meet their basic needs. In addition, the disturbance of exchange rate caused an unreasonable increase in medical services prices, especially, that many service provider are out of service as mentioned before, while the demand on these services is in increase. All the aforementioned factors caused a massive flow of individuals seeking for medical support.

Lamset Shifa have conducted many Cooperative activities with World Health organization to provide patients with primary and secondary health services  in towns and cities of rural of homs, during the last four months Lamset Shifa has served more than  25,000 beneficiaries with medical consultations and medication on child health, internal and chronic diseases and RH in addition to MHPss services through 3 medical mobile teams who targeted the following areas in Northern Rural Homs: Makrumiyeh , Hashemiyeh , East al Farahaniah , Zafaraniya , west al Farahaniah , Deir Fool , and Ballan. in addition to al-Rukban Areas of Second destinations inclusive of: Mheen, Rayyan, Al- Forqlous, houlay, Shamseen, Al-Salihiyah, Zhoriya, and industrial Hassya Talbieseh and Al-Qusayr sub-districts. 

Lamset Shifa was able to respond to all people who seek the association&#x2019;s support using the fund of the WHO grant. Currently, due to  huge number of beneficiaries who ask for critical medical intervention , Lamset Shifa couldn&apos;t meet the needs of all people who ask the association support, taking into consideration that these needs are increasingly raising as people fail to meet their basic needs. Those people vary between host communities and returnees and IDP&apos;S of rural of Homs towns.

This project aims to cover all lifesaving surgeries for people in need, including host communities and returnees who are located in Rural of Homs especially AL-Dar al-Kaberah and Mahin   . In order to ensure that the provided  services is efficient, patient will receive primary health care services including medical consultation, medicine and diagnosis investigation which is supported by WHO fund. Then, cases which require secondary health services will be referred to hospitals to conduct the surgeries or any other treatment recommended by the doctors. Therefore, secondary services that needed to be funded by OCHA are conducted by the following:
1-Orthopedic surgeries
2- neurological surgeries.
3- artificial limbs
4 &#x2013;incubation new born.
5- General surgeries 
6- Dialysis sessions</narrative>
