  <description akvo:type="7" type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">A key hypothesis of the program is that the combination of sports and WASH brings lasting and sustainable improvements to children&#x2019;s hygiene and health seeking behavior. To be able to deliver lasting and durable results and funding, the F4W 2.0 focusses on:
- Enhancement of local ownership of the &#x201C;game change&#x201D; that is taking place. This means local programs with local partners, reacting to local needs and opportunities.
- Ensure institutionalization &amp; embedding. The F4W program should link to national systems, local communities and other stakeholders, as it must pertain to and/or improve standards, procedures and regulations as much as possible.
- Sustain and expand behavior change with a continuum of integrated F4W life skills training both in the schools and in the community.
- Focus on a sustainability approach towards Operation and Maintenance (O&amp;M) of WASH and sports facilities, through continuous monitoring of functionality and sound Cost Recovery Planning and involvement of/collaboration with the private sector.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">During F4W 2.0 we aim to:
- reach an additional 86.275 pupils, teachers and community members in and around 160 additional schools with our complete Football for Water 2.0 approach (ToC).
- reach approximately 292.920 children,teachers and community members through improvement and facilitating growth in phase 1 schools 
- to ensure 10 years sustainability on O&amp;M in all Football for Water schools (total of approximately 522.000 children)</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In 2017 the second phase of the Football for Water Program (F4W 2.0) started with the ambition to ensure quality, functionality and sustainability of the F4W interventions and to proof the concept works. We will consolidate the F4W concept by improving the enabling environment and secure involvement of local and national stakeholders in the F4W approach; assess the concept through a Learning Strategy that can proof the impact and effects; and we will identify financing models (for Cost Recovery and sustainable Operation &amp; Maintenance) for scaling the F4W concept.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Sustainability lies at the heart of F4W 2.0. Without a proper vision and strategy, as well as a clear and firm agreement on sustainability, the program cannot deliver lasting and durable results. This is why the consortium takes the FIETS Framework into account in all steps throughout the ToC. The FIETS framework leads the consortium in assessing all steps on Financial, Institutional, Environmental, Technical and Social Sustainability.
To ensure proper involvement of all stakeholders (a condition for sustainability), the program implementation only starts after a MoU has been signed- to clarify, validate and agree on the implementation roles and rules by all stakeholders. The MoU identifies how the schools and communities will benefit from the program and spells out the roles, responsibilities and accountability of all local stakeholders. It describes all aspects that lead to sustainability of the outcomes, O&amp;M and capacity building, such as: the Purpose of the program; Outputs of the program, including capacity strengthening components; Roles and responsibilities of each stakeholder (both local stakeholders as well as implementing partners); Description of specific program components such as construction/renovation of WASH facilities and football/ sports facilities; life skills training; embedding football activities in school health program; Operation &amp; Maintenance, M&amp;E; Cost Recovery Plans for continued F4W interventions in consecutive years; and budgeting.</narrative>

  <description akvo:type="6" type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) sector has achieved great success in meeting the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) for water &#x2013; globally halving the number of people without improved access. As the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) began, we have the opportunity to both celebrate what has worked and challenge ourselves to do things better. The Sustainable Development Goal for water (SDG 6) challenges us to work on inclusive and sustainable WASH.

We have learned that the solution lies not in just providing the WASH facilities for the 2.6 billion people who currently don&apos;t have them - but also to make sure that once received the services keep on working. So we need to build the local systems that can provide sanitation services needed. Systems that are led by local or national governments while drawing on the skills of the private sector and citizens organizations that actually provide the services. We also have learned that there is a difference between improved access to WASH facilities and improved health; an estimated 1 billion people still use unsafe water despite improved infrastructure. Improved WASH infrastructure should be met with equally an improved hygiene behavior, to get the desired health impact and to sustain services at the right level.

A growing body of evidence puts forward that sport is a good entry-point for the promotion of life skills and healthy lifestyles, through behavior change in the area of hygiene1. It increases self-esteem among adolescent girls and boys and provides opportunities for their advancement; gives all people, regardless of ability, improved physical health and encourages better academic performance; and sport fosters active citizenship, social inclusion and leadership.

That is why in 2012 an innovative program, called &#x2018;Football for Water&#x2019; (F4W) was initiated by a Dutch consortium to address the twin goals of WASH and sports development in neglected schools in three countries: Ghana, Kenya and Mozambique. The F4W program components include improving school football, water and sanitation infrastructure, putting in place the local capacity and systems to manage and maintain those services sustainably and improving hygiene behavior through WASH life skills training, improving football facilities and bringing children the benefits of sport (life skills, team skills, and physical fitness). These activities were combined with special initiatives to achieve sustainability, promote business development and introduce mobile-to-web monitoring systems. As such the program built in strategies to address pre-conditions for success, such as the physiological needs &#x2013; access to water -, as well as strategies to successfully address higher level local motivations and needs.</narrative>
