  </title>
  <description akvo:type="9" type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">At the start of the project, Susamati existed for several months, had 14 molds and a production workshop. It had been awarded for funding from the Islamic Development Bank, but the first instalments were delayed.</narrative>

  </description>
  <description akvo:type="8" type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Specific goals for this funding are:

1. Continuation of the business of this start-up

2. Development of strategies for marketing and scaling

3. At least 2 main contracts secured</narrative>
  </description>
  <description akvo:type="6" type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Susamati was created after the completion of the Aqua for All supported practical research project aiming at the introduction of the Black Soldier Fly as a means to reduce the volume of sludge in latrine pits. The research project had developed three business lines: the biobased pit latrine, Black Soldier Fly production and the Pia Fantastica, a very low flush toilet that was meant to be combined with the bio-based pit. Only the Pia Fantastica was business ready. Specifics are the straight flush pipe, the low water use, the ease of local production (concrete in a mold and painting), the attractiveness of the design  and the competative price compared to industrial flush toilets. Marketing of toilets is, however, not a simple business as many toilet manufacturers have gone bankrupt, already.</narrative>
  </description>
  <description akvo:type="5" type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Susamati was created in 2019 as a company that aims at low cost and water-saving sanitation technology. The main product is the Pia Fantastica, a toilet that needs very little water to flush. Next to that, the company is continuing the development of other business lines that include the black soldier fly larvae products, consultancies and training. As a starting company, Susamati requested gap funding from Aqua for All to sustain itself during the first year of operation and strengthen its business.</narrative>
  </description>
  <description akvo:type="7" type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The gap funding is to support the further implementation of the business plan. Specific deliverables are testing different marketing strategies and business concepts (franchise) while developing business lines for training, consultancies and larger works (such as public toilet buildings).</narrative>
  </description>
  <description akvo:type="3" type="3">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The main target group for the Pia Fantastica are people living in  Low Income areas without a sewer system. The price of 800 Mt (about &#x20AC; 11) is affordable for people living at the base of the pyramid. 

Susamati aims to scale through production workshops that work on franchise basis. Preference is given to women groups. Sales will be done through existing sales outlets of hardware.</narrative>

Finally disaggregate users that are provided with a Safely managed / Basic service / Limited service from the initiative. The initiative must tick all criteria to be considered as that service level.

1) Safely managed service:

- the initiative provides an improved sanitation facility (this includes: flush/pour flush to piped sewer system, septic tanks or pit latrines; ventilated improved pit latrines, composting toilets or pit latrines with slabs)

- the initiative&apos;s sanitation service is not shared with other households

- the initiative ensures that human excreta are safely disposed in situ or transported and treated off-site

2) Basic service:

- the initiative provides an improved sanitation facility (this includes: flush/pour flush to piped sewer system, septic tanks or pit latrines; ventilated improved pit latrines, composting toilets or pit latrines with slabs)

- the initiative&apos;s sanitation facility is not shared with other households

- initiative does not ensure that human excreta and urine is safely disposed / transported / treated

3) Limited service: Usually at baseline level, but cannot be included at target level. This includes, open pits, unimproved pit latrines, unlined pits, no slabs, prone to flooding etc

\* This is indicative of the reach and scale of the initiative in reaching new users with its products and services in terms of the service level that is being provided (as defined by JMP).</narrative>
