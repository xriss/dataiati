Bani Odhabi Water Project was established in 1999 in Abs district, Bani Awdhabi sub-district, it serves 8754 people, and was founded by support and funding from the British and German Embassy and implemented by ADO. A well was dug, a reservoir was built, and a grid was added to it. This project serves over 8 villages in this sub-district and is managed by a community committee which was chosen and trained on project management since 1999. The reason for this project was to solve the problem of not allowing girls to go to school and to minimize violence against girls and to allow her time to enter school, because girls at the time consumed all their time in going to bring water from faraway places, and before this project was launched ADO conducted an assessment of the girl&apos;s situation in these villages and found that the illiteracy rate among girls was 99%. There were no literate girls in that time or a girl that could go to school, after that ADO conducted a study, of the results of this study was to provide a water project before building a girl&apos;s school. In 2015, there was displacement into these villages because they were safe and far from the airstrikes and other dangers. Thus, many of Abs and Haradh city residents were displaced into these villages, overworking the project because the number of displaced families in to the area were about (1200) averaging (8754) individuals. Currently this project needs a minor grid maintenance. Due to the economic situation of most of the residents in the city, whether they&apos;re host community members or IDPs, the project is currently running twice a month, and sometimes only once, and that&apos;s because most of the residents are unable to pay the generator&apos;s fuel cost to be able to get drinkable water on a daily basis. The situation is very bad because people are unable to get a sufficient supply of water..</narrative>
