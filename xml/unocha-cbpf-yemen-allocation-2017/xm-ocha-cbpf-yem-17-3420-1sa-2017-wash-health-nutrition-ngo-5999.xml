   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Provision multi-sectoral integrated assistances ( WASH, Health and Nutrition) for the under-nutrition communities in two districts in Lahij governorate</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In line with 1st envelop of 1st standard allocation-2017, CSSW selected (120) undernourished communities in two districts (Al-Milah and Al Musaymir) in Lahij to deliver the proposed response under this project. The last EFSNA shows that Lahij is exceeding the &#x2018;serious&#x2019; threshold of malnutrition, and the GAM rates in the both districts are respectively 21.7%, and 21.7%.
CSSW with this project aimed to contribute to reducing child morbidity and acute malnutrition incidents by ensuring adequate access to Nutrition, health and WASH to the most vulnerable through an integrated approach. The project will reach with proposed multi-sector assistances (WASH, Health and Nutrition) to (135,302) of the most affected local populations with more focus on the malnourished children U-5, mothers/caretakers and pregnant and lactating women. CSSW continues the coordination with related clusters, YHPF partners and the authorities in these districts to avoid duplication and to ensure access of the targeted beneficiaries to full minimum package in prioritized sectors (WASH, Health, Nutrition and Food security).
The project will deliver the proposed WASH interventions in connection with integrated health nutrition interventions to selected undernourished communities in both targeted districts. CLTS approach will be used as entry point for these communities to improve community sanitation, and this include selecting and training (30) CLTS facilitators (50% female), triggering the selected undernourished communities, selecting and training two natural leaders (man and woman) per triggered community, and verifying and certifying the ODF status in 60% of the triggered communities. Minor interventions will be conducted to improve the water sources in these communities.
At institutional level, CSSW is going to support the capacities of the (10) public health units (selection approved by GHO Lahij) and (2) outreach health nutrition teams to provide integrated health and nutrition services to selected undernourished communities. The medical supplies, cash incentives for (40) health staff (50% female) in the targeted HUs and the outreach teams will be provided for ten months. Furthermore, the WASH facilities in (7) HUs will be rehabilitated.
(20) Nutrition Screeners in Al Milah and (female will be prioritized) will be selected and trained with (35) services providers in both districts on CMAM package by using national CMAM guideline. Malnourished women and children enrolled in malnutrition treatment component will be provided with (1,500) HKs, (500) WCFs and (1,000) malnourished child sanitation kits.
Comprehensive approach will be adopted to promote good hygiene practices within the prioritized four programmatic areas. CSSW is going to select (40) Nutrition/Hygiene promoters (50% female) from both districts. Four 5-days training workshops about comprehensive hygiene promotion approach will be hold for the selected Nutrition/Hygiene promoters, Nutrition Screeners, staff of the supported health units&#x2019; and outreach teams. Integrated activities include (16,400) home visits, (6,400) group awareness sessions for men, women, boys, and girls, and counselling sessions in fixed and mobile health/nutrition facilities will be done through ten months in both districts. With participation at the core, promotion activities and distributed IEC materials will emphasize prevention of diarrhea, hand washing, menstrual hygiene, infant and young child feeding (IYCF), water treatment, food storage, waste disposal, as well as cholera key awareness messages. Men and women of all ages will be encouraged to participate in groups so they can voice their concerns and express their preferences while implementing the project activities. The integrated approach will be doubly incorporated at the project level as well as at the sector level.
CSSW will extend the current agreements with GHO-Lahj to insure stock flow of the required malnutrition treatment including Plumby-Nuts.</narrative>
