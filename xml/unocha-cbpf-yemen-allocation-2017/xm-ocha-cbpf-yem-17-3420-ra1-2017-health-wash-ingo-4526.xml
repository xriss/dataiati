   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Cholera response for priority districts in Hajjah Governorate</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The conflict in Yemen has developed into a long-lasting humanitarian disaster and the situation is rapidly deteriorating in large parts of the country. Hospitals and health facilities do not have the possibility to care for patients adequately. Hygienic treatment and operating of the facilities cannot be ensured yet. Addtionally, most of the families in the Hajja Governorate cannot ensure basic hygiene and have no access or affordable means to equip themselves with the needed materials. The likelihood of a spread of diseases, such as Cholera, is high.  

An initial request by the Hajjah Health Office towards Vision Hope International took place. Their requirement was help in addressing the Cholera spread in some districts of Hajjah. The request has been verified with the request by the Health and WASH cluster. Thus, the project targets various districts: Hajjah city, Hajjah rural, Al Mahabishah Ash Shahel and Abs. The activities are algined with the identified needs of the health as well as WASH cluster. 

In order to meet the identified needs, VHI strives for two outcomes: firstly, the improved capacity of treatment, identification as well as case management of cholera in the priority districts and secondly, the improved hygiene management as well as personal hygiene including raised awareness with regards to cholera in the priority districts. 

To reach these outcomes the level of readiness of the response team, health workers and the facilities will be enhanced through training measures. Additionally, related medicines for treatment of patients with cholera treatments will be distributed in the five districts. 2500 families will receive cholera prevention kits for personal hygiene. This will reduce the spread of diseases through better hygiene. Furthermore, the communicty awareness about the diseases and simple prevention methods takes place. The health facilities can be seen as one of the major places for spreading diseases such as Cholera. Therefore, four hand washing stations as well as two foot washing stations will be set up in each health facilities and the staff be trained on the correct handling and refill of chlorine solutions. Additionally, the health facilities will be equipped with Cholera cleaning kits on a monthly cases. These include materials needed to clean equipment, rooms as well as everything needed after treating Cholera patients. The aim here is to establish a sufficient Cholera identification as well as first measures to take until the patient can be referred to a CTU.
Through this approach, VHI aims on the holistic approach of the situation through targeting the community, the health facilities and additionally including the local authorities such as the Ministry of Public Health   

With the end of the project, a final evaluation will take place.</narrative>
