  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">CARE proposes to implement an integrated response to address the critical and immediate food security and WASH needs of 25,200 individuals (3600 HHs) that are living in Jahaf district of Al-Dhale&apos;e Governorate. Out of the total planned 3600 HHs, the project aims to reach 1080 IDP households (7560 individuals) who are living with families of host communities and live in rented accommodation. The project targets villages with significant concentration of IDPs including Al-Sheimah and Al-Salqah. The project aims to improve the immediate household access to food for the most vulnerable and food insecure communities through unconditional and conditional cash transfers. The project will also address the WASH needs of households through enhancing access to safe drinking water and improve their knowledge to key hygiene, sanitation, and nutrition practices. 3600 HHs will be supported with cash assistance aimed at addressing immediate needs of which 2800 HHs will be supported with unconditional cash transfer and 800 HHs will benefit from conditional cash assistance. The conditional cash assistance will also help to rehabilitate six communal assets, such as water sources, roads, and other infrastructure, which will benefit the population living in these areas. CARE will follow the FSAC approved criteria for selection of beneficiaries and will target the most vulnerable and food insecure households, including vulnerable women/child headed and households, have limited cash income and no formal employment, HHs with children under five, and single parents taking care of disabled people. Monthly cash transfers will be over a period of six months of $67 per household per month, as per the guideline of the FSAC. The project will work with reputable money transfer agents with mobile teams, carefully selected based on CARE USA&#x2019;s procurement policy in order to minimize security risks when CARE staff and beneficiaries have to travel to project offices to collect money. Furthermore, the project shall also collect market information regularly pertaining to the availability and price of basic food items. Post distribution monitoring will also be the integral component of the monitoring framework so as to know what are people spending the cash on, how long it takes them to spend the money, the effectiveness of the distribution mechanism, and the changes in access to food at HH level. 
The project will provide comprehensive emergency WASH assistance to the targeted households to enhance access to safe water and prevent the spread of water-borne diseases through rehabilitating water points, providing household water treatment materials and training households in their use. To assuring water quality, CARE will train project field staff on portable water testing kits for major tests the project team will implement water testing regularly from random samples. CARE will also implement nutrition-sensitive hygiene promotion and distribution of Cluster-approved hygiene kits and replenishables. Hygiene promotion will be focusing on health-seeking behaviors, and recognizing signs and symptoms of common water-borne disease such as acute watery diarrhea and cholera. Additionally, CARE will promote optimal nutrition behaviors (such as regular hand-washing, appropriate health-seeking behaviors, optimal infant and young child feeding, and exclusive breastfeeding) to individuals or groups through the provision of relevant nutrition/health messages at WASH meetings. The project, in collaboration with relevant stakeholders, will establish community committees and develop beneficiaries&apos; selection criteria so as to overcome possible exclusion errors and maximize inclusion. CARE will also strengthen the Complaint, Feedback, and Response mechanism in order to receive timely complaint/feedback from the beneficiaries and provide timely response. The project shall ensure that vulnerable IDP and host men, women, boys, and girls have equal access.</narrative>
