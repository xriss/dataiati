   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Shelter  WASH Assistance for IDPs, Returnees and Host Communities in Ataq District of Shabwa Governorate</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Hundreds of thousands have been displaced and given the current security situation, the needs and vulnerabilities of IDPs have increased and their ability to cope in dire circumstances strained. They either live with a family relative or collective centers and rely on shared resources in cramped spaces. In some areas IDPs lack even basic shelters without any roof over them. 

There has been an increase in the number of returnees to partially stable governorates, yet those returnees needs and vulnerabilities have not been addressed. Affording shelter rent in their current situation is very difficult as some aren&apos;t receiving their salaries due to liquidity issues, while some have lost their sources of income, and for others their houses were severely damaged in the war and no longer suitable to live in. Affording rent and life essentials is a struggle for those people, most of whom are spending their life savings or acquire debt to pay rent leading them towards poverty. They also lack direct access to clean water, being forced to travel great distances or pay exorbitant prices for water which is often polluted. 

SHS seeks to intervene with Shelter amp WASH Assistance by providing Life-Saving Assistance to Conflict Affected Populations of IDPs, Returnees, and Host Community in Ataq District (Focus Areas: Al-Wady, Al-Mustawdana, and Al-Muhamashin) of Shabwa Governorate. To support their Shelter, NFIs and WASH needs by the provision of Shelter rent, distribution of NFIs amp water, provision of return kits amp hygiene materials for the IDPs, Returnees and Host Community which are most in need. This intervention is designed to respond immediately to the IDPs and Returnees most urgent needs mostly caused by the ongoing conflict and to help them cope with their current living situations and to improve their general living conditions with strong consideration to their dignity.

Criteria:

- Households of IDPs / Returnees / Host community
- They don&#x2019;t have shelter (live in collective centers) or open-air/ they don&#x2019;t have proper shelter (damaged by war).
- Difficulty to afford apartment rent: they don&#x2019;t have sustainable income (their income was affected due to the drawbacks of cash liquidity in the country/salary arrears, etc.).
- Poor families in need.
- HHs headed by women.
- HHs with a disability.

Also, Shelter Cluster beneficiary selection criteria will be implemented:

- Families live in the same house without privacy (that may result in protection concern issues). 
- Unaccompanied and separated children under 18 years of age. 
- Unaccompanied elderly persons of concern over 60 years of age, who lack support from their community. 
- A single parent taking care of a child with a disability.
- Single women combining an additional vulnerability element, such as medical condition. 
- Persons with disabilities, who due to their disability (psychological or physical) cannot support themselves.
- Couples with one spouse bedridden or suffering a medical problem which can prevent the other partner from work. 
- Single pregnant women can be assisted starting their 7 months pregnancy for 10 months.
- Persons with serious health problems who, because of their health situation, cannot support themselves or their families. 
- Women with special needs who cannot support themselves or their families. 
- Household headed by minors. 

Methodology:

- Selection of HHs with difficulty to afford the rent or HHs lacking proper shelter will be based on lists of vulnerable IDPs and Returnees with unfulfilled needs established by the local authorities and community leaders. Before the commencing the intervention, SHS MampE team will conduct an independent secondary verification to cross check the list with the current Shelter, NFIs and WASH needs of the beneficiaries for accurate selection according to the criteria.
- Selection of families living in the same house without privacy will take place at the beginning of t</narrative>
