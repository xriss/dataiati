   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Envelope 3: Integrated Health and WASH rapid response to Cholera outbreak in Almahweet Governorate</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Over the project duration of six months, YFCA plans to continue implementing integrated Health and WASH rapid interventions to respond to Cholera outbreak at two districts of Almahweet governorate using the controlling approach of cholera response strategic plan developed by health and WASH clusters. The main objective of implementing this project is to provide life-saving assistance to the most vulnerable people in Almahweet governorate through effective prevention and timely response.
Despite the humanitarian intervention in Almahweet governorate, the cholera continues to affect thousands of people. As of 25 September, suspected cholera cases reported since 27 April have reached 42,641 with 140 associated deaths. 
YFCA had already completed response interventions in Almahweet at Shibam, At Tawilah and Bani Saad districts by supporting 3 DTCs and 15 ORCS from the 2nd reserve allocation and it aimes to continue the response as a preventive measures for the expected third wave. The controlling approach used under this project had been selected for Almahweet as it is one of the high- risk governorates in the country being reporting new cholera cases almost in a daily basis with alarming increasing numbers reported from different locations including new areas with no past history of cholera cases.
Three main groups of activities will be implemented to respond to the cholera outbreak in Almahweet which are: 1) Early/rapid response activities, 2) Integrated response activities and 3) Integrated prevention activities focused on WASH, Health and Communication for Development (C4D) strategy to protect people at all levels.

Coordination with health and WASH clusters and GHO and DHOs has already done to support continuation of already done intervention and to avoid any duplication with other partners. All stakeholders will be coordinated during the implementation of activities with focus on close coordination with the Cholera task force in Almahweet and strengthen the stewardship of local health and WASH institutions to enable them performing in more effective and efficient ways.

YFCA will monitor this project activities using concentrated modalities and tools at the central, governorate and field levels with giving more attention to on time reports in WASH and health areas. Project staff will contain experts dedicated in full time contracts to fulfill the specific tasks in administrative and technical aspects in addition to YFCA staff at the head office and governorate units who will participate in providing the needed support to the field team.

YFCA will ensure mainstreaming of protection and gender concepts during the designing and implementing stages of this project as well as to demonstrate its accountability for beneficiaries and affected communities and their engagement in monitoring this project and take responsibility to improve and enhance the overall community awareness and best practices in WASH and Health areas.</narrative>
