   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Life Makers Meeting Place Organization (LMMPO) is proposing to implement a 9 month project that aims to increasing access of vulnerable persons in both IDP, returnees and host communities to food, and emergency wash and sanitation services in Al-Suqnah district with focus on food voucher distribution with raising awareness of targeted beneficiaries on best practices behaviors of food issues and encouraging them of recognition of malnutrition signs. Furthermore, WASH intervention aims to maintain sustainable water and sanitation systems in Al-Suqnah district including community mobilization in the 4 villages, water rehabilitation and maintenance of 2 wells, rehabilitation of WASH facilities (drinking water, water networks, toilets construction of 100 latrines in 5 villages for 100 HHs, rehabilitation of latrines in 3 health centers. 
LMMPO food intervention will be thro ugh approach of food vouchers distribution mechanism in Al-Qanawes, and al-Suqhnah districts &#x2013; Al-Hudayda governorate.
The project rationale is based on facts that target governorates have unmet food needs, lack of wash services including malnourished and there is evidence that little if any multi sect oral services (food, and water and sanitation) are available and reached vulnerable of children, pregnant and lactating women . 
The project also is built on the assumption that women and girls in both IDPs and host communities fall under more heavier burden of poverty and other forms of vulnerability and takes for granted that they have very low status more as IDPs and thus either unaware or unable to access food, and wash and sanitation services. The project also assumes that there is still need for local level details need assessment on food vulnerability in Al-Suqnah and Al-Qanwes districts working with the conceptual framework of Nutrition referral systems at national level for several years, also types of wash services needed in Al-Suqnah districts of hodidah governorate.
LMMPO has been putting into ongoing food and nutrition project in Al-Suqnah and Zabeed districts innovative approach to community based a control mechanism which heavily relies on community mobilization in support of identified and access of nutrition services. 
LMMPO through ongoing project, conducted rapid need assessment targeted 1116 HHs in Zabeed district and 950 HHs in Alsuqnah district for around 12,406 individuals (4,826 in Alsuqnah. And 7,581 in Zabeed in districts) which targeted identified for 10 villages need food services from Executive Unit of Al-Ramia al-Ulya sub-districts in Al-Hodeida governorate.
LMMPO through conducted rapid need assessment found that there is need gaps of food, and wash services for around 11 villages of Al-Ramia al-Ulya sub-district which is other than the targeted villages in the current food project, and in Al-Qanawes districts through coordination with Abs development organization (ADO) will distribute food basket while ADO have already ongoing project in health, Nutrition, and rehabilitation of wash and sanitation in 19 health centers.
Within this project LMMPO in partnership with Hodeida Girls Association are planning to implement WASH related activities in Al-Suqnah district so as to contribute to the elimination of spread the diseases. As the beneficiaries of WASH will be same as of food intervention to ensure integrated approach. It is worth mentioning that ADO is doing WASH and health related activities in Al-Qanawes. And both districts are of high priority districts for food and WASH.

Needs based food and wash support to the most vulnerable groups of women and children considered priority interventions towards meeting the overall lifesaving objectives of humanitarian aid.</narrative>
