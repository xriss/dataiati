  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project &quot;Delivery of life-saving assistance of food to the most vulnerable in Manakhah and Sa&apos;afan district&quot; is in line with the strategy of Yemeni women Union (YWU) and overall priorities for 2017 to respond to the most urgent needs of the most vulnerable people. YWU coordinated this project with FSAC coordinator and sub-cluster coordinator. YWU also has conducted a very recent needs assessment during 1-3 May 2017 in Manakhah and Sa&apos;afan districts which showed that the highest priority for the most vulnerable people in the two districts is food where 95% of the participants in FGDs and KIs prioritized food, and on the means of provision of aid the majority preferred unconditional vouchers which was well taken by YWU in designing this project. The needs assessment is attached to the project for kind reference. 

YWU will hire ,train and conduct orientation for project staff and implementing partner. YWU will Build the capacity of partner on response in emergencies. The partner will be assisted with developing policies responding to emergency planning and preparedness as well as training on policies ,strategies and reporting. The policies part will include developing , inter alia , program planning, monitoring and evaluation , security and safety, logistics and procurement , financial management...etc. 
YWU will advertise for Bid to contract a vendor to import/provide 6900 food basket. The vendor will be responsible for the distribution of the food basket based on the vouchers that will be issued for each beneficiary. The vendor should develop an emergency plan to deal with the worst case scenario. The project adopts a strict criteria for beneficiaries&apos; selection which has been agreed suggested by FSAC as types of vulnerable people illustrated in the HNO 2017. The project targets the most vulnerable households including IDPs, pregnant and lactating women, children, elderly, persons with disabilities, chronically ill persons, etc. YWU will design , print and distribute 6900 unconditional food vouchers (food baskets) during the project for 2300 vulnerable household (approximately 16100 individuals). A total of 16100 individuals including:  3542 men, 3703 women, 4348 boys and 4507 girls will directly benefit from the project. The implementing partner will be distributing  2070 vouchers in Sa&apos;afan for 690 HHs including 414 vouchers for 138 HHs with SAM cases. and YWU will distribute in Manakhah 4830 vouchers for 1610 selected HHs including 966 voucher for 322 HHs with SAM cases . The shares of both Manakhah and Sa&apos;afan are 70% and 30% respectively. 

The YWU will work closely with Relief International (RI) in both districts Manakhah and Sa&apos;afan as to complete each other in terms of integrating the two intervention i.e. RI will have integrated intervention to scale up its activities (Nutrition, Health, WASH) and YWU will cover the fourth sector which is food in both districts. YWU will provide the affected person with Severe Acute malnutrition (SAM ) discharged from health facilities targeted by RI with vouchers of food basket  to promote integrated approach for ensuring adequate access to Food, Nutrition, health and WASH in the same areas served. YWU has also coordinated with Islamic Relief in Sa&apos;afan district where it has a food intervention to avoid duplication during implementation. A meeting was conducted with the project staff at IRY and they shared with us the action plan they conduct. YWU and its implementing partner will work closely and cooperate with IRY in Sa&apos;afan district. IRY is supported by WFP to distribute 3505 vouchers for 3505HHs in Sa&apos;afan. IRY acknowledge that there is a very big gap in the response and YWU will coordinate with IRY to ensure response to fill that gap in light of the set resources. YWU will cover the following sub-districts in Sa&apos;afan: (i) Al-Jarawih, (ii) Mutooh  and (iii)Bani Ishaq. Meanwhile, IRY will cover the rest.</narrative>
