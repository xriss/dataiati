  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This proposed action seeks to provide access to food, water supply, improved sanitation facilities and hygiene promotion to the affected men, women amp children of Lahj and Sa&#x2019;ada governorates of Yemen. The action has been designed a cash-based and multi-sectoral approach primarily addressing the larger needs of food security. The proposed response is in line with YHPF sectoral allocation strategy as well as Yemen Humanitarian Response Plan 2017. The target area includes districts of first priority convergence. The proposed response is community led programme integrates Food security and WaSH, underpinned by gender, protection and conflict sensitivity throughout the programme cycle. The integration has been designed in the proposed action at two levels. First, Oxfam has collaborated with humanitarian agencies such as SCI, IR and IMC. In Lahj, IMC in the targeted location implements health activities and provides supplementary feeding and are providing nutrition services through established fixed HFs (Health Facilities) and Mobile Medical teams. OGB has already established good relations with other partner agencies and will be getting the FSL and WASH staff trained on the screening of SAM and MAM cases from the communities and will be referring to the RI / SCI established HFs and MMTs (Mobile Medical Teams) for treatment. As Oxfam has targeted the same beneficiaries with food security amp WASH. Secondly, under the UNICEF PCA, Oxfam has targeted the same location in Lahj under WaSH to cover wider beneficiaries and similarly through Swedish Development Corporation (SDC) in Sa&#x2019;ada targeted location. Oxfam through its local NGOs partners identified in both the governorates will intervene with integrated humanitarian response and presence in Lahj amp Taiz to reach 29,428 women, men, boys and girls in the first priority convergence districts of Lahj amp Sa&#x2019;ada through food security, water supply, sanitation and hygiene. Food security will be ensured through the adoption of a nutrition-focused approach that will be developed in collaboration with nutrition expert institutions such as IMC, SCI, IR, district health office to ensure targeting of the most vulnerable households and cash transfer will be made to 4204 households (HHs). Partners will also closely work with district health offices, local water and sanitation Corporation (LWSC) and general authority of rural water supply (GARWSP) in both the targeted locations. In order to address the underlying causes of malnutrition, public health promotion (PHP) team of NGO partner will work closely with community health volunteers (CHVs), health workers from district health office, and humanitarian partners in the location and will ensure cross referral of the identified malnourished cases. Cash-based modalities (unconditional cash, food commodity vouchers) will be identified by location following comprehensive feasibility and market studies to ensure relevance and effectiveness of the interventions. Gender would be the key to the proposed intervention and will be mainstreamed in both food security amp WASH assistance. Under food security assistance, the market feasibility assessment will capture the gender roles and relationships including the barriers experienced by both males and females. The mobility map will assist project implementation to take corrective measure identifies against the risk that it presents while accessing the food from the market. The cash transfer activities will also capture &#x2018;who receives payments at PayPoint&#x2019; and therefore segregation of PayPoint will be established for women amp men from access perspectives. For WaSH infrastructure, the location will be important suiting to the needs of women, men, boys amp girls. Cash interventions, as well as WaSH, will also include in their design to support people with disabilities, elderly as well as chronic ill beneficiaries as well.</narrative>
