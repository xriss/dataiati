   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Envelope 2:  Integrated Response for the Most Vulnerable IDPs, Returnees and Host Communities in Amran.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project will support the most vulnerable displaced and host community families through a mix of complementary and coordinated protection, WASH, FSL and shelter activities which ensures that all beneficiaries have an equal opportunity to access basic services in an equitable and dignified manner and which prioritizes IDPs living in settlement sites and collective centers.

Although the ongoing conflict, mass displacement and limited access to basic services has added layers of complexity to the situation in Yemen, this project seeks to provide a basic minimum package of services to IDPs and vulnerable host community members in and around Raydah City in IDP settlement sites in  (Al Jahein, Al Ma&apos;aredh, and Harih Almutrah) and in a new site along Al Mahm road.

DRC will provide direct assistance to the most vulnerable IDP, returnee and host community households.  DRC anticipates reaching a minimum of 4,000 households (based on the number of households participating in cash-for-work or receiving the improved livelihood assets) with each household receiving a mix of FSL, WASH, protection and/or shelter assistance based on their specific needs and empower community members, with a focus on existing protection networks and site management representatives, to monitor and respond to protection concerns, raise awareness on displacement-related rights, create space for community and beneficiary feedback, and identify the availability of humanitarian assistance and make referrals.  

1.   Food Security and Livelihoods:
     2, 836 households will participate in cash-for-work activities including rehabilitation of agricultural terraces, constructing rainwater harvesting structures, improving irrigation canals and water drainage, repairing roads, and producing        seedlings.
     -2,000 households will receive improved livelihood assets.

2.  WASH support through the distribution of filters and hygiene kits, and hygiene promotion
     -750 households will receive ceramic water filters
     -750 households will receive basic and consumable hygiene kits
     -150 households, at minimum, will benefit from solid waste management campaigns
     -1,500 households, at minimum, will benefit from hygiene promotion.
     -7 community health volunteers will be trained in hygiene promotion.
 
3.  Shelter
    -60 households will benefit from temporary rental subsidies for 6 months with the minimum cluster standards ($ 100/ HH) along with targeted case management support.
    -18 community members participate in community committees 
    -Site management training - targeting - IDP Committe, IDP Community Leaders, Social Affairs Committe under the local Council - to improve engagement with INGOs and local government, improve IDP living conditions and welfare

4. Child Protection
    -75 households with children in need of medical treatment will receive support. 

5.  Protection:
    -Up to 330 households, who are unable to participate in the cash-for-work activities, will receive protection funds.
    -1,000 individuals will receive basic individual or group legal counseling
    -1,000 individuals will receive basic individual or group psycho-social support

DRC will first focus on the most vulnerable IDP households living in the three identified settlement sites (Al Jahein, Al Ma&apos;aredh, and Harih Almutrah) and in a new site along Al Mahm road.  In addition, DRC expects to also work with the 30 households living in the settlement site in the New Suq in Kharif all of which are located in or near to Raydah City.  DRC will identify beneficiaries based on established vulnerability criteria and using community input.</narrative>
