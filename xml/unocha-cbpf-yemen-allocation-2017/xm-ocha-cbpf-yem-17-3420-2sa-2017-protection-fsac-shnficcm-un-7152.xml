   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Envelope 2: Integrated response in providing lifesaving Protection, Food and Non-Food Items (NFI) to vulnerable, conflict affected individuals with a focus on IDPs, returnees and vulnerable host community families in Khamir and Huth districts in Amran governorate</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project is under envelope 2 of the second standard allocation which aims at targeting a total of 14,000 beneficiaries and 2000 households in IDP collective centres and spontaneous settlements and in vulnerable host communities and returnees in Huth and Khamir districts of Amran governorate. The project is proposing to implement Female Friendly Spaces (FFS) in IDP camps in the targeted districts, for a period of 10 months, integrating the provision of food baskets, through food vouchers, and distribution of NFIs as part of the intervention. The project will target these districts in Amran as priority districts under envelope 2 of the allocation and as an intervention that has been coordinated with Protection, FSAC and the CCCM, Shelter and NFI national clusters and sub-clusters, as well as with corresponding stakeholders. 

The intervention package under the proposed project aims at providing Psychosocial Support (PSS) and referrals for SGBV  and  for GBV survivors victims in the targeted locations, while ensuring mitigation measures to tackle immediate and underlying causes of food insecurity and malnutrition, as well as providing cash for minimum winter item support in the targeted locations using fundamental approaches to bridge the gap of assistance in the respective areas of intervention. 

The interventions under the proposed project are separated per district based on the needs in these districts, prioritization by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) for the food intervention, and coordinating the intervention with the relevant clusters and sub-clusters. 

1. Khamir District: a) Provision of PSS services, referrals through established networks, capacity building and empowerment of IDPs, returnees and vulnerable host communities, through establishment of FFS with experienced and qualified female psychologists targeting females of all age groups. b) Provision of EFA (Emergency Food Assistance) through unconditional voucher transfers c) Distribution of cash for winter kits to prioritized vulnerable IDPs, returnees and host communities.

2. Huth District: a) Provision of PSS services, referrals through established networks, capacity building and empowerment of IDPs in IDP collective centres and spontaneous settlements through establishment of FFS with experienced and qualified female psychologists targeting females of all age groups. b) Distribution of cash for winter kits to prioritized vulnerable IDPs, returnees and host communities. 

IOM will ensure the project activities are aligned with the clusters objectives including mainstreaming of protection and gender in all project activities through close monitoring, evaluation and reporting. In addition, accountability to affected population will be adhered to throughout the project cycle, from the design phase to the end of project cycle, ensuring that beneficiaries, stakeholders and the community are engaged throughout the project, through a participatory approach including information sharing and awareness campaigns, complaints and feedback mechanisms and project adjustments as per feedback. 

IOM will manage the project through its experienced staff, in coordination with Yemen Family Care Association (YFCA) as its Implementing Partner (IP) for the project.  All staff involved in the project will adhere to the humanitarian principles and standards while abiding to IOM&#x2019;s Principles for Humanitarian Action and values as per internal code of conduct. IOM partnership with YFCA is foreseen to build the capacity of staff involved and provide a stronger and more integrated humanitarian support on the ground building on the experience both organizations haves in the field. 
Effective monitoring and evaluation of project activities will be put in place by IOM who will assign dedicated MampE staff to monitor the activities as per the designed project workplan to ensure the quality of services, efficiency and effectiveness of resource mobiliza</narrative>
