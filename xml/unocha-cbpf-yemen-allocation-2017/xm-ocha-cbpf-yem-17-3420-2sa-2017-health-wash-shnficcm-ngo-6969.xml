   <narrative xml:lang="EN">ADO commitment, and out of the principles of accountability and commitments towards the affected people , ADO designed the emergency response project of health, WASH, it has obtained funding for this project from (OCHA) in August 1, 2017, which includes the support and rehabilitation of health facilities for the provision of basic health services for the resident of Abs and Hairan districts. Currently ADO is doing maintenance for the health facilities. Work in these facilities will launch at the beginning of this October, but these facilities serve only the first level of population and small portion of the second one. There is still a large number of Haradh, Midi, and Saada IDPs who cannot benefit from this project that&apos;s why the ADO saw that it should expand its intervention with fixed clinics in IDPs settlements , the IDP camps in the districts of Abs and Hairan, there is now in Abs district more than 15 IDP (settlements ) gatherings spread throughout the district&apos;s sub-districts, such as the sub-districts of Bani Hassan, the camps in it. In addition to that, there are more than 8 IDP settlements in Hayran district and in order to provide the minimum and integrated services in the field of health, WASH and shelter this project was proposed as a complement to the previous project which is also funded by OCHA. In this proposal and under allocation envelop( 2) of Second Standard Allocation 2017 the gaps will be filled to provide the basic health services, WASH and shelter for the IDPs settlements in both targeted districts. In heath, will set up health center in IDPs settlement to serve the IDPs who live in the third zone level of Health facilities ( HFs) and who are unable to access the health services currently available in the health centers due to their remoteness and due to the IDPs inability to reach them. Through this community health center will provide Minimum Service Package of health which are agreed upon in the health cluster: primary care, maternity and child care, activating the children vaccination system as well as detecting and referring the acute malnutrition cases which are accompanied with complications will be provided. In this way interrelatedness and integration between the services of the previous project and the services of this proposal will be achieved, by doing that, we fill all the IDPs and residents of these two districts needs gap. Also by doing that we implement and support the basic principles of the comprehensive suite of health interventions which are in accordance with the health cluster (Guidance Note). One clinics for ( 8) IDPs settlements in Hayran district and one clinics for (15 ) IDPs settlements in Abs district. To meet the needs of the third level for the health facilities which are already being maintained and rehabilitated. 
For WASH  sector,  will be  training volunteers in Abs and Hiran  districts on  accountability , mechanism of complaints and feedback   and on hygiene promotion e.g  prevention of Infectious disease diseases  and how to do awareness in their villages. And to sterilize the tanks of houses with chlorine. In addition, And how to determine and evaluate the hygiene situation in homes of IDPs.Also will be built 200  latrines, 3000 awareness sessions and distribution hygiene kits  for IDPs in Hairan and Abs district. 
In shelter sector will be built 450 transitional shelter. ADO intend to construct 450 shelters , and just 200 latrines,here is some elaboration, ADO design the project to construct 450 shelters( 250 in Abs district, and 200 of shelter will targeted Hiaran district, so ADO will construct 200 of shelters, and 200 of latrines in Hairan district). 
Note/ ADO construct 650 latrines in Abs district from the previous project which funded by first allocation of 2017,also OXFAM will construct 2000 latrines in Abs district.
