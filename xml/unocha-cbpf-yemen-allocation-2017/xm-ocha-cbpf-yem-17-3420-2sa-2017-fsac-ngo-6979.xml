  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed project aims to scale up emergency food assistance to the most affected vulnerable HHs through complementary activities in Ash Shamayatyn district of Taiz governorate. The project is within envelop 1 addressing the underlying and immediate causes of food insecurity and malnutrition by ensuring adequate access to Food, Nutrition, health and WASH to the most vulnerable through an integrated approach. 

The project has been designed as a complimentary project for another nutrition and health project # YEM-17/3420/2SA 2017/Nutrition-FSAC/NGO/6947 designed by TYF as an integrated program targeting the same district and same beneficiaries. The proposed intervention will be for a duration of 9 months. It will target 3000 Households (21,000 individual, dis-aggregated 8541 Men, 8889 Women, 1749 Boys, 1821 Girls) / Round for 3 rounds. BCFHD will select beneficiaries based on FSAC standards in terms of household vulnerability and targeting criteria, food basket composition, quantity of commodities, and amount of cash per household per month. The proposed project will target HHs with children under 5 with Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM) or Moderate Acute Malnutrition (MAM) Vulnerable Households with pregnant women and/or lactating women and/or children under five years old Vulnerable Female headed HHs Child headed HHs Vulnerable Elderly headed HHs Vulnerable HHs headed by chronically ill members Vulnerable physically challenged headed HHs HHs meeting other vulnerability criteria as identified by the communities.  
For the sake of conducting a well based intervention, the project has been designed based on the a rapid needs assessments conducted in Ash Shamayatayn district by BCFHD and RDP on 23 -26 2017. A variety of tools were used in needs assessment to collect data from key informant interviews as well as on HH level (Food Consumption Score (FCS), Coping Strategies Index (CSI), Income Resources, HH Expenses). focus group discussions were also conducted with different vulnerable participants (women and men). This process assisted BCFHD and RDP to identify the needs of the targeted beneficiaries as well as the level of food insecurity the vulnerable HHs reached (Poor and Borderline Food Consumption Scores). 

This project will be implemented through conditional voucher modality in order to strengthen the local market as well as maintain a good control over the project activities and resources. Within the rapid needs assessment, some tools were developed and used to conduct an assessment for markets in Ash Shamayatayan district as to support the voucher modality selected in this proposed project. 

The following proposed activities will be undertaken in this project:
- Coordination with all stakeholders/organizations (local authorities, NNGOs, UN agencies, INGOs, communities and the sub-cluster of Ibb and Taiz Hub).
- Conduct Orientation workshop on Emergency Food Security Assistance to the most vulnerable Households project for the project team. 
- Formation of community stakeholder committees in the targeted district and inform them of beneficiaries selection criteria, project objectives, type of intervention and frequency of distributions. 
- Conduct Market monitoring and analysis and trader assessment.
- Conduct training for registration/ verification team.
- Establish complain and feedback mechanism
- Registration of beneficiaries in the targeted district based on the selection criteria.
- Verification of beneficiaries by reviewing the list of most vulnerable people that are eligible for the food voucher assistance in the targeted district.
-Selection and contracting of local food trader.
-Inform beneficiaries of the food voucher distribution date and places 
- Provision of food voucher assistance to most vulnerable households targeting 3000 HHS /round for 3 rounds
