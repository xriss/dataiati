  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Life Makers Meeting Organization (LMMPO) is proposing to implement 12-month project that aims at ensuring that all IDPs living in hosting sites and hosting community in Khayran Al-Muharraq and Mustaba districts in Hajjah governorate involving equitably men, women, boys and girls have equal access to integrated shelter, NFIs, CCCM, protection. The intended intervention includes Shelter, NFIs and CCCM, main protection including child protection and WASH activities and services, which promote protection and dignity of affected and vulnerable people.
LMMPO through this project and within its capacity and experiences has proposed an integrated response to vulnerable people including IDPs hosting sites and host communities including women and children. The comprehensive response package targeting the most vulnerable families (IDPs and host community) was strategized as the focus of the Emergency Shelter/NFI - CCCM Cluster, working with other clusters (WASH, Protection amp Child Protection)..
Shelter, NFIs and CCCM activities will ensure that all Men, women, boys and girls living in IDPs Hosting Sites and in adjacent host communities have access to basic services via provision of NFIs and strengthening shelter of needed HHs. This project targets 3000 HHs with NFIs. Moreover, this project encourage and support site management and coordination structure in 4 IDPs hosting sites and it would include all related stakeholders (LMMPO, IDPs representatives &#x2013; males and females, local authorities, CBPNs) to insure that the voice of IDPs and hosting communities reached out to the humanitarian actors and local authorities. LMMPO will provide support to bring all relevant stakeholders to discuss and advocate for the needs and rights of the IDPs and hosting communities. Multi-sector committees will be formed within IDPs and hosting communities themselves and they will be trained and supported to respond to the hosting sites needs. Rehabilitation of WASH facilities in the hosting sites will take place according to a detailed needs assessment. Moreover, this project includes WASH activities for same hosting sites in which water sources will be retaliated to ensure provision of safe drinking and cooking water. 100 communal latrines will be constructed in both districts beside installation of 4 water pumps (solar system). The targets of WASH sector would be 1500Hs (basic HK) and 2500HHs with Consumable kits. With WASH committees in the hosting sites, volunteers will be trained to organize hygiene awareness raising, promotion and advocacy activities.
This project has considered mainstreaming and taking protection measures to protect men, women, boys and girls within WASH and Shelter and CCCM sectors. A key part of this project is allocated to general protection and child protection activities, which include formation of CBPNs and Child Protection Committees (CPC). Both type of committees will play key role insider mediator to protect the IDPs family solidarity and cohesion. Legal assistance is another aspect of this project through assisting IDPs to issue their national IDs to ease getting of humanitarian assistance in future. Establishment of child-friendly spaces (CFS) where children feel free to play, talk and participate with trained volunteers who will identify cases and referral pathways to nearest protection services. Provision of case management services for conflict-affected children will be of a value to protect children at risk. Social workers and volunteers will be trained on SOP approved by Ministry of Social Afairs and Labour (MOSAL) and national social workers in Hajjah will be one of human resources in this project. 
LMMPO through this project will build the capacity of the local NGO partner &#x2013; which is located in Hajjah governorate with close monitoring on the performance of the project staff.</narrative>
