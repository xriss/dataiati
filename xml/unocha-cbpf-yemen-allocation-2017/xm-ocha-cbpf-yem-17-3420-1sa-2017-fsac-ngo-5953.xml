   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Direct Food Assistance and Nutrition Support for IDPs and Conflict Affected Population in Al-Radhama District-Ibb Governorate</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This intervention target Al-Radhama district&#x2013;Ibb governorate which has 101,890 total population with 14% of them in acute need (2017-Yemen-HNO_Cluster _data-V2). A total of 85 villages within this district will be targeted (see the document tab for a full list of these villages). The project aims specifically to: Save lives and reduce the risk of hunger through scaling up general food assistance to IDPs, host families, and other vulnerable groups residing in the district. It will provide direct food assistance using food vouchers to a total of (1,141 HHs/ 8,347 individuals) which include: 450 IDPs HHs, and 191 host HHs in Al Radhama, representing 100% of this group living in the district. Also 50 minority HHs, 100 HHs headed by women, 150 HHs with one or more disabled members, and 200 HHs that have been affected directly by the war and 359 PLW will also be targeted. Al-Radhama is among the priority districts in Ibb governorate under envelope one and a second priority for FSAC. The food baskets and supplementary nutrition will be distributed four times throughout the project cycle.
Beneficiaries needs identification and selection was determined through rapid need assessment and data was also obtained from the local authorities and government ministries regional offices, among others. The project will contribute to FSAC cluster priority and objectives in improving and scaling up general food distribution and access to food, and in enhancing food security. The project&#x2019;s components and objectives also contribute to the broad SO1 of the First Standard Allocation of 2017 which aims to address causes of food insecurity and malnutrition by ensuring adequate access to food and nutrition, focusing on the most vulnerable. And will contribute to EVENVELOPE ONE strategic objectives in addressing food insecurity and malnutrition with life-saving assistance of food and nutrition ensuring gender equality and protection. The project subscribes to FSAC main activities namely general food distribution using vouchers and will contribute to the cluster indicators for this activity by increasing the number of individuals receiving regular monthly unconditional food. A baseline survey to identify the current FCS, CSI, IDDS, HDDS among the target population is an essential part of the project activities and will contribute to better assessment of the project&#x2019;s impact on its beneficiaries. 
Beneficiaries selection is based on a preset criteria that give priority to the most vulnerable groups and apply &#x201C;positive discrimination&#x201D; approach in selecting HHs headed by women. It ensures protection of all project&#x2019;s beneficiaries in the implementation of all its activities. To this end, venues for the project&#x2019;s orientation sessions are selected based on their proximity to the targeted population, specially women and people with disabilities. The same criteria will be applied in the selection of the distribution points adhering to day time distribution to ensure safety of both project&#x2019;s staff and beneficiaries. The distribution team is formed of both male and female members to facilitate access for women participants and ensure that their particular needs are met and provide them with a culturally accepted environment to air their concerns, if any. 
The project will adopt the following implementation strategies for accessibility and transparency purposes:1) Food distribution will be carried out using food vouchers which will be delivered to the beneficiaries at least three days prior to the distribution date. Vouchers can be collected from the project&#x2019;s office and delivered through door-to-door utilizing KFD large pool of volunteers in the district 2) the food basket contents will be printed clearly in each voucher for recipient to check the contents before signing the voucher 3) unused or misprinted vouchers will be discarded and documented for auditing. This implementation method will enhance transparency and ensure accountability.</narrative>
