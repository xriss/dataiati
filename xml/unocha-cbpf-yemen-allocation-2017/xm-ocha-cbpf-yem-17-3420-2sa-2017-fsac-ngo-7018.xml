   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Improving Food Security and Resilience of Local Communities and IDPs  in Mudhaykhirah District-Ibb Governorate through Scaling Up Food Aid and Sustainable livelihood interventions</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This intervention targets Mudhaykhirah district&#x2013;Ibb Gov. which has a total population of 111,378 with 15,421 in acute food need. This district is priority under envelope one and has been identified with livelihoods gap (FSAC-Ibb_Hub-Livelihoods Restoration-Jan-Augst 2017). 55 out of the total 71 villages that accommodate 56,119 people will be targeted representing 78% of the total villages and 50% of the total population. Village selection is based on population density, availability of agriculture land and water and accessible roads. This proposed action will target 4,500 HHs out of the total 8,487 HHs representing 53% of the total HHs in the district (Source: https://goo.gl/o95P45). 3,500 HHs (24,500 individuals) will be targeted for food aid and 1000 HHs (7,000) individuals will participate in the agriculture livelihoods activities. Beneficiaries selection is based on preset criteria that apply &#x201C;positive discrimination&#x201D; approach geared toward HHs headed by women, children and elderly. The project aims specifically to: i) Save lives and reduce the risk of hunger through scaling up general food assistance to IDPs, host families and other vulnerable groups residing in the district and, ii) Address food insecurity and build resilience of local communities through creating livelihoods activities focusing on home-gardens. The food baskets will be distributed four times throughout the project cycle.  
Beneficiaries needs was determined through Rapid Need Assessment conducted on 23 September 2017 and attended by 401 people with 223 female and 178 male. Data was also obtained from local authorities and government offices, among others. The project addresses FSAC main goal, to scale up emergency food aid and emergency livelihoods assistance to the most affected vulnerable families supporting relief food/ general food assistance through complementary activities and its two specific objectives,YHRP Obj 1) Improve availability of food and access to food for the most vulnerable, and YHRP Obj 3) Improve food security by supporting agricultural, livestock and fishery systems and assets. The project&#x2019;s components and objectives contribute to the broad Obj#1 of the Second Standard Allocation of 2017 in: Addressing the underlying and immediate causes of food insecurity and malnutrition by ensuring adequate access to Food, Nutrition, health and WASH to the most vulnerable through an integrated approach. It fits within Envelope 1: SO 1: Provide life-saving assistance to the most vulnerable people in Yemen through an effective, targeted response. The project also subscribes to FSAC main activities: 1) general food distribution using vouchers and 3) Provide income-generating activities, livelihoods skills development, and longer- term assets support. KFD has coordinated with other partners working in the district including ACTED, UNICEF, SFD and WFP and only the latter distribute food aid. WFP shared the list of its districts and KFD will work closely with WFP once the final list of beneficiaries is verified at the beginning of this proposed project to eliminate any duplication of aid. This interventions ensures protection of all project&#x2019;s beneficiaries. Thus, venues for all project&#x2019;s activities and distributions points are selected based on their proximity to the target population. Distribution is carried out during daytime to ensure safety of project&#x2019;s staff and beneficiaries. The distribution team consists of both male and female members to facilitate access for women. 
The project will adopt the following  strategies for accessibility, accountability and transparency purposes:1) Use vouchers to distribute food and agriculture inputs 2) Food basket contents amp agriculture inputs will be printed clearly in each voucher for recipient to check the contents before signing 3) unused vouchers will be discarded and documented for auditing 4) Cash transfer for agriculture beneficiaries will be carried out through local bank using voucher and ID</narrative>
