   <narrative xml:lang="EN">WASH and Health Integrated Response to Cholera Outbreak in Al Bayda Governorate</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project, which is an extension of the previous NFDHR &#x201C;Emergency response to AWD/Cholera outbreak in the Al Bayda Governorate,&#x201D; funded by OCHA contributes to the WASH and Health Cluster strategic objectives. It specifically contributes to the objectives of the Integrated Cholera/Acute Watery Diarrhea (AWD) Outbreak Response Plan in Yemen, which is to provide a framework for optimal preparedness and effective response in case of acute diarrheal disease (i.e. cholera and dysentery) outbreaks. The plan includes information on response activities, roles and responsibilities, and needs and required resources in the event of an outbreak.

All stakeholders, including Health offices, rural water authorities and local leaders, will be fully engaged in this project. A Local Task-force for cholera response will be established to monitor the project&#x2019;s activities and report its progress on a daily bases to all relevant partners, including the WASH and Health clusters. 

The project beneficiaries will be those that are most vulnerable to AWD/cholera outbreak: men, women, boys, and girls, including IDPs, and refugees from the horn of Africa. Nevertheless, all people in Al Bayda will benefit from the project intervention, as it will consist of chlorinating all water sources in the most affected and vulnerable villages, which will ultimately help prevent the spread of AWD and cholera and save the lives of many in Al Bayda.

Our strategy will be to establish two teams who will be trained and made responsible for responding to all cholera and AWD reports from vulnerable areas. They will also be in charge of training community volunteers, chlorinating water sources, assessing and supporting sanitation, as well as distributing WASH items and materials during public health promotion activities. Community volunteers will be trained in  effective reporting of new AWD/cholera cases and in making efficient referrals to established Cholera Treatment Centers (CTCs).

The project team will make it their priority to respond rapidly to affected areas by chlorinating water sources, raising awareness among vulnerable populations, especially women and girls, increasing sanitation coverage of the affected villages, and increasing safety around sanitation and drinking water.

The public health awareness activities will be implemented through home to home visits, community awareness sessions, distribution of consumable hygiene kits, Jerry cans  and assessments of sanitation coverage in areas with reported AWD/cholera cases. In areas considered most vulnerable, women, girls and young men will be targeted through intensive hygiene promotion activities.

AWD/cholera cases will also benefit from the Cholera Treatment Centers previously established in the  first part of this project, which are located in two vulnerable districts&apos; rural hospitals in the Al Bayda governorate. The CTCs which have been serving as a referral point for severe AWD/cholera cases, will be provided with cleaning materials, such as chlorine and soap, as well as water and sanitation for this second phase of this project. Additionally, the centers will be supported through Mobile Health Teams that can have further reach of rural population affected by AWD/cholera.</narrative>
