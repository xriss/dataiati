   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Integrated Health and WASH rapid response to Cholera outbreak at Almahweet Governorate</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Over the project duration of three months, YFCA plans to implement integrated Health and WASH rapid interventions to respond to the Cholera outbreak at Almahweet Governorate at the most affected locations using the controlling approach of cholera response strategic plan developed by health and WASH clusters. The main objective of implementing this project is to reduce occurrence and to minimize morbidity and fatality of cholera and AWD at Almahweet governorate through effective prevention and timely response.

Based on the updated reports of cholera outbreak, Almahweet governorate had reported 1734 ccumulative cases and 30 death cases which constitute 3.35%  and 1.73% respectively from the overall national case load of cholera outbreak including the last wave which stroked the country in 27 of April 2017. 
YFCA had already started response interventions in Almahweet at Shibam and Khamis Bani Saad hospitals by supporting the existing DTCs before the process of submitting proposals from reserve allocation as an initiative from its own resources to contribute in supporting the ongoing efforts which are very limited and lack sufficient inputs and technical experience in WASH and health sectors.
 The controlling approach used under this project had been selected for Almahweet as it is one of the high- risk governorates in the country being reporting new cholera cases almost in a daily basis with alarming increasing numbers reported from different locations including new areas with no past history of cholera cases.
Three main groups of activities will be implemented to respond to the cholera outbreak in Almahweet which are: 1) Early/rapid response activities, 2) Integrated response activities and 3) Integrated prevention activities which focus on C4D in health and WASH areas.
All stakeholders will be coordinated during the implementation of activities with focus on close coordination with the Cholera task force in Almahweet and strengthen the stewardship of local health and WASH institutions to enable them performing in more effective and efficient ways, while the partnership with local NGOs is also one of this projects&apos; strategies to enhance their capacities and widening the accessibility opportunities.
YFCA will monitor this project activities using concentrated modalities and tools at the central, governorate and field levels with giving more attention to on time reports in WASH and health areas. Project staff will contain experts dedicated in full time contracts to fulfill the specific tasks in administrative and technical aspects in addition to YFCA staff at the head office and governorate units who will participate in providing the needed support to the field team.
As the nature of the outbreak might change in terms of geographical spread and case load burden, YFCA will agree with YHF and corresponding clusters about any adjustments of the plan might needed.
YFCA will ensure the mainstreaming of protection and gender concepts during the designing and implementing stages of this project as well as to demonstrate its accountability for beneficiaries and affected communities and their engagement in monitoring this project and take responsibility to improve and enhance the overall community awareness and best practices in WASH and Health areas.</narrative>
