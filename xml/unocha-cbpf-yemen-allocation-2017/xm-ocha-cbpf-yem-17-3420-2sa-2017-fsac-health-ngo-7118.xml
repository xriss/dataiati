   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Envelope 1: Integrated Multi-Sector Interventions for Affected Communities in Al-Mahwit Governorate</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project was designed to respond to the needs of the most vulnerable groups in the district of Bani Saad, Al-Mahwit governorate, identified as one of the highest priority districts facing risk of famine in the YHRP&#x2019;s 2017 Second Allocation Strategy. The project will target the district with a multi sectorial integrated approach to deliver a package of life-saving food, and health assistance to address the underlying and immediate causes of food insecurity and malnutrition. 
RRD will target the most vulnerable groups in the district with food security activities through food vouchers. The project will select beneficiaries from the most vulnerable groups including households with Under-5 children suffering from malnutrition, PLWs, IDP HHs, Female-headed HHs, HHs headed by elderly or persons with disabilities and households stricken with extreme poverty. RRD will coordinate with UNICEF and district health office during the beneficiaries&#x2019; selection process to ensure targeting participants of the CMAM program. Coordination with the local authorities will determine the initial list of beneficiaries that fall under the established selection criteria.
Community committees will be established to enhance the accountability and transparency and members will represent both male and female. The committees will play an important role in the project&#x2019;s activities and sensitize the community on the project&#x2019;s activities and objectives. They will assist RRD and the beneficiaries to overcome any obstacles faced during the implementation process and will ensure that the community is aware of the project&#x2019;s selection criteria.
Food vouchers will be provided in three rounds to the same beneficiaries to ensure an impact and improve their food security status with the approved FSAC standards. The distribution processes will adhere to a set of established guidelines that ensures gender and protection mainstreaming including but not limited to separate lines for men and women, laborers to assist women and the elderly transport the baskets received as well as the selection of a safe and central distribution point. Each distribution process will be followed by a post distribution monitoring survey (PDM) to measure the impact of the assistance, monitor beneficiary satisfaction and analyze the risks and tensions within the community resulting from the assistance. 
Based on recommendations of the GHO and DHO (attached) as well as the conducted RNA, RRD will respond to increase access of essential primary health care services by supporting Bani Saad District Hospital, the district&#x2019;s main hospital serving majority of residents, through provision of equipment, medicines, furniture, capacity building&#x2026;..etc. RRD will respond to increase access of reproductive health care services through establishing and supporting an Emergency Obstetric Neonatal Care (EmONC) unit in the Hospital. Establishing the EmONC unit will include provision of equipment, required medicines, supplies and furniture. The support will include hiring an obstetrician and a gynecologist, training the midwives as well as the necessary rehabilitation and solar panels to maintain electricity for life-saving services during emergency obstetric care services 24/7 hours. The newly established EmONC unit will also be connected to and benefit from the hospital&#x2019;s water source. To provide the targeted HF with the minimum WASH package, an internal rehabilitation will be implemented and will include internal latrines amp water network rehabilitation, installing laboratory bench, water tank, installing and implementing of medical waste incinerator, rehabilitation and maintenance of the hospital septic tank, etc. Additionally, the HF will be provided with sustainable water supply through rehabilitation of the hospital&#x2019;s non-functioning water source (well).
Gender-sensitive complaint mechanisms will be incorporated throughout the project cycle to ensure receiving feedback from the targeted beneficiarie</narrative>
