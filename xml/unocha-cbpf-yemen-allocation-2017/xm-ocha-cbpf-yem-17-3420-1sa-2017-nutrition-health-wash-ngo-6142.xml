   <narrative xml:lang="EN">SHS in collaboration with local Governmental Health Office (GHO) is planning to implement the project &#x201C;Emergency lifesaving integrated assistance to the vulnerable community in Shabwa &#x201C;to participate in reaching the HPF new allocation strategy regarding the intervention against malnutrition and famine in Yemen.  The project will target 10 health facilities in 2 districts of the southern governorates ( Shabwa ) , for a period of 12 months,  SHS has conducted a rapid need assessment for the targeted health facilities to give an overview of their current functioning situation and the main areas that need improvement and intervention, the health facilities were chosen according to the density of the population and the fact of no other partner is intervening there in collaboration with local GHO and nutrition cluster . The health facilities will be supported by 3 mobile clinics (1 in Haban and 2 in Ataq) working in zone 2 and zone 3 providing integrated therapeutic and preventive nutrition and primary and secondary health care services with also maternal and reproductive health care. A network of CHVs will be working closely to the mobile teams providing Communication for Development (C4D) lifesaving messages and screening with referral of discovered malnourished cases to the nearest mobile clinic or health facility. Discovered SAM/MAM cases will be enrolled in the mobile clinic OTP/SFP and treated according to the national CMAM Yemeni guidelines same as for discovered malnourished PLWs .
In parallel with the nutrition services the Health Mobile Teams that visiting each village twice per month  will ensure to deliver primary health care services (EPI, IMCI and OPD) and secondary health care services including treatment of chronic diseases for the most needed beneficiaries in the targeted areas. Women at reproductive age will receive their routine tetanus vaccination and prenatally women will benefit from the midwife counseling, iron and folate acid supplements to prevent possible anemia and medical checkup. Women at birth will be assisted by trained midwifes to ensure smooth vaginal delivery with health baby in clean and hygienic circumstances, postnatal women will be encourage to start immediate exclusive breast feeding and will receive other lifesaving health and nutrition messages.. SHS will support the capacity of health facilities to provide essential and live saving services through provision of essential and live-saving medicines and supplies including medications for chronic illness. To strengthen the outbreaks surveillance system within the districts the mobile teams will follow a strategy of notification and support by ensuring to communicate with the epidemics surveillance system and the eDEWS program in the governorate to notify them about any possible or unusual outbreaks of diseases and by offering medical help and support to the discovered cases. 
SHS will also ensure to improve the hygienic practice among the affected community by conducting awareness raising session in different WASH issues by the community mobilizer and CHVs. The repeated cycle of malnutrition and acute gastro intestinal illness among the SAM/MAM children will be broken by the distribution of hygienic kits twice to the SAM/MAM children household and by behavior changes.
The result of the need assessment showed that all the targeted health facilities are well connected to the domestic water and sanitary network but suffer from frequent water cut off therefore SHS will provide each health facility with cleaning material and water tank of 1000 ml capacity to have continuous water supply  and to ensure that the quality and the sterilization of the water SHS will coordinate with UNICEF, WHO and WASH cluster to provide chlorine tablets in enough quantity to maintain continuous stock to the health facilities, training of the health workers on chlorination and testing of residual chlorine will be conducted and will  provide them with pool testers.</narrative>
