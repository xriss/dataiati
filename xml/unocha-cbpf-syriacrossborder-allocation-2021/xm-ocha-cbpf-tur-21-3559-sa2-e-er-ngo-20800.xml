   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Envelop2: Enhancing the resilience of most affected communities by improving access to sustainable livelihood opportunities and basic education services in Salqin and Darkosh sub-districts</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed project is going to deliver a strategic multisectoral set of interventions in the Education and Early Recovery and Livelihoods (ERL)that contributes to enhancing the resilience of 300 most vulnerable households and 11840 children and 473educational personnel in an integrated complementary approach in 18 communities in Darkosh and Salqin sub-districts which marked as high priority locations under the 2nd SCHF Standard Allocation 2021 basing on the needs assessment.

In education, the project is going to improve the safe access of 11840 children (5231 boys amp 6609 girls) including 250 CwD to quality inclusive education services in protective environment by conducting light repair to 100 classrooms and 30 wash facilities in 24 schools, do light maintenance to the existing furniture in 24 schools, provide 24 schools with safety equipment (fire extinguishers and safety equipment), Provide the 24 schools with cleaning and disinfection materials and conduct weekly and monthly cleaning as preventive measure of Covid-19, contract with 473 teachers and supporting staff (24 head of schools, 347 formal, 48 non-formal teachers, 24 cleaners and 24 security guards, and 6 supervisors) and build their capacities in different areas including (Distance Learning amp COVID19 preventive measures - Child Protection Principles - Modern Teaching Techniques - Integration of children with disabilities in the education response - Child safeguarding) to provide formal education services to 10400 children (4607 boys amp 5793 girls) enrolled in formal education at the risk of dropout in 24 schools during this academic year (March to May) and next academic year (October 2022 to January 2023) and non-formal education services during summer (May to August 2022) to 1440 OOSC children in catch-up classes using curriculum (B) physically with preventive measures of Covid-19, conduct training on safety and evacuation for the 473( teachers ,supporting staff ),and 9475 children in the 24 schools, provide awareness sessions on Covid-19 and hygiene protocols to the children and caregivers and support the mid and end year exams in the 24 schools as part.

We selected these 24 schools because it includes the highest number of enrolled children in formal education where 60% of them are IDPs and these schools are at the risk of closure if teachers aren&#x2019;t supported with incentives at the beginning of the second semester of this academic year (2021-2022).

In early recovery and livelihood, this project is going to define 300 households of the most vulnerable in the 10 targeted communities whose children were enrolled at schools and enforced to stop their education to work and support their households and provide these households with vocational training opportunities based on market mapping and select 100 households of them to be granted with small conditional grants along with coaching and mentoring services where their children should come back again to continue their education and one of the adults who received the small grant will be the breadwinner of their household.

We selected this approach in ERL because the households in the proposed sub-districts started using this negative coping mechanism which is (stop the education of their children and ask them to be the breadwinner) and the proposed approach (selecting an adult from these households to receive vocational training and a small grant to start his/her business) will result in maintaining the education of children and will help one of the adults to be skillful and be the breadwinner and those small business projects will help those households to be productive and depend on themselves and be an added value to the local economy in the long term.</narrative>
