   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Envelope 1: Provision of Secondary Health Care and Emergency Services through Supporting an Existing Surgical Unit in Ariha Sub-District.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project aims to contribute in Improve access to critical life-saving secondary healthcare services including (trauma management, in-patient, and referral) to highly vulnerable people in the frontline area. The project goal will be achieved through continuing to support an existing health facility (Ariha Surgical Unit - facility code: G0705061), which is the only health facility providing trauma management and general surgeries services in Ariha sub-district. The facility is currently fully well equipped and fully supported by Shafak till the end of December 2021. 

Building on the already established and equipped facility, experienced teams, Shafak will continue providing proposed health services focusing on the most vulnerable of women, boys, girls, and PwDs. The services also include providing essential medicines and medical supplies and will be implemented in line with WHO guidelines (Pillar 9 of COVID 19 Preparedness and Response Plan). Pillar 9 focuses on maintaining essential health services and systems during COVID-19 especially in the light of challenges to health sector budgets and overarching health system governance. 

The proposed activities will include the following components:

a) continue operating Ariha surgical unit in the proposed location with the needed operational costs, medical supplies, and medical staff, to make it capable of providing surgical interventions and stabilization care. Ariha surgical unit is proposed to receive beneficiaries from front-line areas and to provide the following activities: 

- Trauma management for injuries and acute medical emergencies requiring immediate surgical interventions (e.g. appendicitis, amputations, perforated ulcer, arterial injuries, head injuries, advanced trauma life support...etc.). 
- Surgical interventions and stabilization care before referral of emergency cases to advanced surgical hospitals in NWS or Turkey if needed. 
- Shafak proposed to focus more on inclusion especially for PWDs in the proposed project cycle, already equipped its facility with all assistive equipment and preparations to enhance the quality of services to be accessible by PWDs. The proposed health services are expected to reach 528 PWDs including 176 men, 96 women, 144 boys, and 112  girls.

b) linking the proposed facility with other facilities and continuing activating the referral system by continuing to operate an ambulance vehicle (currently existing in the facility and supported by Shafak till the end of 2021). Referrals include the medical emergency cases that need further management in surgical hospitals that efficiently treat advanced complicated cases. Referrals also can be to Turkey hospitals as appropriate. 

The proposed health services will target 12,000 people including 4,200 men, 3,000 women, 2,640 boys, and 2,160 girls.
