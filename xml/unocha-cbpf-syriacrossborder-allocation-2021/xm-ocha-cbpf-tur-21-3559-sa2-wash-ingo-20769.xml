   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Facilitating access to clean and safe drinking water to conflict-affected communities in Idleb 2022 &#x2013; Envelope 1</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">GOAL proposes to provide lifesaving safe water to 113,870 vulnerable individuals in Idleb Governorate, Northwest Syria (NWS). This will be implemented via the provision of essential support to 10 Water Stations (WS) and 3 Water Units (WU). 
The project will build on 7 years of GOAL&#x2019;s expertise in Idleb water supply and support local water networks to meet the needs of the most vulnerable including women, children, PWD and IDPs. The aim of the action is to ensure access to reliable, safe, and clean drinking water to vulnerable conflict-affected communities including host and displaced populations in the northern sub-districts of Idleb Governorate. Core activities will include provision of electricity, procurement of fuel, infrastructure rehabilitation, training to water station operators, coaching to WUs and water quality monitoring. 
The project will enable approximately 113,870 people living in the targeted areas to access sufficient quantities of clean and safe drinking water. Sufficient and safe water will increase HHs resilience against COVID-19 and give them the ability to increase practice of COVID-19 mitigation measures. Due to equipment limitations and breakdowns and with project scope limitations, 35 litres/person/day (LPD) will be piped directly to households (HH) to ensure equitable access for all community members, however where network capacity and project funds allow, GOAL will seek to surpass 35 LPD. Without the support of this project, the provision of clean safe water to the homes of these 113,870 people will cease for the foreseeable future, which will leave most of this already vulnerable population with few options but to resort to negative coping strategies to meet basic water needs. This potential scenario is particularly concerning in the context of COVID-19, where water plays a vital role for handwashing the reduction of transmission. 
The project will build on GOAL&#x2019;s current sustainability research and experience and will aim to reduce operating costs by provision of electricity to all water stations (WSs) as well as installing solar panels for 1 station. The findings from GOAL&#x2019;s research into water supply will be used to strengthen the systems which underpin cost recovery. 
COVID-19 adapted hygiene promotion will target schools and individuals supported by other GOAL sectors via other grants. Curriculums will be context specific and developed using GOAL&#x2019;s expertise in the Syrian WASH context. 
GOAL have mainstreamed extensive COVID-19 mitigation measures throughout all our operations, and within this proposed project, so as to ensure we can deliver this vital project while protecting our staff and the communities we serve</narrative>
