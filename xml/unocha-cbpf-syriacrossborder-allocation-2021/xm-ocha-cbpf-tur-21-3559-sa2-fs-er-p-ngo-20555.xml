  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Recent reports and HRP prioritize the need for scaling-up interventions to contain the economic deterioration affecting livelihoods, agriculture sector and food security as well as the need to improve and establish protection services especially among the IDPs in camps and informal settlements. AHF has conducted a rapid needs assessment in 7 sub-districts in Idleb and has reported the need for strengthening farmers&#x2019; livelihood, increased awareness on protection aspects including child protection, providing life-saving assistance, and supporting self-reliance of affected IDPs especially those in the camps that have been affected by the floods during Jan to Mar 2021. To that end, AHF is designing a 10-months project in FSL,ERL and protection Integrated at the level of the community,household and partially at activity, that contributes to filling the gaps with three stages:
1) Supporting wheat value chain in Maaret Tamsrin.
2) Purchasing farmers&apos; wheat production(600ton)in Maaret Tamsrin.
3) Produce bread and distribute it to the 18 target IDPs camps in Dana sub-district(attached list of the camps 01)
AHF is already implementing bread distribution in the same camps for two years and currently seeking for new funding to continue providing life-saving assistance to the PiN through sustaining the bread distribution activity. the selected beneficiaries from the target IDPs who will receive food assistance(bread) at stage 3 will be supported through ERL intervention by vocational training, cash for work, followed by in kind-grant. Through the Protection component, the same target IDPs will be provided with protection services at stage 3 by conducting outreach awareness sessions on CPamp disability cases integration and case management.
AHF proposed integrated intervention will consist of the following components:
FSL
Support wheat value chain with share in the cost of fertilizer irrigation harvest and purchasing wheat production from 300 farmers (2 tons from each farmer at a price of $400 per ton) in Maaret Tamsrin.
Distribution of agricultural inputs (wheat seeds) to farmers for the coming season (200 Kg/farmer) with total beneficiaries&#x2019; of 1,000 farmers in Maaret Tamsrin.
Bread production at AHF existing bakery amp distribution to 18,500 individuals (250g per person of daily bread for 78 days) in the 18 target camps in Dana.
Cash-for-work to 28 individuals for 3 months to support wheat value chain at stages 1amp2.
Cash-for-work to 31 individuals for 3 months through baking and distribution activities at stage 3.
ERL
200 IDPs will be selected from the FSL beneficiaries at stage 3 and will be provided with vocational training to move from aid dependency to the production stage. Selection of beneficiaries will be according to pre-defined selection criteria and from the most vulnerable IDPs in Dana sub-district camps that have been hit by floods before.
Training duration is 2 months and will consist of vocational training in 4 different professions including Sewing, Hairdresser, Home electricity, and Solar systems, and the topics identified according to a needs assessment conducted by AHF
Cash for work intervention for 200 trainees who will attend the training.
After the completion of the training period, 100 beneficiaries will be provided with in-kind grants as tool kits (600$) to help them start their own small business.
Protection
Improving the protective environment for beneficiaries of ER activities during the last 4 months of the project, targeting female-headed households, persons with disabilities and local communities through:
- Raising awareness sessions on cleaner production and the mechanism for inclusion of persons with disabilities, will target 13,728 IDPs.
- Case management services targeting 160 children and persons with disabilities.
- Referral services to protection and non-protection services and other interventions from other sectors, targeting 200 persons with disabilities and female-headed household</narrative>
