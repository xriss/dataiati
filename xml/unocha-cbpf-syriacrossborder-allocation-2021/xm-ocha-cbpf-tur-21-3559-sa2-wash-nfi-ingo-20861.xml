   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Envelop 1: Provision of lifesaving emergency WASH and winterization assistance to vulnerable populations in Northwest Syria</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed action aims to provide life-saving humanitarian assistance to the most vulnerable displaced populations living in camps and camp-like settings by providing WASH and winterization services. Despite humanitarian presence, most IDPs continue to face critical WaSH needs, including a lack of water tanks and sustainable solid waste solutions (garbage bins, sewage networks). This is particularly problematic in light of the COVID pandemic. 
Findings from the CCCM Cluster confirm that, despite the humanitarian presence, WaSH needs are still not fully covered in Azaz. In fact, according to Humanitarian Needs Assessment Programme (HNAP) report of Dec 2020, 40% of IDPs in NWS report that water is their first priority. In terms of infrastructure, at least 70% of sewage is discharged untreated, while at least half of the sewerage systems are not functional and 29% of garbage is inappropriately disposed within communities (HNO 2021), with 64% of water stations not functional, according to the Syrian Water Resources Platform. SI assessments in the area of operation indicate that respondents rely heavily on NGO supported water supply sources, primarily water trucking. 

SI seeks to address identified needs with a comprehensive WASH and winterization approach, including:
	Water network rehabilitation: 4 water supply systems will be rehabilitated 1 in Al Bab, 1 in Ghandorah and 2 in Aghtrin. (Target 23.718 individuals)
	Water trucking as a last resort for three months while SI rehabilitates the water network in Ghandorah (Target: 24.932 individuals) in areas without a viable more sustainable alternative
	Distribution of 106 water storage tanks in particular for households with PwDs (Target: 3556 individuals)
	Solid waste management: Distribution of garbage containers nearby the PWD (in the camps where we are already working). Waste removal will be funded in some locations by SCHF, while other locations are already covered with other funds. (Target: 38.705 individuals)
	Hygiene promotion in all 17 targeted locations in three sub-districts of Azaz, coupled with hygiene kit distributions in those locations not covered by other funding. (Target: 33.091, including 1.098 individuals that benefit from HK distributions)
	Installation of solar lights in shelter and WASH facilities in camps and informal settlements. (Target: 11.157 individuals)
	Winterization assistance through one-off cash distribution of $150 to 2075 HHs in Al Bab, Ghandorah and Aghtrin. (Target: 12.412 individuals)

Beneficiary selection criteria for individual activities vary, but are always based on needs and vulnerabilities. Gender equality will be prioritized and beneficiary engagement throughout the project cycle will ensure transparency and awareness of project activities. Targeting will be based on needs analysis, inter-agency coordination, and SI&#x2019;s ability to maintain humanitarian safe and principled access. SI will use the Washington Group questionnaire in the identification of barriers and risks of persons with disabilities in accessing water, sanitation, and hygiene services. Protection mainstreaming occurs by installing solar lights in targeted camps, increasing safety and security of vulnerable beneficiaries in public areas during the dark winter months. The sustainability of the intervention strategy is further integrated by inclusion of rehabilitation of water- and sewage networks.</narrative>
