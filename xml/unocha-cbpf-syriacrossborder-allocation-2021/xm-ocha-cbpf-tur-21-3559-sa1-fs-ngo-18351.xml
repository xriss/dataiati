. The assistance will take place in 10 communities taking into consideration equity in access, quality, responsiveness and participation and resilience the intervention can be summarized as the following:
FSL Cluster: the project will cover the distribution of Food Rations (2100 FR) for 2500 HH settled in 10 communities for 8 months. These food rations which are according to FSL Cluster standards will be distributed once a month and for 8 months by informing the targeted HHs about the timing and the location as well, taking into consideration the COVID-19 preventive measures such as distributing PPE kits for the teams and distributing soap for the benefited families. This intervention is classified under ASO2
Beneficiaries will be selected based on the proposed vulnerability criteria as reflected below together with other eligibility criteria as determined as follows after coordination with the local authorities:

The project will ensure equal access for both genders with the priority for women, children-headed households, disabled persons, chronic disease, PLW, and the elderly in addition the project staff will include female and male members trained on the protection principles and gender equality.
Furthermore, ATAA has coordinated with the FSL Cluster and other organizations who are working in Jarablous to avoid any possible duplication and this coordination took place on the 5th of April through documented emails. The project will put in place the prevention and mitigation measures related to COVID-19 during the fieldwork by the physical distance between the beneficiaries during the distribution of baskets.

To summarize the number of benefited families is 2100 HH who will receive on a monthly basis 1 food ration and 1 bar of soap not less than 175G for 8 rounds. Moreover, Concerning families less than 5 members, as WFP partner for 3 years and from the learned lessons, we&apos;ve faced troubles with the beneficiaries in rotation and splitting the content of the basket or to inform these families that they will only receive the FR each 45 days. Moreover, from the selection criteria is Families in need equal to or greater than 5 people</narrative>
