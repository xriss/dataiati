   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Life-saving protection mitigation and prevention support for unaccompanied and separated children and families vulnerable to separation</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Through this project, SARD intends to support a number of unaccompanied and separated children and families vulnerable to separation through continuation and extension of its specialized and unspecialized protection services which specifically target sensitive child protection issues such as family separation, early child marriage, child labor and recruitment to military services. Through its emergency centres/ Child-Friendly Spaces (CFS) in A&#x2019;zaz, SARD provides unaccompanied and separated children with critical life-saving protection services including shelter, emergency and accelerated learning support and PSS, and foster placement. Outside the centres, through its referral system in coordination with the Protection cluster, SARD&#x2019;s Mobile Case Management team identifies child protection cases and renders or refers specialized and unspecialized protection services. 
The project is innovative and is an alternative approach of child protection providing multi-sectoral integrated response to the UASC in the emergency shelter and providing alternative care with particular effort to place the UASC in foster families. Foster families and other families vulnerable to child separation are accompanied throughout the project with provision of dedicated services to favour family placement and prevent family separation
During the project, the following will be implemented :
- 1 emergency shelters  will be running and equipped to host UASC in emergency situation. In the center, all services are provided to the UASC : each child will receive a full kit (1 in summer and 1 in winter) that includes clothes, shoes, hygiene material and products, Each child is assigned a dedicated space for sheltering him ensuring safety and security is provided 24/7. In the center, the UASC will be also provided with all the necessary food (special dietary is provided depending on the child needs, age and conditions), necessary environmental hygiene (hair cut, disinfection of the premises, Covid 19 prevention, basic environmental health care. The innovation being the project will provide all the services, integrated and multi-sectoral, to ensure the aulity of the delivery and the best accountability to the children benefiting the project.
- provision of protection services to children and foster families or families vulnerable to separation, through mobile team visit and assessments. This action will aim at providing all necessary emergency support to families to keep the children in the household securing access to basic needs. As such, SARD will refer the family in emergency needs to other project implemented by SARD with provision of basic needs and even livelihood/income generating opportunities to secure access to income to cover emergency basic needs (under other donors). These activities are implemented by 2 mobile teams (of 4 persons), 1 child protection mobile team in Azaz   looking at UASC needs in each location and 1 PSS mobile team (of 4 persons) covering providing all the PSS supports and requirement to both UASC and parenting program as well.
- Parenting Program: SARD facilitates a parenting program to train caregivers on Child Protection, PSS and dealing with their children&#x2019;s behavior. 
Separated and Unaccompanied children boys and girls shall be identified and registered in child protection information management system and their parents traced for reunification. Reflecting on the current situation in northwest Syria, there are many cases of separated and unaccompanied children identified but their families not yet traced, SARD will work closely with the care givers to ensure that conflict affected children boys and girls are protected from abuse, violence, and exploitation through organising meeting with care givers to discuss the child protection issues in the communities to come up with best ways to protect the affected children.</narrative>
