   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Through the proposed intervention, Violet (VO) aims to contribute to addressing the Health and SNFI lifesaving emergency needs in NWS for both host community and IDPs by 1) continuing to support and provision of CCTCs services to the suspected/ positive cases in Idleb and Ariha, and 2) provision of winter assistance in the form of cash to the most vulnerable groups. The project is designed with the following activities:

Health:
VO strives to maintain the existing CCTCs capacity in Idleb and Ariha to isolate the COVID-19 cases in order to slow down the transmission of the COVID-19 virus. Ultimately, the activities aim to reduce the morbidity and mortality among the community members, as well as to protect the health system from a potential collapse that might be caused by the rapid spread of COVID-19. Therefore, VO is requesting funds to support the CCTCs in Idleb and Ariha for 7 months as funding from previous sources approaches to end. In addition to the health care, treatment, and wellbeing activities, CCTC BNFs will receive 3 cooked meals reach with the nutrients/day in order to improve their immunity against COVID-19 but also minimize the contact between COVID-19 suspected/confirmed cases with their relatives to mitigate the spread of the virus. the cooked meals will be designed to provide at least 2100 Kcal for a person/per day which is in line with the minimum energy requirement in the emergencies. Additionally, the cooked meals will include nutritious vitamins consisting of fresh vegetables, fruits, pickles, and fresh yogurt to support the quick recovery of COVID-19 cases. Furthermore, the CCTCs activities will complement other projects under FSL, Education, SNFI as well as the ambulance and referal system, So the community members and IDPs in the targeted locations has improved access to various humanitarian services.

SNFI:
VO plans to respond with lifesaving winterization activities by the provision of One-off winter cash (150$) for 2157 HHs (10758 Inds) in Idleb, Kafr Najd, and Kherbet Amud. The winterization cash amount was designed based on the SNFI cluster/CWG guidance but also based on the lessons learned from previous projects to cover the basic winter needs of the household. However, VO will adopt the SNFI and CWG recommendations in case of any change. Additionally, based on the WASH cluster recommendations, each BNF HH will receive 750 g of soap sufficient for 1 month to contribute to the COVID-19 response
The cash distribution modality was selected to provide flexibility for the BNFs to buy their winter needs, but also to provide assistance in a dignified way. furthermore, it contributes to market recovery through disposing of cash in the market and may create new job opportunities as well as mitigating various risks such as the risk of fires risks due to storing fuel for a long time by BNFs especially in the camps settings.
Violet confirms the targeted areas are accessible to the on-ground operation team. Moreover, through the need assessment conducted, Violet confirms the markets in the targeted areas are functioning. However, VO will conduct rapid needs assessments to ensure the beneficiaries&#x2019; accessibility to functioning markets to avoid the potential harm of cash inputs. Moreover, the cash will be distributed in USD to improve the purchasing power of the targeted HHs without being affected by the devaluation of the local currency

During all project phases, VO will ensure the field teams apply COVID-19 preventive measures according to VO&apos;s SOPs. This includes applying social distancing, regular sanitization of the CCTC, and wearing face masks. Moreover, VO ensures preventive measures during distribution by minimizing the number of cash beneficiaries in each distribution round, carrying out the cash distribution in the well-ventilated areas, as well as supplying the distribution points with sufficient hand sanitizers and cleaning materials</narrative>
