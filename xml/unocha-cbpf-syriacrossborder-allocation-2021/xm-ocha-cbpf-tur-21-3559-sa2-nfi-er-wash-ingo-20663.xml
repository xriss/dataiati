   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Improving access to and within IDP sites through integrated Shelter and WASH activities in Idleb and Northern Aleppo &#x2013; envelop 2.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">GOAL proposes under the second envelop of this allocation to facilitate safe access to and within IDP sites in Idleb and Aleppo Governate, thus contributing to safer and more dignified living conditions for IDPs and facilitating better access to basic needs and services. Through the construction and rehabilitation of infrastructure in integration between Shelter, WASH, and early recovery activities, focusing on roads and rainwater drainage systems, both within IDP sites and on roads leading to IDP sites, and WASH networks and facilities in IDP sites. 11,680 individuals will directly benefit from the intervention in Darkosh, Janudiyeh, Salqin and A&apos;zaz subdistrict. Key activities will include:  Repair of damaged roads and drainage systems.  Mitigation against the risk of future flooding,  Installation of solar lights to ensure safe access to communal facilities in the IDP sites, which will also support in mitigating protection risks that women, girls and boy may be exposed to.  Installation of sewage and water lines  Construction of communal WASH facilities. These locations have been selected and activities designed based on high level of needs (falling within OCHA priority sub-districts) following a thorough needs assessment of 34 locations (Annex 1 and Annex 2). A summary of planned activities in each location is contained within Annex 3. The needs assessments were done through collecting information from key informants at the target locations using a questionnaire in addition to GOAL Engineers observations. The questions on the initial needs assessment form included general information about the locations, demographics, number of existing shelters, roads and rainwater drainage situation, water provision, wastewater conveyance systems details, roads and communal facilities lighting needs, and the HLP context. Additionally, questions about the interruption of services and/or access to utilities and communal facilities during winter because of heavy rains and floods. This was followed by technical evaluations for the locations where site improvement and infrastructure needs were identified, and where landlord approvals are not expected to be an issue during the implementation either because settlements are established on public lands, or that GOAL Engineers have already received initial approvals from landowners. Under the Shelter Cluster component of this project, GOAL will target IDP sites within Darkosh, Janudiyeh, Salqin and A&#x2019;zaz sub-district that are flood-prone, located on flood streams, or receive heavy rainfall and do not have the requisite infrastructure to cope. This project will focus on the construction and rehabilitation of main roads, secondary roads leading to communal facilities to ensure access of IDPs including elderly and persons living with a disability (PLWD), rehabilitation construction of rainwater drainage systems and communal facilities, tents levelling, and will be provided with exterior solar lights in 9 locations targeting 9,148 individuals. These activities will be implemented in 10 IDP sites reaching a total of 11,680 individuals Under the Early Recovery Cluster, access roads from Darkosh community to IDP sites will be rehabilitated to ensure continued access to 7 IDP sites and a COVID-19 quarantine facility. The road will provide access to and from the camps that accommodate 3,026 individuals, and to the quarantine centre by Darkosh community (28,626 individuals). Finally, under the WASH Cluster, GOAL will construct water and sewage lines, construct communal facilities including tap stands and water storage units, shared latrines with gender disaggregated cells, and sewer holding tanks, benefiting 5,445 individuals in both Idleb and Aleppo governorates. All proposed activities will be coordinated with the relevant clusters, and NGOs working in the same locations</narrative>
