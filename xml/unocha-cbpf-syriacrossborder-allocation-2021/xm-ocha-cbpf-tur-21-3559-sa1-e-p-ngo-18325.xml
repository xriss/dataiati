  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Takaful aims to secure safe environment for 12102 internally displaced children (aged 5-17, 5,731 boys, 6,371 girls) in 20 camps in A&#x2019;zaz, Dana, Maaret temsrin, and Atareb through integrated approach focuses on providing life-saving education and protection assistances to crises-affected children to protect and promote the healthy environment in which they are located through providing integrated and harmonious services in the education and protection sectors.
In Education: supporting formal and non-formal education for 12,102 dropped-out children or who are at risk of dropping out of school, in 20 camps&#x2019; schools, which was established last year due to lack of any educational services, and their fund will be ended in May, as follow:
- Providing three-cycles of non-formal education through catch-up classes for 1500 out of schools&#x2019; children (750 b, 750 g) using curriculum B and each cycle will target 500 children. The children will be identified through BTLs campaigns and meeting with families and local actors.
-Supporting formal education for 10,602 children (4,981 boys, 5,621 girls) by providing operational costs, learning and teaching materials, and recreational activities.
-In order to increase access to CwDs in the targeted areas, the project will provide unserved schools with tools for CwDs such as ramps, special desks amp chairs, Special toilets.
-Conducting hygiene promotion and awareness sessions to minimize the spread of the Corona Virus for all education personnel and students, besides, sterilizing all schools before students come back.

In Protection: protection teams which consists of social workers, case managers, and PSS facilitators will conduct periodical visits to targeted camps to assess the protection vulnerability of camps&#x2019; children and provide case management services for at-risk children, where teachers will participate with protection teams in preparing services maps and referring at risk children, in addition to providing structured PSS sessions for 2400 crises and displacement- affected children (boys and girls) suffering from negative coping mechanism within the pre-equipped activity rooms based on pre-conducted baseline to identify most vulnerable children, where PSS sessions will increase children&#x2019;s resilience, Support psychosocial, cognitive and physical development, Mitigate protection risks, Promote essential life skills that support children&#x2019;s capacities and confidence, and to rising their awareness about PSEA, in addition to providing parenting program sessions for 800 caregivers (M,F) related to parenting skills in order to raise their children in a proper way.
To ensure maximum engagement for CwDs and to raise communities&#x2019; awareness about their role, a community initiative will be implemented by adolescent (including CwDs) in coordination with protection mobile in each camp, who will visit them in their homes and assess their vulnerability, there will be coordination with health service providers for those in need, and they will also be encouraged to participate in safe space activities according to their needs, as will be adopted in the baseline, which will partly contain the Washington test. We will equip PSS activity rooms in the camps with tools that help children with disabilities attend.
The project team will work in a coordinated and integrated manner, where teachers will receive training on child protection issues and will participate with protection teams in mapping services, in addition to making referrals to at-risk students who are identified during the educational process and through visits of social workers.
In case of schools&apos; suspension due to the Corona pandemic, Takaful will go to distance learning methods through WhatsApp and telegram groups with videoing lessons and send it to student&apos;s groups which include classroom&apos;s students together with teachers and followed up by educational personnel in the school.</narrative>
