  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed project aims to contribute to preparedness and response efforts for the upcoming winter and flood season and address the identified urgent food needs of the most vulnerable people in northwest Syria. Through this intervention, 8,182 Households (40,910 individuals) will receive Emergency Food Parcels and Ready to Eat (RTE) Meals in Idleb Governorate during the upcoming winter season. The project is developed based on the anxious need on the ground to get prepared for the upcoming winter and floods. Islamic Relief plans to target the most vulnerable households in Maaret Tamsrin, Dana, and Harim sub-districts. Selection of the targeted location was based on Islamic Relief&apos;s monitoring findings from the previous response to the floods during January 2021 as well as from the NFIs and FSL cluster on-going updates. The targeted areas are also ranked at severity three and four as indicated in the HNO 2021 food security sector severity target sheet. 

Islamic Relief plans to distribute 6,000 RTEs for one time off in response to the seasonal floods between December 2021 until February 2022. In addition, Islamic Relief will target 2,182 households with emergency food parcels support for three months starting from October 2021 until December 2021 to support those most vulnerable during the upcoming winter season. The project will support extremely vulnerable families (with a focus on female and child-headed households). Islamic Relief will conduct a detailed household-level need assessment to identify 8,182 households to provide the Food Parcels and RTE Meals. 

Islamic Relief has been responding to the seasonal floods and winterization needs on the ground to address the humanitarian needs of the most vulnerable conflict-affected Syrians. IR will build upon its response experience in implementing the proposed activities. In coordination with CAFOD and DARNA, Islamic Relief with respect to its seasonal flood&#x2019;s response contributed to the efforts of reducing the suffering of the most vulnerable Syrians from the effects of the rainstorm that hit various locations in Idlib amp Aleppo province causing flash floods in January 2021. Through the response 30,250 flood affected individuals received RTE food rations and winterization items (fuel blankets insulators mattresses). in Addition, IR has reached out to over 16,000 HHs/ 90,000 individuals was provided winterization and food support from Islamic Relief own fund in last winter season. 

Given the particular sensitivities related to women engaging in project activities a careful weighing of the risks associated with providing such support will be undertaken to ensure that no harm comes to beneficiaries or field staff. The project will seek to prioritize women and those with disabilities by tailoring the support provided, in an effort to better respond to their specific needs and concerns. IR staff will organize an awareness session for IR staff and gather medical face masks, Alcohol sterile, LaTeX gloves, and thermometer for COVID-19 protection.

As part of exit strategy, all relevant stakeholders will be informed about project closure. Lesson learnt from the implementation will be shared with FSL cluster members to improve the quality of the programmes.</narrative>
