   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Regular food assistance to most vulnerable IDP households in NW Syria through in-kind food baskets distribution</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Using its rapid response mechanism, White Hands (WH) proposes a 7-month action that includes regular (monthly) food distribution, using pre-positioned in-kind modality.

This project is a proposed action submitted to SCHF for funding, contributes to the first sector objective of the FSL cluster aiming at &quot;To Scale-up and sustain minimum food consumption needs through life-saving and life-sustaining food assistance.&quot; and aims to address the immediate food security needs of most vulnerable IDPs with acute needs, living in 12 communities in the sub-districts of Sharan, and Raju (Aleppo Governorate) in NW Syria, in the medium term.

To meet the food security needs in the medium-term, WH aims to assist 2,115 most vulnerable internally displaced HHs (12,690 individuals) that meet the Food Security Program beneficiary eligibility criteria with regular monthly food assistance through the most appropriate modalities. This will include providing 2,115 HHs/12,690 individuals (2,886 men, 3,268 women, 3,172 boys, and 3,364 girls), living in the proposed targeted areas, where markets are inaccessible, or food is unavailable or unaffordable with locally procured in-kind food baskets for 6 consecutive months, as recommended by the FSL Cluster and WFP.

The project will be implemented over a duration of seven months and will comprise six distribution rounds for in-kind food baskets (one distribution round per month) to highly vulnerable displaced households that meet the food security program beneficiary eligibility criteria.

In general, the main markets in the proposed communities to be targeted under this intervention are not properly functional (reasons related to market dynamics and access issues) as confirmed by WH field staff. However, the modality of response will be determined by market assessment. Market assessment will identify if markets are functioning, what types of products are available, the cost of products and if markets are accessible. In cases where markets are not functional, inaccessible, or unaffordable, WH selects in-kind support.

Continuation of multiple types of transfer programs in NW Syria, including in-kind assistance, will allow WH to remain responsive to evolving access and security considerations, local needs, and market dynamics. It will also enable coverage of a larger beneficiary population, where vouchers may be more difficult to implement in some areas, and these are locations are often where unmet food needs are the greatest.

Regardless of the modality that will be employed for regular food assistance, the ration (food basket) will be designed following the SPHERE standards, FSL cluster, and WFP recommendations of 70% or 1550 of the 2,100 kcal/person/day, the remaining is aimed to be provided by beneficiaries themselves through their own means with 12% of total energy provided by protein, 29% provided by fat and 59% provided by carbohydrates with the inclusion of required minerals. Relevant tools such as NutVal will be used in the design of the ration. 

The overall target number of beneficiaries is 12,690 individuals (2,886 men, 3,268 women, 3,172 boys, and 3,364 girls).</narrative>
