   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Over a seven-month period, SAMS will leverage its technical and operational expertise, to maintain the critical minimum functionality of COVID 19 dedicated hospitals in line with the recommendations of the COVID-19 Taskforce prioritization analysis to decrease the mortality rate by increase the accessibility of the community to essential and lifesaving&#x2019; health interventions. With a total of 21,592 confirmed cases (of them 1,346 are active cases) and 1157 confirmed cases in Jabal Samaan district (as of 14 April 2021, EWAR/ACU), SAMS will support Al Amal specialized facility in northwest Syria, Jebel Saman district of Aleppo (HeRAMS code: B0200097), for treating and isolating the severe and critically ill patients. The hospital has been functioning as a hospital-based isolation unit (HBIU) since October 2020, and treated until March 2021, 577 patients (60% Male, 40% Female) and is still receiving such cases now (The most affected age groups are patients over 60 years (approximately 60%), whereas the affected patients under 18 years were 2%, and the other affected age groups were 38%).

 Al Amal hosts the highest number of those cases according to the daily update from the Health Information System team (HIS). It is the only HBIU in Jabal Samaan District, an easily accessible facility, and serves around 15 communities in the Jebel Saman district in Aleppo governorate, in addition to one community in Dana sub-district in Idleb governorate, with a total catchment population amounts to 152,154 persons (54,853 IDPs), who may benefit from its services. The isolation hospital is divided into 3 departments as follow:
ICU Department: 30 ICU beds, provides care to critically severe COVID-19 patients, the department is equipped with 30 monitors, 30 ventilators, oxygen output for each bed. 
IPD Department: 40 beds, includes patient assessment, monitoring, routine lab investigation, x-ray, and supportive therapy and treatment. 

The hospital is well equipped with all the needed equipment including Ultrasound cardiac, X-Ray, ECG machine, Video laryngoscopes, incinerator, and oxygen generator.
Also, the hospital has 10 additional monitors in the hospital as we already planning to activate an Intermediate Intensive care unit.

Moreover, the hospital is part of the COVID-19 referral network to receive suspected/confirmed severe and critical cases.
