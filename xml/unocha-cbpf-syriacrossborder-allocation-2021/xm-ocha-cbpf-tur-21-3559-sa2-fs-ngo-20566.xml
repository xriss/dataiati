   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Strengthen resilience and access to market-based livelihood opportunities in underserved  with high severity of need regions through enhancing wheat/bread availability and reinforce better access to income-generating opportunities (envelop 2)</narrative>

  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project is a preliminary step to ensure more resilience through support wheat value chain on production and marketing, delivering flour and yeast and supporting bakeries to keep them in their business and rehabilitation of second phase of value chain on infrastructures to support the semi-functioning bakeries. Reinforce and enhance better access to short-term job opportunities for most vulnerable population. The geographical scope focuses on the underserved areas in Idlib gov. Indicatively high priority locations (Janudiyeh, Idleb, Ariha, Teftenaz and sarmin SDs)
Over 4,022 HHs are to be reached throughout the locations targeted by this project. At least 5% PwDs. Participation will be open to resident and IDPs.

The project will support 24,132 individuals (6,481 men, 6,785 women, 5,309 boys, 5,557 girls) to restore income-generating assets amp increase bread and agricultural production and improved economic conditions and labor market opportunities. The intervention designed directly on an ongoing SCHF reserve project. So, it&#x2019;s expected to contribute to utilize the available resources and enhance the integration aspects regarding access to free bread. 
SR intervention will improve the wheat/bread production capacity of 10 bakeries and one mill in Kafr Ruhin, Areha, Taftanaz, Sarmin and Janudiyeh under (output 1.1), and purchasing power under (output 1.4) where 400 MT of wheat will be purchased from 400 farmers in ongoing season 2021-2022 and will divide to two parts, the first: 86 MT will be sieved into 80 MT of pure wheat (93%) and 6 MT impurities (7%). The 80 MT pure wheat quantity will be allocated as wheat seeds, and distributed to another 400 farmers for next season 2022-2023 under (output1.4).  Second part, 314 tons will be milled into 251 tons of flour with 80% rate extraction and will be supplied to the rehabilitated bakeries. Consequently, approximately 404,000 bread bundles with a weight 800 gr (361,000 as bakeries support and 43,000 as cost recovery of bakeries rehabilitation activity) will distribute for 2,747 IDPs households free of charge for 3 months duration/78 distributing days based on the daily survival needs (250 g bread/person/day) under (output1.2). The remaining amount (63 tons of milling process by-products) in addition to (6 tons) as sifting impurities will be utilized (sell or barter) as a cost for the sifting and milling processes with the possibility to utilize any surplus money in purchasing quantities of flour from the contracted mill. Furthermore, the bread baking, packaging and distribution process will be monitored by SR MEAL team, where tent to tent modality for elderlies and PWD will be followed. 
On the other hand, 300 new farmers will benefit from the distribution of wheat inputs, including irrigation and harvesting costs under (output1.4). 

Moreover, 65 CFW (50 semi- skilled,15 un-skilled) will implement activities related to bakeries and mills rehabilitation/maintenance works, bread distribution and fire and vole pest fighting under (output1.3).

According to the latest developments regarding the COVID-19, the WHO guidelines, and following the FSL recommendations cluster.SR will provide the services by reducing the number of beneficiaries during the activities implementation, taking into account the recommended prevention measures.

The field team will follow up on the project implementation daily to ensure the immediate outputs and the outcomes of the project are achieved. The project duration is 10 months and the total budget of the project is $511,036.88</narrative>
