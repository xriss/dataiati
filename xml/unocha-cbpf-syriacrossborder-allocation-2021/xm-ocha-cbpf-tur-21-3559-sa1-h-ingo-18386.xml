   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Supporting the Provision of Life-Saving and Life-Sustaining Healthcare Services for the Conflict Affected Population in Need Within Harim District.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In line with the SCHF 2021 SA1 allocation- ASO2 objective (To provide Life-saving humanitarian assistance and protection to the most vulnerable people with an emphasis on underserved areas with high severity of needs) and in response to the demonstrated needs and gaps in health service provision for the conflict- affected population within Harim district, Human Appeal Turkey (HAT) proposes to support and sustain the functionality of two healthcare facilities in the district for a duration of 12 months, namely:

 &#x201C;Iman&#x201D; maternity hospital in Sarmada/ Dana sub-district/ Harim district/ Idleb governorate (HeRAMS identifier code: G0703086).
 Human Appeal Mobile Clinic in Sarmada IDPs camps/ Dana sub-district/ Harim district/ Idleb governorate (HeRAMS identifier code: B0200196).

The above facilities will continue providing primary and secondary healthcare services for around 79,560 people in need within their catchment area as follows:
 RH outpatient consultations in both facilities. 
 Pediatric outpatient consultations in both facilities.
 General medicine outpatient consultations in HAT MC.
 Community health awareness services in both facilities
 Provision of essential medicines in both facilities.
 Referral capacity in both facilities.
 CEmONC services, laboratory services, inpatient healthcare for the women of reproductive age and newborns in Iman hospital.

Also, Iman hospital serves as an operation station for 2 vaccination teams operated by HAT and another 2 teams by ACU. Furthermore, IYCF-E and CMAM services are being provided through the hospital as well.

The proposed facilities are operating in Dana sub-district that is classified by the allocation paper among the areas of highest humanitarian severity scores. Also, and as per the HNAP report, more than 77% of Dana inhabitants are IDPs who in turn are among the most vulnerable individuals that need humanitarian assistance (This is confirmed by the previous caseloads at both facilities as 93% of beneficiaries served through Iman hospital and almost 100% of those served through the mobile clinic were IDPs). Furthermore, the healthcare services planned to be provided at both facilities mainly target women of reproductive age, children under 18 as well as elderly individuals that are all considered among the most vulnerable population groups.

Besides referring to the health cluster/ Turkey hub dashboard health facilities map, and for the purpose of ensuring coordinated and non-duplicating intervention, HAT, during the design phase, was very keen to coordinate and communicate with the partners and coordination bodies relevant to project including the health cluster, Idleb health directorate, SRH TWG, and Sham foundation that is operating a pediatric specialized hospital in Sarmada, the same community where &#x201C;Iman&#x201D; hospital is based.

In addition to the above service package, and to ensure integration of COVID-19 related preparedness and response measure, HAT proposes to maintain the operations at the COVID-19 triage station at Iman hospital for the whole project period. This will help the facility to mitigate the risk of COVID-19 transmission and infection among the staff and the beneficiaries. 

In order to promote the cost efficiency of SCHF matched funds, HAT will provide co-funding of around 175,000 USD to support the provision of all medicines, medical and lab supplies, the majority of project support staff remuneration costs needed for ensuring the smooth implementation of the proposed activities and provision of the planned healthcare services. Accordingly, the cost per medical procedure matched to this application will be around 7.76 USD (Or 9.96 USD considering HA co-funding), where both values are considered to be highly efficient against the average cost of around 10-12 USD across NW- Syria.</narrative>
