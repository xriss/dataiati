   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Envelope 1:
Enhance access to safe WASH assistant through sustainable solutions for PWDs, IDPs in the informal settlements, and people in communities in Northwest Syria.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Due to limited access to water resources as a result of climate-changing. And due to the lack of using reliable and affordable power sources in water systems. In addition to the damages and absence of sustainable sewage infrastructures in communities and camps, it had a significant negative impact on the most vulnerable groups, especially the IDPs and PWDs.
In response to the costly and short-term water supply in northwest Syria and to reinforce the most urgent life-saving interventions, 
IRD aims to enhance the long-term WASH infrastructures and provide a full package of WASH services and supplies to PWDs in camps.
This improvement targets host communities and IDPs located in Idleb, Janudiyeh, Ariha, Sarmin, and Teftnaz subdistricts in Northwest Syria. This project will respond to the needs of 90426 individuals (Host:69173 IDPs: 21253, women:18991, men:17181, boys:26225, girls:28029) for eight months.
through 3 interventions as follows:
The first intervention will target four informal settlements (Al Hussein, Kafruhin, Water Station, and Bishmaroun camps) in Idleb and Kafruhin communities
Work will be done to connect these camps to the nearby water and sewage networks and then to support them with operating costs to pump the safe water from the network towards these camps daily.
Meanwhile, safe water trucking will be delivered into these camps daily, desludging septic tanks for three months, pending the completion of the network connection operations.
Additionally, this intervention will be ensured that all gaps found through the need assessments related to the WASH services and supplies are filled, such as building latrines providing cleaning materials and tools hiring workers for cleaning collecting and removing the solid waste providing waste containers, as well as conducting hygiene awareness sessions and publishing-related RCCE materials, taking applying the prevention measures of COVID-19.
The second intervention will provide sustainable WASH infrastructures in Kafruhin, Hamama - Kafr Debbin, Janudiyeh, Ariha, Sarmin, and Teftnaz communities that have been considered as high-priority locations through the rehabilitation of 3 water stations and four sewage systems to serve 
86958 individuals (Host:69173 IDPs: 17785 women:18262, men:16523, boys:25219, girls:26954)
This intervention seeks mainly to provide sustainable and affordable power sources through installing hybrid solar energy and/or connecting the water stations to the electricity grid. In addition to carrying out the other rehabilitation works required to ensure the proper functioning of the water systems. 
Work will also be done to build the capacity of water units&apos; staff through conducting operation and maintenance training and tariff system activation training courses to ensure sustained operation and maintenance of water supply and support them with operational costs for three months.
In addition, work will be done to rehabilitate four sewage systems in Teftnaz, Kafruhin, Hamama - Kafr Debbin, and Janudiyeh communities. The works will include installing concrete pipes, excavation backfilling cleaning unblocking sewage pipes and manholes, the extension of sewage networks, and repairing the concrete in existing drainage and manholes. 
40950 individuals (Host:31270 IDPs: 9680 women:8600, men:7782, boys:11876, girls:12692)
The third intervention will target the people with disabilities living in the four camps targeted in the first intervention of this project. The activities will include addressing all the physical obstacles that impede their access to water, washing points, or toilets, considering the condition of each individual according to the disability s/he suffers, in addition to conducting hygiene awareness sessions and providing personal hygiene materials and NFIs with different modalities according to PWD needs.
