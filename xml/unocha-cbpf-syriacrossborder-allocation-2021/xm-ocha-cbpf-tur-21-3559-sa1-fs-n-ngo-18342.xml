   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project is supporting the food security intervention through distribution of free bread to the IDPs HH in Al-Bab, Aghtrin, Jarablus, and Ghandorah sub-districts, with Nutrition-sensitive response to enhance the food security and nutrition.
The project aims to support 8,524 IDP households (42,924 individuals: 8,256 men, 9,399 women, 13,279 boys, 11,990 girls) in 18 camps in Al-Bab, Aghtrin, Jarablus and Ghandorah sub-districts in Aleppo governorate with free bread distribution in an average of 1 bundle with 800-gram weight for families with 5 members and fewer and 2 bundles with 800-gram weight for families with more than 5 members per day for continuous 140 days over 5.5 months.
To achieve that, BINAA will contract with 4 bakeries from the surrounded area and will provide them with wheat flour and operational costs to prepare the daily needed quantities of bread in order to be distributed to the targeted camps over 27 distribution points.
The distribution will be under the supervision of BINAA field staff (Males and females) and support from the representatives from the local communities.
The project was designed as a continuation to provide free bread distribution to the targeted families who were receiving support through a previous project funded by OCHA until the beginning of April 2021. this was according to the analyses of the needs&#x2019; assessment and FGDs conducted by Binaa which shows the continuity of the need. (refer to Attachment 01-02-04).
BINAA field team will conduct verification visits to 100% of the 18 camp&apos;s residents to add the new arrivals and exclude who left the camps, and this verification will be conducted on monthly basis to ensure the exact number of families and provide them with the assistance.
Binaa will start early procurement in order to fill the gap of stop provision of assistance early in the project period, so Binaa can start the bread provision on time, however, the all the contracting will be after signing the agreement.
BINAA will conduct awareness campaign on the best practices towards COVID-19, mechanisms for reporting violations (GBV and SEA), and access to service, health, nutrition and protection centers.
the campaign will conduct through expert team from the protection staff, (majority of the staff will be women) to cover youth, women, elderly and PWD.
Through the project Binaa will formulate 8 Nutrition Rapid Response Teams (RRTs) to support 46 location in Al-Bab, Jarablus, and Ghandorah Sub-District (Attachment 27), whilst BINAA is already operating 1 RRT in Aghtirin Sub-District since February 2021 supported by UNICEF to the end of December 2021. Hence, the maximized impact of Nutrition Activities with the FSL interventions will be expanded to reach 11 camps in Aghtrin during the project.
The RRTs will reach 13,506 families of the newly IDPs.
The RRTs will Provide the Nutrition Services of integrated CMAM, IYCF, IMCI with adaptations COVID-19 to reach 5,363 PLWs, and 14,392 CU5.
In addition to supporting the engagement of 18% of the targeted families in the FSL program at the food distribution points with scaled-up IYCF-E, WaSH, and Health integrated awareness-raising sessions (1070 families/5280 individuals).
BINAA field team will take all preventing precautions from COVID-19 during the implementation as per the recommendation of Nutrition Cluster, UNICEF, COVID-19 Taskforce, and WHO
Monitoring and Evaluation activities will be conducted throughout the project which will include: Distribution Monitoring, Verification visits, and PDM.
5 camps out of the 18 were not coded by CCCM cluster, so we started the registration process, and the related email is attached, attachment 05.</narrative>
