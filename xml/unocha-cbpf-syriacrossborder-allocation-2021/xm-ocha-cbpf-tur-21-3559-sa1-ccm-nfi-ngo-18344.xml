  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">SECD aims to support the vulnerable people who are living the informal settlement under the risk of fire incidents and flood which is means a threat can harm their lives and dignity 
The selected camps are located in Idleb governorate, Jisr-Ash-Shugur district (Janudiyeh and Darkosh subdistricts ) and Aleppo governorate, Jebel Saman district (Ataereb and Daret Azza subdistricts ), and all of them are registered in the ISIMM database, the severity scale of all the camps are very high due to poor infrastructure and the absence of the protective factors which enable them to live in a dignified manner 
More than 50223 IDPs (10547 Men, 11551 Women, 13811 Boys, and 14314 girls ) 491 of them are people with disabilities, and 3267 of them are elderly people will be benefitted from the proposed fire response intervention in camps, in addition to 523 IDPs will be benefitted from the technical capacity buildings in the small-scale rehabilitation which means that they will be enabled to participate in the cash for work activities after receiving the vocational training which focuses on the electrical maintenance and the WASH maintenance
All the IDPs will also be benefitted from the formed emergency intervention teams (EIT) those teams will be on-demand in case of any emergency, especially in case of fire incidents in addition to their ability to implement small-scale rehabilitation in the camps
The following activities will be implemented under the CCCM intervention: 
-Forming emergency intervention teams with more than one members 
-Setting up a fire response plan in each campsite and this will include the required training with establishing 52 equipped fire points and identifying the emergency procedures in case of any possible incident with distributing 8528 fire blankets
-Conducting 66 vocational pieces of training sessions for the EIT and ensure their readiness for handling the responsibility of doing the small-scale rehabilitation in the campsites 
SECD is also proposing the improvement of the infrastructure of camps located in subdistricts and is classifies as first priority to be supported according to the SNFI cluster reports and this is matching the in-depth need assessment which is conducted by SECD&#x2019;s MEAL team 
More than 10568 IDPs (2219 Men, 2431 Women, 2906 Boys, and 3012 girls ) 114 of them are people with disabilities, and 1014 of them are elderly people living in the targeted 11 camps located in Idleb governorate, Jisr-Ash-Shugur district (Janudiyeh and Darkosh subdistricts ) and Aleppo governorate, Jebel Saman district (Ataereb and Daret Azza subdistricts )are suffering from the poor infrastructure and were facing the flood risk in the past winter since it is self-established camps and it wasn&#x2019;t supported by any NGO in the past period by any infrastructure improvement activities
The following activities will be implements under the SNFI intervention:
-The installation of the closed rainwater drainage networks to enhance its resilience against the flood with 8700 m
-Undertake the rehabilitation of more than 9.45KM of the main roads in these camps with paving and leveling it to facilitate humanitarian access and the IDPs movement
-Conducting the ground insulation for 1114 tents as a part of the flood response with installing about 80 ramps for the tents which host an elderly or PWD
One of the differentiators of this project will be the initiative to prepare comprehensive engineering studies for all the targeted camps in the CCCM and SNFI intervention.SECD engineering team will prepare these studied to illustrate the current situation of the infrastructure of the camps, SECD is planning to share this initiative with the NGO community during the cluster meetings, all the studies will be delivered to the respective clusters and to the camp management committees as well to make it available for all and this will save the efforts and ensure a better response in the future.</narrative>
