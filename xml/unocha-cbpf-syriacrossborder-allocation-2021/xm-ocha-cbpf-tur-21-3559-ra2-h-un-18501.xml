  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed project will strengthen access to lifesaving and life-sustaining essential health services within COVID-19 response through procurement of WHO pipeline of PPE supplies to support provision of integrated primary and secondary health care services to the vulnerable population of northwestern Syria. 
The goal of the project is to assist in procurement and preposition of the medical supplies into the warehouse inside NWS from the WHO pipeline (list of supplies is available as Annex 2) available through the Global Supply portal. According to identified needs WHO is planning to organize direct procurement of medical supplies from the Global Market focusing on specialized emergency health kits, including Inter-agency Emergency Health Basic Kits (IEHK), TESK and NCD kits from WHO Global Emergency Stock in Dubai to be distributed among health facilities in Idleb and Aleppo governates. Regarding COVID-19 response in northwestern Syria WHO will procure supplies both for the laboratories aiming to support surveillance system (laboratory Testing Kits, N95 respirators, and Gown) and health facilities providing specializes medical care to COVID-19 patients through intensive care units (ICU) for confirmed COVID-19 patients with severe symptoms and underlying chronic conditions. 

To ensure that these supplies will arrive shortly into NWS, WHO is planning to purchase part of the supplies in Turkey and deliver to Syria immediately since they are under critical demand. Other supplies will be purchased from the available WHO Dubai stock of life-saving supplies and will be based on the existing needs and availability of supplies in Dubai. 

Preposition of the procured medicine and medical supplies would be organized through two warehouses in Syria in Aleppo and Idleb governorates, which are operated by two contracted NGOs which will facilitate the distribution of these supplies to the organizations who are managing the health facilities to receive supplies. These are in-kind donations to the health facilities and WHO will not be having services except for logistics and warehouses. Otherwise, all active health cluster partners have been invited to the WHO supply line forum and may get donated supplies to ones who are prioritized based on the need during the months of distribution. The costs of warehousing and logistics will be covered through other WHO funds and will not be charged to this current project. 

As well it is worth mentioning that considering the risk of non-renewal of the UN Security Council Resolution it is planned to deliver all goods to NWS before July 10, 2021, and ensure health service continuity,</narrative>
