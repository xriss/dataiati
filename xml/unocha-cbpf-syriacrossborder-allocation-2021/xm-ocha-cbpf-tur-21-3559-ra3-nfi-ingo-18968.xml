  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Syrian conflict entered its eleventh year and remains one of the most complex humanitarian crises in the world which has relied on humanitarian financing to respond to critical needs. Humanitarian needs of people in Northwest Syria (NWS) remain critical, with 3.4 million people in need of humanitarian assistance in 2021. 2.8 million are internally displaced persons (IDPs), with the majority (80%) women and children. Shelter remains a priority need for most IDPs. 67% of IDP HHs in NWS face shelter hazard and 36% live in emergency shelter and report lack of space as primary concern. Many IDPs live in inadequate, non-durable and unsafe shelter in multi-occupancy or damaged residential buildings or Collective Centers (CCs) while 6% live in unfinished buildings. CARE&#x2019;s Rapid WASH Assessment conducted in 449 IDP sites in NWS in Jan21 found 86% with regular access to water rely entirely on humanitarian actors (mostly water trucking) to cover daily needs. Most sites don&#x2019;t have functioning water network systems. Women and girls living in IDP sites lacking nearby water sources expressed fear of harassment on the way to collect water. IDPs continue to rely on humanitarian actors for removal of sewage wastewater through daily desludging services. 65% reported that IDP sites didn&#x2019;t have safe and adequate sanitation facilities. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has further complicated humanitarian situation in NWS. On 31st May, the total COVID-19 cases reached to 23,541 individuals. 20,644 people recovered while there were 670 deaths.
In 2020, CARE, using SCHF funds, rehabilitated and extended the capacity of Zoghara Camp in Jarablus to host more than 875HHs. Using ECHO funding, CARE installed durable dignified shelter units targeting 450HHs in the same camp.
Under this project, CARE proposes to enhance shelter and living conditions to mitigate protection, safety and GBV risks by providing safe and dignified shelter units for 400 IDP HHs in Zoghara camp living in tents. CARE will integrate GBV risk identification into its assessment and analysis processes and center GBV risk mitigation interventions across its shelter programming. CARE will utilize the Shelter and GBV tools developed together with IOM, IASC GBV Guidelines (Shelter Thematic Area Guide) and CARE GenderampShelter guidelines to ensure gender and protection are addressed at project stages.
The project will be integrated and aligned with CARE&apos;s existing interventions in Zoghara camp. CARE currently provides all WASH services in the camp through SCHF and other funds. CARE is also working to connect the newly constructed improved shelter units to a new sewage network linking to decentralized wastewater treatment units, where the effluent will be used for irrigation purposes. CARE constructed a flood management system in the camp to drive rainwater out of the camp, consisting of open and closed drainage pipes and manholes. CARE supports other basic needs through monthly cash and livelihoods support by hiring IDPs for agriculture and WASH activities in the camp, which will continue until Dec2021.
Through the proposed intervention CARE will ensure community participation and planning, where specific needs, risks and concerns of diverse groups are addressed from the start of programming. CARE will ensure women and girls equally participate in community consultations and planning and address their specific needs, risks and concerns to mitigate GBV risks. CARE will emphasize diversity approach, considering that women and girls are not a homogeneous group and those with different vulnerabilities may face different GBV risks. Furthermore, CARE will recruit GBV field workers to support GBV Risk Mitigation processes and work with the Shelter team. This will support the Shelter team with &#x2018;on-the-job&apos; supervision and capacity building in integrating GBV risk mitigation into daily tasks. Lastly, field staff will be trained on information dissemination toolkit and safety audit toolk</narrative>
