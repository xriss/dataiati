   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Envelope 1: Support the Gaps in Primary and Secondary Health Care in Idleb and Raju</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed project aims to enhance the access to critical life-saving and life-sustaining primary and secondary healthcare services to extremely vulnerable IDPs and Host Communities in both Idleb and Aleppo Governorates, which is performed through supporting the provision of specialized internal and intensive care services in Idleb Central Hospital, and CEmONC and child health amp nutrition services in Raju Hospital. The proposed start date is the first of February 2022 and will last for 11 months. HeRAMS codes: G0700043!Idlib central hospital (Idlib National in the past) and B0203095! Raju Hospital.
 
Strengthening the internal medicine services would fulfill the massive current gaps in the specialized internal services in Idleb City and the surrounding communities, which was a concerning issue for the Health Cluster and Idleb Health Directorate as the support came to an end for the largest hospital that was the prime provider for these services in Idleb City threatening the lives of thousands of patients with chronic diseases and critical health conditions. Consequently, the only destination for patients who seek these services will be Idleb Central Hospital, supported by SAMS through other fundings. This hospital won&#x2019;t be able to absorb the high caseload of the internal medicine specialties (OPD, IPD, and ICU) due to budget limitations since the hospital funding was reduced significantly this year. Currently, the hospital is providing surgical services with limited internal medicine OPD services. SAMS through this project is proposing to expand and support specialized internal services in Idleb Central Hospital, which is pre-equipped with the required internal medicine medical equipment such as monitors, ventilators, suction machines, lab, and radiology &#x2026;etc. aiming to respond duly to the needs and fulfill the gap.
 
Furthermore, SAMS had and is still driven by its desire to assist the most vulnerable groups mainly women and children, and thus is proposing to support both CEmONC and child health services in the pre-existing Raju Hospital, which is equipped with trained medical staff and medical equipment for labor and delivery rooms, operating rooms, in-patient, and newborn care to meet the needs exist in Raju sub-district, and which had been identified as a gap by the Health Cluster, and the SRH-TWG. Raju Hospital was planned to be supported by the BHA-funded consortium, SAMS is coordinating with the donor to shift the support to other facilities, identified as gaps, however, they are not covered by the allocation because of their geographical locations (Al Atareb Hospital and Kafr Deryan PHC).
 
Over the project period, SAMS will financially support the medical and non-medical staff&#x2019;s salaries in addition to the facility running cost, consumables, medications, some medical equipment, minor maintenance and rehabilitation, and any other needed materials, while technically the staff will be provided with training, mentorship, and supervision.

SAMS will be able to reach 35200, of the 22440 female, 12760 male, 3124 girls, and 3740 boys.</narrative>
