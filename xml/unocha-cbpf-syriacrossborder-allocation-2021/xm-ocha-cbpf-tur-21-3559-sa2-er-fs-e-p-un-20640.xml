   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project delivers a strategic and integrated set of interventions to restore local economy in Salqin as well as enhance the access to socieconomic and education facilities in the targeted locations. 
The project will support agricultural livelihoods, non agricultural livelihoods and access to education, while ensuring the identification and referral of protection cases to livelihood support, enhance their resilience and promote their access to employment and entrepreneurship opportunities. The project formulation has been based in needs as identified in multi-cluster RNA/REACH/HNAP data. Besides, firsthand consultations, conducted specifically for this project with local stakeholders, have also informed the design of this proposal. By pursuing the referred main objective, the project aims to achieve the following outcomes:

1. Agricultural livelihoods are enhanced 
2. Livelihoods and businesses are supported.
3. Access to basic socieconomic infrastructures is improved
4. Social cohesion among IDPs and host communities is enhanced
5. Access to quality education is enhanced.
6. Protection concerns are addressed.

For this purpose, a set of interlinked activities will be conducted in coordination with FSL, Education (EDUC) and Protection (PRT) clusters. Firstly, and considering the high potential of the agricultural sector in Salqin, the project will provide different kind of opportunities to fit the needs and capacities of targeted communities, by supporting 150 existing wheat farmers with agricultural inputs and supplementary irrigation and 1656 new ones with high quality seeds, provision of labour support for 500 vulnerable women and small agribusiness support for 50 businesses and one food processing facility. Secondly, 120 short-term work opportunities will be provided to households that are not engaged in agricultural practices, as well as small business support to 50 existing vulnerable businesses to include different sectors of the local economy. To ensure a comprehensive recovery of these locations, the project will rehabilitate the most critical socioeconomic infrastructures in need of rehabilitation, a total of 2.7 kms of agricultural roads, 7.1 kms of main roads leading to markets, one park and one market. Moreover, the project is also targeting the rehabilitation of 11 schools in dire condition, to provide not only for short-term work opportunities but for overall long term resilience of the targeted communities. 
Finally, the project will mainstream and support a community-based protection approach by targeting PwDs, and protection cases with the support above mentioned, expanding the mobile team to help in the identification and support of these cases, as well as establishing a Community Committee to foster social cohesion as well as community protection mechanisms. 

This project will directly benefit 115,843 individuals living in 8 communities and 5 camps in Salqin (M: 53,318, F: 62,525). 

UNDP is the global lead agency in Early Recovery and Livelihoods Restoration with extensive experience in ERL projects, including inside NWS.UNDP will work in partnership with Ihsan RD (IRD), a national NGO which has experience in ERL, FSL, EDUC and PRT projects. UNDP will be responsible for overall management of the project and oversight against programmatic and fiduciary risks through efficient contractual arrangements and administrative support. This will ensure timely implementation of the project, and high quality of activities and program deliverables. UNDP&#x2019;s ERL team will provide technical guidance and expertise to ensure the quality, appropriateness and sustainability of livelihood activities. The added value of IRD is anchored on their experience in ERL, PRT, and EDUC activities in the area, ensuring a smooth integration across the different components.
This project will leverage existing UNDP&apos;s ERL intervention and IRD&apos;s PRT intervention in the targeted locations.</narrative>
