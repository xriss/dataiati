   <narrative xml:lang="EN">More than ten years of conflict, economic degradation and persistent displacement has exposed millions of people in North West Syria to on-going shocks and deprivation. This integrated UNDP project proposes a holistic early recovery approach to enhance resilience and strengthen the humanitarian response, addressing multi-sectoral needs in livelihoods and shelter through a market-based and human-focused approach in Maaret Tamsrin, Dana and Idleb. 
The project aims to achieve the following outcomes:
1. Strengthened access to income generating opportunities 
2. Improved access to markets and basic socioeconomic infrastructures
3. Enhancement of social cohesion among IDPs and host community members
4. Increased resilience of IDP sites and vulnerable IDP households 
The interlinked ERL and Shelter activities have been developed in coordination with the ERL, and SNFI Clusters, and in consultation with WASH and CCCM clusters to ensure the project is integrated with ongoing and planned works to increase resilience in targeted locations.
First, the project will enhance livelihood opportunities and strengthen markets by providing 200 vulnerable individuals with vocational training and 150 new and fragile businesses with enhanced business training and support to boost economic recovery. Second, 14.6 kms of roads will be rehabilitated in Dana, targeting the same locations that are currently being supported with income generating activities under UNDP to leverage the impact of the intervention, as well as one main market and a park in Idleb, to further increase the functionality of local economies. 150 short-term work opportunities will be created linked to the rehabilitation works to further increase the socioeconomic impact of the intervention. Third, the project will increase the resilience of IDP communities in this area with mixed ERL and SNFI activities to improve IDP sites in Maaret Tamsrin to mitigate flooding, increasing access to markets and improving access to services. Finally, the project will construct 410 dignified and safe transitional shelters utilizing local available resources. A CfW scheme will be chosen to complete the rehabilitation works and hence provide short-term work opportunities for most vulnerable IDPs. The same camps where road rehabilitation works are being performed by UNDP to mitigate floods and improve access of humanitarian assistance will be targeted in this intervention hence ensuring a comprehensive and integrated response. Finally, the project foresees the establishment of three community committees, one per location, to operationalize and mainstream social cohesion, ensure ownership and sustainability. 
Overall the project will directly benefit 524,824 inds (262,393 M, 262,431F) living in targeted communities and camps in Idleb, Dana and Maaret Tamsrin.
UNDP brings in the value addition of its expertise in infrastructure projects around the world and in NWS specifically. UNDP&#x2019;s early recovery team, who are highly experienced in infrastructure projects, will provide technical guidance and expertise to ensure the quality and appropriateness of infrastructure works and livelihoods activities as well as better outcomes for beneficiaries. UNDP will work in partnership with IYD, a Syrian national NGO which has experience with proven track record in site improvement works, rehabilitation and reparation of roads and drainage systems, as well as in the creation of livelihood opportunities. Overall, UNDP will be responsible for the management of the project and its oversight against programmatic and fiduciary risks through efficient contractual arrangements and administrative support from teams in Gaziantep, Damascus and its regional bureau. This will strengthen overall risk management and ensure timely implementation of the project along with the high quality of activities and the deliverables. The added value of IYD is anchored around their experience in both ERL and SNFI programming in Idleb</narrative>
