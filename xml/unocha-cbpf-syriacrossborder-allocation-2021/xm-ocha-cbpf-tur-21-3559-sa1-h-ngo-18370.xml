   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Provision of specialized health services to vulnerable conflict-affected populations in Idleb and Aleppo</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed 12-month project will strengthen access to lifesaving and life-sustaining essential health services and COVID-19 response in northern Aleppo and northern Idlib, in line with HRP 2021 priorities and AS02. Through targeted health and psychosocial support intervention, it will focus on service provision for most vulnerable groups who have limited access to regular services.

The project addresses needs and critical gaps in locations where a lack of funding (and the pull out of some actors) currently threatens the disruption of essential health services. The project will target 3 locations: In Afrin Jandaires (Jandairis PHC 3!B0203069 and Jelmeh (DDD Jalma comprehensive PHC!B0203087) and in Idleb Al Jolan (Aljolan camp PHCC/ Aljolan Camp!G0703048). In March 2021, Dana and Jandairies sub-districts received among the highest IDPs to both camps and communities, and residents have reported considerable needs accessing health services (March 2021 HNAP Mobility and Needs Monitoring). Communities in these areas face greater health burdens due to the COVID-19 pandemic, with 22,300 confirmed cases as of 18 May 2021 and the arrival of the UK variant of COVID-19 in Afrin, and likely in Idleb. The project will continue provision of specialized health and Mental Health and Psychosocial Support (MHPSS) services in each of the targeted areas, scaling up activities supported under SCHF SA2 2019 and SA1 2020, reaching a total catchment population of 93,047 in and out of camps and host community members (indirect beneficiaries).

Doctors of the World (Turkish acronym DDD) clinics have been responding to the health needs of IDPs and residents in Dana sub-district since 2012 and in Afrin since 2018. DDD is one of the largest providers of health care to NWS with 17 HF (12 directly run by DDD and five through partners). Its strong links with the local community have led DDD to develop the proposed project, responding to priorities and needs identified by the community itself. This project will support emergency preparedness steps to ensure appropriate health service coverage and capacity to increase service availability in case of massive IDP arrival. The project has also been designed in close coordination with the Health Cluster, COVID-19 Taskforce, MHPSS Working Group and humanitarian actors in the area to ensure that integrated and relevant services are provided to the targeted population. 

As highlighted by assessments conducted by field teams and as per evidence presented by the Health Cluster, health needs across Jandaires and Dana sub-district remain high and demand for services continue to increase with continuous arrival of new IDPs. DDD is a key health service provider in Jandaires and Dana providing comprehensive PHC services, Sexual and Reproductive Health (SRH) and MHPSS through fixed clinics in Jandaires PHC, Jelmeh PHC, and Al Jolan Camp. Support of these facilities in 2021 is essential to maintain availability of services to returning patients and people depending on the services, and to respond to the health needs of new IDPs arriving in the areas served by the clinics. Moreover, adaptation of services to respond to the specific needs of the most vulnerable groups severely impacted by hostilities and displacement is essential. 

The target population includes conflict-affected children under 12 years old, high risk pregnant women, older people, people with disabilities, people living with chronic conditions and other vulnerable groups with limited access to health care. Beneficiaries are consulted throughout the project cycle to ensure services are tailored to support outreach to these groups through community health workers and FCRMs designed to facilitate feedback from diverse male and female beneficiaries to inform any changes in implementation to better ensure their inclusion in DDD health services. A total of 40,906 individuals are expected to directly benefit from this intervention (direct beneficiaries).</narrative>
