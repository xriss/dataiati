   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Envelope 2: Provision of dignified shelter solutions to vulnerable populations in NWS</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">There remain almost 5 million people in need in Idleb and Aleppo governorates, 2.4 million of whom are in extreme or catastrophic need. Of the eight sub-districts in Syria where an estimated 1.5 million people live in catastrophic need, seven are in northwest Syria (NWS). Populations residing in NWS face mounting challenges due to protracted displacement and poor shelter and living environments, whilst being exposed to harsh weather conditions. Populations are in particularly high need of dignified, longer-term shelter support to cope with harsh weather conditions.

IOM proposes a project providing 1,170 dignified shelter units to IDPs residing in tents in three IOM-managed camps (out of ten camps established under CERF funding in 2020 &#x2013;frequently referred to as CERF sites). Out of the three targeted planned camps, tents in two camps (Abraz and Kafr Takharim camps) will be fully targeted and 270 tents out of 473 tents in Kelly camp will be replaced in the third one. The remaining 203 tents will be replaced through a different funding source. The project will also contribute to increasing the resilience and improve the economic situation of IDPs living in these three camps through the provision of cash for work activities for 108 beneficiaries. Cash for work activities will include beneficiary selection, training on the installation of the new dignified shelters, and supporting the installation of the new shelters.

In order to create better-dignified shelter solutions for 1,170 households (HHs) in three planned camps in NWS, IOM, through Ataa Organization, proposes to upgrade existing tents to the newly designed, innovative  Prefabricated Dignified Shelter (PDS) option by the Turkish Red Crescent (TRC). PDS dimensions are 4.2 m width * 5.5 m length (23.1 square meters) and consists of a steel frame that has a lifespan of minimum 10 years, lockable doors, PVC windows, as well as 3 cm sandwich panel walls. The units will be procured from Turkey and transshipped into Ataa&#x2019;s warehouse in Syria. In the three targeted camps, tents were originally installed between November 2020 and January 2021 with an initial lifespan of six to twelve months. Many tents have been damaged or destroyed due to severe weather incidents. Given the urgency of the shelter needs and the importance of equity within the planned camps, IOM has identified that TRC PDS offer the most viable option. These shelters offer increased durability and safety, with an expected lifespan of at least ten years with basic maintenance. To mitigate protection risks, the PDS have a lockable door and hard wall panels, increasing the privacy, security, and dignity of the beneficiaries. Additionally, the targeted camps have existing WASH facilities according to SPHERE standards (please refer to site plans annexes), as well as recently built cooking areas per each family.

In total, the dignified shelter component will target 4,700 individuals (1,034 men, 1,128 women, 1,269 boys, 1,269 girls) residing in three sub-districts ((i) Ma&#x2019;batli sub-district, Afrin district, Aleppo governorate, (ii) Kafr Takharim sub-district, Kafr Takharim district, Idleb governorate), (iii) Idleb governorate, Idleb district, Maaret Tamsrin sub-district, Kelly community. Locations were selected based on acute needs on the ground, beneficiary feedback, and accountability to affected populations. 

Moreover, this intervention is complementary to various projects, including SCHF, BHA, and GFFO-funded projects. These funds are currently implemented in the same locations whereby IOM and relevant partners continue to offer multi-sectoral services in the targeted sites in coordination with the Camp Management and Camp Coordination (CCCM), Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH), Food Security, Early Recovery and Livelihoods (ERL) and Protection clusters. This integrated approach will maximize the shelter and protection outcomes to improve living conditions of vulnerable IDPs.</narrative>
