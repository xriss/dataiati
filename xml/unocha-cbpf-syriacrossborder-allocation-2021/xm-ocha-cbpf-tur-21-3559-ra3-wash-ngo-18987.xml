  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In response to the gap of access to water in 168 sites during the last two months where more than 182000 of the IDPs in northern Syria in need of water, and to solve the costly and short-term water supply and to reinforce the most urgent life-saving interventions, WATAN aims to enhance the long-term WASH infrastructure in the large camps with considering the water trucking service in those camps with the low number of families due to the high cost of water network comparing to the water trucking service. Also, WATAN will connect some IDP sites with sewer networks alongside providing essential lifesaving assistance. This improvement targets the IDPs located in Dana and Maaret Tamsrin sub-districts, which located in Northwest Syria &apos;nowadays experience a funding shortfall in water and sanitation services. (OCHA, Funding gap analysis April &#x2013; June 2021) and (OCHA, Report No. 25, 2021). To this aim, the planned intervention will respond to the needs of 16101 individuals IDPs (3285 men, 4065 women, 4236 boys, and 4515 girls) through the following strategies:

 Water infrastructure for 6 IDP sites to ensure 35-40 lt/p/d during the months of July, August, September, and October, and 30-35 lt/p/d for the rest of the year of safe water for drinking and personal hygiene, which will be supported by the solar system to reduce the operational cost to almost zero. 

 Introducing solar systems in total 5 IDP sites as an energy source of water stations.

 With a sustainable and innovative solar system to ensure IDPs&apos; needs, WATAN is aware of the scope of the solar system during winter. As a response, during the rehabilitation period, water trucking service will be available for 3 months, and supporting the operation and maintenance of water systems during winter months will be applied in the water stations to ensure the functionality of the water systems and avoid any low-efficiency systems because of the weather.

 Water trucking in 11 camps, 5 camps will be covered for 3 months alongside the rehabilitation of water systems, and 6 camps will be covered for 7 months.

 Water quality monitoring will be applied to ensure that the FRC at the range of 0.2 - 0.5 mg/l.

 Construction of 2 high reservoirs (100 m3) and 1 ground reservoir (80 m3) to ensure the availably of water storage capacity in the 3 of the largest IDP sites while the other sites have water tanks as a storage capacity. 

 Rehabilitation and installation of the sewer networks in 5 IDP sites to ensure safe access to sanitation infrastructure. During the rehabilitation works, emergency sanitation services through desludging will be provided for three months.

 The intervention will cover solid waste management activities on daily basis in 11 IDP sites which include the operation of waste removal trucks, and waste removal workers. The collected waste will be dumped into formal dumping sites in Dana and Maaret Tamsrin sub-districts.

 RCCE intervention that aligned with COVID-19 outbreak will be applied through sharing the awareness information among the camps&apos; residents. This activity will be a complementary activity from WATAN.

 Shelter in camps activities in 12 camps with tent installation and tent replacement, tents graveling, and NFI CRI items kits distribution will be complementary services from WATAN.

One of the key successes of this intervention that the solar system that will be installed in the &#x201C;Alfarhan&#x201D; water station and will feed Al-Karkat and Has camps, this water station will also support another 7 camps hosting 10,872 IDPs (Indirect Beneficiaries). These camps are Al-Rahma 1, Al-Rahma 2, Al-Rahma 3, Alfarhan(Doyouf Almaara), Atta alkhair, Muzun, Kelly( Al Rayhan) located in the same area.

This intervention will address the HRP Strategic Objective 1, and it is directly linked with the 2021 Third Reserve Allocation Strategic Objective and 2021 First Allocation Strategic Objective 1.</narrative>
