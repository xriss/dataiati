   <narrative xml:lang="EN">TAS through this project will work to support the access to basic food services through light rehabilitation/maintenance of 35 bakeries in Albab, Afrin, and Jendires with the integration of Cash-for-Work for rehabilitation through working in maintenance, painting and construction and other related works to these bakeries, in addition, to distribute bread bundles for the most vulnerable as 20% of the cost of the rehabilitated bakeries.
The project will target Aleppo gov in Al Bab and Qubasin where the interventions will be: 
1-Rehabilitation and restoration of 35 bakeries, where we will visit targeted locations and conduct meetings with the local actors and bakeries representatives to explain the project  goals, take any suggestions which help in the success of the project 
TAS engineering team will re-visit each bakery and conduct detailed need assessment to define the required rehabilitation works which will be divided into three main categories building rehabilitation, electrical and mechanical extensions rehabilitations, and fixing or replacing the damaged equipment
After preparing BoQs for the rehabilitation works, we will announce the tender through TAS channels and shared with community through all available ways, then the bids will be evaluated , the vendors will be selected according to certain criteria such experiences, reputation ,Prices, Technical offer. etc
After vendors selection , contracts will be signed between TAS and bakeries&#x2019; owners/managers, TAS will contract with engineers to follow up on the venders and check their work 
After checking the deliverables, completing the implementation of the rehabilitation  work and testing, we will hand over the rehabilitated bakeries to the owners of private bakeries if the bakeries are private and to the local committee.
2-Supporting  2134 HHs, 10670 individuals of the most vulnerable IDPs with bread for 3 months through cost recovery approach with rehabilitated bakeries owners, where after selecting the vendor/s who will conduct the rehabilitation works, a contact will be signed between TAS and bakery owner (only for private owned bakeries) in the presence of local community representatives which includes the commitment of bakery&#x2019;s owner to recover 20% of the rehabilitation costs, the weight of the bundle is 800g and its price is 2 tl.
-TAS will target most vulnerable IDPs who meet the criteria, which will focus especially on women, children headed household, PwD, PLW and elderly.

At least 10% of the workers will be women, and they will be chosen in a way that ensures activities implementation and preserves the women dignity.
Selected workers will be oriented by the engineer team and the security officer about dealing with security incidents and their payments  will be delivered on monthly basis and calculated based on the number of working days for each where  MEAL Team will be there when the payment is done.
