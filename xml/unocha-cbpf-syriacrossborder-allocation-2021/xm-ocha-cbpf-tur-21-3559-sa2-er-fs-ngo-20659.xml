   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Integrated and complementary food security and early recovery project to strengthen the most vulnerable households in Al Bab with access to livelihoods by creating income-generating opportunities with cash for work and along the agriculture value chains (Envelope 2: SO3).</narrative>

  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">VO is proposing an integrated, complementarity 12-months project under FSL and ERL that seeks to increase the resilience of crisis-affected communities by improving their access to livelihood opportunities and basic services through integrated activities along the olives and wheat value chain (under FSL), also creating income generation opportunities through cash for work (CFW) targeting community-relevant basic infrastructure and local markets, and socio-economic services and infrastructure rehabilitation (under ERL)

VO designed the project based on the secondary data and primary data collected in Al-Bab district, Aleppo governorate, considering integrated activities from household up to the higher coordination level. The gender-balanced and inclusive project will achieve its aspired objectives through the following activities : 

Food security and livelihoods activities:

Support to 584 wheat farmers in 9 communities through addressing the gap in the wheat value chain by:
1) Cash vouchers for fertilizers (Urea) with value of 150$/farmer for 1 hectare of wheat,
2) Cash vouchers for supplementary irrigation for a hectare of Wheat with value of 100$/farmer
3) Cash voucher for 1 hectare of wheat harvesting costs with value of 100$/farmer
4) 200 MT of cultivated wheat by the BNFs to support farmers BNFs marketing their crops
5) Milling 200 MT purchased wheat and producing 155 MT of wheat flour to produce bread in the local bakeries and distributed free of charge to 2475 IDPs HHs in the targeted communities (a bread bundle of 800 gram/HH for 3 months) to improve IDPs food security and consumption and to alleviate the negative impact of the deteriorated economic situation (complemented by HIH&#x2019;s activities under SCHF funding: seed distribution for current cultivation season and GAP training on wheat cultivation).
6) Improved access for 555 HHs in 6 communities to livelihoods (income-generating activities) through CFW (100% female) for olive harvesting activities for 1 month in Al Bab (500 unskilled amp 55 skilled labour) to harvest 22000  trees (two trees/day/worker) for approx. 130 farmers.  To ensure sustainability and ownership, the CFW BNFs&apos; transportation cost and harvesting tools will be covered by the contribution of farmers benefitting from olive harvesting. 
The aforementioned activities will be integrated with further activities on the community level:

Early recovery and Livelihoods activities: 

7) 110 HHs in 5 communities have improved access to livelihoods (IGAs) through CFW opportunities for 3 months (100 unskilled amp 10 skilled workers) and improved access to basic services such as daily solid waste removal and public infrastructure by conducting minor rehabilitation to roads, sewage systems, sidewalks or gardens (identified through detailed assessments, potential impact and participatory through community prioritisation). VO will ensure community ownership through participation and financial contribution in all phases. The integration between activities 6 and 8 will be done by targeting different community groups (farmers and women by FSL-CFW, and male BNFs by ERL CFW).

Lastly, the CFW activities under ERL will effectively contribute to the COVID-19 response through cleaning and disinfecting public facilities, garbage collection, rehabilitating of the sewage systems and water networks. Each CFW BNF will receive 750 gram of soap sufficient to cover the HH&#x2019;s needs of soap for 1 month in based on WASH cluster recommendations. Moreover, Violet will ensure the COVID-19 mitigation measures are applied during all project phases.</narrative>
