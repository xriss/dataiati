   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Integrated Response to IDPs in Planned camps in Idleb and Aleppo through provision of full services under WASH and CCCM</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Maram Foundation seeks to save lives, uphold rights, and promote access to key institutions and services through providing integration projects for WASH and CCCM services. Maram Foundation aims through the proposed intervention to protect the vulnerable IDPs from floods, fire and to provide them with life-saving and life-sustaining services with main-streamed protection and advocacy in three planned camps. 
Due to the huge displacement from January 2020, the majority of IDPs had settled in random camps and informal settlement in Northern Idleb and Aleppo which caused their suffering from the floods and heavy rains during 2021 winter, in addition to increasing the fire incident in those random camps because of its overcrowding in tents and not taking into account the modality specified by CCCM Cluster. Moreover, the majority of the mentioned random camps and informal settlements are located on private land and have an HLP due diligence issue, which makes a difficult to provide life-sustainable services to IDPs such as water supplying through water network, elevated water tanks, sanitation network, and drainage system.
Therefore, Maram Foundation has established three planned and organized camps based on SPHERE, Shelter, CCCM, and WASH standards by using RHUs (Refugee Housing Unites ) as following:
- Ehteimlat Planned camp 1367 RHUs- Aleppo Suran
-Sheikh Bahir planned camp 400 RHUs -  Idleb- Maaret Tamsrin
-Kafr Jalis Planned camp 1133 RHUs - Idleb-  Maaret Tamsrin
Recently, MF has started receiving the IDPs in the planned camps and providing them with WASHampCCCM activities from its private fund. Therefore, MF under SCHF 1st Standard Allocation aims to provide 31,400 IDPs, 5250 (HHS ) living in three planned camps and 50% of people in Ehtiemlat village in Idleb and Aleppo Governorate with basic WASH and CCCM services including drinking water, solid waste removal, de-sludging main septic tanks, Hygiene Kits distribution, and Hygiene promotion, in addition to a full package of CCCM activities such as Capacity Building, Contingency plan and Fire-Safety Training for the Camp Management Staff and committees, planting trees, Child-friendly space- Children&apos;s games set. 
The planned intervention will mainstream protection principles especially (Do no harm) throughout the project cycle by considering the different needs of men, women, young children, children, adolescents, young adults, middle-aged adults, and older adults. 
So, as a summary of the project activities, MF will implement a full WASH and CCCM package in the targeted three camps.
Note that in Sheikh Bahir camp, MF will provide a full package of CCCM while in terms of WASH, MF will only cover HKs distribution and hygiene awareness sessions because Maram has already covered it through another fund.
Implementation plan: 
- MF will hold coordination meetings with the local authorities to explain MF&apos;s WASHampCCCM intervention, update the needs and IDPs numbers.
- Regarding the daily activities (water supply, garbage collection...etc.) all PRs and tenders will be prepared after signing the agreement in order to start providing the services at the beginning of the project period.
- While for the other PRs (the solar system, training, Heaters,...etc) all the tenders will be prepared after starting the project according to Maram&apos;s policy.
- Furthermore, during the project life, monitoring will be conducted at every stage of the project duration by collecting routine data and analysis on a continuous basis, in addition to evaluating the services provided by Maram to evaluate the service and find out how it met the needs of beneficiaries of different ages.
It is important to mention that all WASH activities in the target locations will achieve sustainability, for example, the water will be supplied by pumping from the public wells, not only that but also the existing sewage systems connected to public sewage systems will be operated and maintained during the project.</narrative>
