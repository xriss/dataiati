Provision of cash assistance to the most vulnerable households in Aleppo governorate to alleviate their suffering during harsh winter.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">IRD will provide a cash transfer value based on complete coverage of the survival minimum expenditure basket (SMEB) as determined by the CWG and SNFI cluster and based on REACH price monitoring for 3,750 HHs in Afrin sub-district. The transfer value and currency will be per guidance of SNFI and CWG, and thus may change during project implementation. Using the SMEB as the basis for a transfer value and conducting market assessments to ensure these items are available in the targeted markets. The cash for winter transfer amount ($150) as one-off distribution is based on a harmonized value set by the CWG and SNFI cluster during summer 2021. IRD will implement the project according to the IRD&apos;s Cash SoP (Annex 01). Each eligible HHs will have the flexibility to choose the winter items that meet their basic needs during harsh winter. Therefore, this immediate response to the most vulnerable households will continue to be a response priority, while IRD has the capacity and rapid response based on the experience of implementing such intervention and modality in a short time according to the shared RRM and SOP. The way that IRD approaches for this project includes the following responsibilities:
-Contracting with Financial Service Provider (FSP)
IRD will select the best provider in terms of the transfer fees and capacity including accessibility, transfer amount, # staff, and the required banknotes with high quality. IRD field team will share with the contracted FSP the distribution date, time, amp location on daily basis.
Vouchers printing: 
Beneficiaries (BNF) will receive a &#x2018;voucher&#x2019; to present at the FSP. Therefore, these vouchers should have a minimum level of security features, and the relevant procurement process should be followed based on the value of the voucher printing. 
-Program Preparation
IRD will inform and orient local councils and other actors in targeted areas. Local Councils will provide the BNFs&apos; initial list to IRD field team. Then, IRD will conduct a rapid market assessment in the proposed locations where the response will cover. This will ascertain the ability of markets to restock if demand increases, the current availability and quality of essential food and non-food items, and the accessibility of the markets to the local population.
-Beneficiary selectionampverification
IRD will agree and orient the Local Council (LC) and community stakeholders on BNF selection criteria and sign MoU for cooperation, setting out the responsibilities of the LC, community, and IRD in the beneficiary selection process. Initially, recommended targeting criteria should be agreed upon during the design phase of the program. The LC then will register BNFs, engaged from other relevant stakeholders (e.g, Relief Committee) on the BNF registration form to include basic information (head of the HH name, ID number, etc.)
- Voucher distribution amp redemption
IRD will determine the appropriate distribution point and will provide with all the necessary materials while at least 24 hours before the distribution, IRD will inform the BNFs of the date and time of the distribution and will coordinate with the FSP also the cash vouchers will be distributed by IRD field staff, at the same time, the FSP in the next room will redeem the vouchers for cash in hands along with IRD representative.
Arrange BNFs&apos; payments, confirm the paid amount, and transfer money to the contracted FSP.
PSEA is at the core of IRD responses, and all staff complies with it. Effective systems are in place for preventing and responding to acts of SEA by integrating PSEA in IRD policies and making sure that all IRD&apos;s staff read, understand, and sign the code of conduct, and all contracts with suppliers/contractors staff will receive induction and ensure the full understanding related to PSEA, CSG, as well as complying with the safetyampsecurity policy of IRD and the code of conduct will be involved in the service contract.</narrative>
