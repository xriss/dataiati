   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Improving the resilience of the affected IDPs and vulnerable host residents by distributing free bread in Jandairis Sub-district</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project will increase the resilience of IDPs and HC in areas with a large bread shortage by supplying wheat flour from Turkey to areas that suffer from the scarcity of the flour and high prices.
For two years, the SADAD organization has been distributing free bread to camps and communities in Jandairis SD, nevertheless that the distributed quantities do not meet the growing need in the area as a result of high influx of IDPs to the area, 85% of the total population are considered IDPs, the decreased flour quantities in NWS as all and the high inflated of the SYP in the past 6 months.
The designed project aims to support bakeries with 936 tons of imported wheat flour to bake, and distribute free wheat flour bread to the most vulnerable IDPs in camps and IDPs and host residents in communities in Jandairis SD on a daily basis of 6 days a week for 8 consecutive months with an average of 117 ton per month.
The process of baking will be based on a public tender to select the bakeries with proven experience, capacity, and good reputation in the area. Besides selecting the flour supplier based on another public tender to be announced on the public newspaper, and social media.
The project will support an estimated ~3800 households average of 5 persons per family estimated (19238 individuals) in 10 communities and 11 camps related to Jandairis SD. The project will target those most in need of food support and highly at risk of food insecurity and persons with disabilities regardless of their ethnic background and based on specific selection criteria, typology of the affected population (IDPs, Returnees, Host, etc) and based on vulnerability (unaccompanied children, separated children, families of children with special needs, single-headed household, pregnant and lactating women, older persons at risk, and extremely food insecure individuals)
This project will be implemented directly by Sadad staff, and Sadad will conduct the distribution through 21 small distribution points at each village and camp. the project implementation will be through these main activities:
1. Recruitment of the bread distribution team of 21 workers and  bakery monitoring officers.
2. Beneficiary selection process in coordination with local councils, IDPs, and host representatives.
3. Announcing 2 public tenders for procurement of the wheat flour, and to bake the bread in Northwest Syria.
4. Conduct home visits for verification of the beneficiaries and distribute the beneficiary cards to households.
5. Conducting kick-off workshops with the local authorities and camps managements in all of the targeted villages and sign MOUs.
6. Conducting the daily bread distribution in the selected camps and villages.
7. Conducting the PDM on monthly basis for the bread distribution.
The selection of the distribution points will be in coordination with beneficiaries, host, and IDPs representatives and based on accessibility, safety and ability to be reached by everyone.
The process of free bread distribution will be based on specific criteria, where families under 5 persons receive 1 Kg of bread (1 bundle), families over 5 to receive 2 Kg of bread (2 bundles) and families over 10 will receive 3 Kg (3 bundles).</narrative>
