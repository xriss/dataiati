   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Rapid response to the IDPs camps in Northern Syria to protect the most vulnerable people from probability risks of fire and flood</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">SECD aims to support the vulnerable people who are living the informal settlement under the risk of fire incidents and flood which is means a threat can harm their lives and dignity 
The selected camps are located in Idleb governorate, Maaret Tamsrin district, and all of them are registered in the ISIMM database, the severity scale of all the camps are very high due to poor infrastructure and the absence of the protective factors which enable them to live in a safe manner 
More than 53768 IDPs (11291 Men, 12367 Women, 14786 Boys, and 15324 girls ) 4,908 of them are people with disabilities, will be benefitted from the proposed fire response intervention in camps, in addition to 703 IDPs will be benefitted from the technical capacity buildings in the small-scale rehabilitation which means that they will be enabled to participate in the cash for work activities after receiving the vocational training which focuses on the electrical maintenance and the WASH maintenance
All the IDPs will also be benefitted from the formed emergency intervention teams (EIT) those teams will be on-demand in case of any emergency, especially in case of fire incidents in addition to their ability to implement small-scale rehabilitation in the camps with special attention to make them ready to do the needed rehabilitation and preparation of the basic infrastructure of their camps to face the rainy season and to minimize the possibilities of the flood which means the enhancement of the resilience of the camp residents in the coming winter 
The following activities will be implemented under the proposed intervention: 
-Forming emergency intervention teams in every camp  
-Setting up a fire response plan in each campsite and this will include the required training for the EIT and establishing 55 equipped fire points and identifying the emergency procedures in case of any possible incident with distributing 9335 fire blankets
-Conducting 70 vocational training sessions for the EIT and ensure their readiness for handling the responsibility of doing the small-scale rehabilitation in the campsites 
The EIT members will be enabled to do the necessary maintenance for the existing rainwater network where available and they will consider the preparedness for the next winter to mitigate the risk of the flood which is damaging and destroying the tents and is damaging the food and the household items according to the report of the CCCM cluster in the past winter, the flood harmed the people lives as well  
Moreover, the training will focus also on the rehabilitation of the WASH facilities and small rehabilitation and maintenance of the electrical wires and supplies which is means better services and a more protective environment in the targeted camps 
One of the differentiators of this project will be the initiative to prepare comprehensive engineering studies for all the targeted camps, and this will complement the first initiative of SECD which was committed to implementing it under a previously funded project by SCHF, SECD engineering team will prepare these studied to illustrate the current situation of the infrastructure of the camps, SECD is planning to share this initiative outcomes with the NGO community during the cluster meetings, all the studies will be delivered to the respective clusters and the camp management committees as well to make it available for all, and this will save the efforts and ensure a better response in the future.


SECD will include the beneficiaries from the very beginning of the launch of the project through conducting kickoff meetings to explain the activities to them and share information about the project objectives and communication tools. Also, SECD will consult with the community ((women, children, older persons) and decide on the most appropriate method to channel feedback information through conducting focused group discussions.</narrative>
