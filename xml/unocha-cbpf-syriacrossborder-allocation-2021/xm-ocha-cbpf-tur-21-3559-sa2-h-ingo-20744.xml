   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Envelope 1: Support the COVID-19 Response in Northwest Syria</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In the proposed project, SAMS will continue maintaining the essential minimum functionality of two previously established COVID-19 hospitals (AlZira&#x2019;a amp Salqin Hospitals in Idleb amp Salqin sub-districts) which are located in highly prioritized locations, to continue the COVID-19 response in Northwest Syria (NWS) with the recurrent surges and the very low vaccine coverage, where both facilities fund will end by the end of January 2022, and SAMS proposing the continuation of these facilities with the support from the SCHF starting from 1 February 2022. The HeRAMS Codes: G0700139!Alziraa Hospital and G0703153!Isolation Center for Salqin.
The two Isolation Hospitals (Al Zira&apos;a amp Salqin) host the highest number of COVID-19 cases according to the daily update from the Health Information System team (HIS). Additionally, Al Zira&#x2019;a Hospital is considered the main hospital providing ICU services for COVID-19 patients in Idleb city, while there are two other isolation hospitals in Idleb city,  one has no ICU beds and the other has only 13 ICU beds (with 10 ventilators). Salqin Hospital is also considered the main hospital providing ICU services in Salqin Area, as there is only one other hospital with limited capacity and no ICU department.
The full capacity of Al Zira&#x2019;a amp Salqin Hospitals is 90 amp 70 beds consecutively, each of them has 30 ICU beds with 30 ventilators and 40 IPD beds. Al Zira&#x2019;a Hospital has been expanded to contain additional 20 intermediate care unit beds through the SCHF RA4. The two hospitals are well equipped with necessary devices including oxygen generators, patient monitors, ventilators, hemodialysis,  Ultrasound machine, X-Ray machines, ECG machine, Video laryngoscopes, incinerators, medical lab equipment, and others. Moreover, the  two isolation hospitals are also equipped with highly trained medical staff 
Over the project period, SAMS will support the salaries of medical and non-medical staff in addition to the facility running cost, consumables, medication, and any other needed materials. Learning from the previous surges of the outbreak, SAMS will manage the available resources to support the two hospitals according to the epidemiological trends, starting with partial functionality of 20 beds in each hospital assuming 5 months of low season and expanding to the full capacity within the peak for two months, the project duration will be 7 months (with the possibility of changes based on the disease outbreak behavior). SAMS will keep providing technical support from SAMS members through the daily virtual rounds with the staff in the hospitals.  
The two COVID-19 designated hospitals are linked with the community-based treatment centers (CCTCs) in the area and other hospitals, in addition to coordinating with EWARN and HIS teams, and submitting daily information. Moreover, the hospitals are part of the COVID-19 referral network to receive suspected/confirmed severe and critical cases, it is worth mentioning that SAMS has allocated 5 equipped ambulance cars to transfer the COVID-19 suspected/confirmed cases between health facilities.
By the end of the project period, SAMS estimates 2,060 of them are 994 Men, 1034 Women, 19 boys, and 13 girls and about 10% of them PWD.

SAMS is following the case management group recommendations by decreasing the number of active beds inside those hospitals during the low season of COVID cases and will upgrade the hospitals according to the need, SAMS advisory team will observe the number of positive cases overall and the recorded cases and admissions and provide the recommendations to increase the capacity of the hospitals when the occupancy rate exceeds 80% in the available beds for several consecutive days.

All of SAMS staff working in its COVID 19 designated hospitals has been fully vaccinated, according to SAMS regulations vaccination is mandatory to work in the COVID 19 designated hospitals.</narrative>
