  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Using its rapid response mechanism, Alseeraj for Development amp Healthcare (SDH), in partnership with the Syrian NGO &quot;Rebuilding amp Development Organization (IMAAR)&quot; proposes a 9-month action that uses a flexible integrated programming approach that includes a multi-sectoral response (ERL and WASH) with a focus on appropriate preventive measures to alleviate the effects of flooding and prepare for winter in prioritized IDPs sites and nearby host-communities affected by poor weather conditions in Idleb Governorate, NW Syria.

The project formulation has been based on needs identified by Early Recovery, WASH, and Logistic clusters, supported with rapid needs assessments conducted by IMAAR and SDH in April 2021 and firsthand consultations with camps management and local authorities/stakeholders and aims to rehabilitate and maintenance of basic infrastructures, including roads, related drainage systems, and sewage systems, to ensure safe and dignified living conditions for 190,343 most vulnerable people (49,023 women, 43,269 men, 50,466 girls, and 47,585 boys), currently living in 67 IDP sites/camps and 3 nearby host communities in the sub-districts of Maaret Tamsrin, Dana and Qourqeena (Idleb Governorate), which affected by poor weather conditions to alleviate the effects of flooding and prepare for winter through integrated multi-sectoral response.

The project aims to achieve the following outcomes:
ERL Component: Rehabilitation and maintenance of 21.5 km access roads that connect the targeted IDP sites/camps with Sarmada community (Dana sub-district), Kelly community (Maaret Tamsrin sub-district), Kafr Dariyan community (Dana sub-district), Kafr Aruq (Qourqeena sub-district), and Idleb-Sarmada highway as well. The Proposed targeted roads have been partially to completely damaged and affected by floods in most of their parts in recent years. This action will lead to timely, safer, and uninterrupted access for humanitarian aid and humanitarian workers to more than 67 IDP sites/camps in 3 sub-districts (Maaret Tamsrin, Dana, and Qourqeena ) in addition to prevention of access issues and disruption of linkages with host communities affecting local economic recovery as well as improve movement and mobility for livelihoods opportunities.

WASH Component: Provision of WASH supplies and services in 6 prioritized IDP sites/camps in the sub-districts of Maaret Tamsrin (4), Dana (1), and Qourqeena (1) through construction/rehabilitation of sewerage networks and septic tanks to ensure adequate latrines, showers, and handwashing facilities are in place following a ratio of 20-25 person per latrine in addition to sewage management services as needed.

Both components (ERL and WASH) will be guided by the Basic Guiding Requirements guidance to Reduce Flood Incidents in IDP Sites and Communities in NWS shared by the ERL and other clusters in April 2021 and ensuring that HLP documentations are well carried out in parallel with field coordination with the relevant local councils.

Additionally, IDPs sites and nearby host communities around project locations will get access to short-term livelihoods in the form of unskilled labor (CFW). This component will be guided by the CFW Recommended Minimum Actions in NWS guidance shared by the ERL cluster/CWG.

This project will be implemented jointly by SDH and the sub-IP, IMAAR. SDH will carry the WASH component while IMAAR will carry out the ERL component.


In the context of this highly strategic intervention which has to be delivered within a period of nine months, both organizations, SDH and IMAAR bring in the value addition of their local expertise in infrastructure projects throughout NW Syria, which is there since the conception of this project.</narrative>
