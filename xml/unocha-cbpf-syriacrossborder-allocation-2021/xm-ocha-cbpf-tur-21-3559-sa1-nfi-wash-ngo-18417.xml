  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">To address the immediate WASH and Shelter needs and improve the living conditions of affected population in northwest Syria both in-camp and off-camp settings, and in line with the 1st and 2nd Allocation Strategic Objectives (ASO1 and ASO2), Shafak is planning to implement an integrated Shelter and WASH intervention in 9 communities including 7 informal camps in Idleb governorate with the aim to reach 209,743 people (42570 men, 63031 women, 55381  girls and 48761 boys).

1) WASH:

Comprehensive Emergency WASH services will be provided in 3 communities and 7 camps in Armanaz and Maaret Tamsrin sub-districts to offer access to WASH services for a total of 203,123 IDPs and HCs individuals. The following WASH services will be provided:

&#x25CF;	Water supply in camps:  Providing potable water to cover the needs of 5 camps (where 2 out of 7 camps will be supported by another NGO (IHSAN). A total of 2,795 individuals will receive on average 35 liters per capita on a daily basis through water trucks for 3 months, in addition to installing 11 water tanks, along with water quality monitoring for the distributed drinkable water.  Water samples from three sources (water tanks, distribution points, and beneficiaries&#x2019; tanks) will be collected and FRC tests as part of the standard practice for quality monitoring.
&#x25CF;	Water supply in communities: Rehabilitation of 3 water pumping stations including maintenance and provision of new electrical and mechanical equipment, constructing two solar powered systems, and supporting the running cost for operating these stations as well as establishing the cost recovery system.
&#x25CF;	Water amp sewage network rehabilitation: extending the water/sewage networks to connect 7 camps and neighborhoods in 3 communities of Ma&#x2019;ret Tamsarin, Armanaz and Kelly, and replacement of the damaged water/sewer lines. 
&#x25CF;	Support solid waste management in the same three communities and surrounded camps through providing the municipalities with running costs and installing garbage bins in the camps
&#x25CF;	Installment of emergency latrine: 14 blocks of concrete latrines will be installed in the 4 camps and maintenance of sanitation facilities
&#x25CF;	Hygiene promotion activities and distribution of soaps in camps and host communities. 

2) Emergency Shelter:

Emergency shelter activities will target 7 camps which are same camps targeted under WASH rehabilitation activities (in Maaret Tamsrin and Armanaz sub-districts) for a total of 6620 IDP individuals. The activities are gravelling of roads post WASH rehab activities to ensure safe and dignified living conditions for the IDPs residing in these temporary shelter sites, and mitigate the effects of floods in winter. Levelling and gravelling of roads will  be conducted after installing/rehabilitating the water and sewage networks. Where needed and in case the road gets higher than the tents due to the gravelling activities, affected tents will be provided with ground insulation to raise the tents to a level preventing water leak into the tents. 
The 7 proposed camps are registered on CCCM ISIMM tool with Pcodes as BoQs show.

Major activities for Shelter are: 

&#x25CF;	Designing general layout map for the sites for 7 informal camps (in Idleb) that are ranked as severe or catastrophic (in terms of population) on the SNFI cluster priority camps list. 
&#x25CF;	HLP and due diligence verification will be conducted for private, public property lands. 
&#x25CF;	Topographic surveying of 7 IDP sites clarifying the slope of the land and drains sections. 
&#x25CF;	BoQ design for the planned activities of site levelling and gravelling and tents ground isolation. 
&#x25CF;	Gravelling and levelling of 52882 square meter divided in the 7 targeted sites.
&#x25CF;	In case of tents lower than the roads and where needed ground Isolation and raising of tents for a maximum number not exceeding 213 tents (according to field team assessment visits) in 4 IDPs sites out of the 7 planned to be targeted ones.</narrative>
