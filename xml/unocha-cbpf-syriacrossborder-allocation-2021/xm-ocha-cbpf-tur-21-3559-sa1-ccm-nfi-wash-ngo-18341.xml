  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project is designed to restoring basic infrastructure to mitigate the risks of floods and rainstorm effects in the targeted camps for most vulnerable IDPs who exposed to flood and winter impacts, 15,565HHs, 100,500 Ind (100 % IDPs) 20,573 M, 22,920W, 26,963B, 30,044G). The 98 targeted camps are distributed over 3 districts, 9 subdistricts and near to 30 communities mainly located in Idleb governorates

Under shelter sector, the project has 5 main interventions targeting 71 IDPs camps, 10554 HHs (69417ind, 14085 M, 15980 W, 18507B, 20845 G):
1st intervention: raise tents&#x2019; grounds that exposed/will be exposed to the flood after new road graveling intervention, for mitigating floods risks and protecting the tents from the driftage by water rain or from being partially or destroyed during new rainstorms

2nd intervention: installing rainwater systems in the camps that were in need of a rain drainage system and there was a final discharging point (for ensuring the compliance of the proposed intervention with the &#x201C;Do No Harm&#x201D; principle). There were as well 13 camps were designed to be targeted under the WASH sector and sanitation intervention for providing with a combined drainage system (sewer and rain). The designed rainwater systems were categorized under two types for considering the width of the road, and for getting on the best rainwater drainage efficiency

3rd intervention: road graveling/compacted layers of graded gravel for internal roads (sub-base and/or base layers based on the camp&#x2019;s needs to be laid down and compacted), this will improve the access to/within the camps (exits &#x2013; entrances) and prevent the camps disconnecting with its surroundings during the heavy rainstorms and facilitating the living conditions and the access of humanitarian aids to the whole camp parts during the raining days

4th intervention: construction of culverts underneath the existed/constructed road for ensuring the continuing water stream flow throw the road and avoiding the water gathering along the road path and exposing the road body to defects or partial damages. All technical details, drawings, targeted locations and photos are attached with the annexes

5th intervention: provision and installation of solar power system for ensuring access to facilities (latrines, showers) for women and children, and mitigating protection risks. In addition to, maintaining lighting for the existing system as well.

Under WASH sector, the project has 4 main interventions targeting 19 IDPs camps, 4771 HHs (34615 ind, 6423 M, 7569 W, 9583 B ,11040 G):
*Sewage network implementation in 18 camps targeting 4601 HHs, 32935 Ind
Establishment of water system in one camp for 170 HHs, 1680 Ind.CP001727
*Supporting the established water system with operation and maintenance cost for 170 HHs, 1680 Ind using Solar alternative energy method.
*Conducting training on operation amp maintenance of the water system running on solar power.
*Conducting hygiene promotion sessions in all targeted camps.

Under CCCM cluster,the following interventions targeting all 97 camps which both WASH and Shelter interventions are taking place in addition to complementary with other NGOs working in the camp site secured funds:
1.Contingency planning, Safety and Security through providing 1240 fire extinguishers and 382 first aid kits in 97 locations beside deliver trainings to the security points members.
2.Site maintenance and emergency works through hiring 28 workers and equip them with proper tools.
3.Support improvement measures to camp management structures and systems through delivering trainings to the camp management members in 97 camps.
4.Conduct a multi-sector need assessment in the targeted camps before the winter season to identify the gaps in these camps</narrative>
