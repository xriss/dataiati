  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The conflict in NWS has severely affected the wheat value chain in Syria and the local community is not able to fill the capacity gap in terms of availability of agriculture inputs, storage and processing, and overall marketing. The proposed project overall objective is to contribute to improving the food security and livelihood in NWS. The project integrates components of the wheat value chain and has been designed to address the gap and supporting the wheat value chain. The project is based on three main interventions. 1) Wheat marketing by purchasing 2500 MT of local wheat from the vulnerable farmers.
 2) supporting farmers to cultivate 250 hectares of wheat.
 3) distribution of 2156 MT of bread.
Under this project, Qatar Charity (QC) will purchase 2500 MT of wheat to produce 1875 MT of flour for onward distribution to the bakeries for bread production and 500 MT of the wheat brane. The bread produced from bakeries will be distributed to 21,500 beneficiaries (male, female, boy, girl)  in Alraie subdistrict on daily basis for 10 months. 23% of the bread will be distributed for IDPs in camps free of charge,77% of bread will be at a subsidized price for all populations to cover the shortage in flour supply by AFAD.
The collected money out of subsidized bread distribution and wheat bran will be utilized to purchase wheat and repeat the wheat value cycle again after covering the cost of bread backing.
Also, 250 farmers will be supported by good quality agricultural inputs (seeds, fertilizers, pesticides,), cost of supplementary irrigation, and harvesting cost to cultivate 250 hectares. In addition to technical support and agricultural extension through field visits and field days.
The beneficiaries of wheat cultivation will be selected according to the eligibility and vulnerability criteria (attached).
All the selected beneficiaries must meet the following two conditions: 
1. The household does not have productive assets like animals (two cows or more, 25 sheep or more).
2. The household does not generate stable income (stable income: 150, USD or more per month).
The specific project outputs include:
1) Purchase 2500 MT of wheat.
2) Distribute 2156 MT of bread.
3) Distribute 250  agricultural kits contains (250 kg wheat seeds, 200 kg urea, 200 kg compound fertilizer, 0.5-litre insecticide, 0.5-litre fungicide, 2kg rodenticide, 250 ml herbicide, 200$ for supplementary irrigation, and 50 USD for harvesting).
4) Cultivate 250  hectares of wheat.
5) Rehabilitation of 12 silos with a capacity of 1000 MT for each.
6) Rehabilitation of one public bakery and Installation of one public bakery production line to serve the local community.
Wheat for bread distribution will be purchased in coordination and cooperation with SPEG and/or GOSM  to ensure quality, QC will contract with one of them as a technical service provider for that. In coordination with SPEG, GOSM and the local council a survey will be conducted to determine the wheat cultivated area and number of wheat farmers in the targeted area. The most vulnerable farmers will be supported by purchasing a 3-4 MT (1-hectare yield) maximum for each based on the size of owned land from small to large giving priority households headed by women, children, and the elderly.
During implementation, criteria may be updated based on the actual situation of the wheat cultivation and yield per hectare in coordination with Local authorities and FSL cluster.
The price of wheat will be the same price of the local market that determined by local main actors with 10 USD per MT as an incentive to encourage the farmers.
The field team will follow up on the project implementation daily to ensure the immediate outputs and the outcomes of the project are achieved. Project implementation will rely on the staff and sources available with QC. The project duration is 12 months and the total budget of the project is $1,200,026.40 with high cost-effectiveness, more than 90% for beneficiaries.</narrative>
