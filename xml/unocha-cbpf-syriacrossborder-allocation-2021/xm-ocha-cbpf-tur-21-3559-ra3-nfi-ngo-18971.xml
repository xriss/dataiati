   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Contribute to support the upgrading of IDP sites to ensure safe and dignified living conditions and respond to the winterization needs in high severity needs and underserved areas in NW Syria</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed project targets 22 IDP sites in 12 communities in 4 sub-districts in Northern Aleppo, the project aims to respond to winterization needs and measures to limit flood damages and address current emergency needs and critical gaps identified of where GAN is already intervening, it is also consisting of two main components:
1- Infrastructure improvements to mitigate the risk and prevent flood damages: this intervention targets the identified gaps in the assessed location where possible considering the HLP and other critical issues, so 3 sites are targeted under which include 402 families (261 men, 457 women, 640 boys, 670 girls), the main two works are: 
(1) Raise tents&#x2019; grounds that were exposed/could be exposed to floods to mitigate and protect tents from the driftage by water rain or from being partially/totally destroyed during rainstorms, in addition, road graveling /compacted layers of graded gravel for internal roads (sub and/or base layers based on the camps&#x2019; needs to be laid down and compacted), so this will improve the access to /within camps and prevent camps disconnecting with its surroundings during the heavy rainstorms and facilitating the living conditions and the access of humanitarian aids to population and vulnerable people.
 (2): Provide and install solar-based points to facilitate access to wash facilities (latrines, showers) for the population especially women and children, and mitigate protection risks. In addition to maintaining lighting for the existing system.

2- Provide winterization assistance to vulnerable families in all targeted sites: GAN aim through this activity to provide a timely life-saving winterization needs for 22 IDP sites for 6255 families (31,174 individuals including 6,441 men, 6,974 women, 8,580 boys, 9,179 girls) to help them cope with the harsh conditions and secure their needs in a dignified way by distributing 3 rounds of cash for winterization needs, so 50$ will be allocated per family per round as agreed with SNFI and CWG for cash winterization assistance, since cash modality give beneficiaries flexibility in choosing heating items they need and to give the project an ability to meet all changes in beneficiary needs as all camps have access to the markets and heating items according to the assessment, so blanket distribution will be applied in camps and 100% of beneficiaries will be validated and registered, while prioritization criteria will be considered if any changes happened to the number of population in the upcoming few months, so GAN will prioritize families with children below 2 years old, elderly members, disabled members, chronic ill family members and pregnant, in addition female and/or children-headed HHs.
Due to the lack of the banking system in northern Syria, GAN will identify the money transfer agent (MTA) by conducting a competitive process after assessing the markets and the vendors&apos; capacities in the local markets. where the identified vendors will be responsible for delivering the cash amount to the beneficiaries in the camps and the payment for the agent will be conducted after finalizing the distribution which reduces the security risk in delivering the cash in such a complex context, a rapid market assessment in terms of availability of the items, prices, and the accessibility will be conducted to make sure the local markets are functioning and to ensure all beneficiaries have a good and equal accessibility to winterization items.
GAN will benefit from exchanging of experience through sharing the lessons learned and the solutions to overcome the challenges with SNFI cluster and CWG.</narrative>
