   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Envelop 2: Strengthening the Livelihoods of the Vulnerable Population Groups in North-West Syria</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Over 10 years of conflict, infrastructure degradation and persistent displacement in Syria has exposed millions to on-going economic shocks and deprivation. While North-West Syria (NWS) hosts over 2.7 million Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs), this population group has the lowest rate of in-work individuals (Livelihood Situation Analysis in North-West Syria, 2021). This evidence chronic economic deprivation, regardless of livelihood status, as well as employment dynamics intertwined with sex and age. Moreover, in 2020, agricultural production witnessed a slight improvement over the past few years, especially for wheat, with an estimated total production of 2.83 million tons, though this is almost 30 per cent less than the pre-crisis average of 4.1 million tons. Farmers also suffer from limited access to markets due to physical and economic constraints, lack of water for irrigation due to damage of the needed infrastructure, and the impact of COVID-19 on agriculture value chains (2021 HNO, Syria).
To address the above-mentioned barriers and based on the primary need assessment conducted by Women support association (WSA) in conjunction with Nasaem Khair organization (NKO) in Idleb, Bennsh, Ghandorah, and Jarablus (Marma Elhajar,Jamel)sub-districts, this project is developed to:
 support Wheat Value Chain (WVC) in 1200 hectares, which are expected to benefit 2400 smallholder households (12000 individuals. 3240 B, 3360 G, 3500 W, and 1900 M) through provision of seeds, fertilizers, supplementary irrigation, and harvesting cost, during two growing seasons (2021-2022, and 2022-2023). 800 households (400 Ha) will be supported with Urea (Azote) fertilizers, supplementary irrigation and harvesting cost, for the 2021-2022 season, while 1600 households (800 Ha) will receive seeds, and NKP fertilizers, for the 2022-2023 season. 70% of targeted populations are female head households (FHH), and 30% are IDPs. 
 complement with early recovery at household level, via supporting business assets and vocational training for 400 households (using business group approach) that will be selected from the targeted household member in the wheat value chain activities. Moreover, the project will support four job fair (Business connection) events, in order to enhance successful networking and marketing strategy to selected business, in targeted locations. 
The project will maximize active role of women in the project in order to guarantee equality and equity that ensure sustainability of this intervention. Specifically, the community will be mobilized to appreciate the need to involve women in various income generating activities. Technical training sessions will be tailored to support targeted households and will take into consideration women&#x2019;s domestic work and maternal responsibilities.
Nonetheless, it is important to stress that the implementation of the project falls under responsibilities of WSA (as main implementing agency) and NKO (sub implementing partner). Hence, the distribution of the responsibilities between WSA and NKO will be based on technical comparative advantages of both organizations. Notably, WSA will oversee the overall implementation and lead logistics and finance services, while NKO will provide the technical and MEAL support.
Finally, the project will adhere to a Do No Harm approach (DNH), and Accountability to Affected Populations (AAP) to ensure quality livelihood services without causing any harm to the existing social system. WSA proposed program is cost effective, and leverages existing operations and program resources, to maximize efficiency. As part of exit strategy, WSA and NKO will inform all relevant stakeholders of the exact project dates including closure from the onset of the project. WSA and NKO&#x2019;s MampE department will complete an end line survey to gauge the outcome and output level results. WSA and NKO&#x2019; looks forward to sharing lesson learnt from the implementation with the FSL and ERL Cluster</narrative>
