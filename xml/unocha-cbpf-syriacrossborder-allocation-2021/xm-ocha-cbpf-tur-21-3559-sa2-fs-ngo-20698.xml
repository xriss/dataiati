The project objectives will be achieved by supporting the wheat value chain in Afrin areas, where the farmers will be supported in the production phase by providing them with seasonal agricultural inputs (fertilizers, irrigation support  for the cultivating season 2021-2022 and in the marketing phase as HIHFAD will purchase 1100 MT of wheat from farmers, 640 MT of wheat (192 MT of Durum wheat and 448 MT of soft wheat) which will be processed into 475 MT of wheat flour that will be produced via contracting local bakeries to be distributed as a fresh bread bundles (1 KG) to about 5400 HHs using in-kind modality, this component will have the life-saving theme as it will target the IDPs in camps of the targeted sub-district for 4 months of distribution for 26 days per month through contracting with local bakeries, while the rest of 460 MT amount of wheat will be sieved and sterilized into 400 MT that will be distributed as agricultural input (seeds) for around 1600 farmers (800 in Sharan and 400 in Jandiris 400 in Afrin) in the cultivating season 2022-2023.
To ensure integration of all value chain components, the milling and sieving outputs will be used to cover the costs of milling and sieving.
These activities will be linked with  supporting the existed irrigation System in the area by conducting a light rehabilitation/cleaning of the irrigation canals in Sharan, Afrin, and Jandairis. 
HiHFAD will invest in capacity building of farmers to enhance their agricultural practices and, eventually, their crops yield through online-training on best agricultural practices.
