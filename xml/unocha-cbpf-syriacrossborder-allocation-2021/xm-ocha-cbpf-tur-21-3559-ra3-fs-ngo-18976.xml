   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed intervention is a preliminary step to ensure more sustainability not only by delivering flour and yeast via the previous interventions and supporting bakeries to keep them in their business but also to conduct rehabilitation and support to the semi-functioning bakeries. In practical terms, families across Syria have faced heavily eroded employment opportunities, skyrocketing prices and shortages of basic goods and services, and widespread deterioration of household coping mechanisms. Food prices, in addition to other factors such as periodic shortages of staples, have led to a record 12.4 million people in Syria now estimated to be food insecure, an increase of 4.5 million in just one year. 

The overall objective of the proposed project is to enhance bread production and short-term income-generating opportunities of affected households and communities in northwest Syria especially among the most vulnerable households and communities. The proposed intervention focus on i) Improve the production capacity of the existed bakeries ii) Improve the access to free bread iii) Restore income-generating assets amp increase bread production and improved economic conditions and labor market opportunities in the targeted communities. 

Over 1863 households (11175 individuals: 2,163 men, 2,235 women, 3,129 boys, 3,688 girls)) are to be reached throughout the locations targeted by this project. At least 51% of the direct beneficiaries will be women and 5% of people with disabilities. Indirect beneficiaries are estimated at over one million. Participation will be open to resident families, IDPs, with the exact ratio outlined in the proposal. 

The intervention logic assumes that bread bakery sector development and investment in an improved value chain, in a strategic area such as bread production, can lead to increased food security, and contribute to more resilient livelihoods while equally addressing factors that compel people to migrate by creating employment opportunities, especially for vulnerable people. It is also assumed to reduce the risk of conflicts over resources and contribute to solutions to create short-term employment opportunities and so enhance the livelihoods of vulnerable people. 

The geographical scope of the project focuses on all the northwest Syria, Aleppo and Idlib governorates as well as there is a need for bakery rehabilitation. Indicatively the 19 following locations will be targeted: Daret Azza, Batbu, Abzemo, Maaret Atarib, Atareb, Azaz, Jarez, Shamarin, Talil Elsham, Tal Elkarameh, Selwa, Atma, Harim, Salqin, Kafar Takharim, and Idleb city.

Our intervention will improve the bread production capacity of 40 bakeries, 400 households under (output 1.1). 158 tons of bread for 1263 households will be distributed free of charge for 3 months duration over 16 distribution points as cost recovery and bakery owner contribution. The distribution will be under the supervision of SR field staff (Males and females) and support from the representatives from the local communities (output 1.3). Moreover, 197 cash-for-work workers will be selected to implement activities related to bakery rehabilitation, equipment amp infrastructure maintenance, and distribution of free-of-charge bread (output 1.2).

SR field team will take all preventing precautions from COVID-19 during the implementation as per the recommendation of Nutrition Cluster, UNICEF, COVID-19 Taskforce, and WHO. SR will start early procurement in order to fill the gap of bread production early in the project period, so SR can start the bread provision on time, however, all the contracting will be after signing the agreement. SR will conduct an awareness campaign on the best practices towards COVID-19, mechanisms for reporting violations (GBV and SEA).

Monitoring and Evaluation activities will be conducted throughout the project which will include: Distribution Monitoring, Verification visits, and PDM.</narrative>
