   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Livestock vaccination campaign for control of epidemics in smallholder dairy animals in NW-Syria</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed livestock vaccination campaign will protect livestock assets and livelihoods of smallholder dairy farmers and sheepherders and combat human malnutrition by ensuring sufficient availability of milk and dairy products in NW Syria. In particular the project seeks to rectify the dangerous insufficient vaccination coverage of dairy animals in NW Syria against major epidemic infections, focusing on Foot-and Mouth Disease (FMD), Lumpy Skin Disease (LSD) and Sheep Pox / Capripox. This will be achieved by addressing existing livestock vaccination gaps through large-scale refresher vaccinations of dairy animals in all accessible locations of 38 sub-districts of NW Syria. To prevent outbreaks of epidemics, the target is to secure an overall livestock vaccination coverage of at least 80% for FMD and LSD in cattle and for Sheep Pox / Capripox in sheep and goats. Livestock vaccinations will be complemented by serological surveillance to assess the current FMD situation in NW Syria in relation to the protection afforded by the FMD vaccinations practiced by past and recent NGO projects. - Based on project records from different recent livestock vaccination campaigns conducted by FAO and partner NGOs in 2020 and 2021 (please refer to Ref-16 amp Ref-17), the target numbers are: up to 30,000 dairy cattle owned by 11,100 smallholder households and up to 1.2 million sheep and goats owned by 20,900 sheepherder households. The target for women-headed beneficiary households is 15% to 17%. About 16% of cattle owners and 40% of sheepherders are expected to be IDP households. From the analysis of FSL Cluster Livestock Technical Working Group (LTWG) veterinary vaccination mapping data and taking into account LTWG recommendations and the seasonality of livestock vaccinations in Syria, the following epidemics have been prioritized: (1) Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) for cattle, (2) Lumpy Skin Disease (LSD) for cattle (3) Sheep Pox (also called Capripox or Goat Pox) for sheep and goats. The target is to cover 80% of dairy cows in NW Syria with vaccinations against FMD and LSD, and 80% of sheep amp goats with vaccinations against Capripox. This vaccination campaign directly builds on recent livestock vaccination campaigns against LSD in 2020 and complements vaccinations against PPR in 2020 and in 2021.Through collaboration with two animal health projects (FAO-EuFMD, Qatar Charity), FMD surveillance is going to be conducted parallel to vaccinations without any additional costs to the project. Systematic collection of FMD samples and data under the proposed intervention is going to be combined with use of diagnostic FMD test-kits provided by the FAO EuFMD program at Qatar Charity funded field laboratories in NW Syria and analysis of FMD samples at the Turkish national FMD laboratory. Compilation and analysis of all field and laboratory FMD data generated by the project will result in a comprehensive review of the current FMD situation in NW Syria and formulation of very specific recommendations for efficient FMD control (including choice of appropriate vaccine, vaccination intervals and coverage). These recommendations will enable all animal health actors to carry out much more efficient FMD control for all ruminant livestock in NW Syria in future, including FMD vaccination of 1.2 million sheep and goats (for details please refer to Ref-18). - The project will also carry out awareness raising for dairy farmers and sheepherders to educate them on the need for regular vaccinations. The project will also train 50 local veterinary service providers in NW Syria and involve and train 72 community animal health workers (village focal points), including women, on basic animal health skills to build their capacity and their ability to participate in income-generating activities.</narrative>
