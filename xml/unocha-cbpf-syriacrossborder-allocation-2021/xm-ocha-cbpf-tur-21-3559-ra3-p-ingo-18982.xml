  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed action aims at providing inclusive and integrated emergency response to critical needs in protection for conflict affected populations in the North West of Syria (NWS), with a focus on the most vulnerable groups. The strategy of response is developed coherently with the strategic objectives of HRP 2021, particularly OS 2 and it takes into account key protection considerations following a gender, diversity, and age informed approach, while focusing on high vulnerability groups, and strengthening inclusion of Persons with Disabilities (PwD). The logic of intervention is aligned with the second strategic objective of the allocation strategy (ASO2), and it is structured on two main pillars: 
1- Enhance protective environment through addressing widespread explosive ordnance contamination. HI teams and implementing partners will provide direct Explosive Ordnance Risk Education (EORE) sessions at community level, including community impact survey. To build on sustainability, HI will also implement trainings of trainers aiming to build local capacities and extend the impact of the action on the long term. Victims will be referred to internal (Inclusion and/ or Prosthesis services) or external services.

2- Enhance inclusion of Persons with Disabilities in society and humanitarian assistance through mutually supportive programming to increase their participation. Through the implementation of a twin-track approach, the logic of intervention will combine a package of activities aimed at empowering PWD from one hand and building a more inclusive and accessible living environment at the community level, on another hand. Considering the technicality of the activities, HI will be implementing directly in the identified areas of intervention. 

HI will mainstream COVID-19 activities across the overall strategy of intervention. Key messaging and the provision of PPE and hygiene items will be integrated in the activities package.

Concerning partnerships, HI is working with local partners since 2012, and developed strong skills and capacities. The proposed partner is currently working with HI in targeted areas. HI will ensure capacity building and training to partners&#x2019; staff for technical teams, programs, MEAL and support departments. HI will refer to its partnership management guidance and policies

High-needs and unserved areas in North Aleppo are prioritized. The strategy of response is founded on HI long standing operational presence in targeted areas of intervention lessons learnt from previous similar interventions long term partnership with targeted local implementing organizations in-depth understanding and knowledge of needs and socio-cultural dynamics at the community level. The overall logic of intervention and modalities have been designed based on conflict sensitivity considerations.</narrative>
