   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Enhance Safe Access to Formal Education Services for School-Aged-Children in The Underserved and High-Needs Areas of Atareb, Dana, Darkosh, and Qourqeena Sub-districts</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed intervention&apos;s overall objective is to improve equitable access for school-aged children to safe, inclusive, and quality learning environments to foster their resilience. This will be achieved through implementing a package of education activities to 19 formal schools in Atareb, Dana, Darkosh, and Qourqeena sub-districts which are located in underserved and high-needs areas, where11,766 children (5,581 boys and 6,185 girls &apos;including 302 CwD ~2.5%&apos;, 5-17 years old) are enrolled (65% IDPs). The project builds on previous projects&apos; successes, funded by Save the Children, UNICEF, and SCHF. The proposed schools need funding for the time being. So, there will be a big chance for 11,766 school-aged children to lose their education opportunities in addition to 480 education personnel who will lose their only source of income in case these schools aren&#x2019;t supported. By supporting a quality learning environment, IRD seeks to increase children&apos;s enrollment in the targeted schools. To achieve this, IRD will conduct digital Back To Learning (BTL) campaigns &apos;to minimize gathering and as a precautionary measure for COVID-19&apos; in 14 communities for raising awareness among parents and community members regarding the importance of education. All enrolled students will receive formal education services using the SiG curriculum for 9 months (Sep 21 to May 22). 20% of these students will conduct ASER tests twice. The baseline will be conducted during October 2021 and the end line will be conducted during April 2022 to measure the learning outcomes of the project on students. To improve the students&#x2019; well-being during the project lifetime, all enrolled students will receive recreational activities from their classroom teachers. All teachers will be provided with monthly incentives to increase their motivation and ensure their retention in schools. The project will cover the schools&#x2019; monthly operational costs, including recreational materials, refreshment, cleaning, hygiene materials, and stationery, conducting light repairs for schools, provision of students&apos; and teachers&apos; kits. The quality of education will be improved through contextualized and targeted teacher training and further support to their professional development within each school by delivering (CSG, TiCC, PSEA, COVID-19) trainings. IRD will cover the costs of these trainings from another funding. Parents Teachers Associations (PTAs) will be a component in the activities of this project. Quarterly meetings for PTAs members will be held to discuss what was achieved in the last period and set with IRD&#x2019;s staff plans for the upcoming period. Due to COVID-19, there will be comprehensive precautionary measures in the 19 schools, including periodic sterilization process for classrooms and WASH facilities, awareness sessions for students, training for teachers and educational staff, and sterilization provision materials for all schools. IRD will re-utilize all the preexisted IT equipment (laptops and printers) from its previous various education projects.

Plan B: 
All schools are now operational. In case of COVID-19 out-break again, schools may be suspended and close temporarily. As a plan B, the project will adapt the distance learning modality tested during 2020 through 4 education projects implemented by IRD and provide children with internet vouchers (which will be covered from running costs). WhatsApp groups will be created per subject and per class. Teachers will prepare their lessons and record the lessons to be shared with students.
In case there will be a part-time suspension, the blended education approach will be applied. It is a mix of physical attendance and distance learning methods.</narrative>
