   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Life Saving Food Security Assistance to the Most Vulnerable IDPs in Areas with the Greatest Severity of Needs</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed action will address critical Food Security (FS) needs of 922 HHs / 4,610 acutely vulnerable Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) living in underserved informal settlements in areas of Maaret Tamsrin sub-district. Minimum food consumption needs of the most vulnerable IDPs will be sustained through repeat monthly food voucher assistance, with a total of eight rounds of FS provided over the course of the ten-month action in line with FSL cluster guidelines and the priorities of Strategic Objective Two (SO2). In line with cluster guidelines, each beneficiary HH will receive food vouchers valued at $60 per month for eight months. 100% beneficiary verification will be completed during June, with delivery of  eight, repeat monthly food vouchers distributions commencing from July. Reduced 2021 funding from the Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance (BHA) will result in reduced capacity to respond to FS needs in Big Hearts traditional Area of Operation (AoO) in Idleb, including Maaret Tamsrin sub-district. SCHF funding is urgently sought to address this gap.

The action will target the most vulnerable IDPs, specifically those most likely to be food insecure and those at greatest risk of protection concerns. The targeting strategy will place focus on IDP female-, child- and elderly-headed households, Persons with Disability (PWD), including Explosive Ordnance Victims (EOV) in addition to Pregnant and Lactating Women (PLW). Considering the acute vulnerabilities of the target group, particular emphasis will be placed on ensuring assistance is delivered in a highly protective environment as detailed through-out this submission. Please see Beneficiary Selection Criteria and Targeting Strategy inclluded under Documents for more detail. The proposed action complements one-off emergency assistance delivered recently by Big Heart to IDPs in targeted settlements of Maaret Tamsrin by providing regular (monthly) food assistance to acutely vulnerable IDPs to sustain minimum food consumption and mitigate against protection risks.

The action is informed by a recent Needs Assessment completed by Big Heart during April 2021 which confirmed food is a priority and urgent need in the targeted informal settlements in Maaret Tamsrin. The assessment included interviews with IDPs, Key Informants (KIs) and vendors and also confirmed the viability of a cash-based to increase access to a range of food items &#x2013; including fresh foods &#x2013; and ensure maximum flexibility, choice and dignity for targeted beneficiaries, while also supporting local markets and the local economy. The April 2021 Need Assessment found no protection risks associated with accessing local markets, however did record high reliance on negative coping strategies to meet food needs. The selection of a cash-based approach also builds on monitoring, learning and evaluation drawn from Big Hearts seven years&#x2019; experience with FS programming, which indicated significant beneficiary preference for a cash-based approach when local markets will support.</narrative>
