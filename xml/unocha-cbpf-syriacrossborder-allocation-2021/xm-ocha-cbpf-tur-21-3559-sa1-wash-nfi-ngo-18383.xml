   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In response to the costly and short-term water supply in northwest Syria and to reinforce the most urgent life-saving interventions, WATAN aims to enhance the long-term WASH infrastructure and provide an SNFI package and direct live-saving assistance. This improvement targets host communities and IDPs located in Dana and Maaret Tamsrin, which located in Northwest Syria &apos;nowadays experience a funding shortfall in water and sanitation services. (OCHA, Report No. 25, 2021). To this aim, the planned intervention will respond to the needs of 68393 individuals (41393 IDP&apos;s and 27000 residents - 12573 men, 15043 women, 19176 boys, and 21601 girls) through the following strategies:
 
 The expansion of the water network and introduction of a solar energy system in the water station to reduce the monthly operational cost by almost 65% in Kafr Deryan. This approach will benefit a population of 47.000 individuals (8460 men,10340 women, 13160 boys, and 15040 girls),
 A cost recovery system will be established in the community by supporting the OampM cost for 5 months with descending coverage (100% for the first month, then 80%, 60%, 40%, and 20% by the fifth month) to ensure a smooth exit strategy. afterward, WATAN will conduct end-line survey for the water station using the tool by WASH cluster.
 Water infrastructure for 9 camps to ensure at least 35 L/captia/day of safe water for drinking and personal hygiene, which will be supported by the solar system to reduce the operational cost to zero.
 In total four solar systems (one has been installed, one in Kafr Daryan community will support the community and 4 camps, and two in camps to support 4 camps) will benefit a population of 68393 individuals.
 In addition, Kafr Deryan community will be covered through the rehabilitation and expansion of the sewer network.
 Rehabilitation and installation of the sewer networks in camps to ensure safe access to sanitation infrastructure.
 Shelter in camps activities in 8 camps with paving and road gravelling within the camps, lighting the camps, tents gravelling, replacement and NFI CRI items kits distribution will be complementary services from WATAN.
 Alnamothaji Althani camp will receive a provision generating set, construction of pumping room, operational support cost, SWM activities, Hygiene kits distribution, and hygiene promotion.
 Special attention to the concerns related to the COVID-19 outbreak through two rounds of distribution of hygiene kits in the camps to support 21393 individuals.
 Hygiene education and awareness sessions related to COVID-19 prevention, promoted by female professionals under the protection specialist&apos;s supervision.

With a sustainable and innovative solar system to ensure IDPs and the host community&apos;s hygienic needs, WATAN is aware of the scope of the solar system during winter. As a response, during the rehabilitation period, water trucking service will be available for 3 months, and water quality monitoring will be applied to ensure that the FRC at the user level is at least 0.2 mg/l. On the other hand, and to ensure there are enough distribution points, WATAN will install water tanks (1000 L) water ground reservoir (150 m3) in Taiba City camp. 
 
Besides, during the rehabilitation period, desludging activities will be available for 3 months. The project will include the installation of latrine blocks in 8 camps, maintenance of the existing latrines, and installation of PWD latrines. Also, WATAN will support the OampM activities of the latrines through regular cleaning by workers who will be hired from the same camps. Regarding solid waste management, there will be a daily basis intervention for the 9 camps that will include waste removal trucks and waste removal workers. The collected waste will be dumped at informal dumping sites in Dana, and Maaret Tamsrin sub-district.

This intervention will address the HRP Strategic Objective 1 and 3 ,and it is directly linked with the ASO 1 and 3.</narrative>
