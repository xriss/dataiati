   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project aims to provide integrated FSL services under envelop 2 of allocation paper. The project will support 2000 beneficiaries in 15 communities in Afrin, Jandairis, Sharan, Ariha, Mhambal, Jis Shughur subdistricts through the following activities:

1- Supporting barley value chain of 400 farmers who have access to 5 planted donum by distributing:
- Fertilizer (75 kg per farmer).
- Cash irrigation voucher with value 50$.
- Cash harvesting voucher with value 50$.
And purchasing about 70 % of final product of the total farmers, which is equivalent to 360 tons of barley grains and 180 tons of straw. While 30 % to be used for next season.
That fodder will be distributed to 1200 livestock breeders, enough for three months of feeding:
- 360 tons of barley grains will be distributed to 800 sheep breeders. Every breeder will receive 450 kg for one time (enough for feeding 5 sheep for 3 months).
- 180 tons of barley straw will be distributed to 400 cow breeders. Every breeder will receive 450 kg for one time (enough as filler fodder for 1 cow for 3 months).

The selection criteria of farmers are (have access to at least 5 donum of land planted with barley crop, have no access to fixed monthly income, are not benefiting from similar support, pledge to sell 70 % of the final products to the IHR). high priority will be given to smallholders.
The selection criteria of animals breeders are (sheep breeder has from 5 to 50 sheep, cow breeder has from 1 to 3 cow, have no access to fixed monthly income, are not benefiting from similar support). high priority will be given to breeders who own fewer animals.

3- Empowering 400 women by training on food processing, to be by two parts:
i) Supporting 200 women by:
- Holding 12 training sessions include theoretical and practical parts (for 4 months).
- Distributing 200 food processing tools-vouchers with value 150 $ per woman. Those assets can be used sustainably in future small projects by women
- Distributing 200 raw materials-vouchers with value 200 $ per woman divided into 4 rounds/months. These vouchers will be used to produce food that comes from vegetables, fruits, milk (high priority for our livestock BNFs), or other required food items. That small grant aims to encourage women to start their small business projects. 
- Establishing 5 women groups and building their capacity to be able to work as a team by producing processed foods and cooking meals in joint food processing workshops and selling them to markets. To participate in supporting women&apos; groups, IHR will hand over the training tools to women&apos;s groups&#x2019; members to be assets of their sustainable projects

ii) Supporting other 200 women by:
Holding 12 training sessions include theoretical and practical parts (for 4 months) by using the same assets for extra round of training. Every woman trainee receives 5 $ per attendance day as cash for training (transportation and refreshment). 
Training will be done by the first groups&apos; members under IHR supervision. Which is an opportunity to consolidate the gained knowledge.
The selection criteria of those women are (women with age 18 to 40 years, have no access to fixed monthly income, are not participating in similar training project, have the willingness and the ability to participate in the training sessions, pledge to come to the training canter to attend all training sessions). High priority will be given to female-headed households.</narrative>
