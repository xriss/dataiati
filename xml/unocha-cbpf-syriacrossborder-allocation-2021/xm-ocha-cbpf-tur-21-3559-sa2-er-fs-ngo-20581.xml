  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project seeks to conduct integrated and harmonized activities in the humanitarian field between the ERL and FSL clusters in the countryside of Idleb governorate in Bennsh Sub-district, which is considered an area with high needs.
This intervention will contribute significantly to enhancing the productivity and economic recovery in Bennsh by: linking the agricultural lands with markets, supporting the wheat value chain, supporting food security and livelihood assets. This will be achieved through implementation of harmonious and integrated activities that include rehabilitation of main and sub-main agricultural roads by cash-for-work activity, support of current and future wheat farmers with agricultural inputs and training as well as distribution of free bread to the IDPs families inside/outside the camps. 
The Project will be at the community level including three main activities:
- Rehabilitation of 9 km of agricultural roads as follows: 6 km of main roads and 3 km of sub-main roads. The sub-main roads will be rehabilitated through a cash-for-work activity targeting 30 beneficiaries from both the local community and the internally displaced (based on specific criteria) in the area and securing job opportunities for them for a period of two months (each beneficiary will receive $5 for every five working hours per day for 44 days). 
- Supporting 500 wheat farmers who cultivated their lands with agricultural inputs,where each Benf. Will receive 150 kgs of Urea Fertilizer N 46%, 100$ supplementary irrigation twice and 50 $ harvesting cost as well as three online technical training sessions about GAP.
- Purchase of 360 tons of wheat seeds with supported price from the communities (current beneficiaries and other farmers) based on specific criteria for ensuring the pureness and quality of the wheat. The purchased wheat will be divided and used as two parts: 
A.The first part 240 tons will be milled to produce 192 tons of wheat flour and 48 tons of wheat bran. MASRRAT will support four bakeries by wheat flour to produce bread to be distributed for free to 1500 families in/out of camps and returnees for four consecutive months. MASRRAT will contract with four bakeries to increase community participation and reduce work pressure so as not to exceed daily production capacity.
B.The other part of the purchased wheat seeds 120 tons will be storied, sifted and sterilized (we will have 114 tons of pure wheat after screening,5% impurities). The wheat seeds will be distributed to 456 new wheat farmers. Every beneficiary will receive 250 kg of wheat seeds and 150 kg of N:P:K (15:15:15) compound fertilizers as well as three online technical training sessions about GAP. The beneficiaries of wheat activity will be from the local community and IDPs who will meet the selection criteria. The wages of the mill, sterilization and storage of the 360 ton will be paid from the resulting bran 48 ton, and the rest will be replaced with pure flour and added to the amount of flour that will be distributed to the bakeries as a total of 200 ton to produce 220 ton of free bread.
This project will support 16,600 beneficiaries affected by the Syrian crisis (3,860 men, 3,659 women, 4,428 boys and 4,653 girls including 144 PWDs). All the people in the targeted villages and markets will benefit directly/indirectly from the project outcomes. The project is designed with consideration to the ERL and FSL clusters and WHO recommendation on prevention and mitigation measures related to COVID-19 especially during the distribution of support and conducting trainings. In addition, protection cluster recommendations were taken into consideration, wherein all the population in the targeted locations will benefit from MASRRAT protection Centers in Aleppo, in the event of any GBV referral cases.
The target villages are:
Bennsh 19154 HCs, 11860 IDPs and 450 returnees.
Toum 3749 HCs, 2401 IDPs and 161 returnees.
Foah 17280 IDPs.
Al- Swagheih 96 IDPs.</narrative>
