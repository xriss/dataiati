   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Increasing food security and support the resilience of Syrian women and men in Idleb by support the wheat value chain.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project aims to increasing the food security and enhancing the livelihoods of IDPs and host communities in Idleb Governorate (Maaret Tamsrin sub-district) through supporting the wheat value chain as the follows:
Based on community participation and AAP, the project interventions are designed based on the following: 
500 HHs (90% host communities+10% IDPs) in Hazano, Kelly, Kafr Kafrehmull, Kaftin , Beeret Kaftin and Maaret Elekhwan will receive agriculture input vouchers to enable them to plant 2500 dunum of wheat in total. In addition, it will support the marketing of wheat through the purchase of 500 tons of wheat in harvest season from the project beneficiaries.
50 HHs (100%IDPs) in the same regions will benefit from cash for work during the wheat harvest season.
5000 families of IDPs will be supported through the distribution of free bread for two months in random and regular camps in Maaret Tamsrin sub-district.
Key interventions will include: 
1- Provision vouchers to buy agricultural inputs, accompanied by related extension services.
2- Capacity building targeting farmers and local community members.
3- Support the marketing of wheat by purchasing wheat from beneficiaries to encourage farmers and the local community to cultivate wheat annually.
4-Support the IDPs by creating job opportunities in wheat harvest season (activities related to purchasing wheat from farmers and transporting it to mills. etc.).
5- Support the production of bread through milling of wheat and providing free flour for bakeries to produce bread (400 tons of flour).
6- Distribution of free bread to vulnerable IDPs in camps. 
7- Monitoring the project during the cycle of the wheat crop.
ATAA is planning to implement the project by providing 1 type of fertilizer voucher, 1fuel voucher, cash for harvest, as well as wheat purchasing to:
500 HHs for wheat cultivation, in addition, ATAA will provide job opportunities for 50 HHs of IDPs.
ATAA is planning also to distribute 450,000 bread bundles for two months in camps in Maaret Tamsrin sub-district.
ATAA will form specialized technical committees comprising experts to take receipt of wheat from farmers at the end of the harvest according to standard specifications approved by the grain institution. 
ATAA will contract with a mill for the wheat milling then take receipt of flour in bags.
(500 tons of wheat = 400 tons of flour + 100 tons of bran based on 80% extraction rate).
After receiving the flour, ATAA will contract with two bakeries for two months to bake bread, where ATAA staff will distribute it to the beneficiaries in coordination with the local authorities and camp management with daily monitoring by the MEAL department for bread quality and quantity. 
(400 tons flour*1125 bread bundles=450,000 bread bundle&#xF7;52 a workday=8653 bread bundles daily).
 The weight of the bundle is at least 1 kg.
ATAA will identify, verify and profile target beneficiaries through local councils according to the following eligibility selection criteria:
	Families who planted the wheat seed this season.
	Families which have 5 -20 dunums wheat at least.
	Families in the camps (1-5 person) one bread bundle (more 5 people) two bundles.
The shortlist will be identified depending on the vulnerability criteria
	Women headed households (widows, divorced, GBV survivors).
	Large families (more than 5).
	Families with disabled members.
	Families with low income (less than 50 USD)
	Families with elderly (men-women).
 Cash Workers selection criteria will be:
-  IDPs in the villages of the project.
- The age group is between 20-35.
- Physical ability to work. 
 Type of work is unskilled workers.</narrative>
