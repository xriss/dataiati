   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Improve the shelter conditions in informal camps by covering the basic infrastructure to prevent floods and enhance IDP access to their shelter.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The harsh weather conditions had exacerbated the already dire needs of the IDP population, including shelter, and non-food items (NFIs). As floods were a regular occurrence during the last winter season. Almost 123,000 IDPs across 310 IDP sites in northwest Syria were reportedly affected by recent floods. Over 22,000 tents were either destroyed or damaged.
With this deterioration of the living conditions, and lack of assistance to provide adequate shelter with considering the current outbreak of COVID-19 and rising number of confirmed cases in northwest Syria, degraded sanitation conditions and overcrowding in camps and informal sites are of particular concern this and coming winter.
IYD through this project aims to ensure the displaced Syrian families live in Improved shelter conditions in informal camps by covering the basic infrastructure to prevent floods and enhance IDP access to their shelter.
Therefore affected locations will be supported with camp improvement and enhancing the infrastructure, to mitigate and protect IDPs&apos; shelters from expected flooding. The main activities will provide shelter services for the IDPs as the following: 
1-graveling of the camp&apos;s roads to enhancing the status of the roads inside the camps to facilitate the IDPs movement especially during the winter season, IYD will install two layers of gravel with an average of 30 cm thickness (or more as needed) and compact with mechanical machines to form a solid layer above the roads to protect them from any rainfall.
2-Drainage system: the poor drainage and persistent standing water in and around shelters can lead to numerous health and sanitation problems in camps and informal sites extending the adverse effects of flooding beyond the event itself as well the camps are not prepared to contain the rainfall volume, to reduce the probability of a flood in the camps IYD will establish a drain system in the lowlands and beside the roads, this drain system connected with manholes and closed drainage system to collect the rainwater
this network resends the rainwater to the mainline, this mainline extends outside the camps to the nearest valley or sewage line. Moreover, culverts under main roads will be constructed when required.
3-Tents ground insulation (tent leveling): insulating the tent&apos;s grounds by raising the ground 20 cm up the ground by fixing bricks around the tent and fill the middle space with gravel and soft sand to be compacted manually or mechanically to make a fixed base to tents.
This activity prevents moisture and medium flood during rainstorms entering the tent, also makes an insulation layer that prevents the entry of insects and rodents into the tent.
4-Installing of solar lighting poles: To improve the assess in the IDPs sites and  the camp&apos;s facilities through installing solar lighting poles in the main and the sub roads in each camp, those solar poles will provide protected access to the IDPs in the targeted sites.</narrative>
