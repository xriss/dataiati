   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The emergency response through quick rehabilitation for the affected physical access roads to IDP sites during winter in Aleppo Governorate</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project delivers a strategic emergency-based intervention to overcome the access-based obstruction to IDPs&apos; sites in the severe risky sub-districts in Aleppo Governate ( A&apos;zaz, Jarablus, Jebel Saman and Afrin). Its main objective is to ensure uninterrupted physical access to IDP sites during winter and as when emergency situations arise. Maram Foundation MF will undertake strategic planning with response functions to ensure the delivery of the humanitarian goods to those in need, at the right time, in the right place. In order to create scientific-based response and well-planned intervention during the disaster, MF will design communication plan and risk analysis in order to prognose the risks and engage the stakeholders in planned response. A contingency plan (CP) will be designed, which involves making decisions in advance about the management of crisis, coordination and communications procedures. This plan should lead to timely and effective disaster-relief operations. The CP will be designed for Aleppo gov. and those that characterize higher probability that a disaster/emergency situation may occur. The CP will be including:
Determine the risk that are most likely to occur
Prioritize the identified risks and rank them based on the probability they will occur.
Develop realistic scenarios for the highest ranked risks and their impact
Create a timeline for when the scenarios might occur
Specify a trigger point to put the CP in action
Determine the proper action to be undertaken to mitigate the impact of the disaster and allow the humanitarian assistance to access.
In order to design this CP, MF will establish a strong coordination network of stakeholders targeting the sub-districts of Aleppo governorate, especially those that are identified as the highest risky flooded/hazarded locations. The established committee will be comprising via multi-sectoral representatives. The decision-making process will be placed on the multi-sectoral level. The feedbacks and suggestions of the local councils and local authorities would be considered as advises into formulating the outcomes of the committee. The committee members will convene coordination meetings and follow up on activities in the affected sub-districts. The committee will assist in finalizing the CP in order to create better and more comprehensive response..
Based on the outcomes of the committee, MF will be targeting the highest risky locations with awareness signs and signals to draw the attention of those access roads&#x2019; users to the possible risks and guide them for safer access/exit. MF Rapid Response Teams RRT will conduct site visits to the locations to have an accurate overview about the site and access roads and to identify whether there are humanitarian organizations acting on the ground for a better response and notification coordination.
Additionally, as per the outcome of this committee, MF will design a map-based dashboard to identify the risky locations and accordingly locate the procured service providers&#x2019; machineries nearby them in the call up time. MF is intending to procure service provider/s in each sub-district in order to cover the majority of Aleppo governate principally in the risky locations. Urgent information and description of issue will be delivered. Accordingly, MF will assign its RRTs and the procured contractor/s to response within 24-48 hours. The response will be in terms of soft road graveling, excavations, blockage (large stones) furnishing, and small emergency-based fixations.
The project will have a positive impact on all beneficiaries in the selected areas, where the total number of the targeted persons approximately: 141985 IDPs (32656 men, 39755 women, 45435 Boys, 24139 Girls) from different age groups (Young children, Children, Adolescents, Young, Middle-aged adults and elderly). This includes about 7100 Persons with Disabilities</narrative>
