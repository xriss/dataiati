   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Provide sustainable and life-saving WASH assistance to the most vulnerable people in underserved areas with high WASH needs</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In general, 60% to 70% of the population in camps relying on water trucking and often unsafe water supply modalities to meet their water needs. In many parts of Syria, the WASH infrastructure and service provision require significant repair and operational support, with the continued transmission and outbreak of COVID-19. 
The proposed action will provide life-saving assistance to increase and sustain access to critical WASH supplies and services in underserved camps of Atareb, Maaret Tamsrin, Idleb, and Dana Sub Districts, These areas are considered high priority and classified as high severity of need by the WASH cluster. COVID-19 prevention measures have been incorporated across the program design.	
The project activities will immediately increase access to critical life-saving WASH services, while also ensuring the long-term sustainability of service provision through establishing renewable energy modalities in Maaret Tamsrin Sub District in 2 camps (Qaryet Alkuweyt, and Alqatary) and establish water unit and provide them with OampM training, and work closely with ATAA engineering team. 

ATAA planning to respond to 26,799 IDPs in 19 camps (Please see the ATAA Project Locations table in attached sheet), as two-sectors:
- First sector: 	
2 camps in Maaret Tamsrin Sub District.
# of BNFS: 4291, and # of HHs: 660
Provide rehabilitation to the water station in Qaryet Alkuweyt camp, and installing a new water network and connect it with the main water tank (Capacity of 80 M3), also connecting the Alqatary network camp with the new water system, and ensuring the long-term sustainability of service provision through establish renewable energy modalities.
Purchases and install water storage tanks (1 M3) to 300 HHs and connect all water tanks in the targeted camps with the water system.

During the rehabilitation process, ATAA will supply safe and adequate water via water trucking on a daily basis for a short period (First 2 months) to all IDPs in the targeted camps (Ratio 40L/Person/Day).
After the completion of the rehabilitation process, ATAA will establish water units and provide them with OampM training, also provide OampM costs for 3 months (During the winter), and after the winter is over the water station can be work on a daily basis by the solar system.

- Second sector: 
17 camps in Atareb, Maaret Tamsrin, Idleb, and Dana Sub Districts.
# of BNFS: 22508, and # of HHs: 3893
Provision of life-saving WASH activities to the camps cannot connect to any water system and are in crucial need of adequate and clean water via water trucking on a daily basis and for 7 months (minimum 40L/Person/Day in summer season, and 30 to 35 L/Person/Day in winter season).
Purchases and install communal water storage tanks (5 M3) with establishing the gender-separated water taps in 17 camps.

Mainstreaming COVID-19 response throughout all regular WASH activities is crucial to mitigate risks, therefore, the project activities will be contributing to the prevention of COVID-19 and will be a key consideration for this project. 
ATAA will distribute essential hygiene materials (3 rounds of soap) to all HHs project camps in line with hygiene promotion and awareness activities to increase understanding of appropriate COVID-19 prevention and response behaviors.

ATAA will help to improve clean-living environmental conditions by providing solid waste collection (capacity of 100 Liters for each 10 HHs) and conduct solid waste removal on a daily basis from all project camps.
Please note Ihsan organization collecting solid waste on a daily basis in Sabroun (Batbo), so ATAA will not conduct this activity.
