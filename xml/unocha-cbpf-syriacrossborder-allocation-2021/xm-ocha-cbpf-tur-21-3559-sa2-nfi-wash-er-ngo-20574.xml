   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project aims to establish a new camp for 400 HHs (2,395 Ind, 593M, 657W, 512B, 633G) living informal settlements in Al Bab subdistrict in Aleppo governorate which are in high-risk areas, near to the frontline and threatened with eviction by the local administration. The housing unit&apos;s design will classify as dignified, more sustainable, and temporarily made of steel frame, walls of sandwich panels (6cm thickness), roofs from sandwich panels (4cm thickness), PVC door, and window. Each unit is equipped with a private toilet, bathroom, and kitchen in addition to the final concrete flooring layer which will be poured on-site by workers from targeted camps under the CFW program before the structure is in place for finish floor leveling above the compacted gravel layer.
Worth mentioning that BINAA has selected such module for the following aspects:
*Local availability of skills as well as accessibility to adequate construction materials in the local markets and workshops
*5m2 covered living space per person including kitchen and bathing facilities, and 2.5m minimum ceiling height to reduce the heated/cold spaces in summer/winter.
*Low-cost design using the shared wall partitions between the house units without any effects on privacy consideration &#x201C;1,763 USD/House Unit&#x201D;
*Expected to have a minimum 5-year lifespan, maintaining its sheltering and waterproofing capacities in all types of climates
*Provides good protection against fire, dust, wind, rain, snow, insects, and fauna
*Easily removable and reusable units by local availability of skills
BINAA and during the project design phase had selected the camp location as far as possible from front lines, ensured that the community&#x2019;s acceptance and engagement for the proposed house unit design had taken place and the land property is public according to the coordination with related LCs (BINAA conducted HLP Due Diligence Checklist and approved by the CCCM cluster with three key persons to ensure that there are no problems with the selected land)
The interlinked ERL, WASH, and SNFI activities have been developed in coordination with the ERL, WASH, and SNFI Clusters to ensure the project is integrated with ongoing and planned works. The project will first, engage 80 people in CFW for site and housing units floor preparation, and continue to stone paving for roads and planting trees. Second to construct the housing units with dignified and innovative shelter solutions (Attachment_SA2-T07_SNFI_Shelter Solution) in the public land selected. Third, the project will supply WASH facilities and services to the constructed housing units and site and continue to supply the WASH services for at least three months before the project closes out. Forth, the project will distribute a full package of NFI kits includes (kitchen sets, Mattresses, Blankets, and HK) for each family from the contingency stocks in coordination with the SNFI cluster. Fifth, shifting the IDPs households from the targeted unregistered camps to the newly established IDPs Site. These activities aim to establish the new camp with better-dignified shelters, WASH facilities, and services for most affected IDP communities, simultaneously creating short term livelihood opportunities
WASH Infrastructure will be provided including:
Underground infrastructure: septic tank, sewage system, and water network
Water supply: own water tank (500 liters)/HH will be connected to the water network
Water source: Equipping the existed borewell and establishing the 80 m3 of high concrete water tank
Distribution of 120 waste containers (100-liter)
Three months service: septic tank desludging, solid waste management, the operational cost for water supply, hygiene promotion sessions
BINAA&#x2019;s team will coordinate with SNFI cluster, AFAD, and local councils to connect the new established camp to the nearby public electricity network.</narrative>
