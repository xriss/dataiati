To this aim the planned intervention will respond to the needs of 56,476 individuals (11,953 men, 13,250 women, 14,600 boys, and 16,673 girls) -36 percent of them are IDPs- through the following strategies:

Rehabilitate three water stations in Ariha community ensuring the functionality of the water network. Ensure the three water stations are connected to the public power grid for sustainability. Secure low-cost power source by installing solar power systems in the three stations. In addition to a standby generating power source in all stations. Gradually descending operation and maintenance phase for five months. As well as construction of sewer line to connect Sado neighborhood to sewage system. 

A cost recovery system will be established in the community by supporting the OampM cost for 5 months with descending coverage (100 percent for the first month, then 80 percent, 60 percent, 40 percent, and 20 percent by the fifth month) to ensure a smooth exit strategy. afterward, Space of Peace will conduct end-line survey for the water station using the tool by WASH cluster.

The proposed intervention will include the establishment of WASH user&#x2019;s committees at the community level. Space of Peace will encourage women and adolescent girls to be part of those committees. The purpose of establishing the WASH user&#x2019;s committees is representing the vulnerable and marginalized groups in decision making at the community level and empowering them to raise their voices. In the other hand the WASH user&#x2019;s committees will be the core for Risk Communication and Community Engagement (RCCE) modality that will be used in control the spread of COVID-19 at the community level and hygiene awareness as well. 

Additionally, Space of Peace will implement a safety audit questionnaire on a quarterly basis to inform recommendations across intervention for improving the security of women and girls in the targeted community and measure general improvement conditions over time. The recommended actions based on the safety audit data should be interpreted as initial engagement points for strengthening gender-based violence (GBV) response and prevention. Space of Peace is running a GBV community centers in Ariha. The GBV center will provide protection consultation in this area. 

The proposed intervention will mainstream protection principles throughout the project cycle, men, women, boys, and girls will be consulted to ensure that they are served equitably and consider the specific needs of these groups.

Female staff will be hired as community mobilizer and hygiene promoters, and protection specialist will be consulted in Gaziantep office to manage the hygiene promotion, COVID 19 prevention, and implement the safety audit of the GBV during the implementation of the proposed intervention. The female hygiene promoters will take the lead in promoting hygiene awareness among communities in target location.
