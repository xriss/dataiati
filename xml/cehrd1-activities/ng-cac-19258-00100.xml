   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Training of Women on Gender Civic and Voter Education</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The training improved women&#x2019;s knowledge on the voting process to increase their turnout and secure their votes. The women were taught given security tips to protect themselves&#x2019; before, during and after voting. Their eyes were also opened to ethical voting process which is a key component in the voting process. Women were taught on the need to vote the right candidate who can help them protect their rights. A key segment of the training was the segment on the meaning of womanhood. This segment helped the women to reflect on their old and past mentalities and image of womanhood. It exposed them to a womanhood that is change making, strong and willing to fight for its rights. At the end of the training, the women were able to identify their subconscious bias and how it continues to perpetuate inequality as well as proffering some simple and practical solutions. This activity engaged a consultant who developed a civic and voter education module that is gender based. Previous voter education had focused on the citizens generally. However, this type of voter education targets women specifically, their involvement in the electoral process, challenges faced by women in electoral participation and strategies women could employ to combat election violence. The first part of the training takes the women through what their basic civic duties and responsibilities should be to the Nation. In essence, their capacity was built on their rights, duties and responsibilities to the Nigerian State. The second part of the training was more of an interactive session where the trainer facilitates the women through the issues they encountered in their quest to deliver on their civic duties and responsibilities. The trainer asked questions like: why the low turnout of women during elections? Why are most women&#x2019;s votes voided? Why are women inactive in political party activities? Why are there few women candidates? Why do women find it difficult to support their fellow women candidates? etc. As questions of this sort were asked, the women narrate their daily experience on issues of civic responsibilities, political participation. They unfold their encounter with governance, politics and leadership.</narrative>
