   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Sensitization Campaigns on membership of the Women in Governance Network (WIGN)</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Women were sensitized in a town hall meeting at the 3 senatorial districts of Rivers and Bayelsa States on the membership of the Women in Governance Network (WIGN). The objectives of the sensitization campaign were to acquaint the women on the ideals of the WIGN, to make them voluntarily form the network themselves and to elect their leaders. At the 3 Senatorial districts in each of the target States, the women did not only support the idea of the formation of the WIGN, they all joined the network and elect their leaders. It was good seeing community women exchanging contacts and suggesting possible ways to get themselves connected in spite of distance and terrain difficulties. The women agreed to have quarterly meetings independent of CEHRD. They also agreed to contribute some token among themselves independent of CEHRD to sustain the network at the senatorial district levels.</narrative>
