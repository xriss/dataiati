   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Centre for Environment, Human Rights and Development (CEHRD) facilitated technical group meetings to review and discuss the emerging technical issues to advance the Bodo Clean-up. The meeting had different stakeholders in attendance including the Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR), the National Oil Spills Detection and Response Agency (NOSDRA), the Rivers State Ministry of Environment, Civil Society Organizations, Shell Petroleum Development Company (SPDC) and the Bodo Mediation Initiative (BMI), the contractors working on the project, and Bodo community represented by the Bodo Contact Committee (BCC).
The Contractors meetings provide a platform for the Contractors to meet with stakeholders of the community, SPDC &amp; BMI management to discuss the progress of individual contractors in the course of the clean-up - their challenges and ways to resolve them to improve performance.  Its platform serves in the identification of issues that could potentially clog or derail the process and these are addressed as appropriate.
A Total of 5 Contractors meetings were conducted within the third quarter.</narrative>
