   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Centre for Environment, Human Rights and Development (CEHRD) facilitated radio call in programmes to create awareness and enlighten the public on the socio-economic significance of the Bodo clean-up project. 

The radio call-in programme provided a platform for the BMI to update not only Bodo community but Rivers State and the Niger Delta at large on the progress of the Bodo clean-up. It enabled the public to also express their views and be heard on the issues that concerns them in the ongoing project implementation. Topical issues pertaining to the clean-up were expressed and addressed including the benefits/gains of the Clean-up. Some of the concerns raised during the radio programmes were related to community participation, capacity building and knowledge transfer in the ongoing clean-up. Nine editions of the Radio Call-in programme were held reaching over 2 million people in the oil rich Niger Delta Region. 

The oil rich Niger Delta in Nigeria suffers from severe environmental degradation. The region is lacking socially inclusive development and has experienced perennial conflicts. The engagement of youths, including ex-militants in oil theft and artisanal oil refining, aggravates oil pollution in the Niger Delta. Artisanal oil refining causes re-pollution of remediated lands and black soot that compromise air quality.  Environmental management, particularly clean-up and remediation of oil pollution has been grossly ineffective due to weak regulation and use of contextually inefficient technologies (UNEP, 2011) .  Meanwhile, deeply held generational frustrations continue to brew in Niger Delta communities. The loss of traditional livelihoods, agitation for resource control, contract corruption, piecemeal regulation and poorly enforced regulations, and a profound failure of service delivery continue to fuel decades of accumulated tensions. 

In 2008 and 2009, the Bodo Creek was polluted by operational oil spills from Trans-Niger pipelines traversing the creek. The impacts of both spills have been exacerbated by numerous spill incidents caused by oil theft and artisanal refining. Both operational spills were litigated in the UK Court in London which lasted four years (2011 &#x2013; 2014). The litigation initially stalemated clean-up of the heavily polluted creek. Mid way into the litigation (that is, 2013), the Netherlands Embassy in Nigeria with the support of a local CSO coalition, NACGOND, initiated the Bodo Mediation Initiative (BMI) to mediate between the parties (the Bodo community and SPDC) and facilitate the clean-up, remediation and restoration of the Bodo Creek.  
The BMI is a multi-stakeholder platform involving Bodo community, SPDC, regulatory agencies, CSO and the BMI Directorate. The BMI facilitated clean-up has progressed from the initial free-phase cleaning (2017-2018), to the current final phase of remediation and restoration. Being a participatory, multi-stakeholder led platform, it is anticipated that the BMI would deliver robust, inclusive and sustainable restoration outcomes that will offer direction for the wider Ogoni clean-up.  BMI continues to partner with Bodo community, who are the primary beneficiaries of the clean-up, to promote sustainability.</narrative>
