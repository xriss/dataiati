   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This activity, the TOT for the WIGN Leaders in Rivers and Bayelsa States on Common Ground Advocacy and Social Networking aims at equipping the women on key strategies for networking skills among the women, and in their functions in relation to political and governance advocacies. The lack of skills in constructive engagement have reduced the women and relegate them to the background. Women are hence construed as mere supporters in politics and governance rather than actors. Positions taken in governance are all decisions of men. Women are not even part of the decisions that impact on their wellbeing. This training was meant to enhance the WIGN leaders in Rivers and Bayelsa States to constructively engage the government, deal with their challenges and desires to participate in governance at all levels.</narrative>
