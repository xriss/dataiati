   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Centre for Environment, Human Rights and Development (CEHRD) facilitated BMI Management Meetings to review and discuss the general implementation of the Bodo Clean-up with a view to highlighting the issues that may impede progress and resolve them as appropriate. The Management meeting also identifies and flags potential areas to watch out for in order to troubleshoot issues that could act as clogs in the wheel of progress of the Bodo Clean-up. The management meeting is usually attended by different stakeholders including Bodo Community represented by the Bodo Contact Committee (BCC), Shell Petroleum Development Company (SPDC), the Bodo Mediation Initiative (BMI) Secretariat and Directorate Office, CEHRD.
The meetings provided the platform for the BMI Management team to be updated on the progress of the clean-up. At the Management meetings operational, technical and community issues are deliberated upon and resolved. A total of 6 Management meetings were conducted in the third quarter of this first year of the project. It is important to note that in a bid to curb the spread of Covid-19 and the new Omicron variant,  all the Management meetings held within the quarter were virtual.</narrative>
