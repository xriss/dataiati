  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">CEHRD carried out this training to promote a state wide adoption of GBV best practices by bridging knowledge gaps of health workers by training them on data collection methods and intervention response mechanisms for managing gender based violence cases. CEHRD sent a letter through the Ministry of health to invite 40 health workers from the 8 LGs in the state to be trained on gender based violence response. However due to the tight schedules of the workers [some were undergoing trainings and others had to cover for their colleagues], the training had to be split into two phase. This was done to ensure that we have over 80% of target beneficiaries who can support practice in their locality. Bayelsa state has 8 local governments. These local governments have different smaller communities. Within, these communities, there are primary health care centres (PHC) which are meant to take care of the diverse needs of the people with serious cases referred to the general hospitals which are usually sited in central locations. This training target the PHC facilities since they are usually the first point of call by victims as they are accessible to persons from all walk of life.</narrative>
