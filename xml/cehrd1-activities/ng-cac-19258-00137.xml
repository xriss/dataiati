   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Oil exploration and production remains the mainstay of the Nigerian economy. The oil and gas sector accounts for over 90% of the foreign exchange value and 11% of the gross domestic product (GDP) in Nigeria. The Niger Delta region with approximately 31 million people mostly involved in farming, fisheries and food production, is the hub of oil production in Nigeria. Livelihoods in the region are largely dependent on the productivity of mangroves and adjacent alluvial systems. 
The activities of artisanal refining have been a major source of environmental pollution and contribute significantly to global warming. It entails the burning of crude oil and producing harmful wastes, which have negative impacts on society. Artisanal refining has resulted in huge economic loss, environmental degradation, depletion of the ozone layer, epileptic power supply, and inability to create employment opportunities amongst others. Despite these, artisanal refining ultimately affects the environment, social life and economic valuables in the region. Thus it became of value to consult key environmental regulatory agencies on CEHRD&#x2019;s project intentions as it will benefit the locals

This activity is to create awareness on the project and solicit for their support and partnership in project implementation. Stakeholders visited were:
1.	Hydrocarbon Pollution Remediation Project (HYPREP), Rivers State
2.	National Oil Spills Detection and Response Agency (NOSDRA), Bayelsa and Rivers States.
3.	Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR), Bayelsa and Rivers States.
4.	Rivers State Ministry of Environment.</narrative>
