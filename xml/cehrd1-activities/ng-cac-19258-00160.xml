   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Centre for Environment, Human Rights and Development (CEHRD) facilitated BMI Management Meetings to review and discuss the general implementation of the Bodo Clean-up with a view to highlighting the issues that may impede progress and resolve them as appropriate. The Management meeting also identifies and flags potential areas to watch out for in order to troubleshoot issues that could act as clogs in the wheel of progress of the Bodo Clean-up. The management meeting is usually attended by different stakeholders including Bodo Community represented by the Bodo Contact Committee (BCC), Shell Petroleum Development Company (SPDC), the Bodo Mediation Initiative (BMI) Secretariat and Directorate Office, CEHRD.

The meetings provided the platform for the BMI Management team to be updated on the progress of the clean-up. At the Management meetings operational, technical and community issues are deliberated upon and resolved. With lifting of Covid-19 restrictions, the BMI resumed physical meetings and a total of 5 Management meetings were conducted in the first quarter of the 2nd year of the project.</narrative>
