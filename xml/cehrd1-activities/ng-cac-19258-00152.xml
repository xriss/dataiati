   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Centre for Environment, Human Rights and Development (CEHRD) facilitated technical group meetings to review and discuss the emerging technical issues to advance the Bodo Clean-up. The meeting had different stakeholders in attendance including the Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR), the National Oil Spills Detection and Response Agency (NOSDRA), the Rivers State Ministry of Environment, Civil Society Organizations, Shell Petroleum Development Company (SPDC) and the Bodo Mediation Initiative (BMI), the contractors working on the project, and Bodo community represented by the Bodo Contact Committee (BCC).
The radio call-in programme provided a platform for the BMI to update not only Bodo community but the Rivers State and the Niger Delta at large on the progress of the Bodo clean-up. It enabled the public to also express their views and be heard on the issues that concerns them in the ongoing project implementation. Topical issues pertaining to the clean-up were addressed including the benefits/gains of the Clean-u to Bodo community as well as community participation, capacity building and knowledge transfer in the ongoing clean-up.
Three editions of the Radio Call-in programme were held  within the  third quarter, reaching over 2million people. 

&#xF0A7;	Over 2milllion people educated on the BMI Clean-up/remediation programme;
&#xF0A7;	A Bodo community son spoke on the many gains/benefits of the Clean-up to Bodo community and how to protect it. 
&#xF0A7;	Over 2million people educated on Curbing Re-pollution to sustain the gains of clean-up and protecting the mangrove eco-system.
&#xF0A7;	inputs via texts and calls on the topics were received, appreciating the achievements so far.</narrative>

Resource persons were deployed to achieve this. This was drawn from stakeholders within the region and specifically those with in-depth knowledge of the clean-up project from the community, BMI, etc .

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The oil rich Niger Delta in Nigeria suffers from severe environmental degradation. The region is lacking socially inclusive development and has experienced perennial conflicts. In 2009, the Federal Government of Nigeria granted amnesty to armed militants in the Niger Delta with ancillary livelihood package (the Amnesty Programme) to appease the militants, but this is not a sustainable solution. Some youths, including ex-militants, engaged in oil theft and artisanal oil refining, which aggravates oil pollution in the Niger Delta. Artisanal oil refining causes re-pollution of remediated lands and black soot that compromise air quality.  Environmental management, particularly clean-up and remediation of oil pollution has been grossly ineffective due to weak regulation and use of contextually inefficient technologies (UNEP, 2011) .  Meanwhile, deeply held generational frustrations continue to brew in Niger Delta communities. The loss of traditional livelihoods, agitation for resource control, contract corruption, piecemeal regulation and poorly enforced regulations, and a profound failure of service delivery continue to fuel decades of accumulated tensions. 
In 2008 and 2009, the Bodo Creek was polluted by operational oil spills from Trans-Niger pipelines traversing the creek. The impacts of both spills have been exacerbated by numerous spill incidents caused by oil theft and artisanal refining. Both operational spills were litigated in the UK Court in London which lasted four years (2011 &#x2013; 2014). The litigation initially stalemated clean-up of the heavily polluted creek. Mid way into the litigation (that is, 2013), the Netherlands Embassy in Nigeria with the support of a local CSO coalition, NACGOND, initiated the Bodo Mediation Initiative (BMI) to mediate between the parties (the Bodo community and SPDC) and facilitate the clean-up, remediation and restoration of the Bodo Creek.  The BMI is a multi-stakeholder platform involving Bodo community, SPDC, regulatory agencies, CSO and the BMI Directorate. The BMI facilitated clean-up has progressed from the initial free-phase cleaning (2017-2018), to the current final phase of remediation and restoration. Being a participatory, multi-stakeholder led platform, it is anticipated that the BMI would deliver robust, inclusive and sustainable restoration outcomes that will offer direction for the wider Ogoni clean-up.  Bodo people are the primary beneficiaries of the Bodo clean-up process. There is need to mainstream and optimize decision making and benefits of the clean-up in Bodo in such a way that vulnerable groups (e.g., women) would actively participate in and benefit directly from the clean-up process.</narrative>
