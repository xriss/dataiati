   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The extractives sector has the potential to contribute to the development of an economy in ways other than by direct contribution from its revenue stream. Through the creation of linkages to other sectors of the economy, extractives sector operations can create employment, play a significant role in poverty reduction and reduce aid dependency. There are various forms that linkages could take to generate these benefits. This topic overview investigates some of the ways that oil, gas and mining investments can open up opportunities in other sectors and address the challenges of sustaining linkage initiatives.</narrative>
