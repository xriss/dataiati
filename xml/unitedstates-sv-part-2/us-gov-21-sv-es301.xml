   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This award strives to help nations achieve sustainable improvements in the well-being and productivity of their populations through effective and accountable investments in education and other social services. This includes Children and young people in El Salvador often choose to join gangs or migrate elsewhere in response to their country&#x2019;s high levels of violence, limited education and leadership opportunities, and lack of safe spaces for youth to socialize and learn peacefully. At the IAF, we support community-led solutions to promote peace and security and provide alternatives to gang membership and irregular migration. Our grantee partner, Centro Cultural de las Artes Monse&#xF1;or Arnulfo Romero (CLAMOR), is offering art, music, and dance classes to children and young people in Nueva Concepci&#xF3;n to bolster their life skills and create a safe, peaceful space for them to gather, express themselves, and learn. CLAMOR will also provide them with training in leadership, conflict management, and human rights to build their resilience and reduce their likelihood of migration. This grant is part of the IAF&apos;s efforts to address the root causes of irregular migration in Central America..</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">U.S. assistance aligns with the U.S. Strategy for Engagement in Central America (the Strategy) to expand broad-based economic growth in a more secure and transparently governed El Salvador. The U.S. government will promote prosperity by improving the business environment, stimulating greater production, and building a skilled workforce that will help attract greater investment and create more jobs. These activities will be provided through technical assistance, grants, and loans. To increase security, U.S. assistance will help build stronger and more resilient communities that can withstand increasing pressures of gang violence. Programs will address the underlying social and socioeconomic factors that contribute to crime and violence by providing greater educational and economic opportunities for vulnerable youth in high-crime communities. Assistance will also strengthen the capacity of El Salvador&apos;s security forces and law enforcement agencies to contribute to international and domestic security. Using a place-based approach, a geographically focused, coordinated effort to reduce crime and victimization in targeted communities, U.S. assistance will support the integration of law enforcement and prevention activities. To promote improved governance, U.S. assistance will help strengthen the criminal justice system, government transparency and accountability, and respect for human rights. In October 2014, the U.S. government launched the Strategy, which complements the work undertaken by national governments and multilateral development banks, to support the priority objectives identified in the Plan of the Alliance for Prosperity in the Northern Triangle. The Strategy focuses on three overarching lines of action: 1) promoting prosperity and regional economic integration; 2) enhancing security through continued and expanded Central America Regional Security Initiative (CARSI) activities; and 3) promoting improved governance. Therefore, the Department of State and USAID&apos;s FY 2017 request of $750.0 million in bilateral and regional assistance for Central America - a part of the Administration&apos;s $1.0 billion whole-of-government request for appropriations and financing assistance to support the Strategy - includes and aligns the resources necessary to increase economic opportunity, reduce extreme violence, strengthen the effectiveness of state institutions, address climate change and food insecurity, and address challenges that have resulted in an influx of migration.</narrative>
