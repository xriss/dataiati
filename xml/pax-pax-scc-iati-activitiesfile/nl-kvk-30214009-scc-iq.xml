   <narrative xml:lang="ENG">Strengthening Civil Courage &#x2013; Iraq</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="ENG">Iraq has been experiencing many years of violent conflict. This has caused a shrinking of civic space, deteriorating human rights situation, unresolved past conflict and gender inequality. The SCC program in Iraq will address the damaged inter-community relations and the relation between state and citizens. Thereby empowering survivors and victims of violence to advocate for their rights with regards to justice and accountability. The main focus of the program lies on the Ninewa governorate, which was hit hardest by ISIL. Capacity-building training will be provided focusing on human rights, gender, dealing with the past, and advocacy.</narrative>
  </description>
  <description type="4">
   <narrative xml:lang="ENG">The activity is part of a larger programme implemented by the Strengthening Civil Courage Alliance, consisting of ABAAD &#x2013; Resource Center for Gender Equality, Amnesty International The Netherlands, DefendDefenders, PAX and their partner networks.</narrative>
  </description>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="ENG">The main objective is to reach evidence-based advocacy of strong and diverse victim groups and other civil society group in Iraq, that contribute to the realisation of inclusive transformative justice processes and to the nun-recurrence of atrocities. More specifically, the program aims for the victims and survivors of human rights abuses and violent conflict in Ninewa to influence transformative justice and accountability processes to be more inclusive. Secondly, the goal is to reach an increased collaboration between inclusive victim and survivor groups across the political divide, and finally, the programme aims to strengthen international standards and due diligence on arms export control.</narrative>
  </description>
  <description type="3">
   <narrative xml:lang="ENG">The target groups are marginalised survivor and victim groups; Iraqi partner organisations; grantees, such as community-based organisations; a network of advocates; local and provincial authorities; national authorities; and international policymakers.</narrative>

However, tentatively, the goal is to create direct interaction between grass-root/victim organizations or initiatives and national-level authorities (e.g. in Ministry of Justice, Ministry of Migration and Displacement, etc.), brokered by international- and Iraqi partners, the latter which will have a leading role. Change target is openness of Iraqi authorities to victims, which must increase over politically and exclusively oriented policy makers.</narrative>
