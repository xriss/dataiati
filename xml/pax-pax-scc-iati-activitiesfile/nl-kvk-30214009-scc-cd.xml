   <narrative xml:lang="ENG">Strengthening Civil Courage &#x2013; DR Congo</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="ENG">In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, human rights violations are widespread and human security is far from guaranteed. Violations and abuses, by both state and non-state actors, include extrajudicial killings, arbitrary arrests, torture and sexual violence against women and girls. Democratic space is restricted with far_x0002_reaching consequences for press, civil society organisations and human rights defenders active on issues like natural resources, human rights, accountability and elections monitoring.</narrative>
  </description>
  <description type="4">
   <narrative xml:lang="ENG">The activity is part of a larger programme implemented by the Strengthening Civil Courage Alliance, consisting of ABAAD &#x2013; Resource Center for Gender Equality, Amnesty International The Netherlands, DefendDefenders, PAX and their partner networks.</narrative>
  </description>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="ENG">The programme aspires to contribute to improving the human rights and human security situation at different levels. It aims to support pro_x0002_democratic civil society actors in effectively advocating for the improvement of electoral laws, institutions and processes. At the same time, it works with local organisations and selected communities in East and Northeast Congo on resolving (armed) conflict and the protection of human rights by state and non-state authorities. Conflicts relate for instance to access to land and natural resources and may e.g. occur between communities and authorities, between nomadic and resident communities or between artisanal miners and industrial mining companies. Activities include skills development (including on physical and digital security), monitoring and documenting human rights violations, facilitating dialogues and advocacy campaigns.</narrative>
  </description>
  <description type="3">
   <narrative xml:lang="ENG">The programme primarily works with (women) human rights defenders, pro-democratic civil society actors, and with selected local communities affected by natural reserves policies, industrial mining or violent conflict with rival groups.</narrative>

      <narrative xml:lang="ENG">One PAX partner organisation is a grass root level organisation with very strong ties with the local communities and local (customary) authorities. They have credibility among their constituency in the province of Haut Uele for the different issues they work on. Their relationships at a national and an international level are channeled through the work of PAX. Another PAX partneri is a faith-based grass root level organisation linked to the Diocese of Kisangani. But they are part of a national network and can count on support of the national umbrella organisation. The partner has credibility among the catholic base and good relationships at a local level. Their staff and administrative capacity is limited. Another PAX partner is an alliance of both catholic faith based groups and the constituency of the protestant churches at a national level. Most interventions take place in Kinshasa but the presence of the organisations is nationwide. The alliance is linked to the council of protestant churches and to the Catholic Bishop&apos;s Conference. Their main focus is on the elections and their strategies focus on civic activism and lobby and advocacy. The two partners in North-Kivu are specializing in MDR, with AINL&#x2019;s support. They are linking up with advocacy and lobby activities in the region, to make sure lobby and advocacy is evidence-based.</narrative>
