   <narrative xml:lang="ENG">Strengthening Civil Courage &#x2013; Syria</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="ENG">After more than ten years of war Syrian civil society is fragmented, both inside and outside Syria. At the same time political processes related to the future of Syria and processes that intend to pursue justice and accountability are internationally dominated and lack meaningful participation of Syrian citizens. The programme aims to support Syrian civil society &#x2013; outside of Syria &#x2013; to develop into an inclusive and non-violent peace movement that takes an active role in transitional processes and in promoting peace in Syria.</narrative>
  </description>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="ENG">On one hand it provides civil society organisations (CSOs) with support to develop their non-violent strategising skills, their advocacy skills and their ability to build connections and bridges with various actors and communities within Syrian Civil Society at large. On the other hand it facilitates access to relevant in country authorities and international fora, so that concerns and interests of civilians will be heard in political and transitional processes.</narrative>
  </description>
  <description type="4">
   <narrative xml:lang="ENG">The activity is part of a larger programme implemented by the Strengthening Civil Courage Alliance, consisting of ABAAD &#x2013; Resource Center for Gender Equality, Amnesty International The Netherlands, DefendDefenders, PAX and their partner networks.</narrative>
  </description>
  <description type="3">
   <narrative xml:lang="ENG">The programme primarily works with Syrian Civil Society and with and for victims and survivors of human rights violations, with a special focus on women and youth.</narrative>

It was also presented to Belgian, French, UK and German parliamentarians, as well as used as advised study material in the Utrecht University, and was shared widely on social media.  In general there is widespread awareness about civilian harm on Syria, but there is a lack of attention to indirect and longer term harm, and it is not so much directly linked to the international policy debates on explosive weapons in populated areas.</narrative>
