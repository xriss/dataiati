   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Feed the Children&#x2019;s child-focused community-development (CFCD) program approach includes four cornerstone pillars: Food &amp;amp; Nutrition, Health &amp;amp; Water, Education, and Livelihoods. We work to transform lives by improving the food &amp;amp; nutrition security of mothers and children, and more specifically to reduce malnutrition and poverty. This happens when parents have the skills they need to raise well nourished and thriving children, when communities are clean and keep children healthy, when children get the education they need to grow up to have good jobs and to raise healthy children themselves, and when parents have the skills and resources they need to feed their families.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">We improve a child&#x2019;s adulthood outcomes though proper early childhood development, nutrition and health. In Uganda, to best equip mothers and caregivers with nutritional education, trainings provide them with important information on preventing childhood malnutrition and illness (direct beneficiaries=1,500). In addition, Feed the Children provides growth monitoring so mothers can regularly ensure their child is healthy. Through deworming medication and vitamin supplements, children are protected from many preventable illnesses that affect their potential. Rehabilitation is also provided to children who are malnourished (DB=1,500).

Because many diseases are spread through poor sanitation practices and unclean water, children are taught WASH behaviors to prevent the spread of these illnesses. As a high impact, low-cost initiative, this education is designed to help families engage in preventative measures that improve their health. 

Educational achievement improves the chances of adulthood success, so every additional day a child attends school is important for his or her future. We know that parental involvement is key to ensuring a child succeeds in school, so Feed the Children promotes with parents the benefits of attending school. In addition, short-term hunger can impact a child&#x2019;s ability to focus and perform well in the classroom, so daily school meals are provided so that food is not a barrier to educational achievement. Similarly, lack of materials can hinder a child&#x2019;s performance or prevent him or her from attending school at all. Feed the Children provides school supplies so that children can reach their full educational potential, thereby improving their adulthood outcomes (DB=2,000).

Child livelihoods are improved when their parents are economically secure. Through the promotion of community and school gardens, families are able to expand their economic outputs and increase financial security within villages, in addition to improving the nutritional diversity of their meals at home. 

As mothers are primary caretakers for their children, maternal health is crucial to childhood improvement, too. Feed the Children engages in activities with mothers that are designed to reduce maternal depression so they can fully provide for their families (DB=2,100).</narrative>
