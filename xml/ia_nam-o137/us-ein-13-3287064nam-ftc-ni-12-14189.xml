   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Feed the Children&#x2019;s child-focused community-development (CFCD) program approach includes four cornerstone pillars: Food &amp;amp; Nutrition, Health &amp;amp; Water, Education, and Livelihoods. We work to transform lives by improving the food &amp;amp; nutrition security of mothers and children, and more specifically to reduce malnutrition and poverty. This happens when parents have the skills they need to raise well-nourished and thriving children, when communities are clean and keep children healthy, when children get the education they need to grow up to have good jobs and to raise healthy children themselves, and when parents have the skills and resources they need to feed their families.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Proper nutrition is critical to development, especially from conception to a child&#x2019;s second birthday. This 1,000-day window is where nutritional stunting can permanently impact a child&#x2019;s development potential. By addressing needs during this window, Feed the Children aims to help children reach their maximum potential by providing mothers with adequate food and nutritional resources. In Nicaragua, caregivers are provided with nutritional training to equip them with proper skills for caring for their children. Pregnant mothers (direct beneficiaries=2,000) and children (DB=40,900) are provided with vitamin supplements, as well as growth monitoring (DB=2,800), deworming medications (DB=37,000), and rehabilitation for malnourished children.

Many major causes of death in children can easily be prevented by implementing simple sanitation improvements. By promoting WASH practices and other healthy behaviors with children (DB=2,600) and installing clean water sources and latrines, Feed the Children provides children and their families with clean environments conducive to healthy living. For residents who suffer from illnesses, Feed the Children also provides health screenings and finances healthcare for those who are unable to afford it.

Education improves economic, health and overall well-being outcomes over the lifetime of a child. Thus, every additional day a child spends in school is valuable. Feed the Children encourages school attendance to parents by promoting school registration and the benefits of attending school, as well as encouraging participation in PTAs, because parental support is essential for the success of their children. Physical barriers can inhibit attendance, too, so children are provided with daily school meals (DB=3,400), school supplies (DB=2,400), TOMS shoes, and deworming medication (DB=2,200) so that lack of proper materials or poor health does not prevent children from reaching their educational potential.

In Nicaragua, livelihoods are improved when residents are able to develop new skill sets that increase their economic potential. Feed the Children assists communities with establishing community or school gardens so that childhood nutrition improves and villages are able to generate sustainable sources of revenue. Small livestock are promoted as sources of sustainable income as well. Similarly, bakeries are established in communities so women can gain commercial and sales skills to improve the livelihood of their families.</narrative>
