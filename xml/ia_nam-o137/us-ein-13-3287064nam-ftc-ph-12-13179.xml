   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Early-childhood care can prevent nutritional stunting, as well as numerous other health problems. By supporting mothers by providing them with resources to raise healthy children, Feed the Children hopes to increase childhood-development outcomes in the Philippines. Some of these projects include training mothers in childhood nutrition through Feed the Children&#x2019;s Care Groups (direct beneficiaries=1,300), which involve a group of mothers who are educated on nutrition every other week. The group mothers then disperse and share their new knowledge with their respective neighbor groups.This system utilizes current social structures and encourages knowledge sharing and behavior change in communities. In addition, Feed the Children provides vitamin (DB=1,200) and iron supplements (DB=8,900) to pregnant and lactating mothers, and deworming medication (DB=364,100), vitamin A (DB=395,000) and food supplements for children. In addition, childhood growth monitoring, and malnutrition rehabilitation (DB=43,200) provide a support system for mothers.

When sources of clean water and proper sanitation are absent from communities, illness and disease can easily harm childhood well-being. In the Philippines, installing clean water sources in schools (DB=3,800), as well as clean water sources and latrines in villages (DB=1,400), helps improve health and sanitation conditions for children and their families. Promoting healthy practices to caregivers through Feed the Children&#x2019;s Care Groups also helps ensure children are raised in safe and healthy homes (DB=1,300).

School attendance and participation improve livelihood outcomes for children. Engaged and informed parents are key to foster a child&#x2019;s educational achievement, so Feed the Children encourages the creation of PTAs in communities and promotes the benefits of school registration and attendance. To prevent physical conditions from hampering school attendance, children are provided with daily school meals (DB=1,400), school supplies (DB=13,600), deworming medication (DB=701,800) and TOMS shoes. For children who need more educational support, literacy training helps improve their school performance.

When caregivers have the skills, knowledge and resources they need to feed and care for their children, communities can become more self-reliant and stable. Feed the Children encourages this through small livestock provision and homestead gardens (DB=1,500), which both improve nutrition for families and also become sustainable sources of income. Similarly, village savings and loans (VSLs) groups are developed within communities. These groups are comprised of women and men within a community who create a system to develop savings and borrow money from each other to invest in livelihood improving activities (DB=1,500). These groups are self-managed, which promotes financial literacy and stability. To instill financial skills in children, Child-Managed Savings Associations are formed. By promoting practices of savings and investment in these children, they will grow up with knowledge of smart financial practices.

Natural disasters frequently affect the Philippines. These events can prevent communities from participating in routine activities such as school attendance or travel because of destroyed infrastructure. Through the provision of emergency meals (DB=25,000) and infrastructure repair and reconstruction (DB=8,000), Feed the Children helps communities return to normal activities so they are not without income or educational opportunities.

When gender equity is taught and promoted in communities, mothers are able to expand their confidence in participating in livelihood-improving activities and utilizing resources that generate income for their households, which improves the health and stability of their children and families.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Feed the Children&#x2019;s child-focused community-development (CFCD) program approach includes four cornerstone pillars: Food &amp;amp; Nutrition, Health &amp;amp; Water, Education, and Livelihoods. We work to transform lives by improving the food &amp;amp; nutrition security of mothers and children, and more specifically to reduce malnutrition and poverty. This happens when parents have the skills they need to raise well nourished and thriving children, when communities are clean and keep children healthy, when children get the education they need to grow up to have good jobs and to raise healthy children themselves, and when parents have the skills and resources they need to feed their families.</narrative>
