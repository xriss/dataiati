   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Feed the Children&#x2019;s child-focused community-development (CFCD) program approach includes four cornerstone pillars: Food &amp;amp; Nutrition, Health &amp;amp; Water, Education, and Livelihoods. We work to transform lives by improving the food &amp;amp; nutrition security of mothers and children, and more specifically to reduce malnutrition and poverty. This happens when parents have the skills they need to raise well nourished and thriving children, when communities are clean and keep children healthy, when children get the education they need to grow up to have good jobs and to raise healthy children themselves, and when parents have the skills and resources they need to feed their families.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Inadequate nutrition deeply affects development in children, especially from conception to their second birthday. To improve development outcomes in children in Tanzania, Feed the Children trains mothers in nutrition so they can gain new skills in ensuring their children are healthy (direct beneficiaries= 11,200).

Many common diseases are preventable through proper sanitation, clean water usage and behavior change. By promoting WASH behaviors with children (DB=12,900), training mothers on healthy practices, and installing school latrines (DB=1,300), communities are equipped to maintain clean environments for their children. These children are then able to attend school more often by avoiding common diseases.

Educational attainment is crucial to laying a foundation for lifelong learning and success, so Feed the Children focuses its efforts to encourage and increase school attendance in children of all ages. Often, short-term hunger inhibits a child&#x2019;s attentiveness or ability to attend school, so Feed the Children provides daily meals to primary school students to decrease barriers for educational success (DB=10,600). Similarly, lack of materials can prevent children from reaching their full potential, so students are provided with school supplies (DB=6,400) and TOMS shoes. Additionally, by aiding in rebuilding and refurbishing classrooms, children are able to attend school in an environment conducive to learning. 

Children&#x2019;s livelihoods are improved when their families are economically sufficient and financially literate. Through the development of school and community gardens, families are able to engage in economically sustainable practices that improve the food security and self-sufficiency of their families (DB=10,200). In addition, Village Savings and Loans (VSL) groups promote financial literacy and freedom within a community. VSL groups are comprised of women and men within a community who commit to contributing savings to the group. Members can then petition for a loan from the group for the use of improving their livelihoods. These VSL groups are moderated internally and allow communities to develop financial management skills that improve the economic well-being of families</narrative>
