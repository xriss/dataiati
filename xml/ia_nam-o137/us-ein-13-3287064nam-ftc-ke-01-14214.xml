   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Feed the Children&#x2019;s four-pillar approach to community development does more than provide food - it teaches and empowers children, parents &amp;amp; care-providers and their communities to reverse malnutrition and defeat hunger. The four pillars of our child-focused community development program are Food &amp;amp; Nutrition, Health &amp;amp; Water, Education, and Livelihoods.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">&#x25CF; The Abandoned Baby Center rescues at-risk, abandoned babies and utilizes child-care givers, nurses, social workers, therapists, and early-learning teachers to rehabilitate and develop infants through two years of age. In some circumstances, a vulnerable family with a sick or malnourished baby can request that their baby is admitted temporarily into the Center in order to receive proper care until the baby&#x2019;s health improves. Simultaneously, the social work department of the Center works with the parents/guardians to improve the living conditions of the family when the baby returns to its home. The children in the Center are either adopted into new families, reunited with their own families, or graduate into the Dagoretti Children&#x2019;s Center (DCC) when they reach the age of 5. (Direct Beneficiaries = 67) 



&#x25CF; The DCC provides full residential care both to children transitioned from the Abandoned Baby Center and to children with disabilities. The care provided includes physiotherapy, occupational therapy, orthopedic services, special-needs education, nursing, medical and nutritional care, and family support for children admitted to the DCC and to children living with their families through community-based rehabilitation project activities. There is also an integrated, public, special-education school on the DCC compound, run by the Kenyan government, to reach children with special needs. Most of the children who attend school here return to their families, who have received training by medical and therapy staff on care for their special-needs child at home on the weekends and holidays. The DCC supports children through tertiary education and teaches self-reliance via vocational training after the students have graduated from the program and reintegrated into the community. Periodic follow-ups post-graduation from the program ensure the well-being of the child in his or her home. (DB = 42) 



&#x25CF; The Hardy Boys Home is for those few boys who have aged out of the DCC but still require care and protection. These boys do not have known families and have complex special needs like severe mental and physical disabilities. They are provided living arrangements, but are encouraged to begin learning self-reliance and responsibility by caring for their house and garden as they are able. (DB = 9)



&#x25CF; The Community-Based Rehabilitation Services project activities provide thorough care to special-needs children living with their families. The children living with disabilities and developmental delays have access to free occupational therapy, physiotherapy, and orthopedic services. The projects also provide assistive devices such as wheelchairs, crutches, calipers, and special seating aids, along with maintenance and repairs of those devices. In terms of capacity-building activities, disability community awareness and sensitization forums are formed, contributions towards the International Day for Persons with Disabilities are pursued, and support groups for caregivers are offered with efforts in prognosis and prevention of the various disabilities. The project also assists very needy children from the community to undergo corrective surgeries to help correct the anomalies and live a decent and independent life possible through partnerships with local hospitals such as African Inland Church (AIC) Kijabe Hospital.
