These areas are prioritized as having the highest number of children in need of protection assistance. Hirat and Kandahar are the bordering provinces where hundreds of individuals including tens of Unaccompanied and Separated Children (UASC) crossed the border to neighboring countries of Iran and Pakistan. Kabul has the highest level of street working children and UASC while Urozgan is amongst the provinces with highest level of out of school children who are at risk of child protection.
The project promotes the protection and wellbeing of the vulnerable children through- 1. Provision of case management and case referral services to total of 2002 individuals (702 girls, 1300 boys), 2. provision of specialized MHPSS services  to a total of 5018 individuals (1560 girls, 1768 boys, 910 women and 780 men), 3. Increase awareness of 7649 individuals on child rights, case management and referral mechanism, illegal migration, child protection risks including child labor and child marriage, and PSEA, 4. Provision of protection kits to the children who are at risk of separation from care givers due to financial and economic problems faced by the care givers a total of 4050 children will be supported to prevent separation issues, 5 supporting over 702 UASC through provision of alternate care, family tracing, and reunification services and 6. Strengthening the community based child protection mechanism through establishment of 78 Child Protection Committees (CBPCs) and building the capacity of their  members on child protection case management and referral mechanism. Committee members also will be taught about children&#x2019;s right to give feedback and make complaints to CIC about its programming and staff, and to get information on humanitarian assistance they might be eligible for.
The project will mainstream gender and protection across the project cycle, which includes identification of different needs boys, girls, men and women and designing appropriate activities, and also identification and analysis of all the protection risks and designing appropriate mitigation measures to mitigate the risk to the project participants. The project will recruit appropriate number of female staff to safely access women and girls and will monitor the impact of the action on different groups of the project participants. Accountability to affected population  would be ensured through sharing information, and providing reporting channels to the project participants for sharing any concern regarding the project and project staff with CRM focal points. All the complaints would be dealt with in an timely manner and an response would be provided with the project participants. 
The Project would be directly implemented by Children in Crisis in Urozgan and Kabul provinces where CIC has operational capacity and existing offices. However OFRD a strategic implementing partner of CIC would implement the all the activities in Kandahar and Hirat Provinces where they have existing capacity. Children in Crisis will ensure project quality through regular monitoring of the action and placing the project MampE officer at OFRD office to ensure day to day monitoring of the project activities but also coach the local partners staff on different aspects of the project implementation. As such this partnership will not only enable CIC to reach higher number of affected children but will also provide a capacity building opportunity to the local partner.

Sustainability of the action would be ensured through establishing and building the capacity of the CBPCs and supporting local partner.</narrative>
