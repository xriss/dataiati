   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Enhancing partner staffs and communities including Child Protection Networks&#x2019; capacity, to protect children and their caregivers from all forms of violence and facilitate referrals for children at risk to response services in eight districts of Farah and Badghis provinces</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">According to Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP) 2022, community disruptions, displacement, family separations are common issues in the targeted districts of Badghis and Farah province (in districts of Lash Wa Juwayn, Pur Chaman, Pusht Rod and Qala-I-Kah, and in province in districts of Ghormach, Jawand Muqur and Bala Murghab)  and hence putting children and their caregivers at high risk of protection issues including all forms of violence and notably, the province has limited child protection services for the high numbers of children in need of humanitarian support. With AHF funds, UNICEF, will reach 100,450 individuals through the following activities: 
I.	Strengthen the capacities of 450 staff of the implementing partner and community members including child protection networks, to reach 90,000 individuals including girls, boys, women, men and persons with disabilities with messages on child protection issues, including UASC, Explosive Ordinance Risk Education, gender-based violence, child marriage, Sexual Exploitation and Abuse and other forms of violence affecting children their parents and care givers in the province 
II.	UNICEF in partnership with War Child UK  will support the establishment of at least 30 community-based structures, including community-based child protection networks that will facilitate sensitization of the communities and enhance linkages with child protection action networks (CPAN) that are already established in the selected provinces and build their capacity to create awareness on child protection issues and other forms of violence among the children and their families and hence create protective environment for children and their care givers 
III.	support and establish referral pathways for 10,000 children and caregivers at risk for specialized services based on the services mapping and in adherence to the case management SOPs
. 
Furthermore, UNICEF will train the newly established community-based child protection networks (CBCPNs) on child protection risks as well as violations and will encourage communities to abandon harmful practices including child recruitment, GBV, child marriage, child sale and exploitation. The CBCPN members will also be trained to identify, report, and refer cases of violence including grave violations. It is expected to train 300 members of CBPN with at least 30 percent women. 

Also, sensitization and awareness raising on COVID-19 and other Child Protection (CP) issues in Internally Displaced Persons (IDP) settlements and host communities will be an integral part of the proposal.

UNICEF will coordinate with other sectors to conduct service mapping and ensure availability of Child protection referral pathways to facilitate safe referrals for vulnerable children and their caregivers to access the required services and 
UNICEF will continue to negotiate with de facto authority on access for the beneficiaries to access lifesaving services.</narrative>
