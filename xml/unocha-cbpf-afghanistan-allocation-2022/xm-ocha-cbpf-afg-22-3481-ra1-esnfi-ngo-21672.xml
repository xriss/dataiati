  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The 2022 HRP seeks US$ 4.4 billion to reach 22.1 million people with emergency life-saving humanitarian and protection assistance across the country. The strategic objective1 of the HRP focus on &quot; Timely, multi-sectoral, lifesaving, equitable and safe assistance is provided to crisis-affected people of all genders and diversities to reduce mortality and morbidity.&quot; The multiple challenges facing the people of Afghanistan, including La Ni&#xF1;a-induced climatic anomalies, political turnover, economic downturn, and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, are exacerbating the pre-existing needs and vulnerabilities of millions of Afghans. The humanitarian outlook for 2022 remains grim, with 24.4 million people (59 percent of the population) projected to be in urgent need of humanitarian assistance, compared to 18.4 million in 2021.

The main purpose of the 1st RA 2022 is to provide urgently needed funds for strictly prioritized life-saving humanitarian assistance in Afghanistan. According to the recently &#x2018;Whole of Afghanistan Assessments (WoA) assessment, more than 70 percent of households reported living in a significantly or partially damaged or fully destroyed shelter. Considering the high cost of shelter repairs, and the already negative net income of households, reconstruction comes at a high cost that may not be affordable for most. Afghan households must make choices between meeting basic needs and repairing their shelters. The ES-NFI cluster plans under this allocation to provide humanitarian assistance to vulnerable people cyclically affected by seasonal floods expected to occur from April to June 2022.

ORD intends to provide cash Transitional Shelter (two rooms each 39 sqm@ US$1,859/HHs) in cash for a total of 62 HHs (434 individuals) and major Shelter Repair/Upgrade in cash for 557 HHs (3,899 individuals) @US$ 550/HHs to natural disaster households in Sar-e-Pul province (Sar-e-Pul city). ORD has had a strong presence since 2018 and has delivered emergency responses in the partnership of UNHCR, UNICEF, and FAO. Currently, ORD is in partnership with UNHCR, FAO, and UNICEF and is implementing PSN, CBP, livelihood and livestock protection, and  WASH projects in the Sar-e-Pul province. With this 1st RA 2022, the response will be holistic and multi-cluster and will scale up and fill the ORD&apos;s current response gap of 62 HHs in transitional shelters and 557 HHs for shelter repair based on the ORD need assessment conducted in Feb 2022. The proposed intervention of cash for transitional shelter and shelter repair will fill the identified gap.ORD will ensure that the most vulnerable people in need are among the affected population groups prioritized for this action and that 619 HHs (4,333 individuals) following ES-NFI cluster standards for natural disaster (floods) affected households to respond to their shelter needs. 

ORD will provide this response (two-room Transitional Shelters and major Shelter Repair/Upgrade in cash due to availability and market functionality) as well as the beneficiary preference based on the ORD Need Assessment Report that is uploaded under the documents section in GMS. ORD will use the HAWALA system (FSP) for cash transfer to project beneficiaries as other means of cash transfer is difficult in the current situation, each transfer value should be based on the construction progress per household at four installments or trenches. ORD transfers money to FSP accounts and then FSP manages the transactions and cash transfers to distribution points. The project team will carry out PDMs and ORD MEAL will perform additional verification by phone. ORD will share the project participants&apos; profiles with AWAAZ Afghanistan and integrate further AAP activities, including having other communication channels for project participants to give feedback complaints to ORD and get a response.</narrative>
