   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Infectious diseases, poor maternal and neonatal health and malnutrition are causes of substantial mortality and morbidity in Afghanistan. The country is currently facing multiple outbreaks, including COVID-19, measles, Acute Watery Diarrhea (AWD), dengue fever and malaria, in the context of a fragile public health system. The overall objectives of the project are to protect our citizens through case management of COVID-19 patients, to respond and mitigate the threat posed by COVID-19  and to strengthen national health systems preparedness and capacity to respond to public health emergencies. To successfully achieve the intended objectives and target indicators of this project, SAF will offer Covid-19 Case management response through Covid-19 wards to the affected Covid-19 communities in 3 provinces Faryab (Maimana,)Samangan (Aybak) and Jawzjan (Sheberghan) with main focus on covid-19 patients. In close coordination with provincial public health Directorate and exited stakeholder such as WHO and UNICEF, we will review the Covid-19 case management and response  assessment report at the provincial level and the Covid-19 Response and management teams will be assigned to cover preventive and lifesaving treatment services for Covid-19 patients and communities. Meanwhile, the activities will be coordinated with BPHS Health Facilities at the mentioned districts. in the specified provinces With the given prioritize SAF will consider Routine surveillance of and response to COVID-19, AWD, measles and other diseases. The project management team (project officer, project assistant and finance officer based in the provincial office and one project focal point based in Kabul) will have the capability to efficiently and transparently manage the project with the help of management team of SAF at the central and provincial levels. Required IEC and health promotion materials will be distributed among the targeted population by the project staff at the service delivery points. Simultaneously, functional referral mechanisms among the CHWs-CHS-Covid-19 hospitals and nearest health facilities will be established. SAF will also formulate close coordination with authorities of the provincial hospital in the province by signing MOUs with Samangan and Faryab provincial hospitals. As part of this assignment SAF will consider the minimum gender marker code (1) within the proposed projects. SAF will ensure that gender equality and gender awareness activities are mainstreamed within the scope of project. Accordingly, the women, men, boys and girls of all ages will benefit equally from the proposed interventions. A total of 8213 individuals in the Host and IDPs communities will directly benefit from health cluster of the project. However, the 24600  beneficiaries in all 3 provinces will be benefited from the services. Covid-19 response project will provide health services including community outreach, screening, case detection, management,  referral , follow up, community awareness raising on Covid-19 patients for targeted communities. The services will consist of diagnoses, case management, laboratory services and PPEs. Each hospital will have 10 beds based on the current caseload. it is expected that World Bank may consider support to COVID-19 hospitals in the next round of Sehatmandi starting from July 2022. SAF confirms  if World Bank supports COVID-19 hospitals, in consultation with the Health Cluster, SAF will consider re-programming for the available balance. in Samagan province, since currently OPHA,s SAF partner in AHF 3rd allocation is available, Samangan province Covid-19  hospital will be operated by them as sub implementing partner through this allocation and the MoU will be developed for the implementation of covid -19 hospital  through them. Note: Based on MoPH HR manual for 10 bed covid-19 hospital staff will be recruited, if the Covid-19 cases raised for management it will be communicated with OCHA and Health Cluster for budget revision.</narrative>
