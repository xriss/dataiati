   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project will support the immediate humanitarian and child protection needs of vulnerable children affected by the earthquake in Khost (Spera district) and Paktika (Barmal, Ziruk, Nika and Giyan districts) provinces. Targeted districts are potentially affected districts by the earthquake. TACT has the experience and capacity of planning and implementation of similar projects in the targeted provinces. 
The project activities include: 
1.	Scaling up provision of PSS through  20 child friendly spaces and home based services.
2.	Identification, registration, family tracing and reunification of 250 (50% girls) unaccompanied and separated children.
3.	Expansion of Child Protection through CP-awareness raising on access to basic CP services and child protection issues including prevention of violence, abuse, exploitations, family separation and PSEA. Some 12,000 caregivers and 28,000 children are targeted for this activity. 
4.	Community mobilization for protection of children and CP-Strengthen community-based CP structures one DCPAN and 5 CPCBM in each targeted district will be strengthen through this activity.
5.	Building the capacity of CP and other Humanitarian team&apos;s (including  educators ) to provide services.
The project will provide an immediate humanitarian assistance to the child protection needs in the emergency situation of earthquake in Khost and Paktika provinces. The proposed project is planned based on the CP sub cluster&#x2019;s priority activities to address the disaster in these provinces. The targeted districts are the affected districts based on the UNOCHA assessments and situation reports. According to these reports, the child protection situation is critical in these locations lots of children have lost their families and caregivers, the access to health, education, and WASH services are not sufficient, and the psychosocial situation of children is damaged due to trauma caused by the earthquake. 
 TACT is an active member of the protection cluster and child protection sub cluster, and has good coordination with the active organizations in the context of child protection. TACT has functional field offices and experience of work in the targeted provinces. TACT will coordinates the project activities with the de-facto authorities, community elders, and other active actors in the field. The community participation in all phases of the project design and implementation is considered. 
TACT responsible staff for monitoring will conduct scheduled field visits to check that the process and procedures undertaken by the implementing team is appropriate and that fund utilization is in line with the progress made as well as to support counterparts and ensure quality implementation. In addition, regular internal as well as external audits are carried out to ensure procedures are followed. Official narrative progress, final reports and other reporting requirement for the project will be submitted as required and associated with financial reports.</narrative>
