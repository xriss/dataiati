   <narrative xml:lang="EN">After more than forty years of conflict and natural disasters, it is estimated that 24.4 million of people are in humanitarian need in Afghanistan, according to the Humanitarian Response Plan. Since 2012, there have been more than 5,8 million internally displaced in the country, who usually settled in Informal Settlements in peripheries of cities. In 2021 alone, 1,3 million people were newly displaced, 700,000 of them because of the conflict. Since the 15th of August 2021 and the change of regime, the fighting has decreased and many displaced families have been able to go home. However, the economic situation combined with natural disasters, food insecurity and the raise in communal violence is expected to increase internal displacement as highlighted in the Cluster Spring Priorities. 

There is a significant knowledge gap in Afghanistan regarding Informal settlements (ISETs). The sites as well as the needs of the population living there are still largely misunderstood which lead to the absence of a coordinated humanitarian approach to assist these communities. Through this intervention, ACTED will support the communities living in ISETs in Mazar-e-Sharif and Jalalabad (30,000 individuals), through the establishment of mobile Camp Coordination and Camp Management (CCCM) teams under output 1.1. In support to ACTED, the wider CCCM Working Group partners in Afghanistan, and to inform better local-level coordination, REACH will build upon best practices and lessons learned from previous Area-Based Assessments and Approaches (ABAs) in Afghanistan. This will include development of an ABA toolkit for mapping and profiling ISETs and their surrounding areas, to ensure interventions are led by a robust-evidence base, and all necessary information to guide programming and response planning is available. To maximize sustainability of this approach, REACH will provide support and capacity building to partners in the implementation of such assessments in each area of intervention, ranging from technical oversight, to operationalizing data collection, dependent upon need. As part of its integrated CCCM mobile intervention, ACTED will set up a monitoring system to monitor both IDP movements and service delivery. Finally, ACTED will build the capacity of existing community governance structures and enhance community engagement and information access in the targeted sites.
 
Under output 1.2 ACTED will provide protection-oriented services. ACTED will monitor and address risks and vulnerabilities of the population through site risk amp safety audits, conduct community awareness sessions on Protection responses and Gender Based Violence and implement tailored community-led site improvement projects. Through these community led site improvements, ACTED will also seek to include community workers (approximatively 20 participants per sites) to ensure proper appropriation. Finally, ACTED will provide protection services to IDPs through referrals as well as Emergency Cash for at least 250 individuals facing specific risks or protection situations/shocks, to mitigate, reduce or prevent said shocks, and meet individual short-term needs. 

ACTED will sign a Memorandum of Understanding with IMPACT initiatives (REACH), a swiss based organization, under a framework agreement between Paris and Geneva.</narrative>
