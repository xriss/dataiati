  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Food Security amp Agriculture (FSAC) reflected in 1st Reserve Allocation 2022, food consumption declined significantly throughout the country. The proportion of households falling into the &#x201C;poor&#x201D; category of the Food consumption score (FCS) nearly tripled from 2020 (14 per cent) to 2021 (close to 40 per cent) across all population groups. The food crisis severity has been compounded by the economic sanctions placed on Afghanistan following the change in government in August 2021. 
The report further suggests, Rural areas, and particularly farming and livestock rearing households, have been hard-hit by the 2020-21 drought, the worst in 27 years. The drought is estimated to have caused a deficit of up to 3 million Metric Tons of wheat in the country and reduced agricultural labor opportunities by up to 60 per cent. Even after harvest, 57 per cent of households assessed in in the 2021 Seasonal Food Security Assessment (SFSA) reported not having food reserves lasting three months. 
Findings from WoAA indicate that 46% of displaced households were found to have a &#x2018;poor&#x2019; Food Consumption Score (FCS) compared to non-displaced (36%). Additionally, 45% of the assessed households fell in the &#x2018;emergency&#x2019; category of Livelihood Coping Strategy Index (LCSI). This figure was higher in displaced households (51%) compared to non-displaced households (44%). Among those relying on coping strategies, about 6% reported marrying their daughters earlier than intended. Moreover, 45% of the assessed households were in &#x2018;high&#x2019; category of the reduced Coping Strategy Index (rCSI). 
Aligned with 1st Reserve Allocation 2022 strategic priorities for FSAC, this project responds 10,456 individuals in Khulm amp Charkent districts of Balkh province, who are vulnerable households in IPC Phase 4 locations. The project will target most vulnerable HHs facing hunger crisis that has been exacerbated by drought, conflict, and impact of COVID-19, including IDPs and host communities, with the main target based on the following vulnerability criteria: crises affected vulnerable IDP population facing challenges to access humanitarian services, targeting female headed HHs, Pregnant and lactating women, people living with disability, elderly headed HH, child headed HHs, households excessive number of female children or family with more than 7 members with no or below average income, households relying only on pleading or zakat or relying on irregular casual labor by one family member.  

CARE will respond to their needs through monthly cash for food assistance amounting USD 360 per HHs to cover 75% of Minimum food basket for a total duration of six months calculated based on Afghanistan Cash amp Voucher Working Group (CVWG) Minimum Expenditure Basket (MEB) and Setting the Transfer Value - this can be translated into the Afghani equivalent at the prevailing exchange rate. Cash-for-food to be distributed under this project, will help save lives by alleviating suffering as result the liquidity, savings, and credit constraints of rural beneficiaries. CARE will mobilize beneficiaries for cash transfer by organize meetings to explain what the project is all about.CARE will ensure distribution sites are within a reasonable radius within the community hence the beneficiaries will not have to walk long distance. In addition, CARE will ensure the distribution sites have adequate space to allow enough spacing between beneficiaries hence preventing possibilities of COVID-19 infection.   
CARE has a long presence in all the proposed districts in Balkh, where we are currently providing health, and psychosocial and nutrition services to the disaster affected populations, targeting IDPs and other vulnerable groups. In Balkh, CARE has presence for more than a decade and has developed a very strong community trust and thus the access will not be a challenge for implementation. CARE conducted extensive coordination exercise with FSAC, local authority&#x2019;s s and local communities.</narrative>
