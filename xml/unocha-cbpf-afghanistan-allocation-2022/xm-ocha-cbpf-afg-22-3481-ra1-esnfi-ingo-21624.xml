   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Emergency transitional and shelter repair assistance in Samangan</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Vulnerable populations in Samangan face a complex set of needs. Drought, political instability, and Covid-19 have led to widespread illness and mortality and starkly reduced income opportunities in these provinces, depleting households&#x2019; productive assets and reducing their capacity to cope with shocks. In addition to this, many of Samangan&#x2019;s communities are prone to spring flooding which destroys households&#x2019; shelter and assets, and leave them displaced and vulnerable to further hazards. In consultation with the ESNFI and based on an analysis of the past four years of flooding data, Afghanaid proposes to provide crucial shelter assistance to an estimated 554 vulnerable households whose shelter being damaged by flooding or other crises in Aybak, Hazrat-e-Sultan, Feroz Nakhchir, Khuram wa Sarbagh, and Ruy-e-Duab districts all of which are particularly flood-prone and are noted by the ESNFI cluster as priority locations for this allocation. The final locations will be determined based on a needs assessment in consultation with the cluster.

According to ESNFI cluster&#x2019;s analysis, Afghanaid proposes four different shelter assistance packages, in the form of cash-for-shelter, tailored to the needs of different groups:
First, transitional shelter assistance to Category A populations in two provisions A1) an amount of $1472 per household for an estimated 121 small households (HH with 7 or less members), and A2) an amount of $1859 per household for an estimated 13 large households (HH with more than 7 members), whose shelter has been completely damaged and is uninhabitable.
Second (Category B), major repairs and upgrades assistance of $550 per household for an estimated 362 households whose shelter has been severely damaged, but remains inhabitable and
Third (Category C), minor repairs assistance of $330 for an estimated 58 households whose shelter has suffered only minor damage to windows, doors and walls etc.

The assistance amounts will vary based on participants&apos; exact needs. Afghanaid proposes cash as the modality for the assistance to address the shelter needs of each vulnerable households, pending a thorough market assessment to be conducted at the outset of the project. The cash assistance will be complemented with technical sessions and continued coaching for participants throughout the repair and construction works. Where prices of labor and key materials increase significantly, Afghanaid may facilitate procurement from other markets, or pivot to in-kind assistance provision.

Afghanaid will in principle work with an established Saraf (Hawala) in all target areas to distribute the cash from central distribution points. However, if banking system restored and worked well, Afghanaid would prefer the banking system, otherwise, Hawala will be the payment mechanism.
During and after the floods hit, Afghanaid will conduct assessment in the area and form participant selection/distribution committees with local community representatives and Afghanaid staff. Participants will be selected using ESNFI cluster vulnerability criteria to ensure that households in most acute need are targeted.
Further, Afghanaid will also coordinate the project at the provincial level, conduct community mobilization and sensitization at the district levels, and commission the participants&#x2019; assessment, selection and verification in close consultation with the relevant provincial and districts local authorities.
The assistance tranches and percent of value will be set based on completion of certain stages of shelter works such as foundation, roofing and painting etc., in consultation with communities and the cash will be delivered on time to achieve the shelter and result. 

Afghanaid is well placed to implement this project, with over 20 years of continues presence in Samangan, has extensive humanitarian programming experience. Afghanaid has robust experience in shelter construction programming in Samangan and other locations too.</narrative>
