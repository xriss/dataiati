   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Survey and Clearance of High Priority Legacy Hazards and Provision of EORE in Baghlan Province</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Under this project DAFA will recruit and deploy  4 Demining Teams, 1 Survey/EOD Team and 2 EORE Teams to address a total area consisting 656,428 sqm legacy Anti-Personnel (AP) landmines contaminated areas planned in Baghlan province for clearance with 6,765 direct beneficiaries identified in the area where we intend to consider 20,880 individuals for delivery of Explosive Ordnance Risk Education (EORE) in the planned, impacted, conflicted communities including the IDPs to be covered in the EORE sessions in close coordination of UNMAS/HMACCA regional office in northeast region. DAFA will address the high priority hazards under this project, as per its accredited mine/ERW clearance SOPs and release clear/hand over the land as cleared/safe to the communities for their immediate productive use.
This proposed project aims to reduce landmines and ERW related deaths and disabilities enhancing socio-economic situation of the communities by: 
Releasing contaminated land using methods such as NTS, TS and Clearance,
Raising awareness regarding Mine/ERW risks among 20,880 individuals in impacted and conflicted communities,
Training community volunteers to continue spreading risk awareness across other communities during project and in future (when/where needed),
Collecting Victim Data,
Marking
Response to Spot/ERW tasks when assigned
Clearance of the anti-personnel (AP) hazards will allow and enable the relevant communities around to productively use the land for social, economic and rehabilitation purposes and it will pave the way for the development projects to come into effect.
The clearance of landmines hazards will include: 
 Non-technical Survey (NTS): The NTS will ensure new hazards are identified through the standard NTS procedure and reported/recorded in order to be addressed in line with the prioritization system. Besides, NTS of the existing known hazards will help to identify the real boundaries of the hazards and reduce the no-risk sqms within the polygon. DAFA will develop and submit the fresh NTS reports to UN-HMACCA regional office in northeast regions for verification.
 Technical Survey (TS): DAFA will conduct TS in the planned AP hazards in order to identify, mark, and map EO areas. The previously marked minefields are re-surveyed in order to refresh the markings, establish the base line, access line, preparing the clearance plan, reduce the area of minefield and declare them free of Mine/ERW. DAFA will develop and submit the TS survey reports to UN-HMACCA regional office in northeast regions for verification. 
 Clearance of Anit-personnel hazards: DAFA has decades of experience in clearance of hazards (including AP) across the country. Under this project we will deploy the most experienced and qualified personnel to address the hazards and release the tasks as hazards free and safe for the immediate use of communities. 
 Explosive Ordnance Risk Education (EORE): DAFA couple teams will conduct EORE sessions in planned impacted and conflicted communities in consultation with the UN ROs and both tasked and ad hoc (as advised). The EORE teams will reach the vulnerable community people including women, girls, boys and men to help prevent mine/ERW accidents. Female EORE trainer will mainly focus to reach the community women and girls and provide them risk awareness in order for them to remain safe and keep their children safe from the danger of mine/ERW in their surroundings.
Implementation of this demining/EORE project promises facilitation of enhanced yield of communities&#x2019; cultivation and traditional agribusiness Besides, this project will facilitate the residents to grow their agri-business and plant the pistachio trees, wheat, flax seeds (source of oil production), water melon, melon, barley and will pave the way for other reconstruction activities in the project areas and as well as the clear area will be utilized for firewood collecting and herding their animals</narrative>
