   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Shelter assistance to households affected by flooding in Hilmand Province.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In line with ES-NFI cluster plans to provide humanitarian assistance to vulnerable people cyclically affected by seasonal floods expected to occur from April to June 2022, activities prioritized in this action include provision of transitional shelter support and shelter upgrade/repair to households affected by flash floods and flooding in Hilmand. The ESNFI cluster rapid assessment mechanism has identified 512 locations (villages) in 121 districts across the 34 Provinces in need of priority shelter response due to flooding including Hilmand. 
In Hilmand, 189 HHs will receive transitional Shelter support and 167 HHs will receive shelter repair/upgrade support. Thus, in Naw-e-Barakzay district, transitional shelter construction support will be provided to 189 HHs affected by floods and shelter repair/upgrade will be provided to 167 households in need of major shelter repairs due to floods. 
For transitional shelter, the cash grant is $1,879 for large family sized shelter &#x2013; which will go directly to project recipients. For repairs and/or upgrade, a conditional cash-for-shelter repair support will be delivered allowing target populations to repair damaged shelters - USD 330 for minor damage and maximum transfer value of USD 550 for severe damage. 5% of the cash transfer amount will be paid to the MSP. This cash assistance will cover labour and purchase of material and will be paid in two instalments. The first instalment will be 63%. The first phase of repair works should be completed in six weeks. The 2nd Instalment will be 37% and all works should be completed within 10 weeks. UNHCR delivers cash assistance through a money service provider (MSP). The term MSP refers to a registered Hawala regulated by the Central Bank. UNHCR does not use the term &#x201C;Hawala&#x201D; for this specific type of service provider as opposed to other FSPs which is broader and includes banks, MNOs, Post Office, remittance companies.
The modality for this shelter assistance is unrestricted cash grants while maintaining conditions outlined in this text. This modality has proved suitable and effective since 2019 with households spending the cash grant on intended construction materials/labour as outlined in the BOQs. Site visits, monitoring, engagement with recipients and PDM exercises continue to support this implementation modality as it affords recipients the choice of when and where to purchase construction materials (from local markets) that meet the required quantity and quality specifications. In Hilmand, UNHCR partner ACHRO will monitor the quality of shelter construction undertaken by persons of concern and provide the necessary technical support. UNHCR will undertake overall project oversight through its programme and shelter experts. For its partners UNHCR has provided budget lines covering project support costs, as the Agency does not share overall PSC percentage with partners. To avoid overlapping and double distribution, since the Partner ORD is receiving funds for similar activities, UNHCR will coordinate with the partner and agree on the regions for implementation.</narrative>
