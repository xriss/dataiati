  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">CAHPO will provide emergency assistance according to the overall objective of the Shelter Cluster to preserve the immediate safety and wellbeing of people and improve their living standards. Also, as per the Cluster Strategic priorities, the transitional shelter construction, upgrade/repair response together with a multi-sectoral necessary sanitation and hygiene improvement will be implemented and considered to assist the poorest of the poor. The intervention will focus to meet the urgent humanitarian needs of the vulnerable populations as well as those who return back and seeking to receive shelter assistance in the targeted area.

According to the sphere standard, CAHPO will assist the beneficiaries with the in-kind distribution of shelter materials for the transitional one-room shelter, repair/upgrade of the existing shelters to improve the living standards of 715 families to ensure safer and more dignified living conditions in Kabul province. CAHPO studied the beneficiaries&#x2019; situation and it is justifiable for in-kind assistance, see Annex 09. Priority will be given to disabled and women- or child-headed households. They will be assisted according to their needs identified during the rapid assessment and selection of beneficiaries. The in-kind shelter materials will be distributed by the technical engineers of safe shelters and to be protected from environmental hazards. The target population is 5005 individuals (850 men, 890 women, 1620 boys, and 1645) affected by unwanted displacement, COVID-19 imposed unemployment, drought (due to the reduction of pasture selling their animals), and many other multiple factors. Most of these people are very poor that including vulnerable women-headed, child-headed, people with disability, the elderly, and other vulnerable groups. Because of cheaper land for housing available in this area the conflict-affected people displaced from their original place settled in this new location, also there are returnees from Pakistan and Iran. The prolonged conflict in the country and unemployment condition affected these people, who lack resources to repair/upgrade their houses and sanitation.

CAHPO adheres to CHS, shares AWAAZ # and the monitoring staff will collect the phone numbers of the beneficiaries to contact them for any issues and support for their shelter construction/upgrade and receive shelter materials. Beneficiaries should have NIDs or other certifications to check their identity correctly. Beneficiaries who have no NID will distribute verification cards by BSC. Information will be monitored frequently that will not affect by assumption and shared with stakeholders regarding the required items they receive. CAHPO team has the experience to conduct awareness training on COVID-19 as per WHO guide, protection amp GBV mainstreaming accepted level training, all the training will be provided separately for male/female close to the houses. Moreover, the latrine construction will be encouraging as part of the shelter and basic hygienic awareness to all the targeted beneficiaries, this has been communicated with WASH Cluster at the regional and national levels.

Coordination of the proposed activities will take place with relevant ESNFI and AHF partners during the proposal development and implementation to harmonize the intervention and avoid duplication of services. The line department will also be informed during different stages and implementation of the activities. As mentioned in the HRP, shelter activities will be undertaken in coordination with the Government, incorporating all the relevant documents, safeguarded by evidence of legal and/or customary ownership and occupancy. Ownership will be asked to make it available as one of the preconditions for selection.</narrative>
