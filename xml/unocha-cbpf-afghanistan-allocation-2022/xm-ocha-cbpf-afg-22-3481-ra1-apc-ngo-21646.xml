   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Survey of newly explosive ordinance contaminated areas, removal of spot ERW and improvised mines and Provision of EORE to the affected people for raising their awareness</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Through mine action surveys and spot ERW removal, the lives and limbs of innocent civilians and animals will be saved. In addition, the communities within the targeted provinces will also be provided with behavior-changing awareness through explosive ordnance risk education (EORE) using the approved social and behavior change communication model and approved materials. EORE will be provided by both survey and QR teams in the impacted communities - the teams will have adequate time to deliver EORE.

Through this proposed project, MCPA will identify marginalized groups and tend to their needs under the scope of this project &#x2013; EO survivors (disabled) will be identified using the approved forms and data will be collected and updated on persons with disabilities and the any VA service they might have received. MCPA will also take this opportunity to coordinate with VA organizations for referrals where required.

Under this project, MCPA will deploy 10x Survey teams and 2x QR teams to conduct village-by-village survey/EOD in all districts of Maydan Wardak, Logar, and Daikundi Provinces. 
Team Structure Survey:1x team leader, 1x surveyor/medic, 1x driver, and 1x guard. 
Team Structure QRT: 1x team leader, 1x assistant/medic team leader, 2x deminer, 1x driver, and 1x guard. 
MCPA will also provide employment opportunities to local community members as guards, cooks, and cleaners over the course of this project. 

The survey/EOD teams will target 5,000 communities (190 impacted communities and 4,810 un-surveyed communities. The known recorded hazards areas in impacted communities are 446 hazards with an area of 92,447,023 Sq. m that will be resurveyed to either confirm or deny the suspicion of EOs. The result of the re-survey will be hazard confirmed, hazard cancellation, and a significant decrease or increase in the size of the recorded hazard areas.

The survey teams will conduct NTS, re-survey, marking, report spot ERW to QRTs for destruction, EORE, and civilian casualties data collection.
The QRTs will conduct all tasks of surveys teams and in addition conduct spot ERW destruction, small task clearance, respond to hotline/Awaaz callouts, and respond to local and humanitarian partners requests.

The main objective of this proposed project is to conduct,
  
1.	Non-Technical Survey (new survey, re-survey, confirmation, and cancellations) as per AMAS,
2.	Destruction of Spot ERW as per the standard.
3.	Collection of accurate information on mine/ERW/AIM contamination in the planned districts
4.	Marking of hazardous areas identified during the survey to deter civilian entrance and reduce the risk of accidents.
5.     Collection of information on EO survivors/persons with disability and use referrals to VA actors where required.
5.	EORE to at-risk populations in the planned districts 

Upon completion of this proposed project, there will be a clear understanding of the scope of contamination in all districts within the three identified provinces, up-to-date data will be available on EO survivors/EO victims/Person with disability, the vulnerable population will be aware of the risks posed by EOs and will adopt safe behaviors to avoid EO accidents. Doing so will lead to a reduction in EO accidents the total beneficiary population is as follows,

* 335,053 Host Communities
* 10,000 IDPs
* 20,000 Returnees
* 15,000 EORE beneficiaries
* 1,501 PwDs

The number of beneficiaries has been taken from the Information Management System for Mine Action which only include communities already impacted. The number is, therefore, higher than proposed as it encompasses all affected populations in target regions</narrative>
