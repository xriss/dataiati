   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Emergency Primary Health Care Services, COVID-19 Response and Physiotherapy services for externally displaced population in 4 districts in Khost Province.</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Most of the North Waziristan refugees in Khost province are settled in the Gulan Camp, Gurbuz, while others are settled in smaller settlements in Matun, Spera and Tani districts where they live with host communities. 
The affected people have limited or no access to BPHS health services, partly because many of the refugees lack registration documents and partly because the distance from the camp to BPHS facilities is too large. The health services provided in the camps are only accessible services

The currently provided health services in the above-mentioned project locations fall outside the regular, government, provided health services. This means that the CHC and Mobile Health Teams do not receive any human resources, supplies or other support through the government. 
The services are funded through Johanniter Internal Assistance&#x2019;s (JIA) unrestricted resources but this funding will end on 31 May 2022

The proposed project aims to provide the continuation of direct access to primary healthcare services and thus further reducing avoidable mortality and morbidity. The services will be available to a population of 45,100 people (refugees and host communities) in the above mentioned 4 districts through a Comprehensive Health Centre and 3 Mobile Health Teams. Approximately 38,670 people will have access to life-saving health services.
Although this Reserve Allocation has a maximum duration of 6 months, it was agreed with the health cluster that the project will run till the end of 2023

The proposed project contributes to the Humanitarian Response Plan&#x2019;s strategic objectives 1: Timely, multi-sectoral, life-saving, equitable and safe assistance is provided to crisis- affected people of all genders and diversities to reduce mortality and morbidity and strategic objective 3: Vulnerable people of all gender and diversities are supported to build their resilience and live their lives in dignity.  

Due to the (unhygienic) living conditions in the settlements there is a higher risk of disease outbreaks in the camps (COVID-19, Measles, AWD, water-borne infections and vector-borne diseases e.g. dengue). The health facilities are the first line defence in prevention, detecting and contingency of disease outbreaks and through the proposed project this defence can be continued.

The proposed services that will be provided address some of the key concerns mentioned in the allocation strategy and will remain readily accessible for the vulnerable population.
 Primary healthcare services (according BPHS standard), 
 Integrated nutrition services, 
 Emergency reproductive, maternal and child health services 
 Mental healthcare and psychosocial support, 
 Physical therapy (in CHC only). 
 COVID-19 screening, contact tracing, hygiene education, and community awareness raising on the prevention of communicable diseases through RCCE
 Referral to higher level health facilities
 Ambulance service.

In Gulan is a fully functioning CHC with established referral services to higher level facilities. 
Through Mobile Health Teams the emergency medical services will be provided to the refugees in the settlements (and host communities) in Matun, Spera and Tani districts.
Additionally, physical therapy services will be provided at the CHC in Gulan to project participants who live with physical disabilities. The service in CHC Gulan camp will also be open to project participants from the other 3 locations.
The project will be carried out by JIA and HADAAF. JIA will provide technical and logistical (procurement0 expertise and support .

The project aspires to avoid causing harm and to prevent or minimize any unintended negative effects of the intervention that may increase the affected populations&apos; vulnerability to exploitation and psychological trauma. ide services with no discrimination. The services will be available free of charges to all genders and age groups and to people with disabilities or additional needs</narrative>
