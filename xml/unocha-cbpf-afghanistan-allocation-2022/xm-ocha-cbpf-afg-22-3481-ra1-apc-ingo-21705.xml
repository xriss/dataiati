   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Afghanistan is currently facing the worst humanitarian crisis in the world. With 55% of the population in need of humanitarian assistance in 2022. According to a Global Citizen report, Afghanistan is the worst place in the world to be a woman. As per HRP 2022. The 2021 WoA Assessment shows that women had or perceived themselves to have less access to public spaces and services than men, with 31 per cent of female household members (interviewed across 16 provinces) reporting that at least one area in their settlement was unsafe for women and girls. Twenty-four per cent of the assessed households also reported that markets were unsafe for women and girls. Findings from a perception survey conducted in October 2021 confirm that there had been newly established rules and public announcements regarding the restriction of women&#x2019;s movement outside the home without male accompaniment (mahram) since August 2021. Lack or restricted freedom of movement will necessarily affect women and girls&apos; access to services in a drastic way. This climate of fear, uncertainty and mobility restrictions on women will likely have a knock-on impact on women&#x2019;s mental health, their ability to work, pursue education, seek life-saving services, and to participate in public and political life. In direct response to this situation, CARE will implement this project with the aim of improving the health and protection wellbeing of women and girls in Balkh, Kabul, and Kandahar. These locations were identified as highly in need of humanitarian support through CARE&#x2019;s own needs assessments in December 2021. Additionally, these assessments recognized an ongoing lack of access to basic services, with acute gaps in access to health services, including SRH and GBV. Through this project CARE will distribute NFI (provided by IOM to CARE for distribution) and as well as dignity kits to women and girls in areas with the greatest needs, as well as organize and provide the required orientation sessions. The NFI kits will be provided by IOM to CARE upon registration. IOM will also transport the NFI kits either to the distribution point or to CARE&apos;s provincial warehouses. Through direct and indirect support, CARE will reach 750 beneficiaries throughout the 6 month duration of this project.</narrative>
