  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The AHF 1st Reserve Allocation 2022 an emergency assistance to shock affected households (IPC Phase 4) in the selected districts (Darzab and Qush Tepa) of Jawzjan. The latest Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) analysis of FSAC Cluster, shows that over 24 million in need and 22 million people (55% of the population) will face acute food insecurity (IPC Phase 3 or worse) 2022, including 8.7 million people in emergency and require immediate assistance. According to the IPC analysis, Jawzjan province is facing an emergency level of acute food insecurity. The drought conditions are driven by La Ni&#xF1;a, the current political crisis and conflict further compound the food security situation of a population which was already on the brink of a hunger crisis. Assessments of CAHPO conducted in March show that even after harvest, the majority of households do not have food reserves that would last for 3 months, they have contributed to the rapid deterioration in food insecurity. Most people in targeted areas are anticipated to be in IPC 4. Additionally, the higher food prices are negatively impacting the purchasing power of lower-income groups, across the country, reducing their access to food. Though the change of power last year and tangible reduction of conflict, the people stay displaced and many young/adults have been living in the country. As per MoRR they still have insufficient income due to several reasons (prolonged conflict in the past, COVID-19, drought, and unemployment) and impacts on livelihood activities, the majority of poor households are expected to be unable to meet all essential food needs. The combination of past conflict, drought as well as Covid-19, has led to over 50% of the population of Jawzjan being classified as IPC 3 or above by the FSAC Cluster. Based on the market assessment and Cluster preference, through the proposed project CAHPO will provide unconditional cash assistance to 1,050 households (7,350 individuals) in the Qush Tepa and Darzab districts of Jawzjan province to buy food items/commodities. Cash distribution in 6 installments each USD 60 to cover 75% of the minimum food basket chosen in consultation with FSAC Cluster. 1st installment after the beneficiary selection will be at end of 2nd month and then at end of each month the beneficiary will receive 60$ for six months. Totally each HH will receive 360 USD within six installments of cash payment.  Six installments are chosen in order to be most cost-effective and to avoid the distributions barriers. Money Service Provider (MSP) or Hawala will be contracted by CAHPO to facilitate the distribution at CAHPO offices and in consultation with beneficiaries. The usual distribution point will have proven access to work well for all beneficiaries to be able to travel easily. Because of the banking system does not exist in target districts, the Hawala that will be contracted by CAHPO to facilitate the cash distribution for food items at the distribution point will select by CAHPO in consultation with beneficiaries. The distribution will be done based on the signed lists and tokens issued to the selected beneficiaries by the Beneficiary Selection Committee (BSC) through the Hawala. The monitoring staff will collect the phone numbers of the beneficiaries to contact them for cash for food distribution. Beneficiaries should have NIDs or other certifications to check their identity correctly. Beneficiaries who have no NID will distribute verification cards by BSC. Information will be monitored frequently that will not affect by assumption and shared with stakeholders regarding the required food items they will receive. CAHPO team has the experience to conduct awareness training on Protection and COVID-19 separate for male/female, support with hygiene kits according to WHO guide. Jawzjan has a market area with some food suppliers and many Hawalas that make it easy to contract Hawalas to prepare the required cash for food items for beneficiaries.</narrative>
