    <narrative xml:lang="EN">Main results, as presented in the annual report:

High level policy advocacy engagements with local and central governments: The programme has witnessed an increase in the level of engagement as seen by the number of high level policy engagements which the programme initiated. The following selected examples show an increase in the level of engagement by CSOs. Gender Links in partnership with Women in Local Government Forum successfully lobbied the President of Zimbabwe for a 30% quota system for women representation at the local government level which was endorsed by Cabinet. BPRA on the other hand held a successful Water Campaign which petitioned the President of the Republic of Zimbabwe to declare the water crisis in Bulawayo a National Crisis. In response, the central Government availed $10 million for the rehabilitation of water infrastructure in Bulawayo. CYDT lobbied the Gwanda Town Council to adopt and institutionalise a youth participation policy.

Building rights holders civic consciousness in holding duty-bearers to account: The programme empowered rights holders through building their civic consciousness to demand transparency and accountability from duty-bearers. The target reach of the programme is is 85 660 The following achievements were reported; Projects across the programme recorded 18 268 citizens comprising of 9 620 women, 6 536 men and 2 112 youth participating in different platforms created by the programme. The platforms include Junior Councils, Action Accountability Groups (AAGs), Gender champions platforms, Whatsapp platforms; radio programs; Nhimbe; information kiosks and chitubu chevasikana platforms. The cumulative figure is 72 327 which is 84% of the end of programme target. Therefore the programme is on track to achieving the end of programme target.

As part of demonstrating their civic conciousness, residents in Bulawayo raised a red flag on corrupt tender processes in Bulawayo City Council. The residents petitioned the Bulawayo City Council against leasing a 3.5 hectares piece of land to the Mayor of Bulawayo for a paltry USD$2 for 25 years arguing that this was below the real market value of the land.  The residents vigilance and whistle blowing action on this high profile corruption case captured the attention of the Zimbabwe Anti-Corruption Commission (ZACC). Civic conciousness was also demonstrated when residents of Luveve suburb took the Bulawayo City Council to court over the issue of contaminated tap water that resulted in diarrhoea outbreak which claimed the lives of 13 residents and affected more than 1500 residents. The case was handled by the Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human Rights (ZLHR).

Women participation in local government including taking up leadership positions: Following lobby efforts for inclusive decision making structures, duty bearers in selected local authorities engaged by the programme acceded to demands for women inclusion in decision making structures. In Bulilima and Nkayi where Habakkuk Trust is implementing a local government project, 17 local level decision making structures have incorporated women and youths in their structures. In Nkayi ward 5, for example; 1 woman was incorporated into the Gezekhaya Neighborhood Policing Unit while 2 women were incorporated into Gezekhaya Crime Committee and 3 women  (1 as secretary and 2 as committee members) into the Gezekhaya Resource Monitoring Committee. In Bulilima ward 10; a total of 20 women were incorporated into the Hygiene Promoters Commmittee, which conducts awareness and education on sanitation and hygiene. In addition 16 youth ( 12 males and 4 males) were also incorporated into the committee. A COVID- 19 health ECommittee was also established at ward level and a total of 20 women and 16 youth ( 3 male and 4 females) were incorporated. The committees are chaired by women. Mafa Primary school building committee incorporated 2 women and one youth. One of the women was elected as secretary while the youth was tasked the role of committee member.

Platforms and safe spaces for women and youth participation: A total of ten platforms namely; Active Citizens Mobile App; Infrormation Kiosks; radio programmes; whatsapp groups; community work parties;Online TV discussions; youth/ women symposiums; devolution conference; Gender Indabasa and Chitubu chevasikana (Young womens forum) were created across projects to facilitate participation of women and youth. Partners such as ZWRCN, CYTD, SWRGN and IYWD promoted the participation of women and youth through the creation of safe spaces for women and youth to participate in local governance processes. The safe spaces created include; young women and youth symposiums, radio programmes, Gender Indabas, Chitubu chevasikana (Young womens Oasis) and Womens Devolution conferences.  SWRGN facilitated a total of 19 Young women and Youth Symposiums in Mangwe, Umzingwane, Zibagwe, Vungu and Matobo where a total of 506 participated in these safe spaces. Of the total beneficiaries using these safe platforms, 430 were youth and young women (329 females and 101 males), with the remainder being 33 adult females and 43 adult males. COTRAD facilitated a one day Provincial Devolution Conference for young people in Masvingo, Zaka and Chiredzi which was attended by 40 participants.  The platforms enabled young women and youth to share experiences, concerns and challenges they face on service delivery issues in their communities. Gender responsiveness in local authority processes- including resource allocation:. A total of 46 Centres of Excellence Councils (COE) which Gender Links has supported have allocated 37 million USD to gender programmes. Of this amount, 17 million was allocated to gender specific programmes like ending Gender Based Violence (GBV) and Sexual Reproductive Health and Rights (SRHR). Goromonzi RDC and Hwange Local Board were the most resourceful councils with budget allocations of 3 million and 4 million respectively towards gender activities. A total of 51 local authorities working with Gender Links showcased their institutional best practice case studies in various themes including governance, climate change, SRHR, GBV, economic justice and youth at the Thematic and Local Government SADCProtocol@Work Summit. Judges scores revealed that councils performed strongly in areas that include SRHR and GBV. Councils were awarded with colour-coded certificates which symbolizes the extent to which the councils are mainstreaming gender. Of the 51 councils that attended the SADCProtocol@Work Summit, 2 (4%) attained the Gold status while 9 (18%) attained Silver status. The majority 21 (41%) attained the bronze status; 17 (33%) attained the green status while only 2 (4%) attained the blue status. These classifications were approved by UN Women.

Strengthened institutional capacity of civil society organisations implementing the programme: All ten partners involved in the programme had their institutional capacities strengthened in various areas. Partners were supported with capacity building in the following areas: Risk management training; Security training; Gender mainstreaming; COVID-19 response planning; Sexual harassment prevention and Sustainability and exit strategies. As a result of the trainings, partners reported the following changes; Pastel accounting package adopted by IYWD improved accounting systems in the organisation; SWRGN develop a Finance Policy; Succession plan; Organisational performance management tool; Staff Welfare Policy; Conflict of Interest Policy as well as reviewing the Human Resource policy. All partners responded to the Safety and Security training by developing organizational security plans. Non-functional Boards at 2 partner organisations were revitalised and provide strategic oversight roles. Policies and systems development such as financial management systems have assisted CSO partners to operate in compliance with best financial accounting standards and also improving efficiency in their operations.  

Structured innovative systems/platforms for disseminating relevant information to rights holders: One of the causes of lack of citizen participation in local governance identified at programme conception was lack of information. To address this gap, BPRA developed an Active Citizens Mobile Application that allows residents to track information and analyze budget performance and tender processes in local authorities. COTRAD managed to sustain 10 information kiosks established at public spaces such as clinics, schools and business centres to make social accountability information available to youth. COTRAD resourced the information centres with newspapers and literature on governance and social accountability. A total of 300 young people in Chiredzi, Masvingo and Zaka accessed information on local governance and this enhanced their contributions during public consultations with local authorities. Online T.V discussions on social accountability and constitutional literacy were conducted on Heart and Soul online T.V.   COTRAD and ZWRCN produced videos encouraging young women and men to demand transparency and accountability from public officials. The social accountability videos reached out to 425,096 viewers.</narrative>
