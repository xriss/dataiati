   <narrative xml:lang="SV">The overall goal of the country program 2012-2015, in line with ZUNDAF, is to enable the equitable and sustained realization of the rights of every women and child in Zimbabwe to survival, development and protection. 

The programme areas in the country programme are; education, health, water and sanitation, child &amp; social protection and strategic planning and social policy. 

The original assessment to support UNICEF Zimbabwe Country Programme 2012-2015 with thematic funding was carried out by the Embassy in May 2012. A decision was made to support the country programme with 200 MSEK for four years, during the entire country programme period. 

Since then three amendments have been made to the original agreement. In December 2012, additional funding of 9 MSEK was contributed to the focus area child protection. The second amendment had the purpose to extend the agreement for another two years with 100 million MSEK (since the Embassy could only enter into agreement for two years of 100 MSEK to start with even if a decision on support of 200 MSEK was signed for the four years). The third amendment was made in order for UNICEF to receive their entitled 50 million SEK in December 2014 (instead of January 2015). In total UNICEF has so far received 209 MSEK of Swedish thematic funding. 

In this appraisal it is proposed to add another 49 MSEK to the existing agreement with UNICEF to support the current country programme for UNICEF 2012-2015 (and in particular contribute to the funding gap during 2015). In total that would be 258 MSEK for the country programme implementation 2012-2015. 

UNICEF has submitted a request for more thematic funding to support the final year of the current UNICEF country programme in Zimbabwe. The total budget required to support the consolidated annual workplans for each focus area is USD 173,882,602. What is currently available is USD 151,709,567, hence a shortfall of USD 22,173.035. The financial gap has been calculated by taking into account 2015 annual work plans amounts for each focus area and subtracting funds already available in the UNICEF system for 2015. The funding gaps are mainly critical in the following areas; water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH), HIV/AIDS and Children, Nutrition and Health (Health Transition Fund). There are different reasons behind the funding gap; AusAid is cutting down their support to Zimbabwe which has an impact on the water, sanitation and hygiene programs, the government has increased its commitments to double the number of children on ART by 2018 as part of the national accelarating plan to have 90 per cent of eligible children on ART by 2018, and reducing inequities to ART. The high figure of stunting in Zimbabwe has put further attention on nutritional programmes. In terms of Health there needs to be an uninterrupted focus on health system strengthening under the HTF. What is further known is that previous committed funding from DFID to Health Transition Fund (HTF) and Child Protection Fund (CPF) is delayed due to election in UK.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">General question: Results related to the intended outcome 2015Question: Summarise results related to the intended outcome (this information will be sent to Open Aid)Answer: Main results from the implementation of the Thematic Funds be found in the UNICEF annual reports per area (7 repors per year on Education, Health, Nutrition, HIV-Aids, Child Protection, WASH and Social Inclusion respectivly) Futhermore, data from the multi-indicator cluster surveys undertaken by the Zimbabwe National Statistical Agency (Zimstat) in 2009 and 2014 show significant improvements in all this areas. 

Zimstat show that the key education outcomes sought by the TFM, for example in the primary completion rate (from 42.6% to 98.9%), the secondary school attendance ratio (from 44.8% to 57.5%) and school readiness (from 75.0% to 86.2%). UNICEF supported the disbursement of school improvement grants (SIG) to 6,092 schools with a total enrolment of over 2.6 million students. The total amount spent on the SIG was US$24.9 million, which constitutes over 50 per cent of the 2015 Education programme expenditure. In order to strengthen quality assurance in the use of the SIGs, UNICEF supported the training of an additional 995 school heads in financial management, bringing the total trained since 2014 to 9,400. In addition, independent verification by three auditing firms were conducted to ascertain the use of SIG. UNICEF also supported the minstry of education in conducting monitoring of schools, with just over 11,000 visits to schools conducted in 2015. 

In 2015 the number and percentage of qualified teachers in Zimbabwe increased. The qualified teacher-to-pupil ratio improved from 1:40 in 2014 to 1:38 in 2015 for primary and from 1:30 to 1:29 for secondary school. This is attributed to an increase in the supply of qualified teachers alongside the system&apos;s enhanced retention capacity. The training of 9,954 ECD paraprofessionals that has been supported through UNICEF funding since 2012 was concluded in May 2015 with the graduation of the last batch of 2,500 trainees. UNICEF supported the enhancement of over 22,900 pre-primary and primary school teachers&#x2019; pedagogical skills in early reading and catch-up education. UNICEF and Ministry of Education also jointly funded the Teacher Capacity Development Programme (TCDP) in order to upgrade 1,749 teachers&#x2019; subject matter
knowledge in a variety of fields. 

In the health sector the HTF &#x2013; launched in December  2011 -- was a response to increasing rates of maternal and child mortality. The Zimstat estimated maternal death at about 1200 deaths per 100 000 in 2002 and under-five mortality rates at 94 per 1000 live births in 2009. This occurred within the context of an acute shortage of qualified practitioners and essential equipment and medicines, of user fees which suppressed demand for health services, and the skewing of external financing to HIV/Aids programmes. By 2014 access to maternal and child health services had increased significantly. The biggest improvement is in postnatal care of newborns (by 626%), followed by post-natal care of mothers (187%) and full immunisation coverage (by 88%). As a result, at the outcome level, maternal mortality and under-five mortality have fallen to levels last seen in the 1990s and early 2000s respectively. As compared to other countries in the region, Zimbabwe has maintained high immunisation coverages with BCG at 95%, measles at 86% and completion of the primary course of immunisation at 82% (MOHCC routine immunisation administrative data, February 2016). The health sector vacancy rate decreased from 21% in 2012 to 16% in 2015; the proportion of health facilities experiencing stock-outs of essential medicines declined from 13% to 4%; the number of districts with community health workers with critical skills to provide infant and young child feeding counselling and support increased from 41% in 2014 to 52% and the proportion of districts with at least three doctors increased to 50%. It should be noted that other health interventions related to nutrition, HIV/AIDS, TB and malaria have benefitted due to the regular availability of vital medicines and consumables, the increased number of doctors and community health workers as well as the retention of the general health workers through the human resources for health retention scheme.

The results based financing modality (RBF) is showing improved results in the health outcome indicators. The number of pregnant women booking for ANC before the first 16 weeks of pregnancy is steadily increasing as is the number of deliveries attended by skilled health workers. The declared and verified data are gradually converging which is an indicating improvements in the quality of data at facility level. UNICEF, working very closely with World Bank has supported the MoHCC in effecting the RBF payments to the facilities and technical assistance to health facilities and community sisters in charge through Crown Agents.

In Zimbabwe, UNICEF contributes to the national HIV response as articulated in the Zimbabwe National Strategic Plan for HIV and AIDS (ZNHASP 2011-2015) and the efforts of UNICEF are also reflected in the Zimbabwe United Nations Development Assistance Framework (ZUNDAF Outcome 6 - Universal access to HIV prevention, treatment, care and support). Within the Zimbabwe Country Office (ZCO), HIV interventions are mainstreamed into programme components of Young Child Survival and Development, Basic Education and Gender Equality, Child Protection, Social Policy, and Advocacy and Communication. Mother-to-child
HIV transmission has declined from 31% in 2009, to 5% at six weeks and 12% post breast feeding in 2014. The estimated number of HIV related orphans has declined from 610,122 in 2013 to 567,480 in 2014. However, sexual violence among women and girls is still of grave concern, with 18% of Young women (15-19 years) reporting having experienced sexual violence.

In the social and child protection sector, the CPF &#x2013; which came into being in 2011 -- was established at a time when increasing levels of poverty and the collapse of the social and child protection and education systems severely affected children&#x2019;s access to health, education and nutrition. In 2009 Zimbabwe formulated a follow-up National Action Plan for Orphans and Vulnerable Children (the NAP II) to its 2004 NAP. The CPF pools external support for NAP II implementation, taking into account lessons learnt from NAP I implementation on investment in government capacity. Socio economic indicators as measured in 2014, show progress in areas targeted by the NAP II and the CPF, including in nutrition. For 2015, 52,515 food poor, labour constrained households in 19 districts received regular and reliable disbursement of Harmonised Social Cash Transfer (HSCT) payments. According to the HSCT impact evaluation (2015), the beneficiaries received the correct amount of money, timely, and regularly and did not face significant challenges with the payment process.In addition, out of the 9,365 Community Childcare Workers (CCWs), 84 per cent received training on case management operational processes. The CCWs were provided with working tools to address transport and communication challenges. Through Case Management (CM) a total of 58,499 children were assisted whereby 44 per cent of the cases were child protection and 56 per cent of the cases were child welfare.

As part of the Joint Gender Based Violence prevention programme, UNICEF supported partners to
serve 2,865 (1979 girls, 886 women), and 572 (369 boys, 203 men) survivors with legal aid,
psychosocial and medical support in three districts. 1,636 (1518 F, 108 M) victims of rape and other heavy sexual offences accessed justice through 17 Victim Friendly Courts.

Although, the MICS results of 2014, show a downward trend in stunting prevalence from a peak of 35% in 2005/6 to 27.6% in 2014, disparities were noted (ZIMSTAT 20141). Stunting remains high in rural areas (30%), compared to 20% in urban areas. Also worth noting are the gender disparities with boys having a higher stunting prevalence of 31.1% compared to girls at 24.1%. This resulted with UNICEF in collaboration with other UN agencies, spearheading a shift in nutrition programming in 2015 toward community based multi-sectoral implementation of nutrition interventions for stunting reduction, being informed by evidence from Lancet Nutrition series of 2013. With the support of flexible thematic funds,UNICEF supported the establishment of multi-sectoral food and nutrition security committees (FNSCs) in four priority districts; Mwenezi, Chiredzi, Mutasa and Chipinge to facilitate implementation of both nutrition sensitive and nutrition specific actions at community level for stunting reduction. 

Nationwide at total of 16,614 children (0-59 months of age) with SAM were treated between January- September, 2015. This was 49% of the target of 33,340 children projected to have SAM. Of the children treated in the SAM program, 8,390 children under five years of age were tested for HIV out of which 1186 (14%) were identified to be HIV positive and treated both for HIV and SAM (DHIS,2015). As of September 2015, 92 % against a target of 90% of all health facilities are providing treatment for CMAM, 90% against a target of 80% of facilities have at least 1 health worker trained on CMAM trained, 98% of facilities with anthropometric equipment and 96% have adequate RUTF against the target of 90%/ (VMAHS Round 25, September 2015). UNICEF procured a total of 8110 cartons of RUTF and 2000 cartons of RUSF between January - November 2015

In the water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) sector the TFM WASH programmes responded to poor water and sanitation outcomes in five rural provinces and 14 urban centers (towns), partly due to underinvestment and the collapse of services and systems. Two thirds of deaths in the 2008-2009 cholera epidemic occurred in areas with poor water and sanitation provision. The Rural Wash programme was established in 2012 to improve water and sanitation systems in the five provinces, and the Urban Wash programme initially covered seven towns in 2012 with an additional seven commencing in 2013. By 2014 WASH outcomes had shown improvements in the supported provinces; in 2014 not a single death was due to Cholera. The 2015 WASH programme was guided by the National Sanitation and Hygiene Strategy, approved by Government in 2012 and the UNICEF CPAP (2012 - 2015) and ZUNDAF (2012 &#x2013; 2015). The main outcome for the programme is increased, equitable, and sustainable access to and use of safe and adequate water, improved sanitation and hygiene. Implementation in 2015 was also guided by the 2014 - 2015 Annual Rolling work plan (ARW) which was developed from the UNICEF CPAP (2012-2015). The ARW for 2015 had 4 outputs:
Output 1: 3000 rural communities, 14 urban centres, and 1,300 schools in 33 districts and
population (men, women and children) affected by emergencies have access to improved and
sustainable drinking water by 2015.? 
Output 2: 3000 rural communities, 14 urban centres, and 1,300 schools in 33 districts, and population (men, women and children) affected by emergencies have access to improved sanitation services by December 2015.
Output 3: 3000 rural communities, 14 urban centres, and 1,300 schools have adequate
knowledge and skills on critical hygiene practices by December 2015
Output 4: Enabling policy, financial, and institutional environment is strengthened for provision of equitable access to improved WASH services.
