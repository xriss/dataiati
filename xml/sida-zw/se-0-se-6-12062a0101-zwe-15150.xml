   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The objective of the programme is to promote the involvement of women in local politics in Zimbabwe&#xA0; with the long-term view of strengthening local governance capacity and local democracy.
Given this objective, the rationale of the Training Programme Capacitating Local Leaders in Zimbabwe is to focus on local leaders both males and females in Zimbabwe, believing that they have the potential to act as advocates and role models for women who may consider making a career in politics or administration.
The expected result by the end of the programme&#xA0; is: Councillors and their partner council managers, women and men, will have increased personal leadership and interpersonal skills and be able to skilfully perform their duties.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">During the period under review&#xA0; ICLD managed to train&#xA0; 10 councillors 10 managers, and two Ministry of Local Government officials i.e Permanent Secretary and a Director were capacitated in the two 18-month programmes from March 2018 to December 2019. Of the 20 participants 13 where females. There were two participants from each Council i.e an elected councillor and an official. Participants were selected from the councils around the country&apos;s 10 provinces. The programme has led to changes in individual&#x2019;s competencies such as computer literacy and working on line and surfing on the Internet.&#xA0; Most of the councillors had never had any experience in working on a computer especially the rural based councillors.&#xA0; The training came in handy to most of the councillors as they had a hands on lessons on computer appreciation. This saw a handful of councillors acquiring their own laptops for use in their work. The councillors also reported positive change in attitudes that came&#xA0; through the training and exposure to new ideas, culture, and perspectives. The Sweden trip was an enlightenment to most of the councillors as well as the officials who for the first time flew to a European country. A lot of learning at individual level took place in Sweden, key was time management and appreciation of efficient public transport and cleanliness of the city, waste management, and the use of bio gas to power public transport.&#xA0; The attachment of councillors and officials to different Municipalities in Sweden for a week provided an indepth understanding of how a council operates. They were able to draw comparisons from their respective councils.&#xA0; An opportunity to interact with Sweden female councillors inspired both the officials and councillors as they exhibited a lot of knowledge on how their municipalities operate. The cooperation between officials and councillors was also very much appreciated by the visiting team. As most of the municipalities in Zimbabwe are divided on party lines and at times this has been detrimental to progress in some councils. All the councillors expressed a boosts in self confidence levels when compared to the beginning of the programme. The councilors have become bolder when speaking at public gatherings, interrogate and articulate issues better in council meetings and facilitate ward activities better.&#xA0; Just like the previous programmes, through the module on dressing etiquette there was noticeable personal confidence in female councillors that had transformed other facets of their lives as they have developed into community role models.&#xA0; The councillors gained knowledge of the SDGs and were able to see the practicability of such goals in their respective municipalities. This has seen each of the councillors coming up with a plan of action to be implemented in their municipalities. &#xA0;The inclusion of an anti corruption module assisted most of the councillors to understand the magnitude of corruption in the country and also to appreciate the roles and responsibilities they have in accounting for the public funds as holders of public offices. The males that took part in the programme became converted gender champions.&#xA0; They appreciated the challenges women in leadership positions face and how some men are stumbling block to women empowerment. The programme also included&#xA0; Directors and Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Local Government, Public works and National Housing (MLGPWNH) that enabled them to understand the programme and were also exposed to effective ways of service delivery. The inclusion of these high level officials also made the councillors take the programme even more serious as the Ministry will expect to see change from the councillors who travelled to Sweden. The programme has also created a channel of cooperation between the MLGPWNH and the Embassy.&#xA0; Plans are under way to plan for a courtesy meeting with the Ministry Officials, and the Minister.</narrative>
