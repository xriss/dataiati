    <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Action for Choice II project commenced on the first of September 2021. This is an extension of the first phase which aimed to Reduce SRH related mortality and morbidity among young people in 10 state universities of Zimbabwe. The second phase has a goal to ensure that Young People are safe and enjoy high-quality SRHR and GBV Services in higher learning institutions and surrounding communities in Zimbabwe.

Action for Choice II commenced during the COVID-19 lockdown when the country was under lockdown level 4. The subsequent restrictions resulted in 43% of activities being conducted virtually. The organisation was also affected by the new Omicron variant as it recorded 60% infection among the stuff leading to early closure of offices for the December break. This affected the implementation of flagship events such as the students&apos; conference and the Condomize campaign.

Objective 1: Strengthening of young peoples access to SRHR and GBV information

Under this objective SAYWHAT reached a total of 108 640 young people. Students were mobilized to participate in creation of program content through Power Talks and Newsletters thereby enabling their access to SRHR and GBV information. Twelve Power Talks were produced and broadcasted in commemoration of the 16 days of activism against Gender-Based Violence reaching 7 700 people.

Key issues coming out of the various interactions with young people are (i) a lot of young women being abused in relationships even at colleges, (ii) young women and men have established networks of blessers who provide their daily needs for a glamorous trendy university lifestyle, (iii) menstrual health supplies are not readily available at colleges, (iv) mental health and substance use are areas of concern for students. (v) There is need for more free contraceptive planning services for young people.

To address some of these challenges SAYWHAT roped in the Friendship Bench team to support with mental health management. Some of the issues raised have since been included as the discussion points in the next Quarterly meetings with Focal Persons and Deans of Colleges as well as with the portfolio committees for both the Higher and Tertiary Education as well as the Health and Child Care scheduled for the Q2 of 2022. The peer education training and training of college health personnel has also included the matters raised in these various platforms. Population Services Zimbabwe, Zimbabwe National Family Planning Council (ZNFPC), City of Harare and Bulawayo have been engaged for service delivery partnerships.

During the implementation period, 8 Legal Talks Shows could not be implemented due to Omicron (COVID-19) outbreak towards year-end which affected engagement of facilitators. The outstanding Legal Talk shows will be implemented in the first quarter of 2022.

Objective 2: Increasing access and utilisation of SRH and gender responsive services by young people

The Call centre is facilitating SRH and GBV service access by young people through the referral system and medical vouchers. From September to December 2021, 1061, calls were received from young people with cases ranging from, mental health, family planning and education support requests. Of all the cases received, 89% were closed. new partnerships being established with the local authorities, ZNFPC, the Friendship Bench, Musasa, Zimbabwe Women Lawyers Association (ZWLA), After Rape Clinic (ARC) and other NGOs to support and respond to the requests coming through the call Centre In addition, 10 700 young people accessed integrated GBV, SRH and HIV services at college clinics. Services included family planning, counselling, HIV testing and management. The highest numbers were achieved under family planning.

SAYWHAT is also responding to SRH commodities shortages alerts coming through the call centre in different communities by getting in touch with the responsible local service providers to act. SYWHAT jointly with National AIDS Council (NAC) and ZNFPC responded to the call for shortages of condoms at Lupane State University and neighbouring communities 

However, due to COVID-19 outbreak, several planned actions could not be implemented as more than half the SAYWHAT  staff members had tested positive for COVID-19. These include the CONDOMIZE! Campaign, Physical Dialogues at Resource Centres, Social Media Dialogues, Virtual Legal Clinics, and Health and Career Guidance Days. 

Objective 3: Increasing young peoples participation and representation in SRH and GBV advocacy

As a result of the 2021 SASI Debate Competition (implemented under A4C Phase 1), which emphasized the need to criminalize sexual harassment in Zimbabwe, the Joint Parliamentary Portfolio Committee on Higher and Tertiary Education and Committee on Gender commissioned a fact-finding mission and conducted consultative meetings across tertiary institutions in Zimbabwe. SAYWHAT mobilized the Peer Educators community across 16 tertiary institutions to participate in these meetings giving students an opportunity to freely share their grievances on Sexual Harassment.  The consultations Report for the consultative process will be presented before parliament in February 2022 after which SAYWHAT will follow up with the respective committees on actions taken by government to address raised issues. 

Other issues

Media Monitoring findings are informing decision making for the organization. Following media reports of condom and morning-after pill shortages in Bulawayo, SAYWHAT is working with AIDS Health Foundation (AHF) to scale up condom education and distribution in colleges in Bulawayo. 

SAYWHAT did not manage to commission the baseline study which was planned for October 2021 due to late approvals by colleges. This was also a result of the suspension of face-to-face lectures where institutions opened in batches due to COVID-19. As a result, the activity was postponed to early 2022.</narrative>
