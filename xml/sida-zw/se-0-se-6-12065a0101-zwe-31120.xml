   <narrative xml:lang="SV">Kooperation Utan Gr&#xE4;nser (We Effect) har inkommit med en ny ans&#xF6;kan om st&#xF6;d som uppf&#xF6;ljning till deras program Green Enterprise and Business Development Programme (EBDP) som genomf&#xF6;rdes 2014-2017. Det nya programf&#xF6;rslaget bygger p&#xE5; l&#xE4;rdomar och rekommendationer fr&#xE5;n utv&#xE4;rderingen av det genomf&#xF6;rda programmet som bifogas. Det f&#xF6;reslagna programmet syftar fr&#xE4;mst till att inkludera gr&#xF6;na smarta l&#xF6;sningar f&#xF6;r att st&#xE4;rka kvinnor och unga p&#xE5; landsbygden och deras ekomiska st&#xE4;llning f&#xF6;r att de ska kunna lyfta sig ur fattigdom.  Den prim&#xE4;ra m&#xE5;lgruppen &#xE4;r 67 500 f&#xF6;rm&#xE5;nstagare av den fattigaste befolkningen, d&#xE4;r ca 80% &#xE4;r kvinnor och ca 20% &#xE4;r unga (16-35 &#xE5;r). 

F&#xF6;reslagen budget f&#xF6;r det tre&#xE5;riga programmet &#xE4;r totalt SEK 30 500 000. Kostnad per motagare ligger runt 55 USD per person under de tre &#xE5;ren. I utbytte mot att personerna deltar f&#xE5;r de en f&#xF6;rdubblad inkomst fr&#xE5;n ca 1,56 USD per dag till 3,12 USD per person och dag. Projekteringen &#xE4;r att de 67 500 deltagarna tillsammans ska generera ca 460 miljoner USD i inkomster under de tre &#xE5;ren, genom ambassadens investering p&#xE5; ca 3,6 miljoner USD.
  
Ambassaden bed&#xF6;mer att detta program faller v&#xE4;l inom Sveriges nya strategi f&#xF6;r utvecklingssamarbetet med Zimbabwe (2017-2021) fr&#xE4;mst genom att st&#xE4;rka m&#xE5;l:

1.3 St&#xE4;rkta f&#xF6;ruts&#xE4;ttningar f&#xF6;r j&#xE4;mst&#xE4;lldhet och respekt f&#xF6;r m&#xE4;nskliga r&#xE4;ttigheter, med fokus p&#xE5;
kvinnor och flickor;
3.1  F&#xF6;rb&#xE4;ttrade m&#xF6;jligheter till en h&#xE5;llbar f&#xF6;rs&#xF6;rjning, med fokus p&#xE5; h&#xE5;llbar
livsmedelsf&#xF6;rs&#xF6;rjning, produktiv syssels&#xE4;ttning med anst&#xE4;llningsvillkor, s&#xE4;rskilt f&#xF6;r
kvinnor och ungdomar.
3.3  F&#xF6;rb&#xE4;ttrad kapacitet hos akt&#xF6;rer att bidra till milj&#xF6;- och klimatm&#xE4;ssig h&#xE5;llbarhet.

Programmet &#xE4;r del av We Effects globala och regionala strategi. Det faller &#xE4;ven v&#xE4;l inom delar av FNs Globala M&#xE5;l (SDGs); M&#xE5;l 1 Ingen fattigdom, M&#xE5;l 2 Ingen hunger, M&#xE5;l 5 J&#xE4;mst&#xE4;lldhet, M&#xE5;l 8 Anst&#xE4;ndiga arbetsvillkor och ekonomisk tillv&#xE4;xt, samt M&#xE5;l 13 Bek&#xE4;mpa klimatf&#xF6;r&#xE4;ndringen.

Programmet ska genomf&#xF6;ras av We Effect tillsammans med tre partnerorganisationer, som alla arbetar med ett r&#xE4;ttighetsperspektiv och aktivt deltagande. Dessa partnerorganisationer har arbetat v&#xE4;l och gick igenom det sk We Effect Screening Tool 2013, innan de blev partnerorganisationer. We Effect har en l&#xE5;ng erfarenhet av att arbeta med dessa typer av landsbygdsprogram.  We Effect kommer via detta program st&#xF6;dja m&#xE4;nniskor med r&#xE5;dgivning och utbildning, m&#xF6;jlighet att spara eller l&#xE5;na pengar och hj&#xE4;lpa till med aff&#xE4;rsutveckling, d&#xE4;r syftet &#xE4;r att f&#xF6;rb&#xE4;ttra arbetsvillkor och ekonomisk tillv&#xE4;xt. St&#xF6;det g&#xE5;r &#xE4;ven till p&#xE5;verkansarbete f&#xF6;r regler och reformer som gynnar fattiga. Programmet f&#xF6;respr&#xE5;kar &#xE4;ven ett h&#xE5;llbart och klimatanpassat jordbruk. Vidare syftar programmet till att l&#xE4;ra m&#xE5;lgruppen hur de kan anpassa sig f&#xF6;r att hantera ett mer of&#xF6;ruts&#xE4;gbart klimat, det vill s&#xE4;ga f&#xF6;ljderna av klimatf&#xF6;r&#xE4;ndringarna.

Ambassaden bed&#xF6;mer att programmets val av vilka delar av landet som genomf&#xF6;randet kommer att ske i &#xE4;r v&#xE4;l valda och inte &#xF6;verlappar med andra program som Sverige st&#xF6;djer i Zimbabwe. Synergier mellan andra program s&#xE5; som Resiliensfonden kommer att uppmuntras. Det f&#xF6;rslagna programmet kommer att genomf&#xF6;ras i nio distrikt i sammarbete med de tre partnerorganisationerna, vilka arbetar i tre distrikt var. Jekesa Pfungwa Vulingqondo (JPV) kommer att implementera programmet i Umzingwane, Zaka och Chimanimani; Zimbabwe Women&apos;s Bureau (ZWB) arbetar i Goromonzi, Mutare Rural och Gweru; samt Self-Help Development Foundation (SHDF) som kommer genomf&#xF6;ra sina aktiviteter i Gwanda, Seke och Buhera districts. Samtliga f&#xF6;rutom Gwanda &#xE4;r distrikt som We Effect arbetat inom tidigare. 

Ambassaden bed&#xF6;mer att detta program kommer att ekonomiskt st&#xE4;rka fattiga och utsatta kvinnor och ungdomar p&#xE5; landsbyggden samt bidra till ekonomisk tillv&#xE4;xt och anst&#xE4;ndiga arbetsvillkor.</narrative>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">We Effect has applied for 30 500 000 SEK to implement a Green Enterprise Business Development Programme (EBDP) in 9 districts of Zimbabwe in partnership with three local implementing partners. We Effect proposes that the programme be three-year intervention to be rolled out in the country with each of the three implementing partners working in 3 districts. Jekesa Pfungwa Vulingqondo (JPV) plans to implement the programme in Umzingwane, Zaka and Chimanimani; Zimbabwe Women&apos;s Bureau (ZWB) plans to work in Goromonzi, Mutare Rural and Gweru; and the Self-Help Development Foundation (SHDF) plans to roll-out in Gwanda, Seke and Buhera districts. The three partners that We Effect plans to work with in the Green EBDP have a strong presence and a good history of their involvement in rural communities.

The EBDP is being proposed as a successor programme to We Effect&apos;s EBDP that ran from 2014 &#x2013; 2017 with Sida support. The proposed programme seeks to build on findings, lessons learned and recommendations from the EBDP evaluation. It also seeks to include green activities in the new intervention with the overall aim of contributing to the realisation of Sweden&#x2019;s country strategy for development cooperation in Zimbabwe, We Effect&#x2019;s global and regional strategies and other relevant instruments such as the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). 

The Green EBDP plans to respond to the third result area of the Sida strategy for development cooperation for Zimbabwe 2017 to 2021. The result area relates to Livelihods, Environment, Climate Change and Renewable Energy. In particular, the proposal aims to contribute to the part of the strategy that looks at improved opportunities for sustainable livelihoods, with a focus on sustainable food security, productive employment with decent working conditions, especially for women and young people as well as providing opportunities that result in an economic environment that improves the lives of the poor. On the UN Agenda 2030, the Green EBDP plans to target SDG numbers 1 no poverty, 2 zero hunger, 5 gender equality, 8 decent work and economic growth and 13 climate action.

The major problem identified that the Green EBDP plans to address is indicated as the need to deal with economically and environmentally unstainable livelihoods and food insecurity among rural women and young people. The underlyng problems have been singled out as the following:

1. Limited number of rural men, women and youth managing viable &#x2018;green&#x2019; Enterprises
2.  Limited application of sustainable agriculture techniques and practices  
3. Limited application of HRBA and capacity to effectively represent and provide service delivery on enterprise development and &#x2018;green&#x2019; job creation

We Effect realises that the EBDP 2014 &#x2013; 2017 made great strides in mobilizing more than 60,000 rural people, mainly women, to participate in internal savings and income generating activities through development of both agriculture and non-agriculture enterprises. The targeted rural people, developed their entrepreneurial skills leading to a change of mind-set towards business development for income generation and improvement of their livelihoods during EBDP 2014-2017. However, given the relatively short time period of the programme, it was not possible to take the target group to a level where the business opportunities within the targeted districts were fully exploited and broad-based significant livelihood improvements for targeted entrepreneurs achieved. The programme also had limitations in terms of exploring the specific opportunities for youth entrepreneurship, &#x2018;green&#x2019; job creation, application of climate-smart agriculture and other practices for sustainable use of natural resources, and advocacy work for a more conducive policy environment for &#x2018;green&#x2019; enterprise development. 

In the proposed intervention, to address the identified problems, We Effect plans to work with the three selected partners that plan to provide services that enable rural women, men and youth to identify business opportunities, get access to affordable finance, and manage financially sustainable rural enterprises in the green economy. On the limited knowledge of rights by the target groups, the partners propose to apply the Human Rights Based principles of participation, legitimacy; accountability; non-discrimination; empowerment; and transparency in their planning and implementation of activities. It is anticipated that this will result in the emergence of empowered women and youths with equal rights and opportunities actively participating in enterprise development for decent green job creation that is sustainable and improves their livelihoods. The ultimate aim of the intervention is poverty reduction and creation of a more just society.

Currently, there is a limited number of rural men, women and youth managing viable &#x2018;green&#x2019; enterprises. Approximately 70 percent of people in Zimbabwe live in rural areas and depend on agriculture for their livelihoods. Few rural people have opportunities for work that is productive and delivers a fair income, job security and social protection for their families. More than 50 percent of smallholder farmers are subsistence farmers and do not sell their produce. Most smallholder farmers are unable to generate a decent income from their business enterprises. This is mainly due to an unconducive policy environment, limited access to affordable finance, limited knowledge about and access to appropriate technology, markets, limited entrepreneurial mindset, limited value addition of agricultural produce, limited business opportunities in the various agricultural and non-agricultural value chains among others.  

Besides the above identified limitatations for rural on and off-farm enterprises, women face additional problems identified by We Effect that it aims to address through the proposed intervention. Women are further marginalized by patriarchal systems even though they are the source of most farm labour in the rural areas.  They carry out heavy household work but frequently lack control of the productive resources and the income generated from the farming enterprises. Most rural women and young people have limited opportunities to acquire land hence making it very difficult for them to be involved in farming in their own rights. Also, most young people have a negative perception towards smallholder farming mainly because it is associated with living in poverty. Limited opportunities to raise decent income from rural on and off-farm business activities and/or formal employment has resulted in a huge migration of young people to the urban areas. This has in turn contributed to slum-like settlements with related social problems in the urban areas. Another problem is that most on-farm and off farm businesses are not environmentally assessed and may be a cause of health hazard to the entrepreneurs and may result in environmental degradation.

Another identified problem among the target groups and districts is the limited application of sustainable agriculture techniques and practices. Many smallholder farmers use unsustainable agricultural practices which contribute to degradation of natural resources including depleted soil fertility, soil erosion, deforestation and pollution of water sources. This is mainly caused by limited knowledge about how to apply sustainable climate-smart agricultural practices such as conservation farming, water harvesting and agroforestry. Most farmers are also not aware of the reduced vulnerability to climate change, safeguarding of healthy food security and the long-term financial gains by the uptake of resilient green technologies. Adoption rates are also low because sustainable agricultural practices are perceived by many farmers to be labour-intensive. Intensive promotion of high external input agriculture (use of chemical fertilizers and chemicals) also contributes to the low adoption rate.     

On the part of the implementing partners, We Effect realised that despite the intial exposure to the Human Rights-Based Approach (HRBA) in programming in the EBDP 2014-2017, the partner organisations still lack the capacity to effectively represent and provide service delivery on enterprise development and &#x2018;green&#x2019; job-creation. They are generally not very strong in areas of assisting to push participation by members/rights-holders in national decision-making, transparency and accountability by the national structures to the rights holders. The partners are also weak in member-registration, retention and maintaining membership data/records. This has resulted in low &#x2018;own&#x2019; income generation from the members which in turn creates high dependency on donor funding. There has also been limited participation by young people (currently between 15 &#x2013; 20%) in partner activities. The intervention seeks to build capacity among the partners to support the establishment of &#x2018;green&#x2019; enterprises and application of sustainable agricultural practices among their members. Skills will be imparted among the partners  to effectively engage in lobby and advocacy and principled negotiations with duty bearers on matters affecting their membership.

The programme partners have been selected based on past involvement in implementation of the EBDP, experience, results achieved, the organisations&#x2019; ability to contribute to the achievement of the programme objectives and successfully meeting We Effect partnership criteria. The proposed partners have a strong presence in the rural areas and in the districts they plan to work in given they have been working in these areas for decades.

As for the intended beneficiaries, the Green EBDP is targeting to reach out to 67 500 rights holders as primary beneficiaries (on and off-farm entrepreneurs), that are members or potential members of the three implementing partners. Indirectly it will benefit more than 400 000 household family members based on an average family size of 6. The majority of the target group, 80 percent, are women and 20 percent are young people between the ages of 16 to 35. Among the target group, 486 lead entrepreneurs, of which at least 80% will be women, will be identified and supported to act as catalysts to the other entrepreneurs in the programme. In the proposed selection criteria, We Effect and partners identified the situation of the rights holders targeted in this programme as: 

&#x2022; Most live below the international poverty line of $1.90 a day
&#x2022; Most live and farm in the communal, old resettlement and A1 farming areas.
&#x2022; Farmers in the communal areas only have user rights and no formal ownership to their farms. It is mainly the men who are registered as land holders by the traditional leadership. In the A1 resettlement areas only 20% of those allocated offer letters are women.
&#x2022; Most farms sizes are small and range between 1-5 hectares.
&#x2022; Most smallholder farmers, especially women and youth, have limited access to economic resources. 
&#x2022; Women have limited space at household and community level to participate in decision making.
&#x2022; Most land use is controlled by men,
&#x2022; Labour towards agriculture production is mainly performed by women,
&#x2022; Low level of mechanization and farming is mostly manual driven.
&#x2022; Most farming is rain fed and farmers have high vulnerability to climate change especially droughts (4 million people were in need of food aid during the 2015/16 farming season),
&#x2022; They have limited knowledge about resilience building and sustainable agricultural practices.
&#x2022; Most of the women and youths have limited access to affordable finance, extension and marketing services. 
&#x2022; Most women and youths lack voice and ability to articulate their needs and rights to the duty bearers and decision makers.
&#x2022; Limited opportunities for formal employment exist and self-employment in on-farm and off-farm enterprise development provides the best opportunities for income generation and livelihood improvement.

The intervention to be mainly funded by Sida and aims to reach 67 500 beneficiaries in the identified nine districts of Zimbabwe spreading over five provinces. It is anticipated that the beneficiaries&apos; standards of living will be improved post the intervention phase with their annual income doubling from the current average of USD3 425 to USD6 850 per year.

The proposed target beneficiaries, women and youth are at the core of the overall Sida strategy for Zimbabwe. Of the target group, 80 percent are women and 20 percent are young people aged between 16 to 35. The proposed programme shows acceptable levels of value for money where it plans to work within a cost per beneficiary of  USD 55 over the three year implementation period. In return, it is envisaged that the impact of the intervention will result in more than double the income of beneficiaries from the current baseline of USD 1.56 per day to USD 3.12 per person per day. The targeted 67 500 entrepreneurs are expected to generate a combined increased income of USD 460 million in 2020 from the proposed project cost of USD 3.6 million.</narrative>

    <narrative xml:lang="EN">The conclusions are drawn from We Effect&apos;s third year of implementing the Green Entrepreneurship and Business Development Project (EBDP). During the period under review, the programme reached 34 615 rights holders through training which cumulatively added to 92 492 reached thus surpassing the programme target of 67 500. Of the rights holders reached, 62 462 were adult females (AF), 19 526 adult males (AM), 7 582 female youth (FY) and 2 922 male youth (MY). The cumulative number of entrepreneurs engaged in the targeted business sectors to date were&#xA0; Agriculture 37 340 AF, 9691 FY, 13 801 AM and 2498 MY Renewable energy 2 337 AF , 376 FY, 970 AM and 131 MY Rural housing&#xA0; 2 478 AF, 487 FY, 1157 AM and 156 MY General trading 17 817 AF, 3 576 FY, 3 544 AM, 883 MY; General service 2 879 AF, 611 FY, 858 AM, 239 MY. Of these enterprises, 83% were individually owned, 14.4% were informal groups and 2.6% were cooperatives. During 2019, it was difficult to assess results on income, number of people earning an income above international poverty line and savings because of the unstable monetary policy environment and hyper-inflation of 520% that was prevailing. Implementation of the programme involved use of innovative approaches to achieve the desired results which included: developing sustainable value chains building on the Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO) Sustainable food value chain concept, providing support to both on and off-farm business development within the &#x201C;green economy&#x201D;, establishment of 2 580 commodity groups and enterprise clubs including 90 district commodity and enterprise associations. The programme used the study circle methodology to generate business ideas to start and / or improve businesses. A total of 497 lead entrepreneurs (398 women and 99 men) exceeding the set programme target of 486 were trained using the lead farmer / entrepreneur concept for learning to act as catalysts to the other entrepreneurs in the programme. Cumulatively, 8 168 internal savings and loans (ISAL) groups against the set target of 8 296 were functional during the period under review; 51 savings and credit cooperative organisations (SACCOs) were established and the Green Investment Fund approved 125 applications from 80 AF, 20 FY, 20AM and five MY with a total value of USD92 400. During this period, 81 ward information centres were established against set target of 108 were including an information and communication technology (ICT) platform (Android App) for extension and market linkages which has since been operationalised. Overall, entrepreneurs who were participating in the GREEN EBDP had improved sustainable livelihoods and food security compared to those not participating in the programme as evidenced by requests from their neighbours and nearby wards to join the the programme, due to the positive developments they were noticing. During this period about 56 594 farmers 37 848 AF, 11 280 FY, 5 970AM and 1 496 MY implemented various techniques that mitigate the negative impacts of climate change&#xA0; in all nine districts and of these 18 819 farmers comprising of 12 173AF, 2509FY, 3 440AM and 697MY farmers who grew small grains had better harvest as they applied climate smart techniques promoted by the programme. Study circle materials development was completed for tubers, fish, piggery, small grains, oil seeds, indigenous forestry,fruit and woodlots production and marketing; financial literacy; Saving for Investment; ISAL record book; GSIYB; Business plan template; agroforestry options for smallholder farmers; climate change and adaptation techniques; domestic water harvesting; renewable energy options; SACCO manual and distribution of study circle materials for generate start and improve your business (GSIYB), business plan template, saving for investments, ISAL record book financial literacy, climate change, domestic water harvesting and small grains was done during the period under review and the remainder of the books will be distributed by June 2020 The programme encountered challenges that included a prolonged period of drought during 2019, cash shortages during the first half of the year and &#xA0;prolonged economic challenges with a closing annual inflation rate of 520% that resulted in several monetary policy changes. Implementation of some planned activities including the roll out of Green Investment Fund and trainings were delayed due to the challenges mentioned above and plans were put in place to keep the programme on track.</narrative>
