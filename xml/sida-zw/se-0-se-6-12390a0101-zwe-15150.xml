    <narrative xml:lang="EN">Examples of results achieved
Improved Legislation: Veritas consistently worked to support and created input in the enactment of sound and sustainable laws. Veritas did direct lobbying to improve Bills and Statutory Instruments, provided information to CSOs and often joined in with CSO lobbying. Further the organisation simplified laws, lobbied for public decision-making processes to be more open and transparent, and facilitated citizens, businesses and stakeholders to contribute meaningfully to policy and law-making. Veritas created input in the following Bills the Constitutional Amendment Bills (1 and 2), the Independent Complaints Mechanism Bill, the Cyber Security and Data Protection Bill, Attorney-General&apos;s Office Bill and National Prosecuting Authority Amendment Bill. Veritas further tracked the progress of all the Bills gazetted in Parliament, shared detailed analyses of the Bills and this increased the understanding of possible impact of laws on citizens and businesses&#xA0;
Veritas provided technical assistance to the Parliament and its Committees. Information and advice provided assisted Parliament to develop and perform its legislative functions more effectively. The Speaker of Parliament has been on record acknowledging the work and support of Veritas to Parliament.&#xA0;&#xA0;
Public engagement with Parliament promoted: Veritas focused on providing education and information on how public can have access to and involvement in Parliament as provided for in terms of section 141 of the Constitution. Such activities reinforced the efforts of Parliament through dissemination of information for a broadened reach. Veritas provided practical guidance to the members of the public on how to engage with the Parliament. The process and steps of engaging parliament became simplified and clearer. This awareness strengthened the public participation in governance issues and demystified the law-making process.
Reaching out to marginalised women: Veritas Women interactive online platforms reached out to marginalized groups who ordinarily face multiple challenges in accessing legal information and services. The majority of enquiries pertained to domestic violence, were referred to appropriate organisations that provide legal services or shelter like ZWLA and Msasa.
Veritas &#xA0;has amplified the women&#x2019; s issues and human rights discourse and unravelled human rights violations in communities and what recourses and resources are available to them through their platforms.
Work against Death Penalty: In March 2020 Veritas convened a capacity building and sensitisation meeting for journalists on the death penalty.&#xA0; 50 journalists participated, 22 of whom were females. This initiative increased advocacy towards abolition of the death penalty as a sentence in Zimbabwe.&#xA0; Journalists were targeted as key and primary drivers of change and influencers in the community. The advocacy initiative provided capacity building to the journalists, not only for increased reportage but correct reporting. Further to this, in May 2020, the Global Death Penalty Project, MPOI and Veritas launched their report on the death penalty titled; &#x201C;Time to abolish the death penalty in Zimbabwe: exploring the views of its opinion leaders&quot;. The launch was used to garner firm political will and commitment from the President of Zimbabwe to legislate for the abolishment of death penalty. Veritas after much hard work managed to get the President to write the foreword to the report. Veritas has prepared a Bill to take the death penalty off the statute book and, after we encouraged a debate in Parliament, a motion was raised to ask the Minister of Justice to introduce the Bill. Having the foreword to the report under the signature of the President was strategic for Veritas&#x2019; advocacy work, it encouraged the President and other policy-makers to endorse the efforts of Veritas towards the abolition of the death penalty. This was an essential first step as it assessed how the President is predisposed to move towards the abolishment of death penalty in Zimbabwe.&#xA0; The Speaker has arranged a joint session of Parliament with the President and distinguished guests to be present to try and get both Parliament and the Government to pass the Bill into law.
Interaction with UN Resident Co-ordinator&#x2019;s Office (UNRCO):&#xA0; The UN Human Rights Adviser and the Resident Co-ordinator receive our information and bulletins.&#xA0; Veritas supplied information to the UN Special Rapporteur on the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association;&#xA0; this was done before his visit and at a meeting he held with NGOs, as well as at a specific meeting he had with Veritas&#x2019;s Director and legal team.&#xA0; Veritas was invited to meetings on identifying areas for humanitarian intervention and the human rights situation in Zimbabwe.&#xA0; Veritas met the team assessing the needs of women and people with disabilities;&#xA0; we also met the UN Electoral Needs Assessment Team.
Use of Veritas&#x2019;s Work by the Legal Profession:&#xA0; Veritas&#x2019;s work on legislation and the Constitution was used as a basis for many important court cases, such as the case against the shutting down of the Internet, the challenges brought against financial regulations and against illegal police cordon and search activities.&#xA0;
Wide Reach and Use of Veritas&#x2019;s Work: Veritas&#x2019;s work reaches lawyers, law firms and legal institutions not only in Zimbabwe but also other countries, e.g. the Southern African Litigation Centre and the International Bar Association.&#xA0; As indicated in the section under media (see below) we reach the media in a spread of countries.&#xA0; Again as indicated below we reach several well-known think-tanks here and abroad.&#xA0; We get requests from academics from many countries &#x2013; USA, Canada, Ukraine and Indonesia to name a few.&#xA0; Nearer to home our work is used by a number of community-based organisations to inform not only their staff but also their constituents.
On Right to Demonstrate-Veritas disseminated a bulletin on the unconstitutional Government banning of a public demonstration scheduled for July 31st to protest against corruption, the prevailing poverty and low wages. First there were unwarranted pre-July 31st arrests on unsubstantiated charges.&#xA0; Veritas&#x2019;s opinions were cited in the media and amplified by other rights organisations and lawyers. Veritas also disseminated an opinion on the illegality of calling out the army under a public health pretext to round up people in the street around the time of the planned protest. We amplified this call for the right to demonstrate by disseminating statements emphasising this right by the ZHRC, the Catholics Bishops&#x2019; Conference, the Secretary General of the UN and other church, law and human rights organisations &#x2013;? all echoing the same view.
Clarifying and Consolidating COVID-19 Regulations: -Veritas tracked and explained all the promulgated statutory instruments that introduced various control and regulatory mechanisms for the pandemic. These regulations came out piecemeal in successive statutory instruments &#x2013; often poorly drafted and lacking clarity. Because regulations were cumulative and difficult to understand, Veritas provided consolidated updates after each new set of regulations. The regulations are promulgated under the Public Health Act and have sometimes overstepped the powers of the Act.
Work with Constitutional Commissions&#xA0; Veritas continued to work with the constitutional commissions, assisting them in distributing their reports and at times offering necessary technical support and advice to effectively execute their respective mandates. The Commission Watches, emailed to our large mailing list and also made available on our website, increased visibility of the work of these commissions, reaching out widely to more stakeholders. Veritas reinforced the efforts of The Zimbabwe Human Rights Commission [ZHRC] in particular, which has been active in supporting the right of freedom to demonstrate and protest, the right to identity documents, and other constitutional rights and calling on Government to stop using State machinery to instil &#x201C;fear and despondency&#x201D; [an offence that government critics are often accused of.]&#xA0;
Continuing Battle for Freedom of Speech:&#xA0; Veritas did a great deal of work on the Freedom of Information Bill, including monitoring its&#xA0;&#xA0; progress, disseminating analyses, doing advocacy with Parliament, civil society and the media and publicising opportunities for citizen input to improve the Bill.&#xA0; It was passed by Parliament on the 1st July 2020 with some improvements and is now an Act. While it is somewhat better than the Access to Information and Protection of Privacy Act [AIPPA], as Veritas&#x2019;s analyses showed, it still has provisions to stifle freedom of speech and left gaps that still have to be dealt with.&#xA0; Veritas had published an analysis of the Bill and tracked its progress through Parliament and publicised opportunities for citizen input.&#xA0;
Zimbabwe is facing the threat of a stifling Cyber Security and Data Protection Bill. In its current form it will have far reaching effects on freedom of expression and will legalise more State surveillance.&#xA0; The Bill has not yet been passed by the Lower House and Veritas issues constant reminders about its importance and the need to modify it and opportunities to input as it goes through the parliamentary process.&#xA0; Veritas commissioned a very good analysis and commentary on the Bill and also published one by a group of international media watchdogs.
A Step Towards Implementing Constitution Section 210:&#xA0; Following Veritas&apos; successful application in the Constitutional Court, the Government was ordered to enact a legislation implementing section 210, which requires an Act of Parliament to provide an effective and independent mechanism for receiving and investigating complaints from members of the public about misconduct on the part of members of the police, the Defence Forces, the intelligence services (CIO) and the Prisons and Correctional Service.&#xA0; In response to this order, he Zimbabwe Independent Complaints Commission Bill was gazetted on the 24th November 2020.&#xA0; At the request of the Attorney General Veritas drafted two alternative Bills for an Independent Complaints Mechanism [the second one was to site the independent mechanism within the ZHRC].&#xA0; The Government when it gazetted a Bill took a great number of Veritas Bill&#x2019;s provisions but also weakened the independence and scope of the mechanism and turned it into a new Commission [with all the delays that that will entail]&#xA0; Veritas has analysed the provisions of the Bill.&#xA0; Veritas has joined a number of CSO advocacy groups trying the improve the Bill&#xA0;
Preventing Retrogressive Changes to the Constitution:&#xA0; Veritas was the organisation that pointed out at the time that Constitution Amendment (No. 1) Bill of 2017 was passed without the required majority in the Senate. This was eventually confirmed by the Constitutional Court on 31st March 2020, over two and a half years later.&#xA0; We have continued tracking the Government&apos;s subsequent efforts to validate the passing of the Bill in accordance with the Constitutional Court&apos;s order, which still had not been finalised at the end of 2020.&#xA0;
At the same time, we have been fighting strenuously against the Constitution Amendment (No. 2) Bill which will centralise far more power in the Executive than under the Constitution as it is and at the same time diminish that of the Legislature and the Judiciary. We have managed to get the Minister of Justice to agree to remove one clause &#x2013; which would have kept secret debt incurred under certain international agreements.&#xA0; We continued to lobby against the other proposed changes and have disseminated an advocacy paper which we ensured, with the assistance of the Clerk of Parliament, reached every single one of the members of Parliament. Veritas took a leading role in creating technical and legal analysis of the Bill and its effects outlining in detail why the proposed amendments would be undemocratic in nature.&#xA0; We highlighted how the proposed Bill would disrupt the checks and balances system that are meant to safeguard the protection of fundamental freedoms in the Constitution.&#xA0; We conducted several workshops for civil society, etc the Forum, Crisis, the MISA to sensitise them on the flaws of the Bill and how it strengthens the Executive and weakened the Judiciary and the Legislature.&#xA0;
Live Streaming of Parliament&#x2019;s Work, Interviews for Commission and Judiciary Appointments: Veritas got permission to live-stream public interviews for appointments to the judiciary, and then permission from Parliament for live-streaming interviews for Commissioners and then, as part of their new project on Economic Governance, live streaming of Parliament&#x2019;s Public Accounts Committee.&#xA0; This has been welcomed &#x2013; especially that now because of COVID-19 public access has been limited.&#xA0; Now we have permission to live-stream other meeting of parliamentary committees, in particular we will cover all this year&#x2019;s budget meetings.&#xA0; This means that Veritas is increasingly reaching a wider geographical spread of users.
Increased demand for Veritas&#x2019;s electronic information service:&#xA0; COVID-19 has driven up the demand for Veritas&#x2019;s e-bulletins and the use of Veritas&#x2019;s websites.&#xA0; We had to increase the number of e-bulletins produced and disseminated.&#xA0; Because attendance at Parliamentary sessions was suspended for a while and then resumed with fewer parliamentarians meeting and others expected to contribute virtually, the Speaker of Parliament encouraged parliamentarians to make use of Veritas&#x2019;s service to prepare themselves on what was coming up, new legislation, etc.&#xA0; In sending out notices of parliamentary consultations for stakeholders and members of the public, Veritas stressed how contributions by email can be made in absence of physical attendance.&#xA0; Again Parliament has recognised the role played by Veritas for Parliament in fulfilling one of its roles &#x2013;to consult the public as provided for in terms of section 141 of the Constitution.&#xA0; Veritas is now tracking Cabinet briefings and posting them on our website.
Increased technical support to journalists: Veritas noted that the media has enormous responsibilities towards community empowerment thus provided continued technical support and backstopping on legal issues to journalists. Strengthening democracy and basic human freedoms, including freedom of expression, depends largely on the reporter&#x2019;s capacity to provide reliable information through responsible and professional reporting. Veritas manages 4 WhatsApp groups for journalists, it attends to queries and provides clarity to journalists on legal issues and upcoming laws.</narrative>
