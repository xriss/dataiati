    <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Joint Programme for Gender Equality (JPGE) in Zimbabwe was the gender equality flagship initiated under 2012-2015 cycle of the Zimbabwe&#x2019;s United Nations Development Assistance Framework (ZUNDAF). The overall development goal was &#x2018;to contribute to gender equality and women&#x2019;s empowerment in Zimbabwe through a coordinated, multi-sectoral approach.&#x2019;
The JPGE was aimed to: (1) reduce gender based violence; (2) increase women&#x2019;s participation and representation in political and decision-making structures; (3) increase women&#x2019;s economic empowerment and improve working conditions; and (4) strengthen national accountability on gender equality and women&#x2019;s empowerment.
Pillar 1 on Combating all forms of Gender Based Violence did not receive funding, however, interventions on GBV were supported through the UNFPA Integrated Support Programme and the Joint Programme on GBV implemented by UN Women and UNICEF with support from the Danish Embassy. GBV also was mainstreamed into all of the other three pillars.
Pillar 2 - Women&#x2019;s Political Participation and Influence:&#xA0;Over the three-year period (2014&#x2013; 2017), more institutions were created and existing ones strengthened to promote women&#x2019;s participation in politics and decision-making. This included the establishment of the Zimbabwe Gender Commission as newly provided for in the 2013 Constitution; the strengthening of the Ministry of Women Affars, Gender and Community Developmen (MWAGCD) to effectively coordinate and monitor Government&#x2019;s progress in achieving gender equality and women&#x2019;s empowerment; and through the development of a strong voice and alliance among women across all political parties for equal gender representation in politics and political leadership. Parliament, as one of the key branches of Government with the responsibility for the enactment and enforcement of the Constitution and laws, was strengthened through technical support and engagements with the Gender and Justice Portfolio Committees, and the ZWPC, to play its critical oversight role to ensure that laws, such as the Electoral Amendment Act, the Local Authorities Bill, the General Amendments Law, among others, are harmonized and aligned to the gender equality and women&#x2019;s rights provisions in the Constitution.
Furthermore, the JPGE strengthened the gender policy analysis and advocacy capacity of the Zimbabwe Gender Commisison, Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (ZEC), Zimbabwe Women&#x2019;s Parliamentary Caucus, MWAGCD, and of women and men politicians, to promote women&#x2019;s participation in politics and women&#x2019;s equal representation in leadership positions in all sectors. As a result, a national strategy was developed and amplified voices for a gender-responsive political landscape, in the run-up to the 2018 general elections. One of the first plans of its kind, a National Strategy to Increase Women&#x2019;s Participation in Decision-Making Positions in Political, Public and Private Sectors8 (Indicator 1) was produced during the JPGE. The Embassy asseses that although strategies were put in place to increase womrn&apos;s political participation, it was difficult to attain meangful numbers in Parliament&#xA0;
Pillar 3 - Women&#x2019;s Economic Empowerment and Working Conditions:&#xA0;Approximately 25% of beneficiaries (3,769 women) in the rural communities of Murewa, Macheke, Gutu, Chivi, Nyanga and Mutoko districts were reached through JPGE Pillar 3 economic empowerment initiatives which included internal savings and lending schemes; training in business skills; access to markets and to appropriate technology that improved the viability of their businesses. Approximately 1,093 of these women accessed loans from several microfinance institutions and banks. The women also gained social empowerment skills, such as increased confidence in themselves, which when coupled with more funds to support their families, raised their status in their communities and in their individual homes. This is an important achievement of the JPGE.&#xA0;
Furthrmore, thirty-five (35) key institutions including twenty two ( 22) Government Ministries; the Zimbabwe Federation Trade Unions (ZFTU), Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU), Employers&#x2019; Confederation of Zimbabwe (EMCOZ), as well as two National Employment Councils (NECs) associated with ZFTU and ZCTU and government technocrats in the Province and District Implementation Committees (PICs and DICs) were strengthened to integrate gender equality and equity into laws and policies to create a conducive environment for women&#x2019;s participation in the economy.
Three draft legal instruments were developed with support from the JPGE, these included the draft Mines and Minerals Amendment Bill and the Minerals, Exploration and Marketing Corporation Bill. Both bills have provisions for the equal representation of women and men on the Mines and Minerals Board. With respect to improved working conditions, a revised draft Labour Bill was developed with an amendment under Section 18 which provides for women workers&#x2019; entitlement to 98 days of maternity leave but on condition that they would have been employed by the current employer for at least one year; this qualifying period has now been removed from the Act making all women eligible to 98 days of maternity leave regardless of period of employment.
Organizations with expertise in the private sector and agribusiness also adopted gender mainstreaming strategies, such as gender responsive budgeting, gender analysis and gender transformation training. Partners such as SNV, the Murewa Rural District Council and Provincial and District Implementation Committees are now using this knowledge in their programming.
Pillar 4 - National Accountability on Gender Equality and Women&#x2019;s Empowerment:&#xA0;In accordance with the constitution, The Zimbabwe Gender Commission was established (Indicator 1) and became operational in 2016. The programme strengthened the ZGC&#x2019;s capacity to play its oversight role of monitoring compliance by national institutions to the gender equality and women&#x2019;s rights commitments through the development of key policies and plans, such as the ZGC Strategic Plan (2016-2021), operational manuals, and an investigations and complaints manual. A Gender Technical Advisor was seconded to the ZGC to operationalize its Secretariat. The nine (9) commissioners (five women and four men) reported improved knowledge and understanding of the ZGC constitutional mandate (Indicator 2) as a result of a JPGE-supported capacity building programme that focused on the following areas: (1) the Constitution and the ZGC&#x2019;s Constitutional Mandate; (2) Gender Equality and Women&#x2019;s Rights; (3) Communicating Gender Equality and Women&#x2019;s Rights to key stakeholders and broad audiences using mainstream media and social media platforms; (4) Handling Complaints and Conducting Investigations on violations of women&#x2019;s rights and sex discrimination, among other areas. Through their participation in the 60th Session of the Commission on the Status of Women, the ZGC engaged with Commissions from Kenya and Uganda to share experiences and learnings on how to be effective as an independent entity with the mandate to protect, promote and monitor gender equality and women&#x2019;s rights. The ZGC also under took a study tour to Kenya.
The JPGE also provided technical and financial support to the ZGC to prepare its first Annual Report to Parliament and to convene the inaugural National Gender Forum. JPGE-supported engagements with academia, the private sector, men and women in communities in four districts, Parliamentarians and politicians in political parties further broadened the ZGC&#x2019;s knowledge and insights into the scope and range of gender inequalities and forms of discrimination women and girls experience.</narrative>
