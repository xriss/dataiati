   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Oxfam, in partnership Forum for African Women Educationalists Uganda (FAWEU), has been implementing since 2008, an advocacy projectwhose main aim is to promote girls# education in 12 districts located in Northern Uganda, West Nile and Sebei region. The first phase ended in 2010 with an external evaluation, whose report showed noteworthy achievements in promotion of girls# education as evidenced by improved education of girls in the project schools in terms of increased enrolment and retention.  The Project has been documented as a good practice in community advocacy for promotion of girls# education and in menstruation management shared in different education fora such as Forum for Education NGOs (FENU), gender task force of the Ministry of Education and Sports and with other stakeholders. Researchers, Government and Civil Society Organizations (CSOs) have visited the project schools as part of learning. As aresult of the good practices registered in the 1st phase, the Advocacy Project was renewed for three years beginning 2012 to 2014 in the same 12 districts of Gulu, Kapchorwa, Amolotar, Dokolo, Pader, Kitgum, Moyo, Yumbe, Adjumani, Nebbi, Nwoya (formerly Amuru)  and Oyam. The second phase continues to target teachers, pupils and community members askey actors/stakeholders in promotion of girls# education.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">FAWEU - GENERAL GRANTS FORUM FOR AFRICAN WOMEN EDUCATIONIS</narrative>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Forum for African Women Educationalists Uganda Chapter (FAWEU), was established in Uganda on February 27, 1997. Its purpose is to address gender disparities in education, manifest in low rates of access, retention and performance of girls in upper primary school and secondary school. It means to offers a rallying point for women to achieve the Education for All (EFA) goals by bridging thegender gap in education.
FAWEU&apos;s objectives are to increase access for girls to education; to increase awarenessand create consensus among all stakeholders on the overall advantages of girls&apos; education and thus create action at all levels; to improve the access, retention rates and performance of disadvantaged girls until they have completed all levels of education; to build new partnerships and strengthen already existing partnerships and collaborations; to support organisational development for sustainability; and to monitor the effectiveness and impact of FAWEU&apos;s interventions.
The fields of activities are influencing policy and their adoption and implementation for promoting girls&apos; education, and advocacy for increased investment in girls&apos; education; empowerment through education;
demonstration of models of best practice for replication and multiplication.
FAWEU is a membership organisation with over 400 members. They range from the young to the old across Uganda, have varied professional expertise which the organisation uses to realise its programme objectives. FAWEU&apos;s members include professional women highly placed in government, the private sector and non-governmental organisations. These professional women supplement the secretariat&apos;s little staff by participating in the implementation of several activities. Many of the professional women act as role models to motivate the girls to stay in school, perform and excel. They make routine school visits, have time with the girls in mentoring sessions, and counsel them to work hard. This is one of the methods that FAWEU has employed to motivate girls to work hard, stay in school, and move on to higher levels of education. FAWEU&apos;s membership also extends to women parliamentarians who pave the way for advocacy and influencing policy. The Uganda Association of Women Parliamentarians is a registered FAWEU member.They are the voice through which FAWEU plans to implement the advocacy strategies.
In addition there are the District Task Force Committees; FAWEU&apos;s link to the districts and communities. FAWEU does not have field offices. Work is implemented through the District Education Offices, which spearhead the activities, but a Task Force Committee is selected made up of people from the education office and the other district social and political departments. This committee co-ordinatesFAWEU activities at the district level, participates in the planning processes and also monitors and evaluates the implementation of activities. The committee also sets by-laws that promote the education of the girl child and ensures that the by-laws and government policies are enforced. The committee advises FAWEU on other education actors in the district and at the grassroots level to achieve synergies and harmonise programming and activity implementation.
FAWEU&apos;s main strength lies in the composition of its members. They range from high level education policy-makers to grassroots community members. Its other strength lies in its wide network in theregions in the country, where FAWEU operates through the already existing education structures and systems, from the district to the school level. This enables FAWEU to reach girls in disadvantaged rural and marginalised grassroots communities. FAWEU&apos;s vision of eliminating gender disparities in education, shared by all national chapters across Africa, has given the organisation distinct leadership in the promotion of girls&apos; education.
Intervention strategies: to influence education policies with special emphasis on improving girls&apos; access, retention and performance in education; to build stakeholders&apos; awareness and consensus on theoverall advantages of girls&apos; education, through advocacy for action at all levels, with an emphasis on the grassroots level; to demonstrate, through interventions on the ground, how to improve the access, retention and performance of disadvantaged girls,with a view to influencing, replication and mainstreaming best practices into the national education system; to establish new and strengthen existing strategic partnerships and collaboration for accelerated progress towards achieving gender equity and equality in education; to undertake organisational development to ensure the sustainability of the organisation and its activities; to involve the stakeholders and/or beneficiaries in the implementation process right from the start of the project; to provide adequate explanation on issues related to gender and ensure the participation of both sexes at all levels of implementation; to create awareness on the issues of gender and HIV and AIDS in particular its prevention and spread; to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness and impact of FAWEU&apos;s interventions in improving gender equity and equality in education.</narrative>
