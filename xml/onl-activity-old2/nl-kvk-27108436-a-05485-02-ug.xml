  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">CEFORD will undertake a rapid environmental assessment to generate information that can inform design of projects to promote sustainable natural resource management.
2. REA#s purpose and objectives:
The purpose of REA is a) to ensure that information on the significant environment effects of plan and project strategy is collected and made available to decision-makers prior to plan and projectstrategy. b) REA also extends opportunities for local decision making and increases transparency.
The objectives of REA are:
To provide, identify, describe and report on environmental impacts-both negative and positive.
To help us to forecast the likely consequences of massive environmental intervention like deforestation.
To give us (planners) the basis for predicting, preventing and remedying both natural and man-made environment.
Identifying natural resource management activities that directly combine economic and environmental benefits which will inform design of future programmes.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">COMMUNITY EMPOWERMENT FOR RURAL DEV CEFORD</narrative>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The history of Community Empowerment for Rural Development (CEFORD) dates back to 1993 when the Uganda government, with the financial and technical support of the Dutch government, implemented the Community Action Program (CAP) and later the Women Empowerment Program (WEP) in the West Nile region. Both programs were considered successes by the communities and district local governments of West Nile, and external evaluators and the Dutch embassy in Uganda. The focus was on community mobilisation and capacity building through service delivery and the implementation of micro-projects. CAP concentrated on the supply of social infrastructure services and the implementation of agricultural projects, while WEP concentrated on the empowerment of women and the strengthening of their capacities to participate in the development process.
Thus CEFORD was founded, to fill the gap created by the closure of these successful programs that were phased out in June 2000. CEFORD operates in parts of all the five districts of Adjumani, Arua, Moyo, Nebbi and Yumbe.
It was founded in July 2000 but the process of its formation dates back to 1998, to an internal reflection workshop of CAP staff that identified possible scenarios for the future. One scenario suggested a merger of CAP and WEP into a local NGO.
The decentralisation of government to districts in Uganda also demanded strong civil society organisations that could support local governments indelivering services.
CEFORD&apos;s major achievements in the last three years include a participatory poverty assessment in the districts of Arua and Nebbi. Through these assessments CEFORD gave objective feedback from poor women and men to the district and central governments, and to some donor.
It was also successful in supporting the Adjumani district local government in facilitating the formulation of all its sub-county development plans. This enhanced its chance of accessing funds from the central government, from which the communities would benefit.
And CEFORD strengthened the capacities of four local organisations through organisational self-assessment and the facilitation of strategic planning. The performance of these organisations has since improved. It also mobilised and linked ten community-based organisations to funding for agricultural activities; over 30 million Ugandan shillings from the German Development Services.
CEFORD&apos;s Mission is to improve the capacity of women, men, children and their organisations in the more disadvantaged communities of West Nile effectively to articulate their demands and interests, to increase their production and income in a sustainable way and to secure better access to services.
The institutional objectives of CEFORD are to contribute to the following policy and practice changes in West Nile: food and income security is guaranteed, communities have positive attitude to the enrolment and retention of girls in schools, there is active participation of the population in district and sub-county planning and policy formulation (especially around issues of natural resources, peace and security),  peace and security in the region are consolidated especially at the household level, and women are empowered to participate as equal partners to men in decision-making and control over resources at the household and community levels.</narrative>
