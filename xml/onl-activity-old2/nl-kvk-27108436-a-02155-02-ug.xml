   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Health Rights Action Group (HAG) is a civil society organisation, founded in 2001, which is dedicated to promoting the human and health rights of people living with and affected by all diseases, in particular HIV and AIDS. HAG evolved out of a group called the Womens Treatment Action Group (WTAG) which was originally formed by nine members, seven of whom were women living with HIV and AIDS toprovoke government by providing Anti Retroviral treatment to its members which was beginning to become available at that time to demonstrate that universal treatment was possibility.
Due to the dynamic nature of the HIV and AIDS epidemic, the Women Treatment Action Group (WTAG) realised the need to involve a wider range of people if their objectives and dreams wereto be realised hence the creation of HAG. From a small support group of activists, HAG has grown into a formidable organisation in Uganda leading the fight to address disparities and abuse in the health service delivery. From a diminutive secretariat manned by one staff member, HAG has now grown both at secretariat and institutional level with a fully fledged Secretariat currently with a staff of 9, equipped with more resources to effectively implement programs.
From nine members, its membership has nowgrown to 378 and is still growing among which a functional board was elected.
HAGs initial programs took up the theme of prevention of mother to child HIV transmission and promoting access to health care for people living with HIV and AIDS. Subsequently, the focus was enlarged to encompass a wider-ranging humanrights-based approach to HIV and AIDS. As the organisation has grown, it has expanded its work to include HIV prevention activities. It has also undertaken research studies on the human rights and information needs of people living with HIV and AIDS (PHAs), carried out awareness-raising on behaviour change; worked with the private sector to initiate sector specific polices on HIV and AIDS in the work place; implemented national campaigns on treatment and on positive living; trained human rights monitors at district level to act as watchdogs for the rights of OVCs (Orphans and Vulnerable Children) and carried out training on succession planning.</narrative>
