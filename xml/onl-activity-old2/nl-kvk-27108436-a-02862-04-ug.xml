   <narrative xml:lang="EN">We Can Campaign (WCC) is a global intervention  initiated by Oxfam and committed to end all violence against Women (VAW).The campaign seeks to build a social movement of individuals committed to oppose all VAW in their personal relationships and communities and aims to achieve this through alliance building;   with a broad range of influential individuals  and institutions such as cultural leaders, Community role models, artistes, the  Civil society Organizations,  educational and religious and government institutions, among others. The campaign also uses high profile communication activities, aimed at   creating a supportive environment for personal change. In Uganda the campaign was launched in March 2010 initially in Central and Rwenzori regions of Uganda and later in West Nileand Northern Uganda.  The overall goal of the campaign is to reduce the social tolerance and acceptance of domestic violence and other forms of Gender Based Violence (GBV) in Uganda through a positive shift in knowledge, attitudes, practices and beliefs that perpetuate and condone the problem.  This will be done by creating a popular social movement  with a range of local, national and international  Civil Society Organisations  working towards ending Violence Against Women in Uganda; creating a fundamental shift in social attitudes and beliefs that perpetuates VAW; and mobilising men and women from all sections of the community to engage as quality change makers and question the normalisation of domestic violence and other forms of violence against women.</narrative>

It was formed in July 2000 by Community Business Advisors (CBAs) who worked with Joint Encouragement of New gainful Activity (JENGA), a project of CARE International in Uganda. The formation was motivated by numerous reasons. First, the West Nile region is the poorest in Uganda with over 6 in ten people living below US$ 1 a day. Second, many development interventions excluded the poorest people in the communities and the business advisors felt they could continue providingBusiness Development Services (BDS) in all the Districts in the Region. In the face of difficulty in accessing financial services for poor people, this organization provided hope and sustainable solutions to local people#s problems.
The organisation believes in the fact that the poor have the strength and will to get out of poverty and indeed this region can, and should, develop at a faster pace; and that any meaningful development is endogenous and is an integral function of both improved well-being and people#s economicempowerment.

 Since its formation in July,2000 with support of CARE International in Uganda, the organization registered a number of successes and transformed the lives of many poor people especially therural and peri-urban poor women and girls through partnering and implementing livelihood projects with a number of Partners and donors as indicated below;
