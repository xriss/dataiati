   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Universal Access to Female Condoms Joint Programme
The generally low rates of condom use, the high levels of unmet needs for protection methods, the higher STI/HIV incidence and prevalence rates for women and their additional risk of unintended pregnancies provide a strong rationale for promoting female condoms. Massive social marketing and exposure to female condoms will eventually decrease the cultural sensitiveness, myths and misconceptions surrounding the use of female condoms and promotion of women#s reproductive health in general.

The route to follow for female condoms to become an ordinary household product involves # as was the case for male condoms # prolonged large-scale (mass media) campaigns, easy access and availability, as well as education,  awareness-raising and national and international advocacy.

The UAFC Joint Programme has formulated three overall programme objectives (OPOs) for the period 2012-2015:
# increased availability and affordability of quality female condoms
# increased demand and sustained use of female condoms
# increased international and national financial and political support

The UAFC Joint Programme implements country programmes through social marketing organizations in Nigeria, Cameroon and Mozambique. UAFC further works with international actors as the UN Commission on Life Saving Commodities for Women and Children and the Family Planning 2020 Initiative as a means to accelerate progress towards universal access of female condoms as female condoms continue to be underutilized and undervalued commodities. Other actors include, bilateral donors, UNFPA, UNAIDS, WHO, Private Foundations, Governments and manufacturers.
The first phase of the programme (2009-2011) was positively externally evaluated. The programme is currently into the second phase (2013 # 2015.) The UAFC Joint Programme is a partnership between Oxfam Novib, Rutgers WPF, i+solutions and the Netherlands# Ministry of Foreign Affairs. UAFC is governed by an international steering group.  Current donors are the Netherlands# Ministry of Foreign Affairs, SIDA and the Hewlett Foundation.</narrative>
