  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The World Citizens Panel is an impact measurement method developed by Oxfam. The focus is on measuring changes in peoples&apos; lives bycombining quantitative research (impact surveys) among Oxfam#s  target population and a control group with qualitative research (stories of change) and thus give participants a voice.  This project will help Oxfam understand how programmes can be improved, as well as contribute to the public debate on effectiveness of development cooperation.  The project builds on a previous startup workshopin which Oxfam agreed on how to undertake this impact survey.  Thereafter a reflection workshop was held to discuss the main findings based on the data collected among 14 partners with more than 4.000 respondents. The next step is to train partners in collectingqualitative stories of change in order to deepen the insights gained from the impact survey and get a better understanding of the changes that happened in people&apos;s lives. An impact report will be published, based on the surveysand the stories of change. For more information on the background of the World Citizens Panel, preliminary results and publications, please visit www.worldcitizenspanel.com.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">UNATU Uganda National Teachers Unio</narrative>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Uganda National Teachers Union (UNATU) was formed in 2003to advocate and bargain for improved living and working conditions of our members and to promote the cause of education development in Uganda. UNATU was born out of a merger between UNUT(Uganda National Union of Teachers) and UTA (Uganda Teachers# Association). The acronyms were coined to form UNATU without compromising the interests ofthe merging groups. UNUT was mainly comprising of secondary teachers while UTA primary. Upon the merger UNATU wasstructurally reorganized based on the new principles of labour unions. In2003, Uganda National Teachers Union (UNATU) was registered as teacher#s labour union under the trade union act of 1971 as amended in 2016 to protect the interest of teachers in thecountry and promote the cause of education development in the country.  Since then the UNATU has grown into a strong and credible teacher union with over 140,000 members in the country.

UNATU has been operating on democratic principles by holding regular free and fair elections every five years guided bythe  Union  constitution. The union has successfully implemented and externally evaluated two strategic plans and now implementing a new plan 2018/2022. UNATU has established structures from school to a national level.

UNATU has a national secretariat headed by a General Secretary with 41 staff of which 20 of them are spread in the 10 regions across the country. The union is gender sensitive with a constitutional provision of at least 1/3 female representation in the leadership at all levels. This has been effective at school level where a female and male preventative at elected.

The Gender strategy was developed  and launched in 2012 and guided by this strategy we have been implementing a numberof programs under our Gender and women empowerment intervention.
2. ACHIEVEMENTS
What have been the principal results in the past three years that contribute to significant, structural, sustained and positive improvement in the lives of men, women, girls and boys suffering from poverty, injustice, insecurity and exclusion?

UNATU hasbeen instrumental in running successful education campaigns that have contributed to more children accessing a quality public education. For example through the  qualitypublic education campaign, there was evidence in increase in teachers# time on task in the school reached and improved learning outcomes.

UNATU has engaged in close dialogue with Government, multi/bilateral agencies and civilsociety at all levels in order to bring attention to the plight of the teachers in the country, children school feeding, child labour, girls education and  capitation grants. Our contribution has lead to an increase in capitation grant from 7,000 to 10,000/=, thereleases which used to be quarterly and now termly, Our research on school feeding is one of the researches that guided discussionsin Parliament and other high level circles.

UNATU#s work has been recognized particularly in the area of support to unionizing teachers across levels and mobilizing them for professional responsibility and accountability.

UNATU#s advocacy campaigns for teachers# remuneration and welfare  and other labour rights have been very instrumental; important to mention is the issue of the head teachers who were required to have a bachelors degree in education in order to retain their positions. UNATU advocacy led to the reversalof this unfair demand from the head teachers in 2016.  UNATU#s actions yielded 50% salary enhancement of teachers across board implemented in the last 5 years.

Establishment of the teachers SACCO and its other sub-branches in the country has presented an opportunity for the teachers to have access to affordable credit and on the flip side will help to control teachers# vulnerability to moneylenders and other expensive credit facility in the country.

4. STRATEGIC POSITIONING
Analyse the environment in which the organisation works? Who are the other relevant social actors, including government and business, and what roles do they play? #In this context, what is unique about the position of the organisation?

Uganda National Teachers Union is a legal entity operating as a labour union established under thetrade union act of 1971 as amended in 2016; as result UNATU isa recognised a public service teachers union and hence forms part of the negotiation and consultative council under the Ministry of Public service.

Fundamentally three Sustainable Development Goals are relevant to UNATUs work; SDG 4 on education and SDG 8; on Labour and SDG 5 on gender equality. SDG 4 commits to #Ensure inclusive and quality education for all and promote lifelong learning# while SDG 8 commits to #Decent work and economic growth#Promoting the Decent Work Agenda (DWA) remains the main objective of the trade union input into the 2030 Agenda.

UNATUhas a network of partners both local and national that help put forward its agenda through different interventions. UNATU affiliated to National organisation of trade union as its labour centre, Federation of East African Trade Unions at East African level. The union is also affiliated to Pan African teachers centre based in Togo. Globally UNATU is a member of Education Intentional(EI) a global education movementwith more than 170 countries and more than 32 million educators across the globe. UNATU is therefore uniquely positioned with local, national regional and global allies to champion the cause of education.</narrative>
