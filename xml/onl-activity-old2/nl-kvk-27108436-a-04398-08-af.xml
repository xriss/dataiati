  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In order to bring about positive sustainable changes in the lives of people and their organisations, Oxfam Afghanistan will continue with capacity building interventions for its own staff, partner organizations, and other civil society/grassroots organizations (working within our geographical programme area). This is consistent with Oxfam Afghanistan#s strategic plan and Oxfam Global-CapacityBuilding Policy emphasising our continued commitment to work with and through partnerships. Oxfam has developed aconcept for a period of one year in order to roll out its capacity building mandate.

Oxfam pursues its vision through multiple sets of action agenda.Firstly, direct partnership with LNGOs and vulnerable communities for facilitating their local initiatives. Secondly, contribute towards reducing poverty and social disparities, ensuring basic services, and institution building through increasing participation inlocal governance and protecting environment. Another action agenda is to influence policy processes by promoting articulation of the perspectives of the poor and disadvantaged. This may be achieved by facilitating alliance/networks among various civil society actors.
Supporting and nurturing these agenda, Oxfam#s Programme along with relevant support functions will carry forward Oxfam#s agenda for capacity building with a view to promote self-identity, self-reliance and self-growth of marginalized communities. Oxfam seeksto strengthen and widen the process of learning across a variety of relevant themes and contexts of different stakeholders in social development at different levels. It will mainly focus on the processes of transfer and exchange of knowledge and experiences, as well as the provision of technical expertise.

MISSION:
Capacity Building Programme#s mission is to contribute to sustainable changes, poverty reduction in Afghanistan by strengthening the capacity of Oxfam and other citizen organizations. We will work to accomplish this mission through following: human resource development, institutional strengthening, organizational development, creating an enabling environment through discussion, discourse and publications.

AIM of the PROGRAMME:
Help reduce poverty by supporting Civil Society Organizations, primarily serving rural constituencies, through building managerial and technical competence so that they can realise their potential of empowering people.

MODUS OPERANDI:
# human resource development, by providing staff training and supporting personnel policy;
# organizational development by improving internal processes and structures, financial durability and the management culture within partner organizations improve their management;
# institutional strengthening by strengthening the capacities of partner organizations and networks in areas such as advocacy, institutional learning, and the formations of strategic alliances;
# building social partnerships by building bridges between the government, and NGOs;
# advocacy to create and flourish the culture of discourse, debate and critical analysis of local and national issues; also by assisting NGOs in organizing national debate on key issues or getting articles in Oxfam#s newsletter for discussion and debate;
# association-building and network development by facilitating dialogue and networking among NGOs and NGO support groups through Discussion Fora and by being members to different consortiums and forums;

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Afghanistan Public Policy Research Organization (APPRO) is an independent social research organization with a mandate to promote social and policy learning to benefit development efforts in Afghanistan and other less developed countries through conducting social scientific research, monitoring and evaluation, and training and mentoring. APPRO is registered with the Ministry of Economy in Afghanistan as a non-profit non-government organization and headquartered in Kabul, Afghanistan with regional offices in Mazar-e Sharif (north), Herat (west), Kandahar (south), Jalalabad (east), and Bamyan (center). APPRO and its individual researchers have undertakenprojects in Europe, Central Asia, Pakistan, India, Africa, China, and Turkey.

APPRO is also a founding member of APPRO-Europe, a network association for disseminating applied research findings from conflict environments, conducting training on the policy process, and carrying out evaluations.

APPRO#s mission is to facilitate critical dialogue on development policy for less developed, in- and post-conflict countries. This mission has two components. The first component is to measure development progress against strategicreconstruction objectives and provide insights into how to improve performance against the milestones set by the national governments and their international donors. The second component is to train and mentor a pool of national researchers to conduct applied research, practical training with a focus on the policy process, and evaluations consistent with internationally recognized standards. Findings from APPRO#s research and evaluations are disseminated to address existing and pressing knowledge gaps in the policy makingprocess and to advance the learning of researchers, academics, and decision and policy makers at all levels.
Approach to Research, Monitoring and Evaluation, and Training
APPRO#s key strength is its ability to work under difficult operating conditions while adhering to the highest standards in social scientific inquiry. APPRO conducts research, monitoring and evaluation, and training on the crosscutting themes of Human Security, Political Economy, Governance, Aid Effectiveness, and Natural Resource and Environmental Management. The focus of APPRO#s work is to promote dialogue and collaboration between parties with varying or competing agendas who share a focus on reconstruction. APPRO recognizes that in any policy environment, intended solutions create new and unaccounted for problems. As a result, research at APPROis focused on a close examination of the interface between new and pre-existing forms of organization. Particular attention is paid to identifying and mapping autochthonous, or organic, structures and optimal ways through which policy solutions can be absorbed by these structures.

The approach to social research, monitoring and evaluation, and training at APPRO is, in essence, #institutionalist# and policy-oriented. In its work APPRO employs a notion of institutions that encompasses allmanner of social, economic, and political structures through which a given locale or territory is governed. This broad spectrum of institutions includes habits, customs, and religious values as well as social networks based on ethnicity, economic interest, or politicalallegiance, and formal rules, regulations, and government structures. Understanding how the process of development is governed, therefore, requires taking a full inventory of the institutions through which development intervention can be provided.

Sinceits founding in 2008 APPRO has conducted research, designed and implemented monitoring projects, carried out evaluations, and conducted policy training at numerous Afghan ministries for a variety of donors including the Government of Afghanistan, WorldBank, Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs, UNICEF # Afghanistan, CIDA, CARE # Afghanistan, UNDP, Cordaid, GiZ, Cordaid, and Oxfam Novib.
Research
APPRO#s research is supported by the strong academic credentials of its experienced senior research staff whichensures compliance with internationally recognized standards for rigorous and applied social scientific research. Because of the academic affiliation of its senior research staff, APPRO is in a unique position to remain informed of the latest thinkingon a variety of development issues. This affiliation also enables APPRO to utilize the latest methods for, and innovations in, social scientific inquiry in an applied manner and in challenging operating environments such as Afghanistan. The key areas of research are:

Political Economy: This theme explores the organization of economic activity in rural and urban settings at the macro-, meso- and micro-scales of analysis. APPRO views the political economy as a product of the interactions between variouseconomic actors with vested interests constrained or enabled by different contextual factors. Effecting change in the political economy thus requires in-depth understanding of the physical and material conditions, demographic features, and the manner in whichpolicy decisions are made. To date, APPRO has carried out a number of research projects on informal labor markets, business climate, micro enterprises, urban economic development, service provision in urban areas, rural economic development, migration and economic development, climate change and rural food security, domestic and international trade, women in business, corruption, and value chain analysis of agricultural products.

The scale of analysis ranges from organizational, e.g., enterprise production, to sub-national, national, and international. At all scales of analysis a value chain approach is adopted to map and analyze processes in their entirety to establish where efficiencies can be incorporated into the system, how equity in production and resource use can be increased, and how adverse environmental and social impacts can be eliminated, minimized or managed. To date APPRO has applied this approach to examining the impact of climate change on agricultural production, gender and agricultural production, micro foundations of value chains, realignment of domestic products# markets, and the agricultural innovation systems of selected products. These studies have focused on the innovative capacity, coping strategies, and system resiliencies and potential for expansion and growth. See Publications for sample reports.

Governance: This theme examines the dynamics of societal and organizational transformation toward a legitimate, democratic, inclusive, and sustainable mode of governance, payingparticular attention to the formal and informal institutions through which governance is exercised, changes that result in a more legitimacy for the government, and efforts likely to increase general consent about and legitimacy of the governing bodies. Studies under this theme place particular emphasis on the linkages between governance and its institutions, both formal/tangible and informal/intangible, and the trade-offs that need to be made between social, economic, and political considerations and priorities. Governance is researched at multiple jurisdictional scales descriptively (i.e., governance of X) and normatively (i.e., governance for X). Based on this holistic view of governance, APPRO provides training on the policy process and institutionalanalysis to governmental and non-governmental bodies. Given the demographics of less and least developed countries, governance research at APPRO pays particular attention to the role of youth and women in governance. See Training for more information.

Human Security: This theme examines socio-economic, civil and political issues from a human rights perspective. There are a number of international conventions promoting social and economic, civil and political rights to which governments of less and least developed countries have signed up. Research under this theme aims to enhance understanding and appreciation of the numerous barriers that prevent the signee governmentsfrom meeting their human rights commitments. The research also aims to increase consensus on how national and international donors can work more strategically and coherently to integrate human rights in development aid programming. To date, APPRO has carried out a number of research projects on material and rights protection issues including access to health, education, and justice. Related research under this theme includes critical analysis of anti-corruption programming, public service provision including sanitation, and employment. See Presentations for highlighted findings under this theme.

Aid Effectiveness: Work under Aid Effectiveness is intended to inform the government, civil society, and the international development community about successes and pitfalls of development aid intervention through a systemic examinationof the flows, processes, outputs, and impacts of intervention. APPRO has evaluated a large number of programs and projects implemented by national and international organizations. While the findings from these evaluations remain confidential to APPRO#s clients, theevaluations have provided in-depth insights into operational issues and challengesassociated with development aid provision in a variety of contexts including humanitarian aid, women#s rights, vocational training,security sector reform, access to justice, access to health and education, natural resource management, and agricultural development. The learning from these evaluations has provided APPRO with a rich reservoir of knowledge for designing applied social research, monitoring systems, evaluations, and training. See Training for more information. See Publications for sample reports.

Natural Resource and Environmental Management: This theme focuses on how the sustainability of resource use and environmental management can be increasedthrough adopting a mix of traditional and modern (technological) approaches. APPRO#s research under this theme emphasizes the crucial linkages that need to be made between modern approaches to natural resource management and generations-old and (often) sustainable resource use and coping strategies. The scale of analysis ranges from organizational (e.g., enterprise production) to sub-national and national. At all scales of analysis a lifecycle approach is adopted to map and analyze processes to establishwhere efficiencies can be incorporated into the system, how equity in resource use can be increased, and how adverse environmental impacts canbe eliminated, minimized or managed. APPRO has applied this approach to examining the impact of climate change on agricultural production, gender and agricultural production, and the agricultural innovation systems for selected products.

All research reports areplaced in public domain through APPRO#s website at: www.appro.org.af
Monitoring and Evaluation
To date APPRO has conducted over 30 evaluations of donor funded programs and projects on education, health, humanitarian aid, food for work, food security, vocational training for women, access to the legal system for women, and access to services in urban areas. APPRO has also developed monitoring systems for tracking changes in women#s conditions in the context of transition of security responsibility from international to national security forces and the conditions of women in the Afghan National Police.

Whilethe findings from evaluations remain confidential to APPRO#s clients, the evaluations and monitoring projects have provided APPRO with in-depth insights into operational issues and challenges associated with development aid provision in a varietyof contexts including humanitarian aid, women#s rights, vocational training, security sector reform, access to services, natural resource management, and education. Based on the learning from evaluations and monitoring programs, APPRO provides training modules onthe dynamics of the policy process and program / project design.
Training
APPRO#s training in policy development and implementation is supported by the strong academic and professional credentialsof its senior researchers. In policy analysis training,APPRO#steam of trainers has provided guidance to ministerial officials on how to conduct baseline assessments and develop policy dialogue, design policy, develop policy implementation plans, design monitoringsystems, develop usable indicators,and analyze outcomes to inform policy revision. As part of this training, the participants are also familiarized with Logical Framework development and analysis, the role of research as an integrated component of development policy design and implementation, the role of advocacy in policy formation, and the role of civil society in good governance.

To date,APPRO has conducted policy analysis training courses for the Ministry of Economy, Ministry of Education, Ministry of Rural Rehabilitation and Development, Ministry of Counter-narcotics, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Interior, Ministry of Agriculture, Irrigation, and Livestock, and Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Afghanistan. From July 2016 APPRO will commence a certified policy analysis training course in Kabul for Afghan professionals selected from governmental entities and civil society. Successful participants will receive official university certificates and ECTS credits from Ghent University, Belgium.
Technical Capacity
APPRO is staffed byAfghan national and international personnel with many years of collective experience in various facets of development and scientific research including research and program design, planning, implementation, and monitoring and evaluation. APPRO has reciprocal arrangements with researchers in Europe and North America through its associations with British, Dutch, German, and Canadian universities and institutes. Additional affiliations are continually being sought with research and policy institutions in other countries, particularly in Central, South, and South East Asia. Please see Appendix 1 for a list of selected reports and papers.

Qualifications of Staff and Office Facilities: APPRO#s senior staff members have qualifications from internationally recognized academic institutions in Europe and North America. APPRO#s Directors are Ahmad Shaheer Anil (Executive Director) and Saeed Parto (Director of Research), supported by a team of 6 Research Project Managers, and 10 researchers. There is also a dedicated evaluations team of 4 researchers. APPRO maintains a pool of trained national and international research consultants for short-term evaluations and rapid-assessments.

Ability to Design Projects and Develop Proposals: APPRO as an organization and its key staff as previous members of other organizationshave designed and developed proposals for numerous projects and programs complete with methodology, personnel requirements, budget,timeline, and deliverables.

Expert Consultations: APPRO is frequently invited to participate in expert policy consultations and presentations organized by governmental authorities and international embassies in Kabul, Afghanistan, Europe Parliament and embassiesof European Union members in Brussels, and internationaldonors on key development policy issues such as civil service reform, gender mainstreaming, corruption, security sector reform, food security, rural and urban economic development, and sub-national governance.

International Work: APPRO actively pursues opportunities for research, evaluation, and training in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, drawing on the cumulative and collective experience of its core team of researchers in conducting research, evaluations, andtraining in conflict environments.

Partnerships: APPRO and APPRO-Europe continuously seek partnerships with national and international entities and institutions. In Afghanistan APPRO has Memoranda of Understanding with a number of key ministries such as the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Education, Ministry of Agriculture, Irrigation and Livestock, Ministry of Labor, Social Affairs, Martyrs, and the Disabled, and Ministry of Public Health. Internationally, APPRO has partnerships with a number of academic institutions in Europesuch as RuhrUniversity of Bochum in Germany, Ghent University in Belgium, and University of Waterloo in Canada.</narrative>
