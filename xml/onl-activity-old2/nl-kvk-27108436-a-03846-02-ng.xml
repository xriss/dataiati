   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Leadership Campaign &quot;She Should Run&quot;</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">She Should Run  is an advocacy campaign which seeks to motivate women to run for political office and encourage wider society to support women#s participation in politics. At the heart of the campaign is a desire to use social media including video messages to change attitudes about women in leadership by getting more women to believe in themselves and helping society see that many of the skills and experiences that women have are tied to leadership characteristics and traits. The project will raise awareness of the benefits of women in leadership positions among Nigerians and motivate and galvanize women towards competing in the 2015 elections through the use of electronic media and social media. It also intends to subliminally drum up votes for women running particularly amongstwomen who in some states make up the majority of registered voters  and amongst young people.

The project aims to amongst others, to promote a sustained advocacy that is needed to change socio-cultural and religious mind sets which not only limit the space for women in decision-making but which also effectively brainwash females from an early age to believe they have no role in government, politics and decision-making.  More public discussion about women&apos;s involvement in politics and decision-making.
Create and continuously update the database of Nigeria Women in Politics from the target audience demographics contesting during the 2015 elections (aspirants/candidates/elected women and women in business) as well as past elections and women in elective positions.    In the long runit becomes a veritable tool that is timeless, not bound to any election time frame. This is in cognizance with the reality to invest in actions that have potential outcomes beyond the 2015 electiontime frame.
Dissemination of videos to the general public in Nigeria as well as to critical stakeholders in media, government, education and Nigerians in diaspora through the Internet (blogs, socialmedia platforms)

It is expected that the project will 1) create more awareness is  on the need for women to take up leadership positions
2) Increased support for the women contesting in the 2015 elections 3) More interest from a wider section of women (middle class, elite, young) to participate in politics and participate in elections by registering to vote and voting during elections</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Nigerian Women#s Trust Fund was founded in 2011 by a public-private-CSO coalition to address the growing concerns about the gender imbalance in elective and appointive positions and drive strategies to increase the representation of women in Nigeriangovernment at all levels. Our four focus areas are: Leadership Development; Research &lt;(&gt;&amp;&lt;)&gt; Information; Gender Advocacy; and Fund Raising &lt;(&gt;&amp;&lt;)&gt; Grant making. Since inception The Fund has supported over 150 female politicians across 25 different parties across national,state and local government elections. The Fund has organised leadership training workshops for female politicians in Makurdi, Kaduna, Jos, Kuru and has been part of advocacy coalitions for the cause of women advancement in politics as well as GBV.The Fund under its research and communication has documented the stories of women#s advancement in politics in Nigeria, complete with the narrative of the challenges faced by female politicians and the objective of the Fund in meeting these challenges; this is captured in a book,#Politics, Strategy &lt;(&gt;&amp;&lt;)&gt; Sustainability#.
The Fund recently published the Eligibility Criteria, an internal tool for the Fund toguide the application process for women interested in accessing the support of the Fund for their elections. It also serves as a campaign handbook or manual of sorts to provide insights to female politicians and new entrants into the field on improving their election campaigns and strategy.
The Fund is presently working on the NED funded Create Her Space and has been closely involved over thelast eighteen months in all the discussions with political parties, the national assembly and civil society on amending the legal framework for elections to level the playing field for women in politics.  The Fund was part of the organising body for the two-day Nigeria Women Strategy Conference held in Abuja last month.
The mission of the Fund is to serve as the facilitators of equitable citizenship and sustainable participation for women in governance in Nigeria.</narrative>
