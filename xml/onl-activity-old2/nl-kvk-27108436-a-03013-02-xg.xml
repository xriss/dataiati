   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Saferworld has been engaging in Somalia, Somaliland and Puntland for a considerable period of time. This work has evolved over the years to address emerging issues and contextual changes. This project proposal represents a further evolution in two crucial ways. First, it seeks for focus on the specific issues of reconciliation in the Interim Jubaland Administration area through direct supportfor Somalia non-state actors. The emergence of the Jubaland &#x93;state&#x94; area captures well the contested notions of the state and federalism in Somalia; the peaceful resolution of the disputes arising from these contestations will be central to the broader sustainability of peace and stability across the country. They will also be central to international efforts &#x96; most notably through the New Deal process &#x96; to promote peacebuilding and statebuilding. However, not all international actors are explicitly backing the New Deal process of international engagement, including Turkey, which is now a considerable aid, security and diplomatic player in this context. Saferworld has over the past two years developed a rising powers strategy which seeks to examine and engage on the emergence of new actors such as Turkey. Given its prominent role in Somalia, there is a clear rationale for examining this more closely through a research process which produces content for effective advocacy in Turkey &#x96; the second area of evolved focus for Saferworld.

As withSaferworld, Oxfam Novib has significant experience of engagement in Somalia, Somaliland and Puntland. It also has started to engagein Turkey as a rising power, examining its role in, and impact on, overseas development. Both organisations maintain a strong focuson issues related to peace. As such, the two organisations will partner on a project with two areas of focus: on Jubaland (Somalia)and on Turkey.

A.	Building Foundations for Political Reconciliation in Jubaland
The analysis behind the objectives of the proposedprogramme is that for broader social reconciliation processes to be effective, political reconciliation is required between the different levels of authority in Jubaland and the Federal Government. Without a foundation of political reconciliation, social reconciliation efforts cannot be situated in a genuinely national process, and therefore risk failure. The support of Non State Actors (NSAs) provides an effective means of engaging with counterparts in both the Federal Government and with the authorities in newly recovered areas.

The overall objective of the project is &#x93;to enable Somali Non State Actors (NSAs) to engage and address the causes of conflict (e.g. contested notions of the state) and improve inclusive, transparent and accountable governance at all levels through national reconciliation.&#x94;

The specific objective of the project is &#x93;to support NSAs in South-Central Somalia to engage in research and advocacy with authorities in the newly &#x91;recovered&#x92; areas, specifically in Jubaland, and the Federal Government on issues related to reconciliation and stabilisation.&#x94;

The expected outcomes/results are:
1.	NSAs have increased capacity to actively engage in analysing political dynamics in newly recovered areas of Jubaland. Approximately 60 non-state actors have been trained in participatory research and conflict and actor analysis through an initial Training of Trainers exercise.
2.	NSAs, the Federal Government and authorities in Jubaland contribute to comprehensive research and analysis on key issues relating to reconciliation and stabilisation. Research Support Committee established, composed of 6 political analysts broadly representative of Somalia&#x92;s clans.
3.	NSAs utilise a new body of research and data to advocate to the Federal Government, authorities in the newly recovered areas of Jubaland and the international donor community for the implementation of recommendations for reconciliation and stabilisation. Approximately 200 Non-State Actors and authority representatives have been engaged in advocacy activities in Mogadishu and Jubaland.Appro

B.	Turkey&#x92;s role in Somalia
The specific objective of this project will be to deepen the understanding of Turkey&#x92;s engagement in Somalia, Somaliland and Puntland and its impact on conflict dynamics.

The expected outcomes/results of this research project area are:
1.	The nature of Turkey&#x92;s engagement in Somalia (in all three regions) is comprehensively mapped and its impact on peace and conflict dynamics analysed.
2.	Lessons are drawn from the experience of Turkey&#x92;s engagement in Somalia and the implications for Turkey and other international actors are identified.
3.	Policy recommendations are developed on how Turkey&#x92;s future engagement can more effectively contribute to sustainable peace and stability in Somalia.

D.	Consolidation and review phase:
This project is envisioned as a pilot project for broader and future cooperation between Oxfam Novib and Saferworld. As such, a review period will be built into the project with the following outcomes:
1.	Saferworld Somalia Programme and Oxfam Novib Somalia meet to review progress of the Jubaland phase of the project
2.	Following the completion of the 3-month research phase a discussion between Saferworld Rising Powers Programme and Oxfam NovibTurkey will take place to reach an advocacy strategy based on the Turkey-Somalia research findings to be implemented from April 2014 onwards (to be funded independently of the existing project budget).
4.	Dependent on the experience of the Somalia case-study, Saferworld Rising Powers Programme and Oxfam Novib Turkey discuss options to jointly facilitate future research and dialogue on Turkey&#x92;s engagement in other conflict-affected states. This will include a discussion of joint fundraising strategies for additional resources.
5.	Saferworld and Oxfam Novib hold a meeting to review the nature of the whole partnership, next phases and, if new future projects are identified for cooperation, potential joint funding-raising strategies for additional resources.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Saferworld (SW) was established in 1989 and formerly worked as a campaign organisation on nuclear proliferation, most notably working on the Freeze campaign, a campaign set up to respond to new challenges of the post-Cold War scenario. In 1994, Saferworld published &#x91;The True Cost of Conflict,&#x92; which provided new insights into the debate on global security, and studied the costs of 7 differentconflicts on health, education, civil and political rights, trade, power supply and transportation amongst others. In 1997 the Hornof Africa project- examining the impact of EU policies on the Horn of Africa &#x96; was Saferworld&#x92;s first project to involve significant &#x91;on the ground&#x92; research.

Today Saferworld is an independent international not-for-profit organisation working to prevent and reduce violent conflict, promote co-operative approaches to security-building and build safer lives. Since 1989, the organisation has developed considerably with programmes in nearly 20 countries and territories across Eastern Europe and Central Asia, South Asia, Middle East and North Africa, Kenya and the Horn of Africa, and the Great Lakes regions, where it contributes to lasting change. It employs over a 100 members of staff located at our headquarters in London as well as in Bishkek, Brussels, Dhaka, Juba, Kampala, Kathmandu, Nairobi, Pristine, Sana&#x92;a, Tbilisi, Vienna and Washington. Saferworld&#x92;s annual income has grown from &#xA3;3,000,000 in 2007/8 to over &#xA3;9,000,000 in 2012/13.

SW also maintains a strong thematic focus in its work, prioritising four central issue areas:
I. Access to security and justice;
II. The control of conventional weapons;
III. The relationship between aid and conflict;
IV. The relationship between governance and peacebuilding.

Saferworld works with local people affected by conflict to improve their safety and sense of security, and conducts wider research and analysis. It uses this evidence and learning to improve local, national and international policies and practices that can help build lasting peace. Its priority is people &#x96; guided by the belief that everyone should be able to lead peaceful, fulfilling lives, free from insecurity and violent conflict.

Understanding and acting on the relationships between gender, peace and security is a cross-cutting set of issues tackled by Saferworld&#x92;s interventions across the globe. Examples include integrating gender issues in new community security projects in Bangladesh, South Sudan, and Yemen &#x96; initiatives designed to empower local people to find solutions to their own safety and security concerns. Saferworld also started a new project across the Middle East to strengthen women&#x92;s voices and ensure that the many women who played a part in the &#x91;Arab Spring&#x92; have a greater say in decision-making. And at a policy level, Saferworld provides analysis and technical advice to ensure that e.g. preventing sexual violence against women, girls, and boys in conflict was included in the G8 declaration on the issue, and highlighted the impact of genderin securityand justice reform processes.</narrative>
