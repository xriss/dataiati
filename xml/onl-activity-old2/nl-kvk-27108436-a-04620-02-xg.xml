   <narrative xml:lang="EN">TJAS is focussing its activities on MFIs in the loan portfolio of Oxfam Novib and MFIs that are candidates to become a partner of the Oxfam Novib Fund. It collaborates with a number of institutions involved in the same segment of the market, i.e. tier-3 MFIs: starting and growing.
The support of Oxfam Novib is directed towards three main activities:
a.	Support for the Burundi programme, a programme on fertilizer, integrated soil management with producer organizations in several regions of the country. Saving groups and financial services are an important part of this programme.
b.	Big Data: Rural finance, especially agricultural finance, is expensive as MFIs incur in high costs for the delivery of financial services in rural areas. Distances are long, the agricultural sector is a risky sector and natural and man-made disasters are frequent. To lower the costs for the MFIs and therefore to diminish the interestthe clients of rural and agricultural loans pay, the so called &quot;Big Data&quot; are meant to speed up the process of the analysis of loanapplications by linking the clients and their businesses to a statistical database allowing for a shorter analysis and at the same time giving the client a product that is better suited to his/her situation.
c.	Focussing especially on MFIs, TJAS will give TA to 5partners in the Oxfam Novib Fund for different purposes:
-	Turame in Burundi will be part of the proposed programme of Oxfam Novib.In order to link their operations to saving groups of different producer organizations that are partners of Oxfam Novib, new financial loan products will have to be developed as well as new procedures. Many MFIs operating in rural areas have little or no portfolio in the agricultural sector as the risk is high and the necessary expertise is not available in many MFIs. This intervention will help to resolve these obstacles.
-	Oxus DRC is a partner in the Oxfam Novib Fund since June 2014. The organization, part of the network Oxus, is not yet profitable. Situated in Kinshasa, it plans to expand their operations to rural areas. One of the major elements for a financially sustainable organization is the quality of the loan portfolio. Especially when a MFI wants to expand to rural areas and the agricultural sector, there is a need for more expertise of risk management of the portfolio. TJAS will deliver the TA in collaboration with the Oxus network.
-	Advans Ghana is also a partner in the Oxfam Novib Fund since April 2015. It is a profitable MFI supported by the network of Advans, a French network of MFIs. Apart from giving loans to micro-entrepreneurs, Advans Ghana also has different savings products and wants to expand the financial products to mobile banking, ATM cash cards and e-cash for saving groups. TJAS will support them to develop these products.
-	Small Enterprise Foundation in South Africa is also a partner in the Oxfam Novib Fund since 2013. The MFI focuses on group loans for women. Their Management Information System is outdated and a new one has tobe introduced in order to keep track on the growth of the number of clients. TJAS has the expertise to accompany this process.
-	UNTU Zimbabwe will receive a loan in one of these days. Although the organization is financially sustainable, the internal organization is still weak and in need of TA in different areas. after the tightening of internal controls in the organization, there is now need to focus on the introduction of tools of risk management at the level of the portfolio and to introduce criteria for the provisioning and write-off and, if possible, recovery of bad loans. TJAS will support UNTU for this. The TA of TJAS has been a condition of Oxfam Novib to approve this loan.</narrative>
