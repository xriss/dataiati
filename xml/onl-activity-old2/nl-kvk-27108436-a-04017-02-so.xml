The founder of EPHRC was Mohamoud Ali Ahmed, commonly known as Mr. Elman. Elman was one of the pioneers in human rights activism in Somalia and is also known as the #Father of Peace# due to his campaigns against the war. His vision was based on his famous slogan #Drop the Gun and Pick up the Pen#; which was centered on alleviating poverty and promoting human rights for all Somali people; this was after the outbreak of civil war in 1991. For his campaign against the armed conflict, Elman was assassinated on March 9th 1996. From its infancy, EPHRChas grown both in policy, areas of intervention and activities. Since commencement, EPHRC has undertaken a wide spectrum of projects ranging from purely humanitarian and life saving interventions to developmental projects. EPHRC is very well renowned for its success rate and track record in Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration (DDR) projects for children involved in the armed conflict, and also strong focuses on human rights monitoring and reporting; EPHRC also prioritizes providing alternative livelihoods for vulnerable members of society, education, protection, response and prevention of gender based violence and activities for improving and sustaining gender justice and empowerment.
