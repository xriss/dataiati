   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Spark Center for Social Entrepreneurship Development is a Vietnamese not-for profit organization supporting sustainable growth of companies with proven business solutions that effectively address social concerns at scale through social entrepreneurship and inclusive business development. Recognized the need from small and medium enterprises (SMEs) # who are also negatively impacted by disaster risks and climate change impacts, and based on SPARK strategic vision in building capacity for agriculture businesses, SPARK develops the Strengthen Resilience Options for Narrowing the Gap (STRONG), to provide supports to companies to be well-prepared for disaster risks and climate change impacts - which in turn benefit small-scale producers who involved in the value chains.
The program will be implemented in two phases: Awakening (12 months) and Growing (36 months) that aim to build resilience to climate change impactsfor agri-businesses and contribute to more stable livelihood of thousands of farmers.
In the first phase, SPARK will work with selected companies (6 - 10 SMEs) in its existing network to identify their needs, support them to develop and implement their business contingency plans, and share the best practices widely in the SMEs network.</narrative>
