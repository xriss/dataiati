Within one yearimplementing on women led agriculture (WLAS), the project found that there are some improvement of the service because of their experience and the ways of their business implementing. Beside the experience and weakness of business implementing, so the WLAS team still need another opportunity to strengthen both of on and off farm to ensure that they can continue to provide the service in the period of constraining.  Those constrained which will affected to the stopping of the continuing of the service, continue building their technique capacity, lack of capacity to reach the market information, group management and business strategy follow up and implementing.
