International Sports Alliance (ISA) (formerly named NSA International) www.isa-youth.org
and www.facebook.com/pages/NSA-International
International Sports Alliance (formerly named NSA International) is an ambitious non-profit organization committedto the capacity building of Sports &amp; Peace programmes in Africa, Asia and South America. In the Netherlands the focus is on increasing the support-base for the theme of sports and development co-operation. We believe in the power of sports to unite and encourage the growth of networks for development. Our partner organizations are every day engaged in successful sports and peace activities, to engender fraternization and equal opportunities for all.

International Sports Alliance and its local partners have been supporting development programmes for over ten years, in countries like Burkina Faso, Indonesia, Kenya, Uganda, Sudan, Surinam and South Africa. Sports are for us the means to activating people. That is what spurs us on!

ISA works together with the following partners:

Seeds of Peace Africa (SOPA) www.sopa.or.ke
SOPA International strives to empower children and young people, in communities, organizations and learning institutions, to support them in their endeavours to rebuild relationships, clarify personal and organizational visions, see reality more clearly, and develop, maintain and resolve conflicts in a non-violent manner. And thus to act with empathy, patience, integrity and courage in the process of disengaging from the violence that surrounds them, and to become agents of peace and social transformation.

SOPA does so by investing in peace education and imparting non-violent values and skills in children and young people. SOPA International helps to build families, communities, institutions and a world where justice, peace, harmony, and respect of God, humanity, life and personal dignity are the foundations of peace and sustainable development in the world. SOPA International uses sports, cultural activities and creative arts, life skills training and other forms of education to engage youths on issues that affect and impact on their lives.

SOPA&#x92;s mission is to facilitate the empowerment of children, young people and women through non-violent means, conflict transformation and peace education and training, research and analysis, counselling and networking, so they can participate in building positive peace, sustainable development and respect for human dignity in realizing a just and friendly world.

Oikos www.stichtingoikos.nl
Oikos strives for a world where righteousness and sustainability are key. Oikos believes that everyone can contribute to the worldwide movement for a world free of poverty, with opportunities for everyone. Its main focus is on stimulating processes of change, and its main target group is Dutch society.

The aim of all its activities is to involve people in the vital task of achieving sustainable development for all. By showing what can be done, Oikos encourages politicians and other people to act, through campaigns, lobby, the organization of conferences and the production of information material, backed up by research into the causes of poverty. Although Oikos&#x92;s main focus is on Dutch society, it also works with international organizations on a number of projects around the globe. Oikos has launched several Dutch campaigns in support of international campaigns.
