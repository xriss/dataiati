   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The principle thematic areas of this project  are Agriculture (improved livelihoods), primary education, community development, community health and Institutional development. The principle of work is empowerment of communities and individuals in all thethematic areas. CEFORD works in 8 districts (Arua, Nebbi, Zombo, Maracha, Koboko, Yumbe, Moyo and Adjumani).

The social actors that benefit from CEFORD&apos;s work are the children (pupils in school), disadvantaged women and men from local communities as farmers and as community members, out of school youth, orphans and vulnerable children who are financially handicapped (do not have money for their demands especially for education), local CSOs, and primary schools.

Methodologies applied in the project
1. Training especially in the rural area, where a participant-centred learning approach is used involving adult learning techniques. Such type of training is cost effective in terms of time and money, is appropriate in passing on skills and knowledge, andthe use of local materials makes the training more practical. Trainings will be organized for farmers, FAL learners, pupils in schools and OVC.
2. Surveys will be conducted to establish benchmarks for the project and to assess pre-intervention, during implementation (mid-term) and also End of project Evaluation. These will be conducted for all the thematic areas in the project.
3. Provision of inputs, is a strategy that will help provide start-up seed, money and equipment for further multiplication. Since trained people get the inputs, the method allows for deepening the understanding and increases the asset base of the beneficiaries. These will target the farmers and OVC.
4. Exposure visits will be used to expand knowledge through sharing of experiences amongst participants/ beneficiaries. This method is also critical for enhancing adult learning from exchanging daily practical experiences. Learning visits will be conducted for adult learners.
5. Advocacy is a method CEFORD will use mainly to mobilise more support for positively promoting good decisions, policies, practices and ideas, whether within the community, towards the private sector or the government. It is best suited for targets where attitude change and change in beliefs is expected. Thisapproach will be used for farmers, children education, OVC support.
6. ICT: Use of Information Communication Technologies that are relevant to the environment in which the interventions shall be implemented. This will include web based technologies, useof mobile phones, radios, video shows, posters, leaflets, public notice boards, e.t.c to communicate messages to the target groups. This approach will be used for farmers, FAL members and schools.
7. Community meetings will be held toinitiate group discussions on issues affecting the target groups and draw action points that will be implemented and followed up toascertain progress towards addressing the issues raised. These will also be used for phase out discussions with the target groups in all thethematic areas.
8. The establishment of linkages with other partners is a valuable method CEFORD has used before. This method helps in mobilising more resources, accessing other services that CEFORD cannot provide, and is also good for the sustainabilityof the support activities. For instance linked groups can open up to obtain further support for their activities. Linkages for farmers for market and market information, linkages on health issues e.g. HIV/AIDS, SRHR for all the target beneficiaries.
9. Partnershipsand collaboration: this method has been successful before in resource mobilisation and sharing. It also encourages CEFORD to work through other organisations and offers opportunity for learning.

As a strategy to contribute to sustainable development, CEFORD mainstreams HIV/AIDS and environmental concerns e.g. soil and water conservation in its activities. Already, CEFORD has a relationship with JOHMET for internal mainstreaming of HIV-AIDS at the workplace and in programmes. In addition, CEFORD has had her capacity builtthrough participation in GMLT and SRHR trajectory supported by Oxfam Novib. This has built staff capacities to be able to mainstream gender, sexual and reproductive health and HIV/AIDS into its programming and that of itspartners.  On advocacy issues, CEFORD forms alliances from the grassroots up to the national levels.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">COMMUNITY EMPOWERMENT FOR RURAL DEV CEFORD</narrative>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The history of Community Empowerment for Rural Development (CEFORD) dates back to 1993 when the Uganda government, with the financial and technical support of the Dutch government, implemented the Community Action Program (CAP) and later the Women Empowerment Program (WEP) in the West Nile region. Both programs were considered successes by the communities and district local governments of West Nile, and external evaluators and the Dutch embassy in Uganda. The focus was on community mobilisation and capacity building through service delivery and the implementation of micro-projects. CAP concentrated on the supply of social infrastructure services and the implementation of agricultural projects, while WEP concentrated on the empowerment of women and the strengthening of their capacities to participate in the development process.
Thus CEFORD was founded, to fill the gap created by the closure of these successful programs that were phased out in June 2000. CEFORD operates in parts of all the five districts of Adjumani, Arua, Moyo, Nebbi and Yumbe.
It was founded in July 2000 but the process of its formation dates back to 1998, to an internal reflection workshop of CAP staff that identified possible scenarios for the future. One scenario suggested a merger of CAP and WEP into a local NGO.
The decentralisation of government to districts in Uganda also demanded strong civil society organisations that could support local governments indelivering services.
CEFORD&apos;s major achievements in the last three years include a participatory poverty assessment in the districts of Arua and Nebbi. Through these assessments CEFORD gave objective feedback from poor women and men to the district and central governments, and to some donor.
It was also successful in supporting the Adjumani district local government in facilitating the formulation of all its sub-county development plans. This enhanced its chance of accessing funds from the central government, from which the communities would benefit.
And CEFORD strengthened the capacities of four local organisations through organisational self-assessment and the facilitation of strategic planning. The performance of these organisations has since improved. It also mobilised and linked ten community-based organisations to funding for agricultural activities; over 30 million Ugandan shillings from the German Development Services.
CEFORD&apos;s Mission is to improve the capacity of women, men, children and their organisations in the more disadvantaged communities of West Nile effectively to articulate their demands and interests, to increase their production and income in a sustainable way and to secure better access to services.
The institutional objectives of CEFORD are to contribute to the following policy and practice changes in West Nile: food and income security is guaranteed, communities have positive attitude to the enrolment and retention of girls in schools, there is active participation of the population in district and sub-county planning and policy formulation (especially around issues of natural resources, peace and security),  peace and security in the region are consolidated especially at the household level, and women are empowered to participate as equal partners to men in decision-making and control over resources at the household and community levels.</narrative>
