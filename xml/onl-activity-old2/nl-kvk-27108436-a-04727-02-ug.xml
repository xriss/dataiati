   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Uganda Youth Network UYONET</narrative>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Uganda Youth Network is a national, non-partisan and non-profit Civil Society Organization registered in
Uganda as a non-governmental organization. UYONET was founded in 2002 initially as a Youth Analysis Board (YAB) and later registered as an independent national youth initiative with the overall mission to redefine the role and contribution of the Ugandan youth in the governance and development processes in the country. It was conceived by a group of young people, then student leaders in Uganda publicUniversities, who during the formative days of reintroduced plural politics in Uganda were concerned about the status of the country#s governance and leadership. They were convinced that reforming the Ugandan state required young and vibrant leadership. This necessitated the organized involvement of young people in Uganda#s democratic processes. Towards this end, following the formation of UYONET, structured dialogue among young people from the different sectors in Uganda on how to radically redefine therole of young people in political, economic and social discourses were facilitated by UYONET, starting with the formation of a loose coalition of young people called the Youth Analysis Board (YAB) that eventually transformed into UYONET as a legally registered entity.

UYONET  has increasingly been demanding for a collective platform for research, training and policy advocacy for young people by young people with a vision of an Empowered youth population participating in governance and development processes.  Our core mission and every day work is mainly building, empowering and sustaining a vibrant youth network through advocacy, raising awareness on sexual and reproductive health rights for young people, coordination and capacity building.
We work with 37 network members all over Uganda and 157 youth organisations. Uganda Youth Network is a governance based organization and therefore strives to exhibit tenets of good corporate governance.
We continue to be the premier youth organization working to enhance the contribution of youth in the governance and development processes.

The organization has a well-defined decision making structure as explained as; The Annual General Meeting (AGM); this is the organization#s highest decision making organ. Itisconstituted of all the registered and fully subscribed member organizations. Its key roles include among other; to constitute the Board, to review and approve the decisions made at different levels of decision making, review reports from the board on theimplementation of the General Assembly Decision and to approve audited books of account. The Boardis the second organ in hierarchy of decision making at UYONET. The board#s key roles include; implement the decisions of the General Assembly, support in policy formulation, policy review and implementation, constitute board sub committees to handle different management roles, receive and review secretariat decision, ensure effective management of the secretariat among others.</narrative>
