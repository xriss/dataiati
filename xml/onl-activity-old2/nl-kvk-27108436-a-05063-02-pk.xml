   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Fair taxation is a crucial and strategic issue in many developing countries that aim to reduce poverty through national resources mobilization. It is an admitted fact that the richest ten per cent of Pakistanis have accumulated colossal assets in the last three decades without paying due income tax. Exemptions of billions of rupees have been given to the rich and mighty through executive orders (SROs), whereby incidence of indirect taxes on the poor have increased#they have been forced to pay 17% sales tax on many items of daily use. The rich in Pakistan are either outside the tax net or do not pay personal taxes in accordance with their actual ability to pay. Those who control 90% of resources contribute less than 2% in total tax revenue. Pakistan is a tax heaven for the rich andmighty. The military complex, civil bureaucracy, higher judiciary, landed aristocracy and industrialist-turned politicians are enjoying all kinds of privileges and perquisites, tax-free and funded from taxpayers# money, borrowed funds and foreign grants. Present system serves the interests of the privileged classes#they represent only 1% of entire population but own 95% of national resources.Greater reliance on indirect taxes is directly contributing to rising poverty#the worst affected are the poor farmers and labour class. People who possess enormous income and wealth are not being subjected to income taxation in Pakistan (wealth tax and other progressive taxes like capital gain tax, gift tax and estate duty have been abolished to favour the rich) while main tax incidence is onthe middle and poor classes.
The rising level of poverty is due to many attributes and one direct link between growing poverty in Pakistan and income inequalities is due to distortion in tax base. The situation is further of grave concern not only owing to inequitable balance between indirect and direct taxes but also due to the regressive taxes which in fact underlies hidden direct taxes.
Main goal of the project is to contribute to regional campaign Evenitup in more effective way to build a national as well as regional momentum to generate discourse around inequality.
Results
The outputs lead to stronger civil societies in Pakistan and internationalcivil society alliances, by amplifying country-level issues to regional and global tax policy issues and capitalize on potential international policy multiplier effects, which push for further tax justice and act as a movement, adjusted to the context:
R1. Increased research capacity, knowledge and awareness in more than 126 CSOs on how the state, the private sector, civil servants and citizens deal with taxes at present and in the future.
R2. By the end of project, Tax Justice Coalition has been connected in with regional campaign Evenitup.
R3. By the end of project, through joint advocacy and engagement with the stakeholders involved in tax issues; the representatives and staff of the country government are informed about the harmful effects of unfair and ineffective tax-relatedpractices, and asubstantial impact is generated on tax policies and practices</narrative>
