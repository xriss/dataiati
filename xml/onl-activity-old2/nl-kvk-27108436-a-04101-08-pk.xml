   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The key to change sexual reproductive health rights situation in Pakistan is to change the perceptions and attitudes of overall society towards this issue. The key actors in the whole scenario are parents, teachers, government and religious scholars and program approach should contribute to developing awareness and acceptability of these stake holders of the fact that young people should havea right to access information and services related to sexual reproductive health. They should also have freedom to exercise these rights as well.
As SRHR is a broader term, so here we are going to focus on three main components to improve SRHR needs of young people including enhancing LSBE, reducing Child Marriage and preventing AIDS and STI.

Life skills represent the psycho-social skills that determine valued behaviour and include reflective skills such as problem-solving and critical thinking, to personal skills such as self-awareness, and to interpersonal skills. Practicing life skills leads to qualities suchas self-esteem, sociability and tolerance, to action competencies to take action and generate change, and to capabilities to have the freedom to decide what to do and who to be. It is now recognized as a methodology to address a variety of issues of childand youth development. Expected learning outcomes include a combination of knowledge, values, attitudes and skills with a particular emphasis on those skills that related to critical thinking and problem solving, self-management and communication and inter-personal skills.
1. Child Marriage is one of the most wide-spread human rights violations that exist in the country. Girls from poor households are more likely to be married as children. Being forced into marriage before one is able to give consent violates the basic human rights of boys and girls. Each day, more than25,000 young girls around the world become child brides, joining almost 60 million girls who have married before their eighteenth birthday . In particular, girls from the poorest quintileare three times more likely to be married as children than girls from the richest quintile. Prevailing gender inequality, practiced through the custom of dowry, poverty and the supposed #social security# thatchild marriages bring are important reasonsasto why child marriages are still so widely practiced. The physical, social and emotional consequences of child marriages are multiple and severe, ranging from lack of access to education, leading to limited literacy and employment opportunities, exposuretounprotected sexual relations, pregnancy and child birth before being physically or psychologically ready, and high rates of female poverty.
Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs) are among the world#s common communicable diseases with exceeding incidenceday by day. More than 1 million people acquire a sexually transmitted infection (STI) every day and eachyear, and estimated 500 million people become ill with one of four STIs . However, 80% of these incidences occur in the developing countries andadolescents and young adults suffer the most. Having far reaching consequences on public health, STIs are often associated with multiple health risks including gonorrhoea, chlamydial infection, syphilis, trichomoniasis, chancroid, genital herpes, genitalwartsand HIV. High prevalence of STIs and related complications in the poor countries are due to inadequate health facilities andbarriers to information on these diseases, generally because of stigma associated with sexual issues.
The project aims to work on awareness, information and education through various intervention strategies. It is very important that for each intervention targetsgroups should be defined; However in awareness,  education and capacity building, the principle target groups arepublicsector organizations, private sector, religious scholars, media, youth, caretakers, marginalized communities and CSOs, NGOs and INGOs. Program also aims to work on policy reforms and the main target group to be targeted will be Parliamentarians and Public sector. Capacity building is another objective and the focus of intervention will remain with public sector organizations, religious scholars, media, CSOs, networks, theatre groups, caretakers and academia. Research is another focus area program needs to focus on; and the ways of working may include institutions like academic, public sector and I/NGOs. Networking and Alliance building will be the cross cutting theme of all interventions designed already or aspired with INGOs, service providers (public/private) and media</narrative>
