   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Independent of the existence of a democratic system, the balance of power is skewed towards a small group of influential actors. Sometimes these are entrepreneurs from the corporate sector, people from the rich and powerful classes, or even armies and religious institutes. In any case there are opportunity structures that allow one actor or a small group of actors to dominate political decision-making. Our democratic systems are not free of such tendencies. The occurrences of these power games differ substantially across countries. Citizens in Uganda as well as in South Africa are deprived of their basic (human) rights, such as the right to education and health care. In the absence of effective methods of advocacy and channels for dialogue, citizens fall back on protest.
In The Netherlands laws and policies are implemented effectively, but it is very difficult for citizens to have influence on the decision-making process itself 1. Many decisions are made outside the democratic realm, which makes it difficult to hold political leaders accountable for their actions. Whilst creating prosperity and affluence, the same policies and laws set boundaries, and by doing so they limit or conflict with freedom and equality.
Netwerk Democratie created the online platform volgdewet.nl2 (followthelaw.nl): a community-based online platform for monitoring and influencing law-making processes. With this platform Netwerk Democratie created the opportunity for citizens to monitor and influence law-making processes and at the same time advocate for more transparency and accountability.
In South Africa there is no method or tool with which citizens can hold the government responsible for its actions, other than protest. This has led to a situation in which citizens set things on fire to protest against the lack of service delivery by thegovernment. It is a strong, symbolic tool but it does not guarantee better government performance. For this reason Seriti Institutehas developed a method to systematically monitor service delivery by government departments tasked with implementation of progressive policies. Uganda struggles with similar issues. In Uganda many laws and policies have been adopted, but not implemented. For thisreason CEW-IT has started th Citizens Manifesto and the NA-project. Ugandan and South African methods might gain more strength by making the linkage between human rights frameworks and specific policies.
Within this project the consortium partners want to do three things:
1. Develop and learn
Develop a manual on the online platform volgdewet.nl by Netwerk Democratie and develop a manual on community based monitoring by Seriti Institute. This in order to transfer knowledge from one country to the other two countries
2. Link and merge
Link the proven tools together, using knowledge derived by the two tools: volgdewet.nl and the Citizen Based Monitoring method to improve the list of tools on volgdewet.nl
3. Implement
Implement the online platform in South Africa and Uganda</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Network Democracy was born out of the cooperation between Burgerlink and Forum for democratic development, in the context of the program &#x93;Digital pioneers&#x94; of the Ministry of Education, Culture and Science. Network Democracy was launched in 2011 with the support from Vfonds. This support has enabled Network Democracy to have two successful years. Our visibility with regards to various topics and in different audiences has led to a lasting partnership with and financial support on the part of the Ministry of the Interior and Kingdom Relations.
Network Democracy is committed to resilient democracy in which citizens are more involved and can actively contribute with the help of new technologies.
The present-day technological developments transform the way people interact with one another and connect to the society and government. In the era of social media, smart-phones, and high internet penetration everyone is capable of launching new ideas and quickly connect with link-minded people. Simply using a hashtag for an #idea can enable a single individual to become a powerful inspiration which could urge people to mobilize around an emerging idea.
Network Democracy sees the potential that these technological developments offer in order to initiate social change. The world lies at our fingertips and the possibilities are endless: petitions, citizen initiatives, collective action, social movements, and even revolutions. The Internet allows for faster information exchange and offers opportunities to the citizens to personalize and re-use the information. It gives the public new tools to organize themselves, to participate in the democratic process, and to learn more about governmental decision-making. Not necessarily within the boundaries of formal government. Network Democracy advocates equal information awareness between the government and its citizens by promoting transparency, accessibility, and accountability of public administrations. Therefore Network Democracy works to stimulate citizen participation, to make citizen initiatives more visible, and to offer citizens the tools to make their interaction with the institutions that represent them more effective.</narrative>
