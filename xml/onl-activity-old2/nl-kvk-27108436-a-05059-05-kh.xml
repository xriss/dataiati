The garment industry is concentrated in and around the capital city, Phnom Penh, with a smaller number of factories scattered throughout the provinces. An estimated 85% of the garment factories are foreign controlled, mostly by Chinese, Taiwanese, Singaporean and Malaysian investors, who moved to the country in the 1990s to take advantage of the low-cost labour market and the country#squota-free access to US and EU markets. The top five brands sourcing from Cambodia are H&lt;(&gt;&amp;&lt;)&gt;M, GAP, Levi Strauss &lt;(&gt;&amp;&lt;)&gt; Co, Adidas and Target.
