   <narrative xml:lang="EN">SACCA (Sustainable Agriculture with Climate Change Adaptation) aims at increasing positive changes of gender perception in the families and communities based on agriculture activities. As project report in 2015, 251 women became community leaders, women and men joined decision making in the families increased from 56% to 68%, men reported to stop their wives from participating in public activities decreased from 31% to 26.67%, and women felt afraid of her husband decreased from 74% to 43.33%. The projectalso trained 60 potential women leaders and work with 92 couple of Gender Road Map model families.

This new project continues to build up the achievements and challenges from previous results especially developing the new business model for small holder farmers to become qualifiedSRI Service Providers. They are formed in group, well-trained, equipped, and encouraged to earn more revenues from selling labors by transplanting SRI for other farmers. The business model is added up with transplanting machine and/or weeding tools. Moreover, thefarmers encourage to work as a rice producer groups and apply eco-agriculture techniques with their SRI to increase value and access to the rice market. Saving for change (SfC) will also introduce among SRI farmers to have inputs to apply other integrate farming system (IFS) in the families. Furthermore, women empowerment and gender mainstreaming are also applied in this proposed action. The project works with potential women leaders and gender road map (GRM) model families. In addition, the results of farmers# works, market, new innovation, challenges, and lesson learned will be shared to public through Cambodia Community Innovative Center (CCIC). However, it is big changing approach and way of working to address issues and find solution together through building from bottom up and participatory process rather than applying the top down approaches that the project expected to produce better and effective results.</narrative>
