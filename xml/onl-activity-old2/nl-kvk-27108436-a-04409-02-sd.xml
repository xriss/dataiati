   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Water, Sanitation and Hygiene Promotion (WASH)
The main water supply system in Shagra villages (the biggest gathering) consists of a borehole driven by a 2&quot; submersible pump connected to 16m&#xB3; storage tanks and tap stand in Shagra C.  Shagra A and B villages were connected to elevated storage tank connect to borehole with motorized pump. Water is supplied at specific time in a day and the hostcommunity used to pay water tariff. Recently Oxfam America upgraded the water supply network in Shagra C by installing a 3 inch submersible pump, a 30 KVA generator and construction of 4 tap stands; this has significantly contributed to improve safe water access by the IDPs and host communities.
Although water supply is adequate to the host community, the newly arrived IDPs suffer much due lack of access to safe drinking water.  Due to limited access, the per capita/person/day for the IDPs is not more than 2-4 liters, which is far less than the Sphere standard. Number of existing tap stands is insufficient. Water is not supplied continuously during the day. IDPs do also lack appropriate size and quality of water containers for collection and storage water. IDPs&apos; affordability to pay water tariff and the distances to existing water points are still great challenges. Accordingly, most of the IDPs have either to collect dirty water contaminated by animal contact and from broken pipelines network; otherwise people mainly women and children have travel 2-3 km two ways to collect water it from the tap stands which is physical difficult for displaced people who are suffering from lack of adequate food.
Majority of households in Shagra A, B and C villages have latrines.  But still large number of the people mainly the new arrivals practices open defecation. Due to social pressure resulted from hosting on the new IDPs, some household&#x92;s hosted more than 5 relative families and they shared one latrine. Gender needs are not observed as there are no private latrines forwomen, young girls or elderly.  Those families who settled in open resort to open defecation which exposes their environment to contamination and that will expose the whole village breed of flies and other contaminating diseases.
There is a WASH committee established very recently but its effort in conducting garbage campaigns was noticed by accumulation of garbage in the area of IDPs settlements. There is no arrangement for garbage management (collection and proper disposal) and IDPs lack the required cleaning tools for collection and disposal of garbage. The new IDPs&apos; had limited access to adequate water supplies, safe excreta disposal facilities and soap for proper hand washing and maintaining their personal hygiene. In addition, Children are observed suffering from scabs, skinand diarrheal diseases.
As the new IDPs are sharing existing water supply facility with the former IDPs plus the host, this status has resulted in excessive pressure on the existing sources. In Behair, the upgraded Hand Pump is with low capacity connected to small tank swept by floods during the rainy season. Now, water is pumped directly to a trough from which people and their animals drink.Some IDPs travel 2-3 km to fetch water in Shagra or Golo villages. Water tariff was adopted by Behair community to support operation and maintenance of the borehole.  But, as the new IDPs do not have enough resources, most of them are unable collect enough. IDPs do also lack suitable containers for collection and storage of water.
It is observed that few families use latrines, majority of community members including the new IDPs are practicing open defecation. It was noticed adult men and women were using field and bushesfor defecation while children faeces were scattered near to the shelter creating nasty smell around the village. It was observed that scabs and skin diseases are wide spread among children and adults in addition to diarrheal and respiratory infections. The limited access to safe water supply and adequate means for excreta disposal and lack of soap put high risk of communicable diseases for the host community and the IDPs. There are no proper hygiene practices among the IDPs and no sufficient soap for hand washing at critical times
As in Shagra village, those new IDPs in Umhajaliege, also share the limited existing facilities with the hosting community. Water source in Umhajaliege consists of one water yard operated with motorized pump with very low yield and frequent breakdowns.  Some geophysical surveys/studies made confirmed possibilities of success for ground water but not yet drilled. Current consumption/capita/day for the new IDPs in about 4 liters and this quantity of water is not enough for personal and domestic use. Therefore, IDPshave no choice rather than collecting very dirty limited quantities of water from 2-3 km in their broken Jerry cans or stay for hours to collect small water at cost from the village water yard. IDPs are also sharing same limited existing 100 public temporary latrines constructed by OXFAM last year for the old IDPs displaced in mid 2014. Community leaders have raised concerns as they are facing the host season when more flies breed, and last year their  area was affected by many cases of Dysentery. Health committee in the village is inactive.
1.1	Emergency Food Security and Livelihoods Recovery (EFSL)
The host villages around Elfashir where IDPs are received have some basic infrastructure; schools that could accommodate IDPs children; heath units from which they could fetch some basic curative and child nutritional services.  Possibilities of return to their homes of origin are not feasible as their original villages are still insecure and those who have made some seasonal returns for cultivation have also been brutally attacked by militiamen who tortured and stripped them off their belongings.
Women stated that, most of their specific gender needs are not observed / met in their new setting. They lack privacy and are forced to live in open areas; temporary in school yards and health clinics, ect; and even in that temporary residence, they are now being ordered to leave out and accordingly forced to live in flimsy shelters of plastic sheets, empty sacks and other inappropriate local materials. IDPs are not allowed to move into or settle in the old camps in Elfashir .i.e. Alsalam and Abushouk. As most of the IDPs have fled their home empty handed, they do not have regular means of income.
Based on the findings of the recent joint assessment, their immediate food needs and access to livelihoods is affected as well as they had lost all their Household wealth / assets. There are three main wealth categories; better off group of around 25% of the community, and mainly represent those who escaped a bit earlier from their villages immediately after they realized that militias&apos; attacks are imminent.  So, this segment had some time and accordingly brought with them some of their asset and livestock.  The second group middle group and they represents about 30% of the population. The last wealth category is the very poor vulnerable group and they are majority as they represent 50% of the community.  Those are the direct victims of the atrocities of the Jinjaweed (outlaws) ofArab militiamen. People under these categories are in needs for- almost everything as their home/huts are burnt, assets looted, majority is exposed to torture and likely to have lost a family member.
1.2	livelihoods and food security:
Most of the IDPs arrived hadlost their productive assets, opportunities of reliable livelihoods are very little.  For their daily survival the newly displaced IDPs engaged in:
Collection of Fodder, firewood, charcoal for cooking and as means of income, although is dangerous, but is highly needed. Almost all HHs uses firewood collection as a means of income generating activities, and as sources for fuel for cooking.  Considerable numbers of the HHs do not have enough cooking sets.
Some of the IDPs used to practice Petty Trading in some stalls scattered within the local villages&apos; markets (mobile petty trading).  But due to lack of cash, they failed to restart their business.  So, if they could be assisted with unconditional cash transfer grants, many of them could start their shops again.
Collection of wild foods will also remain as an option at times scarcity and dire needs.</narrative>
