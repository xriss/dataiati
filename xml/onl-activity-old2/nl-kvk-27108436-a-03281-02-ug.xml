   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Since 2000 CREAM&apos;s strategic stance has evolved from the business approach to poverty focus thereby changing the organization into a local non-governmental organization from a business entity. The mission and objectives of CREAM now go beyond BDS to issues of gender sensitive socio-economic empowerment and environmental sustainability in the West Nile region. To achieve that CREAM has worked with CARE International to pilot Village Savings and Loan Association (VSLA) in Moyo and Yumbe districts 2004-6, scaled up promotionof VSLA in four districts namely Adjumani, Koboko, Moyo and Yumbe districts 2006/7 under CARE SUSTAIN phase 1 with funding from Department for International Department (DFID). Phase 2 had been approved since May 2008 and implementation is going on..  AdditionallyCREAM has been piloting Credit plus Self-help Affinity Groups concept targeting rural poor in Moyo and Yumbe districts with supportfrom Stromme Foundation. Whereas CREAM has targeted to reach 80% rural poor women in its programmes the intervention was not genderfocused. Accordingly in 2007 with support from OXFAM NOVIB gender mainstreaming in Business Development Services is being piloted in 8 sub counties of Arua through the Gender Action Learning Systems (GALS) approach. The present proposal looks at expansion of the earlier achievements.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Community organization for Rural Enterprise Activity Management (CREAM) is a local professional, not-for-profit, non-denominationalNGO operating in all the 9 Districts of West Nile region with its Head Office in Arua.
It is a member- based organizationdully registered with the National NGO Board (Reg: No.8666). It was formed in July 2000 by Community Business Advisors (CBAs) who worked with Joint Encouragement of New gainful Activity (JENGA), a project of CARE International in Uganda. The formation was motivated by numerous reasons. First, the West Nile region is the poorest in Uganda with over 6 in ten people living below US$ 1 a day. Second, many development interventions excluded the poorest people in the communities and the business advisors felt they could continue providingBusiness Development Services (BDS) in all the Districts in the Region. In the face of difficulty in accessing financial services for poor people, this organization provided hope and sustainable solutions to local people#s problems.
The organisation believes in the fact that the poor have the strength and will to get out of poverty and indeed this region can, and should, develop at a faster pace; and that any meaningful development is endogenous and is an integral function of both improved well-being and people#s economicempowerment.

 Since its formation in July,2000 with support of CARE International in Uganda, the organization registered a number of successes and transformed the lives of many poor people especially therural and peri-urban poor women and girls through partnering and implementing livelihood projects with a number of Partners and donors as indicated below;
