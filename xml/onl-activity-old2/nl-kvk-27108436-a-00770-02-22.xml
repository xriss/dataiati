   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This proposal refers to a sub-regional programme within ARROW&#x92;s overall work in the area of building regional partnerships for strengthening advocacy on SRHR. Though the  project is coordinated by ARROW, the management of the partnership and setting of the regional advocacy agenda will be lead by a Steering Committee (made up of the leadership of the national partner organisations) while the implementation coordination is lead by the Working Group (comprising the project officers and managers at nationaland regional levels).
Aims
The aim of the project within the period to be funded by this proposal is to contribute to an improved quality of life, particularly in the area of sexual and reproductive health and rights for marginalized women and young people in the Mekong Region, through civil society engagement for accountability in health governance.

The initiative is part of a larger, Asia-Pacific level programme of action by ARROW, called the Women&#x92;s Health and Rights Advocacy Partnership (WHRAP).Currently, ARROW implements WHRAP in a number of sub-regional projects including WHRAP South Asia (8 countries), WHRAP South East Asia (7 countries, which include all four Mekong region countries within this proposal) and WHRAP China.

Activities

This proposal includes a set of activities that are geared towards achieving the aims of the project and which span three component areas &#x96; mobilization, advocacy and civil society capacitydevelopment.
The expected results are:
- Number of young people directly mobilized to articulate their demand for improved SRHR information and services increased from 22 750 in 2011 to 27 500 by 2013.
- The number of advocacy engagements in 2013 increases by 20%from the baseline from WHRAP South East Asia project annual report numbers in 2011.
-  Capacity for effective advocacy increased and Number of occasions created to draw learning out of partner experiences.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">ARROW - Asian Pacific Resource &amp; Research Centre for Women</narrative>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Asian-Pacific Resource and Research Centre for Women (ARROW) was established in January 1993 in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, as a regional non-governmental, non-profit organisation. ARROWs vision is for women in Asia and the Pacific to be better able to define andcontrol their lives, particularly in the area of womens health and womens rights.
Since 1993, ARROW has been able to make significant progress towards this vision, particularly in the area of monitoring government progress towards international commitments such as the International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD)s Program of Action and the Beijing Womens Conference Platform for Action (PfA).
In 1994, ARROW produced an innovative resource kit entitled Towards Women-centred Reproductive Health that was extensively distributed during critical international conferences in following years, and is still in active use today. ARROW continued to develop other such creative information tools, including our quarterly publication ARROWs for Change, that are recognised for their added-value towards improving the conceptual frameworks with regards to womens health and rights.
From this stage of developing and disseminating information resources, in 1997 ARROW began extending the reach of the organisation by conducting multi-country monitoring projects of both Beijing and Cairo commitments. ARROW is the only NGO that has systematically completed both five-year and ten-year monitoring of progress towards ICPD targets in the Asia Pacific region.
In 1998, ARROW initiated high level policy dialogues between government policy makers and NGO partners.
Organisationally, there was the establishing of the Program Advisory Committee in 1997, which enabled continued programmatic relevance and excellence through the active participation and feedback from women leadersfrom within the region. ARROW incorporated the use of regional strategic planning meetings to inform the development of our five year strategic plans from 2001 onwards.
From the 1994 ICPD conference in Cairo, ARROW has consistently participated at critical international meetings while at the same time endeavouring to enable the participation of partner organisations in creating collective advocacy at these events. ARROW was the only womens NGO represented at the UNESCAP ICPD and 5 governmental meeting held in Bangkok, Thailand, and was one of 200 organisations that were selected from over 2,000 global applicants requesting to participate at the Millennium Development Goals and five NGO Review that was held in June 2005.
From 2002 onwards, ARROW continued to grow in terms of partnership building and capacity-building projects for evidence-based advocacy in collaboration with partners in the region. In 2005, thefirst Regional Policy Dialogue of the Womens Health and Rights Advocacy Partnership (WHRAP), which is a multi-country project of ARROW focusing on capacity-building for advocacy at local, national and regional levels, realised the first government-NGO Task Force on Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights. This was towards expanding regional level platforms for engaging with governments and increasing advocacy spaces.
The next five years will focus on consolidating all the various components of work that ARROW has been involved in: transformative information creation and dissemination; expanding spaces for regional and international partnerships for advocacy; local, national and regional capacity-building for evidence-based advocacy; monitoring and research on progress towards internationally agreed goals and commitments, organisational strengthening; and regional strategic partnerships for advocacy that contribute towards movement building.
ARROW is committed to promoting and protecting womens health rights and needs, particularly in thearea of womens sexuality and reproductive health. ARROW believes that good health, well-being and access to comprehensive, accessible and affordable gender-sensitive health services is a fundamental human right.
ARROWs long-term objectives are:
- health, reproductive health and population policies and programs are re-oriented to become more accessible, affordable, comprehensive and include a gender and rights approach;
- the womens movement and civil society become stronger and more effective in holding governments accountable to commitments, influencing policy agendas on womens health and rights, and gaining sustained representation on decision-making structures;
- womens health outcomes and womens lives improve, particularly in the area of sexual and reproductive health and rights, as well as violence against women, especially for poor and marginalised women and girls.</narrative>
