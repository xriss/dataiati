   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Palestine Link started in 2012-2013 with its work with universities and &apos;hogescholen&apos; to inform and mobilize students for justice and respect for human rights and peace in the Middle East. Hereby, Palestine Link wants to contribute to the general and political debate among students and political youth.

The implementation of the first phase of the project has been successful. In a relatively short period Palestine Link managed to reach out to many students and student organisations in at least 5 higher educational institutes. There is a growing acceptance of Palestine Link and its activities and students are keen to cooperate with us. The work has been done systematically and the strength of the strategy we developed lies in working with students and creating long term cooperationand network building, going forward step by step towards positioning Palestine Link as a credible partner and source of information/ portal to Palestine. During the last year, Palestine Linnk managed to organise many activities that helped increasing its visibility among students.

Palestine Link also reached out to many Palestinian students and mobilized them within the framework of the Palestinian Students Circle (currently counting 10 student members). In this context it is important to note that being at beginning stages Palestine Link will continue to work hard on positioning Palestine Link in a structural way through ongoing activities, initiating new contacts and involving more and more students as well as broadening the base for the distribution of its information and services and publicizing that through social media among others (Palestine Link also has a growing mailing list through which dissemination has happened of publications like the Palestine Link brochure &amp; and information document addressing the issue of registration of Place of Birth of Palestinians in the Netherlands). In addition, one important goal of this project is to continue to mobilize Palestinian students, organise them and strengthen their knowledge base to equip them to participate pro-actively in the debate. I.e. the general debate in Dutch society about the Palestinian case, starting with preparing them to participate in the debate with other students and become &quot;the ambassadors&quot; of Palestine and the Palestinians first and foremost within the students circles, but also beyond students circles. In fact, these young Dutch Palestinians are the future hope of Palestine Link. During the first project a coregroup was initiated, for which a program was developed on the basis of a needs assessment for the coming period.

In the first phase of the project, Palestine Link chose for a strategy to focus its efforts on 4-5 universities / colleges at this stage, but keepingthe possibility open for contact and exploring possibilities beyond these five universities. During this second phase PL will work on two levels; i.e. consolidating the network already built by means of tailor-made activities, as well as exploring possibilities for new contacts / networks to reach out to new locations / students and student organizations.

The main strategic lessons learned in the first project period are:
a)	reaching out to student organisations with activities relevant to their studies like for example students in technical studies are interested in issues relevant to their studies e.g. in the College tour students in Twente were interested in the presentation of a speaker from the PHG.
b)	Reaching out and mobilizing Palestinian students has been successful through relevant activities like lectures, film screenings as well as social activities where they can meet with each other and socialize together.
c)	The use of new social media helped in reaching out to many students / youth especially through connecting to their own social media outlets, such as the Facebook pages of FFIPP, Basis, Hikma and others.

The following external factors influenced theproject in a positive way:
-	The high level of interest and good cooperation of student organisations gave the project a boost.
-	The cooperation with other organisations in the implementation of various activities enabled us to create synergies, extra activitiesand strengthened impact despite the limited financial resources available for the project.
-	The flexibility to make use of opportunities (especially hosting Palestinians while on a visit to the Netherlands for other purposes) and organising ad hoc activities with students was also another effective way to do much more than planned at the beginning of the original project.

This new project has been developed with an eye on the above.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Founded in 2012, Palestine Link is a young organization that aims to represent a genuine, and independent Palestinian voice, as well as a professional resource and service center. Palestine Link provides quality work and services based on first hand knowledge in socio-economic, historical, cultural and political developments in Palestine and in the region, as well as the Dutch and European foreign policy on the Middle East.

Palestine Link&apos;s mission is to advocate for Palestinian national and human rights, and promotes Palestinian interests. It seeks to put Palestine and the Palestinians on the European agenda in a positive way through challenging thecurrent myths and stereotypes, re-framing the debate and contributing to branding Palestine, its people and its identity, and functioning as a bridge to link up people.

Palestine Link&apos;s scope of work includes:
- Setting the agenda: Palestine Link promotes a legal approach towards the Palestine questions. We seek to engage both politicians and civil society in this process, and to challenge the lack of consistency and coherence in the current policies of the Dutch government as well as the discrepancies? Between the Dutchpolicies and international law on Palestine and Israel.
- Challenging stereotypes: Palestine Link works to dissolve the cloud of myths and stereotypes surrounding Palestine and the Palestinians; the product of a long process of de-humanizing and demonizing a nation. Recapturing the history of Palestine and presenting the land and its people outside the framework of conflict and war will highlight the power of diversity of culture and opinions.
- Re-framing: Palestine Link aims to introduce correct political jargon and challenge the fixed mainstream paradigms that dominate political and public discourse.
- Advocating (human) rights: Palestine Link challenges the complicity with the occupier. The current Dutch and European Middle East policy is directed towards unconditional supportof the State of  Israel disregarding applicable international law and human rights treaties.
- Branding Palestine: Palestine Link aims to promote Palestine as an independent entity with an identity that goes beyond the dimensions of the conflict. We seek to broaden your view on the Palestinian society to include academia, economy, arts, civil society, nature, culture and literature.
- Building bridges: We initiate and facilitate tailor-made joint activities for Palestinians and Europeans with a specific focus on the Netherlands. In addition, We will offer an informal virtual meeting point on Palestine for all.
- Linking up: Palestine Link serves as a hub for all those interested in Palestine, and for Palestinians in search of opportunities and counterparts in the Netherlands.
- Encounters: Palestine Link facilitates tailor-made visits for groups of selected professionals and opinion makers to Palestine. We organize meetings with politicians, human rights organizations, civil society leaders, academics, youth and other groups as well as tours of the region that give a sense of life under occupation.</narrative>
