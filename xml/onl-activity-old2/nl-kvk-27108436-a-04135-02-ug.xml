   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In December 2013, fighting broke out in Juba in Central Equatoria and spread to other State in South Sudan, with intense fighting in Jonglei, Unity and Upper Nile States. Since 16 December, approximately 67,589 South Sudanese refugees have arrived in theborder region of Arua, Adjumani and Kiryandongo in Northern Uganda.  A large majority of the refugees are located in Adjumani (currently 78,435 refugees); and others are located in Arua and Kiryandongo, respectively

Refugees who have been resettled areliving in precariousconditions with limited access to safe water, and sanitation facilities, which increase their vulnerability. There are limited household latrines or bathing shelters in the settlement camps because refugees are settled into an area where they need to start many things from scratch, and most of the time they give priority to constructing a shelter.  With little or no cash to purchase shelter construction poles in the local market, refugees have resorted to cutting wood from their surrounding area. Wood is also used as cooking fuel and a source of light in their homes. These activities have translated into very visible reduction in vegetation cover and trees in the areas hosting the refugee population.

Problem description
Prior tothe refugee influx, environment experts were alreadywarning that Uganda is headed for energy and environmental crises as a result of the indiscriminate cutting of trees for wood fuel.The settlement process is already exerting a lot of pressure on the environment in West Nile  including the project target area (Adjumani) given that up to 80% of required materials for the settlement are provided by the environment (this includes timber for setting up houses, fuel wood, etc) .

Environmental degradationisamajor concern for all aid actors working in the area and host communities. The current refugee priorities of food and shelter have translated into a very visible reduction in vegetation cover and trees in the reception centres and settlement areas. Whileenvironmental degradation has been an issue before the influx of refugees, in Adjumani the state of the natural resource base is expected and is still a virgin source of conflict. The enormous negative impacts exerted on environment have also had diversecorrelating effect on gender dynamics and disparities hence an issuance that gender related activities have to be incorporated into the interventions at the refugee settlements.

This project will address selected beneficiaries within refugee and host population, schools and sub county headquarters. Particularly women and youth with various skills of establishing localized energy saving stoves (Lorena stoves). These skills are expected to support income generation and improvement in the standard of livingfor the beneficiaries even after the project ends. Other activities are geared to protecting the environment, improving living conditions through avoiding risky behaviors that may affect the environment.

In this project, CEFORD will  also workin partnership with Oxfam to  continue improving the WASH standards within the targeted settlements of Arua and Adjumani districts in terms of increasing access to safe water and sanitation facilities as well as intensified hygiene mobilization.  At thisphase of response, strengthening of the community based WASH management structures will be a key priority as this will ensure sustainable operation and maintenance of the established infrastructures and continued behaviour and practice changes.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">COMMUNITY EMPOWERMENT FOR RURAL DEV CEFORD</narrative>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The history of Community Empowerment for Rural Development (CEFORD) dates back to 1993 when the Uganda government, with the financial and technical support of the Dutch government, implemented the Community Action Program (CAP) and later the Women Empowerment Program (WEP) in the West Nile region. Both programs were considered successes by the communities and district local governments of West Nile, and external evaluators and the Dutch embassy in Uganda. The focus was on community mobilisation and capacity building through service delivery and the implementation of micro-projects. CAP concentrated on the supply of social infrastructure services and the implementation of agricultural projects, while WEP concentrated on the empowerment of women and the strengthening of their capacities to participate in the development process.
Thus CEFORD was founded, to fill the gap created by the closure of these successful programs that were phased out in June 2000. CEFORD operates in parts of all the five districts of Adjumani, Arua, Moyo, Nebbi and Yumbe.
It was founded in July 2000 but the process of its formation dates back to 1998, to an internal reflection workshop of CAP staff that identified possible scenarios for the future. One scenario suggested a merger of CAP and WEP into a local NGO.
The decentralisation of government to districts in Uganda also demanded strong civil society organisations that could support local governments indelivering services.
CEFORD&apos;s major achievements in the last three years include a participatory poverty assessment in the districts of Arua and Nebbi. Through these assessments CEFORD gave objective feedback from poor women and men to the district and central governments, and to some donor.
It was also successful in supporting the Adjumani district local government in facilitating the formulation of all its sub-county development plans. This enhanced its chance of accessing funds from the central government, from which the communities would benefit.
And CEFORD strengthened the capacities of four local organisations through organisational self-assessment and the facilitation of strategic planning. The performance of these organisations has since improved. It also mobilised and linked ten community-based organisations to funding for agricultural activities; over 30 million Ugandan shillings from the German Development Services.
CEFORD&apos;s Mission is to improve the capacity of women, men, children and their organisations in the more disadvantaged communities of West Nile effectively to articulate their demands and interests, to increase their production and income in a sustainable way and to secure better access to services.
The institutional objectives of CEFORD are to contribute to the following policy and practice changes in West Nile: food and income security is guaranteed, communities have positive attitude to the enrolment and retention of girls in schools, there is active participation of the population in district and sub-county planning and policy formulation (especially around issues of natural resources, peace and security),  peace and security in the region are consolidated especially at the household level, and women are empowered to participate as equal partners to men in decision-making and control over resources at the household and community levels.</narrative>
