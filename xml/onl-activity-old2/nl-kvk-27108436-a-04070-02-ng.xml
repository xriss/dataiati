   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Book on Culture&amp;African Women Leadership</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The book is viewed as an important and timely contribution of OH to the ongoing recognition and accelerated promotion of integration of women rights and gender equality in development --as a condition sine qua non for sustainable development. The goal of this book is to help African women complement their modern leadership strategies with tools distilled from traditional women leadership roles, experiences, and networks, thereby empowering them not to lead more effectively and confidently in the hybrid cultural environment in Africa, but also to promote the emergence of a critical mass of African women leaders-sorely needed to populate the apex governance and private sector decision making institutions. The book will provide insights into understanding how women can leverage lessons of their grandmothers&apos; wisdom and leadership skills and styles to enhance their leadership and empowerment goals. The book will also sensitize men on how much they stand to gain by sharing power and challenges at home, the work place and communities.
With increased global focus on the benefits that accrue from strategic promotion of gender equality and women leadership, it#s time for women of Africa to step into leadership roles as a matter of right and equality. But change rarely comes easily, especially in Africa where gender inequality is not only deeply rooted in male dominated cultural traditions, but also condoned by colonial heritage. For African women to lead with rights-based confidence, they must acquire tool-kits of leadership and management skills that integrate women friendly traditional and modern leadership strategies. The goal of this book is to help African women complement their modern leadership strategies with tools distilled from traditional women leadership roles, experiences, and networks, thereby empowering them not to lead more effectively and confidently in the hybrid cultural environment in Africa, but also to promote the emergence of a critical mass of African women leaders-sorely needed to populate the apex governance and private sector decision making institutions. There is strength in numbers. The book will provide insights into understanding how women can leverage lessons of their grandmothers&apos;wisdom and leadership skills and styles (Mamaisms) to enhance their leadership and empowerment goals. The book will also sensitize men on how much they stand to gain by sharing power and challenges at home, the workplace, and communities.
The main messages of thebook include:
Increased awareness raised on the huge impact of culture on gender equality and women empowerment with special focus on women leadership and access to high-level decision-making institutions.
Insights on how lessons from traditional women leadershiproles and experiences can be incorporated into the toolkit for women leadership development.
Examples of what men stand to gain when they wholeheartedly support gender equality and walk side by side with women in decision-making and leadership. Such leadership forged out of equal partnership between men and women will be transformational and more effective in addressing the complex leadershipand development challenges of African communities today.

The strategy:
Through literature review; action research; collection, documentation, and analysis of life stories; testimonies and experiences of women, the book will distil strategies women have used or are using in addressing leadership and management challenges, in a male dominated  environment exacerbated by cultural conflict between Africa and the West, and the frequent conflicts/wars in the African region. The book will offer analysis and lessons from the stories that can help women not only attain the leadership positions they desire, but succeed in them. It will identify traditional women coping mechanisms and networks that can enhance women capacity to address gender based challenges in their private and professional lives. The book will proffer strategies on how women can use the skills of the grandmothers without sacrificing their rights, without accepting inferiority that compromises their management and leadership skills; without discounting the positive traditional aspects of the culture that empower them. Finally the book will include examples of what men have to gain by promoting gender equality and women leadership.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Other Half Women Empowerment Initia</narrative>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Other Half Women Empowerment Initiative (OH) is a new organization founded in 2013. This is why it was founded the impact of culture on women access to equal rights with men. Almost all women, no matter their level of education, social or economic status, do findthemselves at some point fragilised and/or violated because of discriminatory or harmful practices that are sustained by patriarchal governance and cultural concept of gender. Global and national governance structures and civil society organizations, including the UN have addressed women empowerment through conferences, constitutions, legislative actions, resolutions, charters, conventions and programs. These efforts have rightly focused more on empowering women through access to education and health, participation in political and economic lives. They have certainly yielded tremendous results but they have not adequately addressed women rights and gender equality,#which continue to be regimented by dominant patriarchal cultures and male biased gender paradigms.
Unless the impact of patriarchal governance systems/structures and male biased gender paradigms on women access to equal rights is honestly and strategically addressed by both men and women, real achievement of development objectives like equitable governance, gender equality, poverty alleviation will remain elusive, and the cost of delayed achievement of these objectives will continue to be devastating to development. Women must therefore learn to lead the process of gender equality struggle by focusing on mitigating the burden of culture on their rights through strategic partnership and negotiations with men.  Women success in doing this will, to a great extent will depend on their good understanding of how culture impacts on gender paradigms and limits their access to right and gender equality
Inthe last one year, OH provided capacity building services to the UN Women in Sierra Leone. They worked with the UN Women, the government of Sierra Leone, the UN system and other donors to ensure that gender is fully integrated in the country&apos;s national development plan, titled #Agenda for Prosperity# but also that gender was included as a stand-alone pillar in the development plan. This is the first time it was done in Africa! OH also worked with the government, women organizations and NGOs to design a gender agenda that strengthened partnerships among all women organizations and women at all levels of governance, in such a way the women from all walks of life have sense of ownership of thegender agenda.
In Nigeria, OH worked with the UN Women and UNESCO to develop a project on girls# education that took into account the cultural and gender impact on girls# education and the nature of the aid that will be needed by the Chibok girls once they are released. They also worked with the UN Women to design implementation strategies for women economic and governance projects that took into account Nigeria&apos;s cultural and gender specificity.
Furthermore, OH continues to provide training to women entrepreneurs, in Nigeria and in other Africa counties on enterprise development that includes the impact of culture and gender on women enterprises.(as a result, OH is being invited to participate in the preparation of a study for the establishment of a women financial institution in Zambia). The women enterprise training also covers work life balance issues, women life-longinvestment strategies and retirement/aging planning. We continue to deliver lectures and provide technical assistance to institutionson how to address the impact of the interplay of African culture and gender in development activities and sectors.</narrative>
