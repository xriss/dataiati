   <narrative xml:lang="EN">ACC &#x96; Associacao Construindo Comunidades, is an NGO based in Huila province. Since their founding in 2003 they have been working mainly in the Southern part of Huila province with pastoralist communities. The livelihoods of these communities are under increasing threat, through the increasing land-grabbing that started after the end of the civilian war. Both local large landowners (fazendeiros) as elite from Luanda start occupying land and raise fences without any consultation of traditional users of this area, communities which are living and depending on routes they traditionally walk with their cattle.  Also (inter)national companies started exploring local resources and evicted sometimes whole communities from their traditional areas.
ACC gives voice to these marginalized rural communities and as stakes are high (involvement of high place government persons) their work has to be done under a lot of pressure and often they received threats. Nonetheless they were able to have some victories with their lobby/advocacy work, especially whenthe government started building a large fence around a National Park located in the area. This blocked the traditional roads for the pastoralist. Through ACCs work, that included taking local pastoralists to Luanda to advocate their case at governmental institutions and political parties, the fence had to be broken down. However, this only seems to be a short-term victory as in reality the needs and interests of local communities continue to be not taken into account. ACC plans to continue pressing local and national government to give attention to needs of these pastoralist groups. One of their strategies, one that worked in the above case, is facilitating that local leaders are able to speak out for the needs of their communities. ACC not only tries organizing meetings with the responsible duty bearers, but also uses its membership of the African Commission on Human Rights to report on this situation. As thenext meeting of the African Commission will take place in Luanda, ACC plans to prepare a group of local leaders (men and women) to report on their case during the unofficial sessions of the Commision.

The current proposal is a continuation of ACCs work with these rural communities, based on their Strategic Plan on Human Rights 2010-2015. Our contribution will be a contribution to the 2014 yearplan/budget, financed mainly by Christian Aid (since 2010 on a yearly basis). Oxfam Novib funds will be used to finance the activities related to their advocacy and lobby work. We will also facilitate the participation of ACC in our capacity buildings trajectoryon lobby and advocacy, so that this can feed directly into their project. Existing links with some of our other partners (SOS Habitat and AJPD), which will also participate, can be better explored.</narrative>
