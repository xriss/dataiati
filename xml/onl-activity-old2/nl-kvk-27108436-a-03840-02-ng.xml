   <narrative xml:lang="EN">GOTNI was founded in the year 1996. The vision was birthed by its President, Linus Okorie, as an undergraduate in the Imo State University. It began with a desire to see the right set of leaders elected into student government leadership positions in theUniversity, eventually permeating to witnessing the election of credible leaders in political leadership positions across Nigeria as a whole.GOTNI as an organization has experienced tremendous growth since its inception, moving from a university based vision, to a national vision of raising young men and women all over the nation, who will be taught the right sets of leadership values for transformational leadership in their fields of endeavour and in every aspect of the Nigerian polity. The Organizationis a registered, Non-profit, Non-Governmental organization growing from gathering a few youths for leadership empowerment programs and seminars in Lagos Nigeria, to holding larger leadership conferences, seminars and programs all across the country fromLagos to Owerri, to Abuja, to Port Harcourt and to other parts of the country. Over the years, other brands of GOTNI have emerged such as the Leadership Clinic monthly seminars, Leadership Clinic on television and radio, the Emerging Leaders Conference, theGOTNI Community Outreach Program, the GOTNI Mission to Schools Outreach among others. GOTNI has made big leaps in integrating both genders into its programmes and initiatives, with key positions and responsibilities handled by females. For example, the GOTNI radio and television shows are headed by females, the team leads for events and logistics, communication and media are females. These are the reasons why GOTNI is on an advocacy campaign for women in political leadership in Nigeria, and stop the marginalization of women from seeking political office positions andparticipating actively in its processes.
In the past three years, GOTNI has been able to empower over 10,000 Young Nigerians who have participated in her programmes and Leadership conferences and seminars such as the Emerging Leaders Conference, The National Youth Economic Summit, and the Leadership Clinic and among other GOTNI programmes and initiatives. The Leadership Clinic on television has also been a tool to reach both young and old Nigerians, addressing critical leadership issues confronting our country and providing solutions, as well as teaching the right leadership values that will help them in their daily living. The GOTNI Youth EmpowermentSummits have witnessed the emergence of future leaders among the youth, equipped with the right sets of leadership values needed for the transformation of Nigeria</narrative>
