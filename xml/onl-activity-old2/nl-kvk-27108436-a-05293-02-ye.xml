   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Project Title: Resilience and Peace Building in Hodiedeh- Yemen
Project Description:
The proposed project will reach out to the most vulnerable households in Hodiedah, where poor women and children left alone when men have left to fight in the current war. This situation has led to increase women#s mobility so as the protection issues. Women are now more engaged in livelihood income generation and therefore, the proposed intervention will target women headed households, providing  skills to help them building the livelihood opportunities, have access to protection assistance such as access to referrals legal support and sheltering as well as increase young women#s understanding and involvement in conflict management and peace building activities.
Geographic focus:
The proposed interventions will be implemented in Hodeidah, where Oxfam and the two implementing partners have extensive presence and experience in this governorate.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Oxfam&#x92;s vision is a just world without poverty. We envision a world in which people can influence decisions which affect their lives, enjoy their rights, and assume their responsibilities as full citizens of a world in which all human beings are valued and treated equally.

Oxfam GB is a development, relief and campaigning organisation dedicated to finding lasting solutions to poverty and suffering around the world. Oxfam GB&apos;s principal objectives as stated in its statutes are &apos;to relieve poverty, distress and suffering in any part of the world&apos; and &apos;to educate the public concerning the nature, causes and effects of poverty&apos;. Oxfam GB, with a view to achieving greater impact on poverty and suffering, has joined seventeen other international affiliates around the world to form Oxfam International. Oxfam GB is a member of Oxfam International, a confederation of 17 affiliates from different countries registered in Europe, the Americas, and Asia.

Oxfam GB&apos;s purpose is articulated by its five Strategic Change Objectives. Oxfam believes everybody has the rights to: Sustainable Livelihood, Life and Security, Essential Services, Being Heard, Equity (gender equality).

Oxfam GB works in seventy countries across the world. Oxfam GB&apos;s global programme is delivered by six regional centres and by a seventh team responsible for an anti-poverty programme in the UK. Regional programmes, while contributing towards achieving Oxfam global objectives, are shaped by the particular nature of poverty in that region and by the strategic opportunities available for impacting upon sustainable poverty reduction.

Oxfam&apos;s continuous presence in Yemen for over three decades dates back to 1983 when we provided emergency humanitarian assistance to thousands of victims of the Dhamar governorate earthquake.
Since then Oxfam presence has grown, enabling us to repeatedly respond to humanitarian needs throughout the country while developing a solid reputation for delivering quality programming within often challenging environments.

Over the past 5 years, Oxfam has scaled up its humanitarian and development programmes, responding to the growing needs of an increasingly impoverished population. Oxfam&apos;s Yemen programme is one of the largestbeing implemented by Oxfam globally, and had a total budget of over &#xA3;11.5 million for FY 2015. This large investment in Yemen reflects the huge needs in-country, as well as Oxfam&apos;s commitment to responding to these needs.

Prior to the recent escalation of the crisis, our robust network of long established field offices located throughout the country as well as the dedication of our skilled and experienced staff have enabled Oxfam to consistently provide quality humanitarian and development programming across seven  governorates - Sa&apos;ada, Hadramout, Aden, Taiz, Hodeidah, Hajjah, and Abyan. Furthermore, through our field offices in each of these governorates, Oxfam has developed strong community based roots with target beneficiaries and a positive working relationship with key stakeholders and decision makers who are familiar with our work, reputation and the positive change we bring. Oxfam&apos;s humanitarian programme focuses on meeting the basic needs of the most vulnerable, which includes access to safe and clean water, support on hygiene and sanitation, screening and referrals for malnutrition, cash transfers and livelihoods support.

Since Operation Decisive Storm began on 26 March 2015, Oxfam has been able to respond to meet the urgent needs of the humanitarian crisis; initially through remote programming, and since June, direct implementation of a scaled up response including the opening of two new field offices in Khamir (Amran governorate) and Shafer (Hajjah governorate). Oxfam&#x92;s operational areas currently include Amran, Hajjah and Hodeidah, with support also being provided to the Aden local water corporation. A recent assessment has been concluded in Taiz, where we will start our response once the security situation allows, and a further assessment is planned for Aden in August to determine how we can expand our response. Our office in Sa&#x92;ada remains closed and access in the governorate has been classified by OCHA as the worst in the country. The situation will be reviewed around whether work can be re-started in the governorate, as well as conducting intention surveyswith beneficiaries to ensure that our response is aligned with their plans for return.

Oxfam has a full team of highly motivated staff already based in Hajjah and Amran, consisting of Public Health Engineers and Public Health Promoters as well as an a contingentof long serving programme support staff. Oxfam is one of the few agencies who have scaled up in this response and who has permanentinternational staff in country.</narrative>
