   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Q-SCHOOLGOVFrom 2005 to 2011, Oxfam Novib supported the two phases of Enhanced Girls# Basic Education in North Nigeria (EGBENN), implemented by AAN in 36 communities in three states in North West Nigeria (Zamfara, Sokoto and Kebbi). Good results were achieved in girls# enrolment at community level and some progress was made in policy and practice changes at state level. This follow-up projectshifts to the quality of primary education in Kebbi state through addressing two critical factors. Firstly the greater involvement of women in school governance and stimulating their daughters. Secondly, the in-service training of (female) teachers. It covers thefirst two years of a total intervention of three years. As Oxfam Novib is phasing out from Basic Social Services programmes in Nigeria, i.e. education and health, by 2013, this is Oxfam Novib#s final contribution to the project. The project will be completed as part of AAN#s Local Rights Programme (former PAP).
The project will be implemented in 16 communities in three Local Government Areas (LGAs) in Kebbi state, North West Nigeria. The communities are a combination of those covered under the previous EGBENN programme and those covered under AAN#s Local Rights Programme. See Annex 1 of the Description forfurther details.

1. Improved quality of education through in-service training of teachers
By December 2013, the quality of public primary education in the 16 selected communities will be improved through the in-service training of all 128 teachers (78male, 50 female, some 60/40%) in collaboration with the National Teachers# Institute (NTI). The training of the available female teachers is first priority. The training will take place twice a year and among others cover gender, HIV/AIDS and participatory teaching methodology. Some 4,000 school children (2,400 male, 1,600 female, some 60/40%) in the 16 communities will benefit directly. The improvement of quality will be measured with a pre-project inception test, bi-annual review and assessment tests and an end-line learning assessment test among school children currently in primary 3-4.

2. Strengthen the capacity of women to support girls# education and participate in school governance
# By December 2013,Mothers# Associations will be establishedand strengthened in all 16 selected communities. Some 50 women will participate per community. The associations will undertake income generating activities to contribute to school costs and opportunity costs to send their daughters to school. The contribution to school costs will consist of sponsoring particularly disadvantaged girls and/or school improvement. The empowerment will also lead to an increased effective participation of women in the School Based Management Communities (SBMCs) from less than 10% now to 35-50% by December 2013.
# To further strengthen the enrolment and retention of girls, existing Girls# Clubs will be sustained and strengthened in the 16 communities, with an average membership of 50 girls each.

3. Application ofPromoting Rights in Schools (PRS)
By December 2013, PRS will be effectively applied in the 16 selected communities by the government and citizens as a standard to improve quality education. PRS is a comprehensive charter of 10 measurable rights to education developed by Action Aid International. It offers a framework for citizens to gather evidence on the state of education enabling them to hold duty bearers accountable for developing inclusive and sustainable solutions to ensure quality learning for all children.Some 71 key policy and law makers will participate in the data collection and analysis. As a result, they will appreciate the need for change without much persuasion. The policy and law makers will be drawn from the Local Government Education Authorities(LGEAs), State Universal Basic Education Board (SUBEB), Ministry of Education (MoE), Ministry of Women#s Affairs (MoWA) and the 16 members of the Kebbi state House of Assembly representing the 16 selected communities.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">ActionAid Nigeria (AAN) is a local Non-Governmental Organization. It is an affiliate of ActionAid International and also registeredwith CAC in Nigeria. ActionAid Nigeria commenced programme operations in Nigeria in January 2000 and currently operates inalmost all the 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory of Nigeria.  Its programmes are spread in Six Thematic Areas; Democracy and Governance; Health, Education, Food and Agriculture, Conflict and Human security and women#s rights.  Linking all theseis the geographically based integrated Local Rights Program (LRP) # a long term partnership and engagement strategy which is being implemented in twelve states of the federation.

ActionAid Nigeria continually works with community based organisations in its local Rights Programme, strengthening the capacity of partners to carry out voter education which helps curb violence and other electoral vices. It also supports partner organisations to embark on budget tracking and monitoring activities and to conduct capacity building workshops in their communities to observe and question public service delivery. Its head office is in Abuja, a southern regional office in Lagos and project offices spread across different parts of the country.  Since the year 2000,AAN has partnered and administered grants to over200 Civil Society Organizations across the 36 states and FCT of Nigeria. Its current annual budget is over $7m drawn from institutional donors and sponsorship Program (where individuals from across some Northern Countries, commit a particular amount periodically,to sponsoring and caring for children). Currently, AAN manages over 50 CSOs in delivering various programs and projects, across Nigeria

The strength of its systems and processes is demonstrated from our partnership framework/process (Partnership Assessment Development Framework # PADEF), specifically developed by ActionAid Nigeria and now adopted by several international agencies in and outside Nigeria. It has over seventy (70) experienced, well-motivated and passionate staff spread across various offices in the Country.Almost 70% of these staff are based in AAN#s head office in Abuja while others are in their southern regional office in Lagos and project offices spread across the country.

Financial system and capacity.
ActionAid uses SUN system account package to capture all its project expenses and the Vision reporting software to generate all donor reports. This helps ensure accuracy and timeliness. ActionAid financial year end is 31stDecember of every year. it has an internal auditor office (with two Professional auditors # all chartered accountants). The office assesses financial transactions, systems and audits project expenses and partners on a regular basis or based on need. In addition, ActionAid International Internal auditors audit the Country Program every two years. Some projects are also audited based on donor requirements.  ActionAid Nigeria as a statutory requirement carries out annual audit of its financial statements. The current external auditor is Ernst and Young Chartered Accountants
