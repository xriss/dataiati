  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In order to bring about positive sustainable changes in the lives of people and their organisations, Oxfam Afghanistan will continue with capacity building interventions for its own staff, partner organizations, and other civil society/grassroots organizations (working within our geographical programme area). This is consistent with Oxfam Afghanistan#s strategic plan and Oxfam Global-CapacityBuilding Policy emphasising our continued commitment to work with and through partnerships. Oxfam has developed aconcept for a period of one year in order to roll out its capacity building mandate.

Oxfam pursues its vision through multiple sets of action agenda.Firstly, direct partnership with LNGOs and vulnerable communities for facilitating their local initiatives. Secondly, contribute towards reducing poverty and social disparities, ensuring basic services, and institution building through increasing participation inlocal governance and protecting environment. Another action agenda is to influence policy processes by promoting articulation of the perspectives of the poor and disadvantaged. This may be achieved by facilitating alliance/networks among various civil society actors.
Supporting and nurturing these agenda, Oxfam#s Programme along with relevant support functions will carry forward Oxfam#s agenda for capacity building with a view to promote self-identity, self-reliance and self-growth of marginalized communities. Oxfam seeksto strengthen and widen the process of learning across a variety of relevant themes and contexts of different stakeholders in social development at different levels. It will mainly focus on the processes of transfer and exchange of knowledge and experiences, as well as the provision of technical expertise.

We will work to accomplish this mission through following: human resource development, institutional strengthening, organizational development, creating an enabling environment through discussion, discourse and publications.

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Co-ordination of Humanitarian Assistance (CHA) was founded in 1987 by a group of motivated Afghans involved in the provision of emergency relief to desperate populations in Western Afghanistan. The organisation quickly began to work on reconstruction andsustainable development. This took place in villages where hardly any developed had happened as a result of the war, and to support vulnerable groups in society, such as returning refugees.
In its twenty six years of existence CHA has implemented projects in all sectors ofrelevance to rural development: agriculture, cattle raising, basic healthcare, and water supply, rural infrastructure (irrigation, roads and public buildings). CHA has developed approaches for every segment of the population, includingwomen. Its most important tool is working with the village council Shura or Community Development council (CDC), which kicks off processes at the local level.

CHA has been involved in improvement of formal and informal education system extensively. Through it#s Galaxy training centers, CHA provided training to girls in languages, science, computer, internet and fine arts to provide growth and development opportunities for young children. It also provides training for young adults preparing them for jobmarkets. It was a partner in large education programs such as Education Quality Improvement Program EQUIP and The building education support system for teachers (BESST) to support teachers so that they are able to deliver quality education for children.

Oxfam Novib has been supporting projects since 1992. In 1998 it began to support a wider program of providing services at the regional level. Vocational and supplementary education courses have also been given in several towns. This was often to supplement the many rural programs. CHA has regularly become involved in distributing emergency relief aid. Within the organisation the importance of such relief aid is subservient to that of long-term development; it is provided to save lives.

After 2001,CHAhas grown into one of the largest and most important national NGOs in Afghanistan working in the fields of rural development, education, health and is an important implementing partners of the Ministry of Rehabilitation, Reconstruction and Development (MRRD) in its community led rural development National Solidarity Program (NSP) and in the Afghan National Development Strategy (ANDS). CHA has actively and independently engaged in and initiated innovative projects like awareness raising through the radio,targeting the marginal poor, including women, in a program focusing on the improvement of the value chain of trade in natural plants, working with Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR), the establishment of an Afghan Education Watch, and more recently it hasincorporated popular campaigning in its intervention strategies.

In 2011, Oxfam Novib launched a pilot project - an innovative distance learning model that improves quality and accessibility of education for students, especially girls, within the frameworkof the vision of the Ministry of Education. CHA was an implementing partner for Oxfam Novib. The pilot phase was completed in Feb 2013 and was able to develop a model that improved the performance of girls and boys in 21 schools in Parwan and reducedropout rate. It was also very successful in improving teachers# capacity to deliver quality education in schools.</narrative>
