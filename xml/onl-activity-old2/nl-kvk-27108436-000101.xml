   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Introduction SLHAP
Strong and empowered local actors play a key role in leading and delivering effective response. They work with vulnerable communities before, during and after crisis and have a deep understanding of the context. However, the international humanitarian community is currently not designed to systematically recognise the role and potential of local actors or define what international actors will do in the coming years to increase local/national humanitarian capacity.

Time for a Change!
Oxfam#s vision is to achieve an increase in local leadership in emergency response by 2020. Based on pilots with local humanitarian actors in Somalia and El Salvador the Strong Local Humanitarian Actors Programme is developed by Oxfam Novib, America, Intermon and GB and aims to scale-up the approach the next 5 years. SLHAProject2015 starts up SLHA projects in 6 countries managed bij Oxfam Novib, Oxfam America and Intermon Oxfam.

Oxfam Strong Local Humanitarian Actors Programme
This programme seeks to achieve that local actors play a leading role in humanitarian work with the interest of women, children and men affected by disaster at the centre. The Strong Local Humanitarian Actors Programme provides a practical approach for supporting local actorsto take the lead in humanitarian response. This programme employs a participatory methodology to analyse the humanitarian response ecosystem in-country and discuss positive elements in capabilities and collaboration, as well as blockers preventing local actors from fulfilling their potential. A capacity building pathway then maps the way to develop local humanitarian leadership. Sharing this analysis and discussing what it requires from whom in the system to reach a next level increases ownership, collaboration and provides new venues to capacity development and to resource mobilisation to support this.

Areas of intervention

Strength
Local actors (government, private sector and civil society) have the capacity to deliver and lead humanitarian preparedness and response. This demands organisational capacity and collective agenda and leadership of organisations to influence and work with others.

Space
Creating an enabling environment to allow the Space for local actors to use, claim and further develop their Strength. International stakeholders need to recognize and trust the capacity (Strength) of local humanitarian actors and create an enabling environment and a willingness to develop equitable relations, engaging in information sharing, networking and mutual learning. Strength and Space are two sides of the same coin and form the basis of this Program!

Oxfam Change
Oxfam will lead in changing its own attitudes and practices and in convincing others to do the same. We will do so by addressing the external environment of donors and the public, and our internal environment (staff, including management, and the systems of decision-making and funding).</narrative>
