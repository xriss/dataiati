   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The general objective is to empower people with disabilities (PWD) to enable them to collectively raise their voices, demand their rights and influence the ways in which governance decisions impact on their lives through development of civil society organizationsmanaged by the PWD and their families.The project duration is from August 2013 to Dec 2015.  Total approved budget of US$97,339 (OHK funds US$85,839 and MCNV contributes US$11,500).

Approach
The project works to achieve three specific objectives:
1. By December 2015, 05 civil society organizations of PWD in Huong Hoa are strong enough and able to support local PWD in accessing their basic rights.
2. By December 2015, the PWD in project areas participate in social economic development plansand public events, and are able to advocate for their rights to information
3. By December 2015, the economic status of the participating PWD and their families will have been improved, through using appropriate livelihood development approaches.

Target Groups
The members of 5 Disabled People#sOrganizations (DPOs) in five communes of Thanh, A Xing, A Tuc, Xy and A Doi are the target groups of the project. In addition, an estimated 1,400 members of PWD family members and/or care-givers will participate directly in the project activities.

Expected changes
- 80% of the DPOs will have concrete evidence to show their own successful microfinance model (The successful model should cover need of 70% of members, get 97% payback rate, high score of performance capabilities, and effective PM&lt;(&gt;&amp;&lt;)&gt;E system in place)
- 70% of PWD will gain more confidence in connecting with other people via different kinds of communication tools such as the Internet and mobile phones
 80% of the DPOs will have developed and realized their plan of action in which rights of and key issues face by the PWD are clearly stated (the awareness of their rights, the understanding of key issues/stereotypes that PWD are facing and being able to articulate such issues as well as their asksin SEDP and other public dialogues)
- 100% of the DPOs will percept that the intra-relationship within DPOs , including #shared agenda#, mutual supports enterprises have intensified (Via the midterm and final evaluation, the DPOs will be invited to measure the intra-relationship within DPOs by Venn diagram)
- Communities and local authorities will have increased respect for the contribution to community development of PWD and their DPOs</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">MCNV started in 1968 as a solidarity organization during the war in Vietnam. MCNV&apos;s vision is that in countries in South East Asia which are in a phase of transition, marginalized groups need to be empowered to obtain equitable access to health care, education, housing and food security, so that they can influence the processes, systems and individuals that presently limit their development.MCNV&apos;s mission is to contribute to the structural improvement of the health of disadvantaged groups in South-EastAsia by developingevidence-based participatory models that build capacity and focus on the major determinants of population health.

MCNV started itscollaboration with Quang Tri province in 1974. One of MCNV#s successful programs is the community-managed health development (CMHD)program in Quang Tri province. CMHD is an approach to healthy community that facilitates communities to gain ownership of their health and development. CMHD empowers communities using participatory methods and bottom-up planning, promotes participation of the community in decision-making and improves access and advocacy of communities for their own development. CMHD promotes equity by workingwith all people in the community but pays special attention to the disabled, the ethnic minorities, the very poor, and women and children. In this process, villagers make their own health development plans, based on their own analysis of their health situation and with their own resources.

Recently, MCNV has paid more attention to support PWD in the development of civil society, rehabilitation and inclusive education, using for planning and evaluation the approach of Outcome Mapping, which focuses on changes in behaviors, actions, attitudes and relationships of boundary partners. MCNVsupports the civil society organizations and local NGO to lobby forthe rights of PWD and other marginalized groups. With the CMHD program, MCNV has supported PWD to establish 16 commune-level civil society organizations of PWD and one #umbrella# NGO inQuang Tri province. Their network plays an important role in empowering PWD. MCNV strengthens the civil society organizations through applying current models such as the &quot;five capabilities&quot; and principles of &quot;outcome mapping&quot; for learning, planning, monitoring and evaluation. In Vietnam, MCNV supports the target groups to develop similar civil society organizations in Cao Bang, Phu Yen, Dak Lak and Khanh Hoa provinces.</narrative>
