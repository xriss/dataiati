   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The action builds on Cord&#x92;s current capacity development program in Laos. Since 2010, Cord has facilitated action learning workshops and individualized coaching sessions for over 10 NPAs in areas of strategic planning, proposal writing, participatory planning andevaluation, governance and non-violent communication. Cord is actively involved in networks supporting civil society to share best practices, avoid redundancies and develop a harmonized approach.

For this project, Oxfam Novib/Cord apply a partnership-based capacity development model to facilitate the strengthening of selected civil society organisations in Laos, thereby enabling them to moreeffectively and creatively manage resources and to play a more dynamic and active role in the ongoing development of civil society and democratic process in the country. This model is also applied in relation to key government actors, namely, the State Administration and Development Department, under PACSA, which is tasked with the responsibility for regulating and monitoring civil society organisations in Laos. The primary implementer of this action is Cord who has established a multidisciplinary advisory team in Laos and is currently developing partnerships with various NPAs, including developing further those relationships already in place with Oxfam Novib partners.  These NPAs include, the local associate Gender Development Association (GDA) who has extensive expertise workingon women&#x92;s rights and gender empowerment issues; and the local implementingpartner Participatory Development Training Centre (PADETC) which incubates nascent Lao civil society organisations, including the Hmong Sisterhood Association and the Coalition for Lao Information, Communication and Knowledge (CLICK). PADETC is also highly skilled in developing media to increase political representation and participation and has launched and supports a network of learning centres throughout the country to support youth education through action-learning.

Building long-term partnerships
Because capacity development is necessarily a long-term process, the approach used is predicated on the establishment of a solid foundation of an agreed long-term partnership. Partnership is understood to mean working alongside civil society, governmentand private actors in mutually accountable relationships, where joint strategies and partnership agreements have been developed for the long term.

Action learning training events
While a significant portion of the workof this action will be conducted through individualised coaching and mentoring of partner organisation leaders and staff, it has also been recognised through initial consultations with NPAs and other INGOs working with them that there are a number of learning needs that are common to allNPAs.

Coaching and mentoring
It is widely recognised that training as a standalone activity is insufficient in bringing about real learning and change. In all areas of work in this action, principles of coaching, mentoring and facilitation are usedinsupporting local organisations, networks and government agencies.

Multi-stakeholder facilitation of networks and communities of practice
As agents of capacity development support, senior and national advisors play an important role in multi-stakeholder facilitation, both in the structured sense of conferences, and network and COP meetings and in the less formal sense of facilitating communities of practice and long-term processes of interaction.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">PADETC (Participatory Development Training Centre) was officially founded in late 1996. With an initial staff of five Lao development workers (four men and one woman), PADETC#s broad objective was to promote alternative models of development aimed at helping Laos# people to find ways to improve their livelihoods in a just and sustainable way.
Prior to its founding its director and his small team of development workers had worked in various aspects of agriculture and integrated rural development in many rural communities in Laos for more than 15 years, with the support mainly from international NGOs and some UN agencies.  During the early 1980s the team#s work had focused mainly on improvement of food security in poor rural communities by promoting low-cost appropriate agriculturaltechnologies, such as use of bio-fertilisers and bio-pesticides, and integration of fish-raising in the rice fields, etc. The impetus for working on food security during that time was the need to address the problem of food shortages faced by many rural communities in the aftermath of the 30-year war of independence which ended only in 1975.  It was through working on these agriculture-related projects that the team understood that the food security of Lao rural communities could not be solely resolved through improvements in agricultural techniques, but must be systematically tackled at a multi-dimensional level.
From the early 1990s onwards PADETC broadened its work to include integrated rural development, with the emphasison strengthening the capacities of rural communities andempower them to improve their livelihoods systematically.
The main strategic approaches used included: the promotion of participatory processes for community development, especially the use of participatory processes in problem analysis and planning in collaboration with local authorities and communities; the training of multi-sector rural development teams comprising staff from the agriculture, education, health, and woman#s unions at various levels (village, district, province); the setting up of integrated rural development offices at the provincial and district levels to provide management, extension, and monitoring support; and the production of Lao language manuals and forms for village surveys, planning, budgeting, reporting, and many types of production techniques.
With the expansion of its scope of work programmatically and geographically, PADETC has grown from its original staff of five in 1996 to anorganisation with 53 staff (12 women), all of them Lao. PADETC also draws on the support from international expertise in the form of short-term technical experts, advisors and volunteers, etc. through international agencies, such as German International Aid (DED), Singapore International Foundation (SIF), Australia Volunteer Service, etc.
PADETC continues to co-operate closely with governmentagencies at all administrative levels and ensures that responsible authorities are regularly briefed on the progress of its projects. PADETC has closeco-operation with a number of NGOs, UN and bilateral agencies. After more than ten years of operation and innovative contribution to local development, PADETC is increasingly given more political and social recognition as a local development agency. Basedon its experience the vision and mission of PADETC is to promote the concept of #liveable# communities which balances economic growth with social and cultural vibrancy, environmental harmony, and spiritual development for all.
PADETC has long operatedasalaboratory both for development thinking, and for the applied-use of locally appropriate approaches. This has included not only Learning Centre and network development, but the articulation of a conceptual framework for development.  In 2009, PADETCbeganthe process of supporting each Learning Centre and Network to become independent, paving the way for eventual registration as individual NPAs.

In July 2012, the founder and long term Director of PADETC Mr. Sombath has handed over the function toMr.Khamphoui Saythalat. The last year, PADETC has focussed much of its energy and resources and the internal transformation of its organisation as well as the AEPF process. Consequently, most of the activities now take place in and around Vientiane, although contacts with youth groups in other provinces still exist.

Also for the coming programme period the institutional transition process will demand a substantial investment in time and resources from PADETC. In order to support the new director in the processa group of &#x93;Friends of PADETC&#x94; has been formed with international and national members and that provides coaching and technical advice to PADETC.


PADETC will focus on four fields of action. These are:
1. Education for Sustainable Development (ESD)
2. Enabling Environment Support for Lao CSOs (with a particular focus on Organizational Development and Management, and Small Grant Facility)
3. Policy Advocacy (mainly with reference tothe recommendations made from the Impact Assessment report in March2012)
4. Resource mobilization including the marketing and delivery of services for the general public, NPAs and iNGOs.</narrative>
