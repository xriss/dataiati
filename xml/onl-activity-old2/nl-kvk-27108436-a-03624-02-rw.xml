  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project focus will be on creating systemic changes within the dairy value chain development geared towards increased support for smallholder farmers. The intervention will take place within six districts across Rwanda i.e Rulindo, Bugesera, Nyanza,Kayonza, Rwamagana, and Kicukiro.

Overall, the project will support two new groups with 80 HHs (560 people) in the north and east of Rwanda i.e. Rulindo district in the North, and Bugesera district in the East. This is in addition to supporting 600 HHs(4200 people) in 15 already existing groups in 6 districts.

Main Aim/Objectives
To promote participation and integration of small-holder farmers# throughout the dairy value chain for increased food security, enhanced income, equity and sustainable livelihoods by complementing on the governments impetus of;

- Poverty reduction via sustainable agricultural production as a key pillar for social and economic growth.
- Stimulating development of modern livestock/dairy industry through value addition and access to markets.
- Putting in place supportive infrastructures and strengthening services that contributes to sustainable and profitable development of the livestock/dairy sub-sector.

Outcome 1: Increased Income and Employment creation:
By end March 2015, 680 HHs (4760 people of which 75% will be women i.e. 3570 and 25% men i.e.1190) will be able to acquire additional income and employment opportunities through their enhanced participation within the entire dairy value chain by March 2015.

Outcome 2:  Food security and nutrition:
By end of March 2015, 680 HHs will be food secure and their nutrition enhanced. Food security will be evidenced throughout the year and with special focus on seasonal nutritional and food shortages.

Outcome 3: Environmental sustainability:
By March 2015, 75% of 680 HHs i.e. 510 HHs will have implemented practices that promote environmental protection to reduce on disaster risks.

Outcome 4: Lobby and Advocacy:
By March 2015, local level advocacy and lobbyinginitiatives will be enhanced in order to create systemic changes within the dairy value chain development geared toward increased support for smallholder farmers and there-by enable more farmers to transit from subsistence farming to participation in themarket oriented economy

At the centre of SACRs intervention strategies, gender and associated gender related inequalities will be considered in the following ways,
1) By incorporating cross-organisational emphasis on gender equality across the entireprogramme activities as well as policy that impacts upon staff, partners and primary stakeholders;
2) By conducting gender specific activities or training where necessary
3) At all times using a gender lenses to programming (problem analysis, planning,implementation and execution, monitoring and evaluation/reviews.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">SEND A COW RWANDA</narrative>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Send a Cow (SAC) was founded in 1988 by a group of British farmers in response to calls for help and livestock from Uganda. The cows provided subsistence farmers with swift remedy to malnutrition whilst the manure enabled them to enrich depleted lands (soils) leading to increased food productivity. Training in livestock husbandry, capacity building, extension, and follow-up support ensured communities were equipped with long lasting skills.

In line with its growth and expansion strategy, Send a Cow Rwanda (SACR) was bornin 2002 and has continued to grow; adapting its programmes to address the needs of vulnerable farmers and their families. Its development initiatives complement government planning and development priorities, supports policy development and implementation processes. In general, SACR work fit well into broader government of Rwanda#s economic, social development and poverty reduction strategy. SACR, building on its years of experience and successes has been able to influence policy and practices at both national and local governance levels.

Mission of SACR: To reduce poverty and malnutrition in Rwanda

Institutional objectives: SACR, intentions are,
1.To ensure active and strong community groups capable of managing their development projects.
2. To improve food security and increased household incomes.
3. To promote climate-smart agriculture, environmental management, and natural resource conservation.
4. To ensure equal sharing of resources among household members and ensure positive gender relations.
5. To support smallholder farmers# agricultural commercialization and diversification for sustained income generation.
6. To build a coherent and strong organization (SACR) positioned to support community development in Rwanda.

Field(s) of activity: SACR approach is holistic and integrated and includes;
a) Gender and Social development: This encompasses promotion of gender equity and equality, group solidarity, behaviour change and development communication. The benefiting farmers are, women and men and their families, surrounding communities, local leadership, NGOs.

b) Sustainable Agriculture, entailing soil and water conservation, natural resources management and promotion of climate-smart agric practices and kitchen gardens. Benefiting farmers include mainly women and men, their families, surrounding communities,local leadership, government agri-vet workers, NGOs.

c) Integrated Animal Management: Mainly animal health, feed and nutrition, extension services and artificial insemination (AI), dairy value chain and animal product marketing. Benefiting farmers include women and men, their families, surrounding communities, local leadership, government agri-vet workers, private veterinarians and pharmacists, NGOs.

d) Value addition and Marketing: Once having established themselves as food secure households with enhanced productivity,farmers are supported with value addition and marketing training in order to begin generating reliable income. These benefit farmers; women and men, their families, surrounding communities, local leadership, local and national consumers, NGOs.

e) Cross-cutting themes: Examples include disability and HIV/AIDS and allows SACR programmes to be tailored to the needs of those often excluded from development, benefiting the most vulnerable in the communities where we work. Other cross-cutting issues include disaster risk management and environmental sustainability, agricultural training preserves soil and protects the environment and farmers develop strategies to minimise risks associated with climate change and the environment.

Geographic Coverage
Rwanda consists of 30 districts. SACR works within 8 districts chosen because of high poverty prevalence, minimum land availability, avoidance of duplication with similar NGOs and the need to have long lasting impacts. The eight districts are: Rulindo, Gasabo, Kicukiro, Bugesera, Rwamagana, Nyanza, Kayonza and Kirehe.

SACR works closely with government at national and local (district/sector) level, in particular with the Ministry of Agriculture and Animal Resources (MINAGRI) and Ministry of Gender and Family Promotion (MIGEPROF). MINAGRI is also responsiblefor the promotion and use of E-SOKO the mobile phone technology used for this project,.

SACR works to complement, and in collaboration with other NGOs filling gaps in service provision both thematically and geographically. Collaboration with other NGOs allows for synergy building, advocacy and shared learning and dissemination of technologies.

Other significant social actors include cooperatives, businesses, traders and distributors. Businesses and informal traders provide outlets for collection of produce, sale of produce and business financing, amongst other services. Farmers will tap into and strengthen links with these organisations and learn from their experience as they establish themselves as formal cooperatives.

SACR#s relationship with Oxfam Novib
Oxfam Novib and Send a Cow Rwanda (SACR) have not yet jointly implemented a project together. Meetings were held between Oxfam Novib and SACR in late 2012 to discuss opportunities for working in Rwanda. The connection was established due to Oxfam Novib#s past work with Send a Cow Uganda (SACU). Oxfam Novib and Send a Cow Uganda (SACU) have been working in collaboration since December 2010.</narrative>
