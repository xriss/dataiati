   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Culture and Free Thought Association is a community-based organization that was established in 1991 by opening a Al Shruq WalAmal Center for children between the ages of 6 to 12. By 1995, CFTA was running 4 centres: Shruq Wal Amal Center, Bunat Il Ghad for teenagers, the Women Health Center and the Gaza Womens Loan Fund. The team expanded from 13 staff to 25 employees. CFTA came as a response to the socio-political situation in 1991 and especially its effect on women and children where many suffered from psychologicaleffects of the violence.  The programs initiated at the time aimed at providing secure places for children where they could get social and psychological support as well as enjoy recreational activities. CFTAs program was the first of its kind in the Gaza Strip and still is unique especially with the quality of services provided to the target groups. Although CFTA runs 8 different programs anda network for 40 CBOs from the south of Gaza,  Oxfam Novib supports the Bunat Il Ghad Center.  The target group of Bunat Il Ghad Center are teenage girls and boys from Khan Younis Governorate where 90% are refugees and 10 percent are non refugees. These teenagersare significantly marginalized and there is little attention here from the donor world. To respond to this situation, CFTA will undertake following interventions:
- Through cultural and community activities (such as photography, art and handicraft, exhibitions, making an animation film,etc.), 1200 teenagers including equal number of girlsand boys will develop their skills to become independent, free thinking, creative and empowered young men and women. More young girls engage positively with the social problems and take aleading role within their community. To achieve this, CFTA also includes the parents of these girls creating a supportive environment both inside and outside their homes. Parents are invited to visit the center, attend the activities and also volunteer if needed.
- 600 teenagers  will improve educational achievements inEnglish, Arabic, Geography, Science and IT and develop critical consciousness to articulate their ideas, feelings and thoughts by attending innovative and creative education programs provided at the Bunad il Ghad centre. This intervention seeks to fill the gaps in the quality of education that has stagnated over the years as a result ofcontinuing blockade of Gaza.
- 120 disadvantaged teenagers   are better able to function in their society after receiving psychosocial support  through using expressiveart techniques including role play, theatre and painting.
- CFTA will continue to run its Social media and blogging workshops.  Teenagers will be develop their social media tools to attract more audiences and readers especiallytheir peers, teachers andparents. blogging, photography, youtube channel, student online campaigns, message writing and informationsharing will be part of the work.
The blogs might be administrated by more than one teenager and work will be divided, some will present multimedia films and photographs and others will be writing and commenting.
-Radio broadcast will be one of the main themes which will be encouraged,. The center has a small recording studio and soon might launch a local radio online to allow young people particularly girls to present their views and news to the community.
- Animation film production will be part of the social media and will be produced by the teenagers themselves. The film will be the second experimental film to be produced and will be a campaigningtool that presents an issue that the teenagers want to express to the public. It will be uploaded to the blogs and comments will beinteractive.
-Sport activities which will include tennis, basketballs, footballs, swimming, horse ridding, marathonsandvolley ball.Teenager girls will be encouraged to play sports and be active in the fitness rooms which is now available at the center. The center will organize tournaments with the local community teams and will open its doors for practice after the working hours of the center. Girls are not expected to participate in all sport activities because of social constrains, therefore, there will be a female volunteer from the community who will come three days a week to encourage them and train them especiallywhen physical activities for this age is very important. Without these specific provisions, families may not allow girls to participate in sports activities.</narrative>
