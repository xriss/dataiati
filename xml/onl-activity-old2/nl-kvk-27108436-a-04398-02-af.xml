  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In order to bring about positive sustainable changes in the lives of people and their organisations, Oxfam Afghanistan will continue with capacity building interventions for its own staff, partner organizations, and other civil society/grassroots organizations (working within our geographical programme area). This is consistent with Oxfam Afghanistan#s strategic plan and Oxfam Global-CapacityBuilding Policy emphasising our continued commitment to work with and through partnerships. Oxfam has developed aconcept for a period of one year in order to roll out its capacity building mandate.

Oxfam pursues its vision through multiple sets of action agenda.Firstly, direct partnership with LNGOs and vulnerable communities for facilitating their local initiatives. Secondly, contribute towards reducing poverty and social disparities, ensuring basic services, and institution building through increasing participation inlocal governance and protecting environment. Another action agenda is to influence policy processes by promoting articulation of the perspectives of the poor and disadvantaged. This may be achieved by facilitating alliance/networks among various civil society actors.
Supporting and nurturing these agenda, Oxfam#s Programme along with relevant support functions will carry forward Oxfam#s agenda for capacity building with a view to promote self-identity, self-reliance and self-growth of marginalized communities. Oxfam seeksto strengthen and widen the process of learning across a variety of relevant themes and contexts of different stakeholders in social development at different levels. It will mainly focus on the processes of transfer and exchange of knowledge and experiences, as well as the provision of technical expertise.

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">ECW as a non-governmental, non-political, and non for profit humanitarian organization came into
being when Taliban were ruling thecountry, where an atmosphere of degradation, choking, and
depression were forced to the residents of Afghanistan. The worst hit of the situation were women
and girls where even their movement was adversely limited along with deprivation form all the basic
human rights. To contribute in the reduction of the misery of the girls and women a group of the
committed and devoted Afghan women took the initiative of establishing Empowerment Center for Afghan Women of Afghanistan (ECW) in October 1997,ECW was established with the aim of providing a resource to Afghan women and girls to help them
to be empowered, economically independent, and socially active. ECW since its establishment
continuously expanded its services to different parts of the country, and currently is providing
services in Kabul, Kunduz, Baghlan, Takhar, Badakhshan and Parwan provinces. ECW, as a learning
organization, since its establishment continuously developed and upgraded its operational and
management capacity to enable the organization to move towards realization of its vision and
mission.</narrative>
