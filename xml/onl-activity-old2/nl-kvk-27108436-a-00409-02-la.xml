   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Gender Development Association</narrative>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Gender Development Group (GDG) is a transformed version of the earlier Women in Development (WID) network that was formed at the end of 1991.  It is an organisation that works towards more gender equity and empowerment. Since indigenous NGOs are not (yet) allowed by the Lao government, GDG operates under the umbrella of an international NGO (currently Concern Worldwide). Presently GDG operates as a network of 21 member organisations that mainly at the grassroots levels within the country for improving the life of rural people.
While some of the member organisations may have gender components in their projects, this is not the case for all member organisations. GDG organises and facilitates gender related workshops, geared towards the project needs of the member organisations. In addition, GDG also introduces newly emerging issues such as Violence against Women.
In the Lao context there are no NGOs that focus on gender related issues specifically. However, at the national level the Lao Women&apos;s Unionhas a long history of working on &apos;women related&apos; themes and issues, and it has recently been joined by the LaoNCAW.
GDG works closely with the Lao Women&apos;s Union and the LaoNCAW, yet its focus is distinctively different. The Lao Women&apos;s Union and the LaoNCAW are closely connected to the Lao government and their activities mainly focus on high level policy. Instead GDG is closely connected to the grassroots level of development practice, through its partners, and thus focuses directly on the everyday gender relations that shape life in Laos.
In addition, GDG also actively participates in CEDAW activities. One staff member participates in the UNIFEM based resource pool for CEDAW. This resource pool organises regular meetings and training on CEDAW. GDG takes responsibility to disseminate CEDAW information to its member organisations. For this purpose a first workshop was organised in May 2007. In this, CEDAW was explained and a process was started to draw up a joint CEDAW action plan in order to translate CEDAW to the grassroots level development initiatives of the partner organisations. Since UNIFEM and LaoNCAW are currently working on a CEDAW manual for Laos, further development of a CEDAW action plan for GDGmembers is postponed.
In Laos GDG&apos;s positionas a gender focal point is well recognised by international actors. The World Bank for example has invited GDG to regional meetings in 2003 (Siem Reap, Cambodia) and 2005 (Bangkok, Thailand) in order to present the state of affairs of NGO activities withgender in Laos. Similarly, the Asia Development Bank sought GDG&apos;s input and invites GDG to its research workshops. Relations with other international actors, such as UNFPA, are based mutual collaboration in which relevant information is shared.
GDG is currently involved in two regional networks. GDG participates in the Thai based NGO network &apos;Border Esan Action Network&apos;. This network connects Thai, Lao and Cambodian NGOs and governmental partners on cross-border issues such as HIV and AIDS, migration and trafficking, and reproductive health of migrant workers. Within this regional network GDG acts as a Lao focal point, acting as an information bridge between the Border Esan Action Network and GDG&apos;s Laos-based member organisations. GDG has recentlyalso become involved in a regional working group on migration and trafficking. This working group has emerged out of the IWRAW AsiaPacific workshop of last September in Jakarta, Indonesia, entitled National Women&apos;s Human Right Implementation Strategies. The working group consists of member organisations from Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia. The organisations are involved in the CEDAW process and have identified migration and trafficking as a theme which needs inter-country analysis and activities, especially with regard to the improvement of the rights of migrants.</narrative>
