   <narrative xml:lang="EN">SILAKA NGOs</narrative>
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">SILAKA was incorporated as a non-political, non-sectarian local Cambodian NGO in January 1997 registered with the Ministry of Interior. SILAKA works to identify and provide quality programs and training opportunities for individuals and organizations. Asa leadingcapacity building organization, SILAKA#s offers unsurpassed service and delivery of high quality training and consultant services. SILAKA has the development goal to promote the implementation of democracy in Cambodian society for sustainable development which includes the economic development, including caring for the environment, and social justice.

The Committee to Promote Women in Politics (CPWP) was established in 2005, intended to promote women leaders in public office. The committee ismade of seven local non-government organisations: SILAKA, Gender and Development for Cambodia (GAD/C), Committee for Free and Fair Elections in Cambodia (COMFREL), Neutral and Impartial Committee for Free and Fair Elections in Cambodia (NICFEC), Women forProsperity (WFP), Cambodian Women for Peace and Development (CWPD), and Cambodia Development Research Institute (CDRI).
The Coalition for the Promotion of Women in Politics (CPWP) formed in relation to Cambodia#s national and local elections in 2007. The coalition was structured under the guidance of international leadership as embodied in the Millennium Developmental Goals. CPWP consists of a colourful mixture of non-government organisations that represent such diverse programs as capacity-building, gender-based initiatives, and research. The timing of the coalition combined with targeted multilateral institutional support in the form of both financial and human resources allocated to theoverall effort to galvanise local excitement and opportunity forchange that resulted in the active and genuine participation of thetwo major project beneficiaries, which are government and the community.
Cambodia#s socio-political development over the past two centuries has been wrapped under colonialism and communism, and only recently and in theory has democracy been adopted. What makes CPWP unique to Cambodia is that itis a local nascent coalition based on a participatory and democratic model for action.
Just as unique, CPWP is a movement targeting and lead primarily by a traditionally marginalised group, which are women. In some respects, the CPWP movement can be interpreted as a positive indicator and product of the recent democratic and decentralisation efforts advocated bythe international community and implemented by the Cambodian government.
CPWP aims to contribute to the creation of a positive and &apos;empowering&apos;environment for women#s participation in public office. CPWP interventions target local, provincial and national administrators and political party leaders, potential female candidates and voters as well as the general public. CPWP contributes to the mobilisation of women#s support networks. CPWP envisions a Cambodian society in which women and men enjoy equal access to opportunityand benefits from society.
CPWP#s mission statement commits its members to promoting women and men#s equal participation indecision-making and representation in public office; collaborating with each other in developing and implementing joint activities to further theadvancement of women in Cambodian society.</narrative>
