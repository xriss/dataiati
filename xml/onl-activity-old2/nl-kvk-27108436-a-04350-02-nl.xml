   <narrative xml:lang="EN">E-motive Re-evolution Game</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In this call our purpose is to successfully develop an overall foster incubation process applicable for e-motive and the Warriors movement worldwide, which includes online infrastructure, a support and incubation coaching process, an (closing) incubation support event and a (on- and offline) process of mobilizing (financial) partners for the support of these projects. Our larger mission
is todevelop this incubating service, by strengthening networks, using full potential for mutual support, knowing that in groups we are better able to find innovative solutions and creating international multilateral projects, to realize bigger projects and higher impact.

This call is offered by a partnership between e-motive partners Elos Nederland, Instituto Elos Brazil and Altekio (Spain) and has a more global reach by supporting partners of the Elos network in Southern Africa, Caribbean and India.

The &#x91;E-motive re-evolution game&#x92; focuses on piloting a foster incubating service within our existing and growing worldwide network of warriors, e-motive members and partners, to become a foster incubation tool as one of the four intended e-motive services. The proposed &#x91;E-motive re-evolution game&#x92; blends the experience of the partners with e-motive network, with the application of our connecting methodology (the Elos philosophy) and its application in incubating projects and collaborations.

As with e-motive, warriors or communities that have gone through an intervention bringing together people from different places, the central question after such an initial start is &#x91;how can this be sustained&#x92; or better said &#x91;how can we re-evolute this experience into a bigger dream and impact, more complex and long lasting project/partnership/ change&#x92;.

We will offer these participants to enter in the incubation process: The needs of players for the re-evolution game are:
- Turning an initial project into a bigger, more impacting and longer term project
- Turning an initial project into a sustainable business or organization
- Turning an initial collaboration into a structural one
- Building a proposal that is clear and attractive based on a shared vision
- Space to develop, to exchange questions, references and learnings
- Coaching and specific specialized support
- Building a network of supporters
- Building and finding partnerships for financial and non-financial support (knowledge, materials)
- Helping with the promotion of projects and processes (sometime is difficult to promote if there is no previous experience in the territory)
- Getting inspired by new ideas or new projects

In general to achieve sustainability orfor the realization of projects we look for answers in financial resources, yet we&#x92;ve seen that that&#x92;s not the only resources that need or can be tapped in order to come to a successful impulse of bigger and more sustainable dreams and partnerships. A strong supporting network, inspiring projects and experiences, the right knowledge and the right partnerships, will give you these financial resources and a lot more. To work on participants needs the foster incubation tool has different activities:
- An online platform/workspace for presenting projects, sharing experiences, tools, and support between members.
- Online coaching (as groups and individuals), mentoring and specialists&#x92; contributions
- Collective process (with platform members) to decide which partners to invite and involve.
- A closing collaborative offline event for participants to present their project achievements to the platform members and partners.d

With this process and combination of qualities of participating partners we know we will pilot a tool that will be effective, powerfull, truly global and with a good mix of online and offline, maximizing the internal power of the groups qualities and abundance. We will create a case with highly mutual benefit for e-motive and ourselves, expanding the network and visibility of e-motive in the world.

Lastly while developing this project we realized that we are offering a mix and the best of foster incubation and matchmaking. We believe to a certain extend we hit several birds with one stone.</narrative>
