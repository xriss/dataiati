In principal, the program will aim for the following goals: a) improving organizational capacity and economic independence of artisanal fishers; b) stimulate and initiate policy reform and c) to strengthen the capacity of the network and the network members to stimulate and enlarge public support on fishery justice in Indonesia.

Closely related to the advocacy work and policy reform effort of the network, KIARA has seen a growing government emphasis to encourage industrialisation of the fisheries sector, both in capture fisheries and aquaculture. This is in line with the findings of the evaluation, that stated, &#x93;Overtime, KIARA has seen that marine and fisheries affairs are not mere domestic issues, but have escalated and cannot be isolated from the global fish market dynamics&#x94;.  In this line, the network strives for the rights and concerns of small scale fishers and small scale fish farmers to be well represented in national policy and laws. These state instruments should protect the interest of these vulnerable groups to be able to sustain their livelihood, to secure domestic fish supplies as well as to be empowered and may take part and benefit from the market opportunities, i.e. through fishers cooperatives and producer groups.

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Koalisi Ikan untuk Rakyat (KIARA), a network organization which was established in 2003 by fisherfolk groups, non-governmental organizations, and individuals who work and put their concerns on fisherfolk and coastal community. Since January 2009, based on the 3rdKIARA&#x92;s General Assembly in Ambon, North Maluku Province, acronym of KIARA has been changed with &#x93;Koalisi Rakyat untuk Keadilan Perikanan&#x94;. Initially, it focused on reviewing the relation and inter-relation impacts of international trade policies toward fisherfolk and coastal community. The organization found its moment when OGB (OXFAM Great Britain) was sponsoring a workshop on Coastal Resources and Fisheries Management. It was attendded and supported by KIKIS (Jakarta), Bina Desa (Jakarta), Eksekutif Nasional WALHI (Jakarta), JALA (Medan, Sumatera Utara), Kelola (Manado, Sulawesi Utara), JKPKP (Buton, Sulawesi Tenggra), Nen Mas Il (Maluku), Yayasan Karya Kasih (Sumba Barat, NTB), Layar Pantura (Semarang, Jawa Tengah), Yayasan Silfagama (Yogyakarta), FSNN (Jakarta), Konphalindo (Jakarta), Telapak (Bogor), APKP (Jakarta).

 The network works towards a vision that artisanal fishers&#x97;men and women&#x97;should have sovereignity to manage aquatic resources in order to enable them to play a more significant role in ensuring more just trade of fisheries products and sustainability of their livelihood. In achieving the above vision, the organization defined its mission as follows:

- To be information center for members and public on fisheries policies.
- To develop and/or support network on policy change towards more just trade for the benefit of small scale/traditional fishers.
- To become part of social movement in eliminating injustice practices international trade in fisheries sector.

 KIARA sought to occupy a specific niche on &#x93;fisheries trade&#x94; related advocacy, because at that time there was an active network in Indonesia on CB-CRM. Unfortunately that network is no longer active.

I n the first years of its existence KIARA received support by OGB and created a secretariat and appointed a general secretary in the person of Nina Dwisasanti. KIARA became in this period an active member of the regional network SEAFISH for Justice. It also managed to organize a number of events, workshops and campaigns. To mention some:
a. Facilitated and Participated in Asia Pacific Female Fishers Meeting in Medan 2004 (Joint Committee of SPPNSU-KIARA-SP)
b. Conducted One-day Seminar about NAMA Agenda in Serdang Begadai (200 people) before Hong Kong MC.
c. Conducted National Conference of Artisanal Fishers in Jakarta, September 2005.
d. Conducted Regional Conference of Artisanal Fishers in Jakarta, September 2005 (back to back with the national conference).
e. Participated in Hong Kong WTO MC, December 2005 and petition offered to WTO.
f. Participated in NAMA discussion, Pre Hong Kong MC, December 2005.
g. Involvementin Make Trade Fair campaign in Indonesia.
h. Signatures collection for Make Trade Fair by KIARA network (Bina Desa, Kelola, and JPKP Buton).
i. Discussion with local fisherfolk about fisheries globalisation issue in Cisolok, February 2006
j. Discussion with localfisherfolk about NAMA in Kamal Muara, April 2006.
k. Linked up with discussions on Public Private Partnership Indonesia- Netherlands on aquaculture

To date, Oxfam Novib has entered a total of two direct partnerships with KIARA, the first collaboration was for the period of September 1, 2008 to March 31, 2009 with a total amount of IDR 354,400,000,-(&#x80;  27,261,-  at exchange rate of 1&#x80; = 13,000,- IDR), and the one which just recently being finalized was a two-year program from April  1, 2009 &#x96; March 31, 2011 with contribution of Rp 2,312,550,000 (&#x80; 158,394,- at exchange rate of 1 &#x80;= 14600 IDR, date: May 2009).

In addition, KIARA has been collaboratingclosely and has become a key partner of the Oxfam International Economic Justice Campaign in Indonesia implemented by Alliance for the Village Prosperity (or Desa Sejahtera). In this alliance, KIARA was responsible to contribute on the aquaculture and fisheries aspects of the campaign strategies and managed a total of IDR 352 million for the period of April 10, 2009 to March 31, 2010.
At regional (Southeast Asia) level, the network joined a regional fisheries network based inthe Philippines, Seafish for Justice, and contributed the experience around the advocacy efforts in Indonesia to achieve leverage at regional level for the benefit of small scale fisherfolks. KIARA took part in two activities, in the period of January- December 2008 (EUR 7,133) and January- December 2009 (EUR 22,180).

KIARA has proven to be a determined and effective partner, within only a couple of years and with a lean staff resources, the advocacy work of the network has attracted much attention from the members, academics, mass media and most importantly has promoted policy changes through its advocacy work to the Ministry of Marine and Fisheries Affairs and the House of Representatives. As quoted from the Evaluation Report of KIARA 2009-2010, &#x93;KIARA&#x92;s campaigns have focused on cost and labour effective activities however with large impact to policy change&#x94;. One of the big-wins is the Court decision that states some articles stipulating the coastal waters management permit (HP3) provision of Law 27/2007 is against Indonesia&#x92;s Constitution. Hereby KIARA has completely satisfied the mandate of the National Assembly (highest decision making of the network) to propose elimination of the respective controversial articles.

KIARA has successfully implemented its program 2009-2011 as planned, as summarized by the Evaluation Report KIARA 2011:

&#x95; KIARA has satisfied the mandate of the National Meeting, proposing elimination of some controversial articles from Law No. 27 of 2007on Coastal Areas and Small Islands Management.
&#x95; KIARA has also fulfilled the mandate of the National Meeting to foster revision ofLaw No. 31 of 2004 on Fisheries.
&#x95; KIARA&#x92;s suggested that the Minister of Marine and Fishery should follow up its suggestion about the use of theTPI&#x92;s levy. KIARA asked the Ministry to ensure that the levy was to be used to support fisherfolks in hard times (no or small quantity of catches) and to secure sea accident insurance as was stipulated in regional government regulations on TPI.  KIARA&#x92;sadvocacy of the use of the levy was undertaken by the member in Semarang (Layar Nusantara) and in Bau-bau City (JPKP).
&#x95; At regional level, KIARA has supported its regional members, such as Layar Nusantara and JPKP to advocate for regional government regulations on Fisheries Auction Places (TPI).
&#x95; KIARA and partners launched media campaigns against oil dumping by an Australian ship entering Timor waters. According to Dr. Alan Koropitan, the opinion article and the letter sent to the President seemed to be successful inencouraging the government to take stricter measures.
&#x95; In response to the 2009 World Ocean Conference in North Sulawesi, KIARA succeeded in turning the forum into the one promoting integrated coastal and marine advocacy and mobilizingsolid cooperation with othercivil society&#x92;s organizations.
&#x95; KIARA disclosed information on five fisherfolks from North Sumatra having been imprisoned in Malaysia. In the end, the government asked KIARA to go with the government&#x92;s team to help releasing the fisherfolks.
&#x95; KIARA provided assistance for smallholder shrimp farmers at Dipasena (a large shrimp company) in Lampung. KIARA assisted the farmers to talk to the related officials, among other the Ministry of Marine and Fishery and the multisectoral team specifically formed to settle the disputes between the farmers and the company, which erupted from 2001. In defending the farmers, KIARA was actively launching media campaigns.</narrative>
