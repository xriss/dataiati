   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Oxfam Novib Post-Conflict Reconstruction Program seeks to address causes of conflicts and provides &apos;peace dividends&apos; through improved economic development and human security in three conflict-affected regions/country. These are respectively Afghanistan and Pakistan; Democratic Republic of Congo, Burundi and Rwanda; and South Sudan.

This program, funded by the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs from the Post-Conflict Reconstruction Tender, began in 2013. The South Sudan program ends in 2015, the other two programs end in 2016.

The Afghanistan-Pakistan program is called Cit
izens First: Improving Human Security in Pakistan and Afghanistan. The purpose of the program is to contribute to human security and good governance by strengthening the socialcontract. This is done by empowering civilians and civil society to hold the (local) government accountable for law and order and the provision of basic services on the one hand, and by strengthening the ability of the (local) government to understand and respond to causes of (local) conflict on the other.

The Great Lakes region program is called Beyond Borders: a Roadmap to Peace for the Great Lakes Region. The objective of the programme is to address the causes and consequences of conflict by implementing a Regional Roadmap to Peace in the Great Lakes region. This is done by: 1) creating a common understanding of the causes and consequences of conflict among government, civil society and community representatives by conducting participatory actionresearch; 2) building a network of peace brokers to mobilize support for a Regional Roadmap to Peace; 3) addressing urgent livelihoods needs that contribute to creating a peace dividend; 4) establishing a conducive environment and sustainable mechanisms for inclusive dialogue and conflict transformation; 5) developing, adopting and implementing a regional roadmap to peace with strong commitment of involved communities and other stakeholders; and 6) ensuring that women and youth in the region have confidence and skills to participate in the peace process.

The South Sudan Peace and Prosperity Promotion Program seeks to contribute to establishing public safety and security in communities in Malakal, Juba, Terekeka, Gogrial East and Gogrial West counties byaddressing local roots of conflict, strengthening conflict transformation capacities while improving food security and income of vulnerable men and women and building government and civil society capacities.

Cross-program learning and sharing of experiences is a priority, therefore annual learning events are held.</narrative>
