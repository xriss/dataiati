   <narrative xml:lang="EN">SAP-PK started its struggle with the capacity building of small local civil society organizations and, in a very short time, raiseda crop of effective individuals and organizations across Pakistan. That initiative became well known in Pakistan and SouthAsia as Resource Development Program (RDP). That program was year long, aiming to develop capacities of the community based organizations in community needs assessment, project planning, implementation, monitoring, evaluation, reporting, resource mobilization, financial management, gender, etc. SAP-PK conducted RDP for fourteen years, from 1991 to 2004. Its cycle catered to the needs of the developmentworkers from clarity about terms such as #development# to the field application of their experiences.
In 2004, SAP-PK underwent a strategic review. As the result of that extensive exercise, SAP-PK undergone with major changes and opted for working with peasants, workers, women, religious minorities and political workers, directly in its mission to contribute in a grass roots movement of the marginalized people for their empowerment and policy advocacy.
Integration of gender perspective has been a core value of SAP-Pakistan (SAP-PK) that cuts across the organization#s entire structures and programs in terms of a theme itself. Apart from the fact that gender is mainstreamed in SAP-PK, we also have an independent desk for policy guidance and review of gender aspects in all of our projects, managements and reporting.</narrative>
