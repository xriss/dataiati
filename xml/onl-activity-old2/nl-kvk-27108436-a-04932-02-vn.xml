   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In Vietnam, Agribusiness is one of the main generators of employment and income which would improve benefit and living conditions for small scale farmers. At the same time, it could bring negative impacts and inequalities to the small scale farmers and vulnerablepeople groups whose livelihoods and life depends on the agriculture by irresponsible and unsustainable investment of private sector. Moreover, Vietnamese agribusiness companies is facing much challenges including lack of access of market, lack of access to finance, less understanding and interpretation of market requirements and regulatory framework for agribusiness investment, lack of motivations on inclusive business. These challenges limit both private and public investment flows in agribusiness as well as result ineffective investments which don#t reflect concisely current inequalities and unbenefited by small scale farmers. In addition, the transformation of the donors# development strategies for agriculture also makes a change to the agribusiness investment. The traditional donors are more emphasizing on private sector engagement programs where private sector play an important role for not only bring positive impacts to the marginalized people but also reducing negative impacts to their life. Then the donors are initiating new impactinvestment for private sector development as a key strategy contributing to the country economic development sustainably.
With the vision that all forms of poverty, injustice and inequality are tackled by enabling women, small scale farmers, marginalized and discriminated groups to voice their own agenda and exercise their rights; distribution of the benefits and costs, opportunities and risks, of growth are equitably shared and where vulnerable groups are nolonger excluded, Oxfam in Vietnam will seek transformational change through confronting and acting on the root causes of exclusion, poverty, vulnerability, inequality and injustice by enhancing collective voice of small scale farmers, marginalized people, women and ethnic minorities as well as civil society organization to claim their rights. Oxfam has been working in agriculture sector in Vietnam for years to deliver effective livelihoods and pro-poor market development. Meanwhile, Oxfam in Vietnam has engaged private sector in value chain development programs through facilitating thepractices and compliance of corporate social responsibility and international responsible standards which help increase inclusive business investment.
