   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Inspired by Omar Asghar Khan, prominent social entrepreneur and rights activist, a group of activists established the organization in July 1999. It was formally registered in April 2000 under the Societies Act 1860. For the first two years since its registration,the organization functioned as a community-based human rights group, and its geographical outreach was in and around the Hattar area of District Haripur in Khyber pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan.

In June 2002, the organization revised its strategy to focus on pro-poor policy and democratic reform. A new board was also constituted. From this point forward, the organization evolved from a community-based group to a national-level advocacy institution. Beginning in District Haripur, its effortsextended to District Abbottabad, and after the October 2005 earthquake also reached Battagram and Mansehra, and then gradually to other parts of KPK. The expansion in its geographical outreach entailed extended citizen coalition-building. Around the sametime, the Foundation also intensified its work on public budgets with a special focus on off-budget funds and government policies on post-earthquake rehabilitation. In 2007, the Foundation included mainstream budgets in its work with a focus on funds forhealth. At the same time, it joined the movement for the rule of law led by Pakistan#s lawyers and remained its active part till the restoration of judges in 2009.

In 2009, the organization responded to the tragic displacement following the armed conflict in north western Pakistan which also led to its supporting the creation of a national citizen coalition, Aman Ittehad (United for Peace) that is striving for long-term peace and stability in Pakistan. It is largely due to its efforts under Aman Ittehad that the organization has emerged as a national-level advocacy institution with partners in every district of the country. Omar Asghar Khan Development Foundation has a staff of 52 and offices in Islamabad and Abbottabad.</narrative>
