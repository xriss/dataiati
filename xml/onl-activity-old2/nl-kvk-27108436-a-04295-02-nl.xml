  <description type="1">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In this new episode of the Peace of Minds Academy thirty Dutch youngsters investigate ways in which their lives are connected to those of girls and women in fragile and (post) conflict, and they experience how they can make a contribution from the Netherlands to lasting peace and gender justice. They do this by examining, on the basis of several problem statements, which Dutch actors and processes affect the lives of these girls and women, and especially how these impede their participation in peace processes. Participants subsequently develop strategies aimed at these actors - such as Dutch citizens, companies or the government - their influence to have to turn to contribute to sustainable peace and gender justice. In a varied program we bring the participants in touch with peaceactivists from around the world, and offer them the tools to improve their communication, strategic and research skills, and organize expert meetings including professionals, community organizations, businesses, policy makers, trendsetters and artists.

Between 2011 and 2013 the Peace of Minds Academy was carried out three times including once with the support of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs through SBOS and twice with support from Oxfam Novib. Previous evaluations show that the &apos;learning by doing&apos; method and the connection between theory and practice is experienced by participants and other stakeholders as innovative and instructive. We also see that this leads to a very concrete expression of global citizenship and continued involvement of young people with the theme. Peace of Minds recent editions have also shown that there is a significant group of young people in the Netherlands with an interest in thetopic of women, peace and security who are looking for ways to take action on this topic.

This year, Upact works from the beginning to the end together with two parties with relevant complementary expertise: WO=MEN and Butterfly Works. This close collaboration will allow us to improve the quality of the previous episodes, when we were dependent to a great extent on the goodwill and expertiseof many different people and the consistency was sometimes difficult to guarantee. With the successes and lessons learned in mind, we have chosen this year for a different angle and shifted the focus of the program of action &quot;in the Global South&quot; to the actions of actors here in the Netherlands.

The core group of thirty participants consists of a mix of young people between 18 and 28 years with different types of expertise, experience and educational backgrounds ranging from art and culture and technical studies to anthropology or conflict studies. The project thus reaches a group of students and their dependents that normally don&apos;t have a natural interest in or commitment to understanding the impact of development and conflict in other parts of the world, especially on women andgirls. They usually have a lack of understanding of how actors in the Netherlands both government and business, NGOs and consumers are also responsible for the underlying structural causes of conflict and social, economic and political inequality in the world. And that is exactly where the Peace of Minds Academy about. Participants will engage in doing their own research and unravel what typeand level of impact particular Dutch actors may have on (female) activists for gender justice and where relevant expose the underlying political, social and / or economic connections that often may worsen confllict and violence. They delve into the different kinds of perspectives that we have in the Netherlands to contribute to sustainable peace and gender justice strategies and examine what works well and why. They get inspiration and insights into the workings of campaigning or lobbying from various parties, such as theSilent Warehouse, creative agency Vandejong or Oxfam. They will use their research information to rapidly develop a targeted strategy to stimulate (a) particular Dutch actor(s) to use their leverage to improve certain situations in their operational contexts in the Global South with respect to women, peace and security. This can be a lobbying and media campaign or another innovative way in which (new) art forms, social media, an app or a playful action can be developed and deployed. During a public closing event several groups of participants present their strategies and compete with their strategy to be chosen as the winning strategy.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">IKV was founded in 1966 by nine denominations with a mandate to study the problems of war and peace and to seek ways to promote peace. IKV is known in the 80s by its mass actions against nuclear weapons in the Netherlands. The organization also developedmany contacts with independent groups and dissidents in Eastern Europe under the motto &apos;relaxation from below&apos;. In 2006, the two organizations merged under the name of IKV Pax Christi. As of January 29, 2014 the organization&apos;s name was changed to PAX.

PAX stands for peace. Together with people in conflict and critical citizens in the Netherlands PAX actively contributes to a dignified and peaceful society, anywhere in the world. Peace takes courage. The courage to believe that peace is possible, to goagainst the flow, to speak outand proceed anyway. Everyone in the world can do something for peace, but there is need for courage. The courage to talk to people and invite them to join regardless of one&apos;s background.

Peace Organization PAX combines its work in conflict with national and international political lobbying and public campaigns. PAX works with peace activists in conflict and tries to build bridges between rival groups. In conflict areas PAX initiates and supports local peace initiatives that aim to build bridges between conflicting groups, generate mutual understanding and improves dysfunctional relationships. Besides working with local partners in conflict PAX is doing research in the field of disarmament.

Moreover PAX encourages national and international politicians and policymakers to actively commit to taking peace, security and human rights as starting points for their policies and political choices. PAX works very closely with various national and international networks, and have an employee at the European Union in Brussels and at the United Nations in New York.

PAX develops public campaigns to engage people with its work and to gain their support for its activities; alone ortogether with other (international) organizations. The topics on which we campaign are always issues around which we try to achieveintroduction of new policies or amendment of existing policy, in close collaboration with its partners in conflict areas. Examples include the campaign &apos;Stop blood coal&apos;, the citizens initiatieve &apos;Sign against nuclear weapons&apos;, the &apos;Embassies of Peace&apos;, the international campaigns against cluster munitions, landmines and killer robots, and the crowdfunding campaign &apos;Adopt a Revolution&apos;. With these campaigns PAX tries to show why peace in the world affects us all and what people can do themselves to support a safe and secure existence for people in Congo for example, Syria or South Sudan.

The mission of PAX is aimed at protecting civilians from violence, and improve citizens&apos; (feeling of) security. There are several factors that contribute to people&apos;s security such as increasing mutual trust between different ethnic groups and holding governments accountable for security and human rights.
In addition there areexternal factors affecting security and human rights, such as the arms trade, the use of controversial weapons and repression around the exploitation of natural resources. Through the strengthening of citizen activism (here and there) and our continuous lobbying oncompliance with the International Law PAX&apos; programs contribute to positively influence these underlying factors to create more impact.

Building bridges between antagonistic communities and facilitate dialogue between local communities and authorities or betweenwarring parties and governments is a core activity of PAX. PAX has shown in the past to be able to help bring about a successful conclusion to both local and national peace and negotiation processes, despite often very complex conditions. Additionally PAX focuseson local capacity building, research and monitoring, lobbying and advocacy and public campaigns. PAX makes sure that these elementscombined reinforce each other and thus contribute substantially to the protection of civilians in war zones.

In the Netherlands, PAX seeks to actively engage people in processes that can contribute to peace elsewhere. Peace is everyone&apos;s responsibility. Anyone who believes in peace, can do something for peace. PAX puts peace in motion and calls on concerned citizens to participate. By e.g. placing a simple call on Facebook or by engaging people in starting up an Embassy of Peace. Through Action Alerts and action newsletters we offer people the opportunity to take concrete action for peace in the world. Examples are &quot;Sign Against Nuclear Weapons,&quot; &quot;Adopt a Revolution,&quot; &quot;Stop Explosive Investments&quot;, &quot;peace flights&quot; and the annual Peace Week.</narrative>
