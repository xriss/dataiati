   <narrative xml:lang="EN">After heavy torrential rains in central and northern regions of Afghanistan reported landslides had affected some communities, thenon 12 April a landslide directly engulfed Khoja-Khairab village in Rustaq district of Takahr province affecting 118 families destroying homes and livelihoods. The affected families were forced to flee to Dashte-e-Qala district, remarkably, there were no fatalities. On 13 April 2014 some humanitarian assistance was provided including food rations, emergency health, tents and NFI (clothes, winter kits, and kitchen kits).

The landslide hit Khoja-Khairab village of Rustaq district # Takhar Province - on the night of 11/12 April 2014.  The 118 families living in the village (corresponding to 826 individuals) left their homes and moved to a safer location.To date, there are still no reports about persons being injured or killed. Families are now living in a temporary location in campsand with host communities. The communities# livestock, food and belongings were all lost in the landslide. As the damaged houses are no longer useable, and the village is not possible to inhabit. Government Institutions and Humanitarian Organizations are providing Humanitarian assistance, but the affected population is still in need of further assistance.
The rapid needs assessments reports indicated that the major needs consisted in Food, Health and sanitation/hygiene. WFP has supported the affected population with food assistance. Tents were distributed by ARCS. Some NFI were distributed by UNCHR and other active organization.  DRRD  provides drinking water. DoPH established a mobile clinic in the area. Most of the needs are responded to, but Sanitation and Hygiene promotion arestill a gap, with a very limited number of public latrines available, which increases the risk of communicable diseases.
Oxfam and its partner AHEAD already completed necessary needs assessment and designed its intervention, in coordination with the relevant stakeholders. Oxfam is providing Water Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) support to the landslide affected population in Takhar.
This project aims to support the vulnerability of natural disaster induced 118 IDP families in Dasht-e-Qala district through provision of basicWASH services (provision of sanitation facilities, hygiene training and hygiene kits).
Through implementation of this project, the following activities will take place:
# Conduction health and hygiene awareness training for 118 male and 118 female
# Distribution of health and hygiene kit for 118 landslide affected families
# Construction of 20 public latrines

Project title: Improved water and sanitation conditions for landslide affected communities in Badakhshan province
Project duration: Three months (15/05/2014- 15/08/2014)
Project aim: This project is intended to contribute to responding to immediate emergency needs as a result of the landslide inAgro district of Badakhshan Province
Project description:
On 2nd May 2014, a series of heavy rain resulted in landslides in the District of Argo, Badakhshan Province in north-eastern Afghanistan causing significant loss of life and widespread damage to homes and agriculture fields. Reports indicates that the landslides have killed over 503 people with many others still missing.
Rescue effortshave been hampered by a lack of proper equipment, there is now a race against time to try and provide the appropriate support to the 400 families who have been displaced. There basic needs include safe drinking water, food and shelter.
Afghan central Government and Provincial Disaster Management Authorities (ANDMA) together with civil society organizations are leading the coordination of operational response within Badakhshan; whilst search and rescue operations have now finished, the Government authorities have emphasized the urgent needs in WASH, food and non-food items assistance.
The search and rescue effort and humanitarian assistance is extremely challenging, the surrounding mountains still pose risks of further land slides and flooding. Government has communicated their inability and capacity-gaps to deal with the situation.
A rapid assessment by the provincial governor, ANDMA and other actors in the field indicated that around 1,000 families have been affected. Out of 1,000, 400 houses are completely destroyed and still over 500 victims buried under the mud. Currently 400 families are at very high risk of being victims of further landslide; these families have left their houses and have migrated to areas around Aab Barik village. The familiesare currently living out in the open, and are in immediate need of WASH, food, shelter, health and basic non-food items.
Based on information provided to AHEAD by local government authorities, these displaced families are temporarily settled in areas around the village, who are expected to remain in their current locations from 6 # 12 months before the government is able to allocate new lands for permanent settlement.
WASH situation in the area requires immediate attention; the affected people are currently using unprotected spring water and wide spread open defecation.
Oxfam through its partner AHEAD is providing Water Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) support to the affected population of the landslidein Badakhshan Province # Argo District. These services include;
# Construction of 25 public latrines
# Construction of 50 bath rooms
# Conducting training on health and hygine awareness for 800 men and women
# Distribution of hygine kit for 400 IDP families.

This project is intended to contribute for immediate humanitarian needs of the affected community as a result of landslide in Agro district, Badakhshan Province. Besides it aimed to contribute to the reduction of preventable communicable diseases for landslide affected people.
In coordination with relevant humanitarian actors (UNICEF, WFP, UNHCR among others) AHEAD proposes to construct 25 publiclatrines, 50 public bathing rooms, distribution of 400 hygiene kits and hygiene awareness training.</narrative>

   <narrative xml:lang="EN">AHEAD is a non-governmental, non-political and non-profit organization established in 2008 by Afghan trained professionals those are committed to contribute in improvement of public health, social development, civil society and educational programs. AHEAD is registered under license number 1259 with Ministry of Economy, with the long term Vision of the realization and development of public health, education, community development and a vibrant and vital civil society in Afghanistan where the interest, concerns and dignityof the civilians are taken seriously and more people have access to resources.

AHEAD continue focusing on actions that directly improveon the lives of the majority poor in the region and inputting into the wider societal challenges as well. The usually expressed need to increase household incomes strikes as the ultimate development goal of the grass root communities with much less interest in putting mechanism to make these incomes sustainable. AHEAD has come a long way in thinking to underpin value for integrated programs which embed the social, political and economic considerations in the emancipation of the grassroots communities from abject poverty. AHEAD has continued to invest in skills, community awareness programs as well advocacy to enable many more community members become informed, analytical of their own contexts and planners of their own development, which in turn can potentially bring in more gains from the available resources of government # as the biggest actor, civil society and the community. This kind of precondition becomes very important for the economic empowerment of the rural people.
AHEAD continues its efforts to work further for development and maintains its communication with donor agencies to gain funding sources for further support and achieving its objectives toward achieving the vision.

Since October 2013 ON has been supporting AHEAD in provision of WASH minimum services for 270 IDP families in Balkh province.
