   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The Enhanced Integrated Framework (EIF): The First World Trade Organization (WTO) Ministerial Conference, held in 1996. recognized that the Least Developed countries (LDCs) faced difficulties integrating into the global economy. This led to the adoption of the WTO Plan of Action for LDCs, The following year, in October 1997, the WTO convened a High Level Meeting to discuss the specific needs of LDCs and to formulate a programme to strengthen their trade capacities, including supply-side and market access capacities. The Integrated Framework for Trade Related Technical Assistance to Least Developed Countries (the &#x201C;IF&#x201D;) was the outcome of that meeting. Support was offered to the IF by six multilateral agencies (IMF, ITCP UNCTAD, UNDP, World Bank, and WTO). The achievements of the IF during the early years were modest and when the six agencies met in 2000 to review progress they adopted a number of recommendations and implemented institutional changes to improve the IFs effectiveness. Two main objectives were formulated for the revamped IF: To &#x201C;mainstream&#x201D; (integrate) trade into the national development plans and; To assist in the coordinated delivery of trade-related technical assistance The IF is built on the principles of country ownership, partnership and the &#x201C;Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness&#x201D;. By the end of February 2007, 43 LDCs were at different stages of the IF process. Despite progress a number of weaknesses still remained in the IF: evaluations pointed out an implementation gap and a weak country ownership due to various factors. To that end a Task Force was established by the IF Steering Committee which was welcomed at the Hong Kong Conference, December 2005, WTO Ministers as well as an agreement on the three elements which together would constitute an enhanced IF (thereafter EIF): (i) increased, additional, predictable financial resources to implement Action Matrices; (i) strengthened in-country capacities to manage, implement and monitor the IF process; and (ii) enhanced IF governance. The Accountability Framework builds on the principles and procedures that guide the EIF to facilitate: The effective use of trade as a development tool by the LDCs. LDCs ownership of the in-country programme and projects to be funded by the EIF Including the responsibility to identify their own trade development priorities and manage trade development activities. A partnership approach, through which, in accordance with the principles, of the &#x201C;Paris Declaration&#x201D; donors and international agencies coordinate their response to the needs of LDCs, manage for results, LDC leadership and accept mutual accountability. Building upon these principles, the objectives EIF programme are to provide for: Increased capacity building support to LDCs throughout the EIF process, including increased financial resources, support provided to National Implementation Units (the &#x201C;NIU&#x201D;s), and technical assistance, training and knowledge transfer to be provided by national, regional and international implementing bodies in project delivery; Stronger governance of the IF, including collective decision making through a reconfigured Board, a strengthened Executive Secretariat, clearly defined accountability, and rigorous monitoring and evaluation. UNOPS acts as Trust Fund Manager for EIF. This project will be implemented by the World Bank&apos;s International Trade Department (PRMTR).</narrative>
