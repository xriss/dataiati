ng reflected in the media.The project includes Russian speaking journalists Moldova including its Russian speaking regions Transnistria and Gagauzia. Most of the media outlets used in these regions are of Russian origin with challenges with freedom of expr
ession and fact based journalism. In Transnistria isolating the population and media from Moldovan information sources is also a matter of politics. So accessing a training in HR in their language of use for both groups is a challenge. Also treating HR sub
jects for all of them is of a subsequent difficulty because of each region?s situation and a general lack of democracy and HR culture. By enhancing the capacity of media outlets and journalists to treat Human Rights issues we are enabling the whole society
