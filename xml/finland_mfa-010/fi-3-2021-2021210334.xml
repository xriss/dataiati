   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project is based on the rural villages of Konibodom Gafurov Devashtich Spitamen and Penjikent in the Sugd region of Tajikistan. The project will include one workshop / training 12 seminars in 6 locations the establishment of 6 peer groups and a persona
lized counseling service for women with disabilities in the area. The project aims to raise awareness among woman and girls  with disabilities (WwD) in rural villages in the Sugd region about Tajikistan law and the UN Convention as well as strategies progr
ams and international documents aimed at promoting and protecting women&apos;s rights.It should be noted that girls and women living in this area have limited opportunities which are considerably weaker than in the city. Restrained families and social attitudes
 limit the position of women. Discrimination can be triple based on gender disability and / or poverty. Many women with disabilities did not have access to basic education because they do not have the opportunity to influence themselves. They are completel
y dependent on their families. For the disabled the concept of self-determination is unknown. In particular the lack of information about their own rights drives WwD into four walls. The expected development impact of the project is to increase the awarene
ss of WwD in the region about their own human rights and the content of Tajikist law. Their increased understanding of their own human rights helps them manage their lives and improve their position in society. We will also develop cooperation and networki
ng between women&apos;s and disability organizations in the region. The local organization will be equipped with more capacity and tools to promote the situation of people with disabilities in the area and will be able to produce quality communication and lobby
ing materials. The organization?s experience in providing information and counseling services to people with disabilities in the area is developing.About 2940 beneficiaries women and girls with disabilities in rural areas in the Sugd region will participat
e in the project.The project is implemented by: OO Safoi Konibodom in cooperation with the Central Asian Nations Association Julduz ry</narrative>
