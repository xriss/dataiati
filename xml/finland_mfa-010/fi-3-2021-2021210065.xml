   <narrative xml:lang="EN">In Ethiopia long-term man-made and natural disasters as well as climate change have caused internal displacement that has driven more than 2 million people from their homes. Although the positive political changes followed in 2018 have been significant in 
2019-2021 the old conflicts have deepened and new ones have emerged. In 2021 conflict-affected children in need of education has further increased. As a result of the crises that erupted in Tigray state in November 2020 and the school closures caused by th
e Covid-19 pandemic an estimated 1.3 million children are out of school. Of these an estimated 85000 are refugee children.The Education Cannot Wait (ECW) Fund?s ?Increasing Access to Protective Inclusive Learning Opportunities for Crisis-Affected Children
