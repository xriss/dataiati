   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The International Solidarity Foundation (ISF) is a Finnish development organization founded in 1970.  We have a vision of a world where no women suffer from violence and nobody lives in poverty. We implement our vision through our development cooperation p
rogramme by supporting ecologically and economically sustainable livelihoods and women?s rights. The objectives of our programme are: ? Local economies are dynamic and ecologically sustainable ? Women and men are empowered to prevent violence against women
? People and communities are empowered as instigators of global changeThe 2018-2021 programme seeks to reduce violence against women and girls. It thereby increases women?s potential in society particularly in the economy and development of local communiti
es. Our operating model solves root causes of poverty effectively: we empower local economies by building ecologically sustainable agriculture small businesses and alternative livelihoods in Somaliland Kenya and Nicaragua. Our programme has some 215000 ben
eficiaries of which 54% are women. ISF?s willingness to invest in fragile areas is emphasized in our programme: the largest portion of our budget is devoted for climate change adaptation development of new livelihoods and reducing violence against women in
 Somaliland. Our work in Somaliland complements and supports Finnish strategic priorities in Somalia. The overall budget for our 4-year programme is 12208000 euros. We request 2 million annually from the Ministry for Foreign Affairs in Finland (8 million i
n total or 655% of the budget). We implement our programme primarily through partner-driven development projects and multi-channeled communication and advocacy in Finland. We also do advocacy work at the international level and in the EU through partner ne
tworks.</narrative>
