   <narrative xml:lang="EN">This project seeks to contribute to creating a social safety net for at risk communities suffering the adverse economic consequences of the Coronavirus pandemic in Kira Municipality Wakiso District (impact). The outcome will be strengthened domestic resour
ce mobilization and job creation. The outputs will be: increased access to capital by young adults (especially women) and Increased entrepreneurship skills of young adults (especially women).Uganda Vision 2040 recognizes the challenge of ?a labour force th
at is largely under or unemployed due to inappropriate skills? and the challenge of the ?shortage of development finance.?  By addressing these two issues the project strives to contribute to the Uganda Vision 2040 of ?a Transformed Ugandan Society from a 
Peasant to a Modern and Prosperous Country within 30 years.?The impact on the global economy due to the ongoing covid?19 pandemic will be grave. Access to capital for individuals and small businesses is an essential tool to cushion the impact of the global
 crisis. This project seeks to make affordable capital available at a time when income is desperately needed for businesses to women and youth through the savings groups. The outcome of this intervention would strengthen the capacity of 1000 young adults (
especially women) to access resources and the creation of 600 jobs between 2021 and 2024. Caring Hands has a proven track record for job creation among women youth and other vulnerable groups. They have created access to finances through the facilitation o
f 44 Local Saving and Loan groups. Their entrepreneurship trainings have resulted in the creation of employment for 1100 people living in poverty between 2017 and 2019. Given the sudden onset of the current global economic crisis caused by the Coronavirus 
pandemic these activities need to be upscaled as vulnerable households risk sliding back into poverty as established jobs have been lost. Entrepreneurship training gives women and young adults the skills to exploit new business opportunities in their local
 communities drawing on innovative approaches and joint ventures with established businesses.</narrative>
