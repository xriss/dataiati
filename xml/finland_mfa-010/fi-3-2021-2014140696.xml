   <narrative xml:lang="EN">According to the original plan the project aims to enhance opportunities for quality education for four minority language groups. In the project high quality learning materials are produced for mother tongue education and teachers for Pokomo Orma Digo and 
Duruma grade 1 to 3 pilot schools are trained. Mother tongue education (MTE) provides a strong foundation for a child?s learning when instead of memorizing the focus in on learning. The development of cognitive skills through mother-tongue based learning e
nsures the child&apos;s ability to move on to secondary education and strengthens his/her life skills.The learning materials were partially produced during the first phase but a curriculum reform by the Kenyan authorities (2017) now requires a revision of the m
aterials. In this phase the project seeks to ensure the quality of mother tongue teaching materials and the standard of teachers in line with the requirements of the education authorities. Children (4000) in pilot schools (19) will learn using their mother
 tongue which enhances their chances of achieving national learning outcomes. This will contribute to their equality and their potential to becoming active citizens; finding employment seeking better livelihood and advancing democracy.In addition to comple
ting the learning materials other important objectives of the second phase will be engaging stakeholders transitioning to locally-based ownership and ensuring the sustainability of the program. Engaging of stakeholders will be facilitated by the approval o
f the learning materials by education authorities. Local ownership will be enhanced by awareness and advocacy activities. This is to ensure the sustainability of the developed MTE program beyond the end of funding. Promotional activities will include stake
holder meetings conferences cultural days for children and International Mother Language Day activities.The project is based on learnings from its first phase and recommendations from two different external evaluations.Wycliffe Finland and BTL are organiza
tions with strong expertise in MTE. The project will increase their capacity to work with the government education authorities.</narrative>
