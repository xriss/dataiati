WDs is weakest. Other methods of work include advocacy for inclusion support for disability mainstreaming communications and global education.The Programme consists of a total of 18 projects in 9 countries and the Central Asian region. The core of the Prog
ramme is the implementation of the CRPD. All work is planned according to rights-based approach to development. The objectives and strategies are defined together with persons with disabilities and their organizations in the South.The expected impact of th
