n transition to the next stage of development.The group is currently comprised of 20 countries from Asia Africa the Caribbean and the Pacific Ocean. g7+ was formed in response to a gap identified by conflict-affected states in the achievement of Millennium

nsive manner is one of the conclusions of Finland&apos;s Development Policy Results Report 2018. In addition support to g7+ is well in line with Finland&apos;s activities and objectives in mediation. Finland&apos;s current Government Programme states that in Finland?s fo
reign policy a stronger priority will be placed on conflict prevention mediation and peacebuilding. The cooperation with g7+ also contributes to Finland&apos;s aim to increase partnerships with African countries as stated in the Government Programme because 12 
of g7+ member states are African countries. The covid-19 pandemia has highlighted the need to build resilience in fragile states which is one of the objectives of g7+.</narrative>
