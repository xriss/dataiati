   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The disability specific project is designed to create sustainable solutions for inclusion and rehabilitation of children with disabilities in Chilga Woreda. The long-term change we wish to see in the project area is for children with disabilities to have a
n effective access to health education and preparative employment opportunities and enjoy participation and inclusion in their communities. To achieve the long term impact the project aims in four years (2021-24) to ensure that:1) 640 children with disabil
ities are rehabilitated and local health office continues providing rehab services as 17th package of their Health Extension Programme. (Article 26 of the CRPD)2) Children with disabilities access an inclusive quality and free primary education secondary e
ducation and technical or vocational education on an equal basis with others. (Art. 24/CRPD)3) 30% of Children and youth with disabilities and their families have an adequate standard of living. (Art. 28/CRPD)4) Communities are socially inclusive to childr
en and youth with disabilities and their families and rights-holders and local DPOs are actively monitoring the rights situation. (Art. 29/CRPD) After a decade of restrictive CSO regulation in Ethiopia the situation again allows for rights-based work. To s
eize the opportunity the project takes a human rights progressive approach to development working in close collaboration with government offices to build their capacity to provide health and education services and employment opportunities for children and 
youth with disabilities ensuring sustainability of results. The project will take place in sixteen kebeles (smallest administrative unit) covering 48 schools and all communities. Final beneficiaries are about 640 children and youth with disabilities and th
eir families but systems level changes will of course benefit a much larger number of children and persons with disabilities.Interpedia&apos;s partner in Ethiopia Berhan Lehetsanat is an expert organisation in CBR and most of the selected approaches to work wit
h government offices and with communities are tested for their effectiveness.</narrative>
