   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The joint project by the National Union of University Students in Finland and 8 Finnish university student unions invites university students to consider the global effects of their consumption on developing countries. Thus the project mainly focuses on th
e sustainable development goal (SDG) 12 responsible consumption and production and on goal 4.7 by increasing the skills of students to promote global responsibility.Research information shows that the consumption habits of the young are contradictory: Envi
ronmental responsibility is highlighted in the attitudes of young people especially those who are highly educated. Howeverthey are more likely planning to increase their consumption and once they have found a product that pleases them they do not always co
nsider the possible ethical or unsustainable aspects of the product. Therefore this project called Sustainability holds us up uphold sustainability! aims at increasing the willingness of university students to promote the sustainability of the products tha
t they consume (especially human rights ethics and environmental points of view). The project increases the awareness of Finnish university students on global sustainability through communication acitivities and events that will be organised in 8 student u
nions (2 events / year in each union). In addition 3 of the student unions will organize their own events complementing the shared event concepts. The topics of the project events are responsible production of clothes electronics and food and corporate res
ponsibility. Other organisations and experts are also involved in organising the events. The project draws attetion to the selected themes with an animated video and blog texts and in social media to reach a broader public because young people are active i
n social media. Volunteers and members of student unions participating in project implementation will increase their awareness on the SDGs and ways to promote them. Similarly the project increases students&apos; willingness to purchase items that are environmen
tally friendly and whose production respects human rights. They learn to promote sustainable consumption in their organisations.</narrative>
