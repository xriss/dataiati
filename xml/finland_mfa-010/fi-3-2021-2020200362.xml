   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The attitudes in Finland towards development cooperation and reducing global inequality are among the most negative among EU countries (2019 Eurobarometer). Changing this requires not only more knowledge about inequality but also an experience of empathy a
nd the acknowledgment of the shared human commonalities which brings the experiences of people living in developing countries closer to the average Finn.  This is the goal of My Equal Life project. The project brings a photo exhibition by the award-winning
 Bangladeshi photographer GMB Akash to Finland. GMB Akash photographs people on the margins of the society in a way that gives them dignity and the opportunity to make their voices heard. The personality of Akash?s images and related stories make them deep
ly touching to their viewers. The experience of empathy lays the basis for the internalization of more theoretical knowledge and concrete actions to reduce inequality.The exhibition also includes information that deals with global inequality as well as the
 role of Finnish development cooperation in reducing inequality. The photo exhibition will tour seven municipalities in Finland where it together with the municipalities&apos; cultural departments will be displayed in public places such as libraries and cultura
l centers. The exhibition will also be available on the website.The themes covered will be turned into reflection material that can be used both in the exhibition and in connection with the online exhibition. The purpose of the material is to deepen the un
derstanding of inequality and it can be used both by school classes as well as by the independent exhibition visitors.The social media campaign which uses photos from the exhibition encourages young people and young adults to reflect on inequality and ways
 to influence it in their daily lives. The campaign will be enhanced through a cooperation with a popular YouTuber. The photography competition organized with photography clubs also encourages a deeper reflection on inequality and the structures that cause
 it based on the themes of the exhibition. The project culminates in an event presenting the harvest of the photography competition.</narrative>
