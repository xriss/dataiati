   <narrative xml:lang="EN">?Freedom of expression and democracy as prerequisite for democracy: study programme for media students? is a project by Vikes and Maailma.net that aims to increase the knowledge of journalism and media students in universities of applied sciences about the
 freedom of expression and democracy as issues of sustainable development. The aim is also to increase the coverage of these topics in the media.The primary target group are the students in Turku and Metropolia Universities of Applied Sciences. A secondary
 target group are the students of Haaga-Helia University of Applied Sciences and if possible also other journalism and media students. In the project a course worth 5 academic credits will be organized for the universities. It consists of lectures on susta
inable development and journalistic workshops where students produce multimedia content for Maailma.net. Based on the themes of the course a seminar open to all will also be organized in the autumn of 2022.Another target group of the project is the general
 public interested in societal issues and online journalism which will be reached through the media content produced by the students. Through innovative media content public awareness is increased e.g. on the role of freedom of expression and democracy in 
promoting sustainable development and the situation of freedom of expression and democracy in developing countries. The aim is to increase public awareness that the challenges are global and affect everyone and to strengthen their engagement to defend free
dom of expression and democracy as part of sustainable development.There is a need for such information. According to a survey by the MFA less than half of Finns have heard about Agenda 2030. The need for this project also arises from the global crisis of 
democracy. The amount of democracies has increased but their quality has decreased. The suppression of media freedom has become more common. However when this topic is being covered in the media it is often forgotten that this phenomenon is global and that
 freedom of expression and democracy are not only values as themselves but also a prerequisite for sustainable development.</narrative>
