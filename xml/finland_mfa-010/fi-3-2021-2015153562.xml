cessional loans; the poorest countries also receive grants. IFAD-supported projects focus particularly on smallholders in developing countries but also the rural landless pastoralists small-scale fishers indigenous peoples and in all these groups especiall
y rural women.IFAD&apos;s work is closely related to the UN Millennium Development Goals and the future Sustainable Development Goals of eradicating extreme poverty and hunger. There are still  1.3 billion poor and the 840 million hungry people in the world. Ne
arly three-quarters of them live in rural areas. 80 per cent of developing countries&apos; food is produced by smallholders. Population growth the scarcity of natural resources and cultivable areas natural disasters and climate change continue to create pressur
e on food prices and poverty. IFAD operates in more than 90 countries in partnership with governments local communities the private sector and other organizations in order to improve rural poor people&apos;s access to markets finance technology land and other n
atural resources.IFAD&apos;s resources are replenished every three years through a consultation process. IFAD&apos;s largest donor countries are the United Kingdom the Netherlands United States Italy and Sweden. The replenishment target for IFAD 11 was set at USD 35
 billion of which the member states&apos; contribution is 12 billion. IFAD&apos;s key objective in the IFAD-11 replenishment period is to lift 80 million people out of poverty. As cross-cutting themes IFAD will emphasize the adaptation to climate change nutrition an
d gender equality and the empowerment of women.Finland pledged EUR 6 million to IFAD-11 in 2018. In 2019 Finland decided to pledge an additional EUR 462 million to IFAD-11.</narrative>
