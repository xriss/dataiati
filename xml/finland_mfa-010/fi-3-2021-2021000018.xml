   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The overall objective of the project is to promote fully inclusive sexual and reproductive health (SRH) services information policies and infrastructure for women and girls (W+G) with disabilities. In Moldova W+G with disabilities are often treated as not 
having sexual and reproductive desires and needs. Service providers are inadequately informed about the SRHR of W+G with disabilities. Many W+G with disabilities do not know where they can access SRHR services. The infrastructure of facilities is generally
 poorly adapted to their needs. Project immediate results:1) 45 W+G with disabilities demonstrate increased knowledge and awareness about sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) and greater confidence to access SRH services. 2) 5 videos developed 
on SRHR topics. 3) 35 SRH coordinators (one from each district) demonstrate increased capacity to promote rights-based services to W+G with disabilities. 4) 1000 primary care personnel capacitated to provide rights-based SRH services absent of stigma or di
scriminatory attitudes to W+G with disabilities. 5) 500 social workers demonstrate increased knowledge about SRH services and benefits available to W+G with disabilities and how SRH services can be accessed.6) 1 University curriculum for social work studie
s revised to include module on providing beneficiaries including W+G with disabilities with assistance in accessing SRH care and services. 7) National Standards for the Evaluation and Accreditation of Outpatient Healthcare Facilities revised to require fac
ilities to meet international accessibility standards. 8) 3 indicators established for M+E of the National Program on SRHR 2018?2022 included in National Health Insurance Agency?s list of performance indicators. 9) 50 key stakeholders demonstrate political
 will and commitment to improve access to SRH services and information including for W+G with disabilities.The target groups of this project include primary healthcare personnel social workers local authorities and civil society organizations working in th
e field of disability. The final beneficiaries of the project are W+G with disabilities.The project is implemented by Reproductive Health Training Center (RHTC): a non-governmental organization founded in 1998. The mission of RHTC is to protect and promote
 the sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) of all people W+G. The FLC grant is 58 983 EUR. The total project budget is 71 913 EUR.</narrative>
