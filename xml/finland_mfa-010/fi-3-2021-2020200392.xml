   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The mother tongue/home language instruction in the core curriculum of Finnish National Agency for Education (FNAE) outlines home language lessons are right of anyone whose mother tongue is not Finnish nor Swedish. The classes are voluntary but a group to b
e established requires 10 students. The education providers like municipalities are obliged to provide classes and they draw up their own curriculas and state the broad content of the lessons. However the materials for the lessons vary. For Somali language
 there is no coherent materials and it basically leans on teachers&apos; own resources and contacts. Some efforts have been done for the somali language itself through an e-learning material available on the website of FNAE. Wider themes and globally important 
issues are not touched.FSN sees demand for the material for Somali language teachers. As a diaspora organisation running developing projects in Horn of Africa knowing the background of country and being familiar with the global development issues FSN sees 
a natural entry point to fill in the gap. All partners will win. In this project FSN equips somali language lessons with quality material on global development issues immigration routes climate change environmental protection recycling and sustainable deve
lopment.The material will give opportunity for the somali children and youth attending the Finnish schools to discuss these important issues in their own mother tongue with peer-to-peer in comfortable and neutral atmosphere. Also the access to the vocabula
ry of these complex issues in their home language is a great asset and assures deeper understanding of the root causes behind global development issues. On the other hand the students will gain better learning results in lessons on other topics in Finnish 
as the basis is rock solid with wide vocabulary of their home language. In the end this will have impact in youth&apos;s identity and self-esteem as the understanding is more profound on causes and consequences and the background of their family history. Until 
now the global education done in Finnish schools has only been in Finnish/Swedish leaving the immigrant students a bit on their own.</narrative>
