   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The work of KIOS Foundation aims to ensure that human rights for all people are realized and that states are committed to human rights in their legislation and implementation. At the heart of our work is realizing the rights of the marginalized and exclude
d groups and persons in vulnerable positions. The strengthening of civil society and in particular strengthening the enabling environment of human rights defenders and their organisations in developing countries is in the core of our work. KIOS considers t
hat an independent capable and competent civil society committed to defend the human rights of all is a prerequisite for the realization of human rights and for functioning democracies respecting rule of law.KIOS gives financial support to human rights wor
k that is planned and implemented by local human rights defenders and their civil society organisations and networks. Thus KIOS grantees have a strong ownership of their projects/programmes and often represent the specific rights-holder group themselves.Th
e programme impact is a stronger more independent and pluralistic human rights movement contributing to the realization of human rights. This will be achieved by 1) improved capacity of the grantees to defend human rights in local national regional and int
ernational levels 2) Right-holders having increased abilities to claim their rights and participating in civic and political life in their communities to defend human rights. It is vital that 3) right-holders have increased access to justice and 4) duty-be
arers are engaged and committed to advance human rights in programme countries. KIOS therefore 5) raises awareness and improves knowledge among duty-bearers the general public and other targeted stakeholder groups.During this programme period KIOS will dir
ect its funding to East Africa and South Asia. The programme countries and focuses in East Africa are Kenya Uganda Rwanda and Burundi and in South Asia Nepal Sri Lanka and Tibetan refugee organisations.</narrative>
