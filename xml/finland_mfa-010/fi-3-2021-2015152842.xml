 the rights holders i.e. the citizens and the duty bearers i.e. the authorities and the political decision makers. Discrimination and injustice are also moral challenges. Felm furthers these through value choices and by defending justice and non-discrimina
tion.The Felm development cooperation program 2018-2021 promotes the rights of people who face discrimination advances social and economic justice and builds peace and reconciliation. Through the program we aim to remove discriminatory structures attitudes
 and harmful practices  especially for women and girls for  people living with disabilities for ethnic minorities and indigenous people and for youth. The program boosts empowerment livelihood and education food security  and equal opportunities for the di
scrimintaed in communities and societies. Furthermore Felm promotes climate change prevention adaptation and resilience as well as builds capacity in disaster preparedness. The program addresses intersectional discrimination. In line with the rights based 
approach the capacity performance and networking of duty bearers and other influential actors to promote justice in societies is strengthened. We support development through prevention of conflicts and promoting peace and reconciliation in the communities.
