   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project is a larger and more inclusive continuation and extension of its successful predecessor Empowered Girls Speak Out (EGSO) project (2017-2020) by LiiKe and SDA. The project aims to improve adolescent girls&apos; and youth with disabilities aged 13-19 
opportunities to equal and safe participation in secondary education and civil life. It aims to increase their school performance and understanding of their rights and sexual and reproductive health (SRH) so they would graduate from secondary school and be
 less affected by teenage pregnancies and gender/disability-based violence. The girls and youth with disabilities are at the center of social change however boys schools and communities will also be targeted to facilitate the change. We have seen positive 
change in girls&apos; graduation rates (from 9% to 43) and pregnancy in the 9 target schools and communities in EGSO. In other communities however the problem remains. The central issue to be addressed is poor academic performance gender+disability based violen
ce harassment in/on the way to school and negative parental attitudes towards girls? and PWD&apos;s education due to traditional gender norms and ignorance towards PWD. Furthermore insufficient knowledge of human rights and SRH combined with controversial tradi
tional cultural initiation ritual Unyago encouraging adolescent sexual relations and a lack of contraceptives is leading to many school-aged pregnancies.Inclusive Girls&apos; Action Clubs teach 40 girls of all abilities in each 50 schools about sports human rig
hts SRH and life skills. 9 of these schools are EGSO pilot schools. Influential and other community members are trained and mobilized to start promoting the project values and 100 teachers are trained to support and to secure girl-and disability friendly s
chools.The project continues from where EGSO pilot project ended by working with Unyago (a training for 5-13 yearsold girls about household activities and how to please future husbands) trainers and train them how to teach according to the safer and revise
d Unyago curriculum. The project provides the new kungwi organisation with capacity building to get stronger and more sustainable.</narrative>
