   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Central American democracies have taken steps backward in the last two years which has manifested in electoral frauds corruption repression of citizens and blockage of freedom of expression. This makes the work of independent media and civil society actors
 that are not tied to economic or political powers more important than ever. In this era of fake news and disinformation due to propaganda and the polarization promoted by authoritarian rulers independent media can guarantee journalism that monitors decisi
on-makers. This project aims to attack these problems by investing in the development of independent innovative and financially viable media in order to ensure that citizens are informed about what is happening in their environment and society.The project 
builds on the experience and good results of previous project phases and the long-term partnerships of Vikes in the region since 2007. The new project phase continues to support independent medias and civil society organizations in Nicaragua El Salvador an
d Honduras in building institutional capacity and developing the skills and networks required to operate sustainably in hostile environments.The expected outcomes are: 1) Independent media journalists&apos; unions and CSOs have increased funding and improved ad
ministrative and financial management. 2) CSOs journalists and independent media are well interconnected sharing knowledge and experiences to strengthen their work. 3) Independent media and CSOs provide quality information that reach a wider audience inclu
ding marginalized groups. The project will be implemented in collaboration with media partners El Faro in El Salvador and Onda Local in Nicaragua as well as Centro Humboldt an environmental CSO in Nicaragua. In addition the project will directly benefit Ho
nduran journalists and digital media El Criterio in Honduras. Vikes is also looking at possibilities for working with social communicators networks (community radio and television stations and web-based digital medias). In Nicaragua support is also given t
o the Union of Independent Journalists of Nicaragua (PCIN) to implement its core administrative and operational functions.</narrative>
