   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The main components of the Abilis Global Programme are capacity building of persons with disabilities and their organizations disability inclusion and policy dialogue. The overall objective of the programme is that persons with disabilities are aware of th
eir human rights and act for the realization thereof and are in every way equal to their fellow human beings. This is possible when persons with disabilities recognize their human rights and are empowered for independent living. Disability inclusion occurs
 only when the attitude of the community is positive towards disability and the infrastructure of society is supporting implementation of disability rights.The realization of the human rights of persons with disabilities require supporting of rights-holder
s and duty-bearers. This is the focus of the work Abilis carries out in 12 programme countries and in the named fragile states in Asia Africa Eastern Europe and  the Middle East. Majority of the project funding is channelled to the least developed countrie
s and remote areas where very few other donors can support local groups. Particular attention is paid to women and children with disabilities as many of them experience multiple discrimination. Project funding is given only to organizations of persons with
 disabilities that plan implement monitor and report projects. Thus the entire project cycle builds capacity of grantee organizations. Abilis Foundation has 20-years? worth of experience in project management work with standardized mechanisms and tools and
 a wide network. Results and impacts are monitored through global and country specific indicators developed for the Foundation?s use. Further development work is carried out continuously based on recommendations made in the evaluations. Global Disability D
iplomacy on Human Rights is the initiative for policy dialogue and inclusion in Finland and programme countries as well as globally. Active information and communication work is undertaken in order to share results with the general public and external acto
