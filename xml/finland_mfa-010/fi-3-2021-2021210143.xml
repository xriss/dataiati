   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Somalia has one of the highest maternal- and child mortality rates in the world. Long-lasting conflict has damaged the health sector and due to shortage of professional staff and low financial resources especially the most vulnerable people continue to str
uggle to receive quality healthcare. Since maternal healthcare services are not widely available majority of women don?t receive any professional healthcare during pregnancy and delivery which contributes to the high rates of maternal and infant mortality.
 Maternity Clinic and Training project has supported FinSom Maternity Clinic together with the local partner VMDSO in Afgoye Somalia since 2012. The Clinic provides maternal healthcare for thousands of women and treats about 20 000 outpatients annually. Th
e Clinic is the only one in the area operating free of cost and open 24/7. In addition to maternal health services the project aims to increase the awareness of health-related issues in the local community such as FGM HIV/AIDS provide support for the victi
ms of gender-based violence through counseling and organize training to traditional birth attendants. Long-term goal of the project is to improve women&apos;s health in Afgoye and ensure women&apos;s access to quality maternal healthcare. Main beneficiaries of the p
roject are the women receiving maternal healthcare and counseling at the Clinic and their children. Furthermore all the outpatients receiving care at the Clinic and people participating to the awareness raising are beneficiaries of the project. This includ
es vulnerable groups such as IDPs and disabled women. The results of the previous project phases show that the Clinic is providing vital source of quality care both to expectant mothers and other members of the community. Raising awareness about health has
 been successful and majority of pregnant women and mothers treated at the Clinic report negative attitude towards FGM. The continuation phase invests further to increase the capacity of local partner Clinic&apos;s health personnel TBAs and volunteers through t
raining so that in the future they could take over the management of the project and secure other sources of funding.</narrative>
