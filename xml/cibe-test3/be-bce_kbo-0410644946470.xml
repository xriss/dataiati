   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The humanitarian situation for some populations in Burundi, Niger, and the DRC is currently very difficult. This is largely the result of a context of widespread poverty, chronic instability, recurrent natural disasters (droughts, floods, locust attacks, landslides, etc.), lack of access to basic social services, weak economies dependent on external markets, violations of human rights, and protracted national or regional armed conflicts.

In the context of these three countries, which face the risks of recurring disasters and complex crises, Caritas International intends to increase the resilience of vulnerable populations to the risks of disasters and to help them reduce their vulnerability before, during and after a crisis , through capacity building.

The areas of intervention selected in each country are areas facing multiple disaster risks. It was decided, with the partners and the local population, to focus the work (1) on&#xA0;the Community component of disaster risk reduction and on the setting up and monitoring of DRR plans, (2) on preparation and capacity building in the face of two or three specific risks affecting the population in particular.

Burundi

Rural families in the province of Rutana derive their main sources of income from agri-livestock sector, but the latter has suffered for several years from the deterioration of agro-climatic conditions: land erosion, degradation of soil fertility, climatic variations alternating between rainfall deficits, and heavy rains that destroy crops, etc.

Focus : strengthening the community to better prepare for disasters, reducing flood risks, reducing the risks of food insecurity, reducing the risks&#xA0;associated with soil fertility loss.

Niger

The Diffa region is particularly affected by poor harvests due to a recurrent rainfall deficit in recent years as well as the consequences of the insecurity due to Boko Haram&apos;s exactions on the border with Nigeria (population displacement, Socio-economic activities, etc.). Refugees, internally displaced and internally displaced persons&#xA0;&#xA0;suffer from food insecurity.

Focus : strengthening the community to better prepare for disasters (DRR committees), reducing the risks associated with the lack of drinking water, reducing the risks linked to the deterioration of the socio-economic environment, reducing the risks of conflict

Democratic Republic of Congo

The territories of Lisala and Lolo have an important rainfall due to their geographical position (equatorial zone) and frequently suffer the phenomena of erosion and floods. The effects of these erosions and floods further increase the vulnerability of populations, especially those in rural areas.

Focus : strengthening the community to better prepare for disasters (humanitarian watch), reducing flood risks, reduce the risk of erosion, reduce the risks associated with the deterioration of income from the change in climate</narrative>
