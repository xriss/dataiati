   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The reception centre has been opened for 5 years and shelters women and children while they receive specific accompaniment throughout the asylum application process to help prepare them for their new life. 21 independent private apartments allow for a community life in a former convent which alleviates the isolation of these women.

Thanks to its strong experience in welcoming asylum seekers, Caritas International was well placed to identify the specific needs of women migrants who experiment extreme difficulties once they find themselves unprotected and outside of their country of origin. They carry a heavy past since many of them had to flee their country faraway from their relatives either because they were victims of violence, armed conflicts or discriminations. Traumatized and isolated, they had to bear the exile, the constraints of asylum application, the financial distress while trying to go beyond their traumatism and to take care of their health and children.
