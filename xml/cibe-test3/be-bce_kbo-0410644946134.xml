   <narrative xml:lang="EN">When asylum seekers receive a positive answer to their asylum application &#x2013;&#xA0;this means: when they are officially recognized as refugees - they need to find a home and a job as soon as possible. The difficult process of integration can usually only start from the moment that they have found a suitable home. Only then will they have the right to public welfare assistance, will they be able to apply for a Belgian ID card, to enroll in language classes, etc.

Unfortunately, reality shows that it is very hard for refugees to find a rental contract. Caritas International supports refugees during this search for a home. This is also why we are currently in the process of expanding our network of homes so that recognized refugees may find a home as quickly as possible. In August we launched an&#xA0;appeal to homeowners&#xA0;who are willing to rent out a property to those refugees who have been granted a residence permit. Since our appeal we have received more than 500 offers. But given the extraordinary demand, the search continues. Read more about our appeal&#xA0;here (why/where/what).</narrative>
