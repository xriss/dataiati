   <narrative xml:lang="EN">International Defence Education is recognised as a key element of Defence Engagement; impacting and contributing to Defence Diplomacy through capacity building, security sector reform, conflict prevention and stabilisation. The Defence Education programme aims to provide future leaders of international service personnel, police and civilians in the security sector with the skills that will enable them to make effective contributions to long-term institutional reform, conflict prevention and regional security. Defence Education benefits a broad variety of countries around the world and thus, would be difficult to split down on a country-by-country basis. It covers five distinct courses and for each a different proportion is ODA eligible, reflecting the relevance to ODA purposes.</narrative>
