   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Following the Nepal Earthquake on 25 April 2015, the UK deployed military aircraft to transport over 148 tonnes of humanitarian aid to and around the region. We also airlifted 33 civilians who needed evacuating to safety from Kathmandu airport. This spend includes the deployment and recovery of one C-17, one C-130 and three CH47s, with associated personnel and equipment, and an Operational Liaison and Reconnaissance Team. The funding was transferred to MoD from DfID during the 2015 Supplementary Estimate process.</narrative>
