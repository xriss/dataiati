   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Containing and preventing the spread of Acute Watery diarrhea (AWD) in 3 sub-cities from 11 woredas of the Addis Ababa City Administration of Ethiopia</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The densely populated Addis has a major problem of provision of basic services (clean water, sanitation facilities, and health services) to its community, which contributes to the prevalence of communicable diseases including the current AWD outbreak. 
The major underlying causes of AWD are the absence of safe drinking water, poor sanitation facilities, poor hygiene practices and limited capacity to contain the disease by adequate regulation and practices. In order to contain and prevent the spread of AWD and associated diseases Oxfam will deliver and manage this response in partnership with a partner (AMREF Health Africa) with proven experience and presence in the target areas. While partner NGO will be primarily responsible for managing ground level operations (e.g. WASH promoters management and local level coordination), Oxfam will ensure prompt and high quality technical support and supervision, in a coordinated and harmonized way.
Oxfam and AMREF will also closely coordinate and work with health and WaSH clusters, health bureau, Addis Ababa city water and sewerage authority, Addis Ababa city Administration, Health clusters and other partners to ensure timely and coordinated response. 11 Woredas from the the sub-cities of Addis Katema, Gullele and Kolfe Keranyo have been considered as the priority areas for this intervention as they do not have significant support from other INGO, or significant ongoing AWD response projects. 
The AWD programme aims to encourage and facilitate behavioral change through a mixture of tools and events that will reinforce the importance of good hygiene.  Whilst some community members will be more active than others, it is considered that using this varied approach the whole target population will be reached either directly or indirectly.
Project will collaborate with selected WASH promoters and structures that are already established within the respective sub-cities/ woreda. At sub-city, Woreda Health officers, Health Extension Workers (HEWs) are based at Community Health Units and Health Development Army located at community level.  
The project will focus on promoting safe water chain management ensuring that water is safe for human consumption. Hygiene promoters will be organized trained and linked with HEWs so that they will mobilize communities in the areas of hygiene and sanitation practices. The HP/HEWs, will promote safe hygiene washing practices through IEC materials.

The project will rehabilitate existing and build new latrines, install Water storage plastic tanks, distribute WASH NFIs and water treatment chemicals ensuring the availability of safe water to population at risk in affected woredas. vPromotion of programme quality through empowering approach to working with communities and inclusion of key crosscutting issues such as gender, quality, and accountability will be employed in all levels during implementation period. 
 Socially desegregated programming will be encouraged to ensure that all social groups have representative structures and are equally represented at all phases and levels of implementation
 Communities will be encouraged to provide feedback on their level of satisfaction with the quality and effectiveness of programme, paying particular attention to the gender, age balance and diversity of those giving feedback. 
 Appropriate measures will be put in place to ensure communities have access to safe and responsive complaints mechanism and that complaints are welcomed and addressed.
This project will respond to the AWD outbreak by targeting estimated 16587 Households and 11 schools in 11 Woredas of 3 targeted sub-cities. Selection of beneficiaries will be based on level of and most affected groups as daily laborers, housewives, unemployed and self-employed as per of the reports shared during the Health cluster meetings. Special attention will be given in terms of gender (with particular focus on women) and age (children).</narrative>
