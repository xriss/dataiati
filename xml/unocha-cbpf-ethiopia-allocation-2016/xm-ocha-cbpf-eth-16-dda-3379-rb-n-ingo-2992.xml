  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">SC is proposing an emergency nutrition and WASH project targeting Kabridahar, Sheygosh, Shilabo, Doboweyne of Qorahey zone, Harshin, Babile, Kabribayah of Fafan zone, Mustahil, Ferfer and Qalafo woredas of Shabelle zone (hotspot priority one and two woredas) the project is an extension to an ERF funded project in Korahe, SC will be taking over for Mercy Corps project in Shebelle and conducting a new intervention in Fafan Zone. Despite the interventions in the areas of Korahe and Shebelle reports show that the numbers for SAM and MAM cases are still high prompting the need for furher intervention. The project will have nine months duration with a total budget of US $ 1,496,077.50 and additional SC contributions. The project activities will be supporting CMAM response, institutional WASH and RHB MHNT.  RHB MHNT will be linked to ongoing static activities through integration of activities, referral linkage where SAM complicated cases will be referred to TFU, reports, coordination and support in case finding.
Community based management of acute malnutrition (CMAM): According to the recent biannual nutrition survey (ENCU) the GAM and SAM rate reported at17% and 3% respectively. SC will support government health posts and health centers to manage SAM cases through OTP and will refer SAM cases with medical complications to the stabilization center. Children admitted in OTP will attend weekly follow-ups, and will be treated with ready to use therapeutic food (RUTF). Selection criteria on Annex 1.
Targeted supplementary feeding program (TSFP): In priority 1 and 2 woredas (Mustahil, Ferfer, Qalafo, Shilabo, Kebridahar, Dobowye and Sheygosh woredas of Shabelle and Qorahey zone) SC&#x2019;s will support TSFP targeting lt 5 years children&#x2019;s, PLW and OTP discharged children with moderate acute malnutrition through the provision of super cereals. A total of 604.0 Mt of super cereal will be provided from ERF for P2 woredas amp from WFP for P1 woredas including OTP discharge rations for 10 woredas of Somali region. Admission criteria on Annex 1.
Infant and Young Child Feeding in Emergencies (IYCF-E): Prior to the emergency, 52% of infants 0-6 months were exclusively breastfed (EDHS 2011) however, evidence from other pastoralist areas suggests this has fallen significantly among women in drought affected areas.SC will train IYCF officers and midwives to provide support for mothers experiencing difficulty with breastfeeding, facilitate mother-to-mother support groups established at OTP sites. 
Health education and Case management during emergency outbreak diseases SC will work to reduce diarrhea incidence through case management at health facilities and stabilization center support the woreda health office with logistics during measles campaign/ active case identification and actively strengthen the surveillance system by providing training for woreda health staffs on public health emergency management (PHEM) and support transportation of emergency drugs supplies to health facilities and selected TSFP sites. 
Capacity building to enhance existing services: During visits made to Babile, Kabribayah and Harshin, SC found that 60% of health extension workers and nurses were not trained on SAM management. Training will be conducted for the facility staff and SC will also provide technical support to the woreda health bureaus and health facilities through coordination support with RHB.
WASH activities in health centers and posts: Water quality for drinking and cooking is a concern in the woredas. Of 78 health facilities in woredas of Fafan zone, 23 have piped water or water containers and no hand washing facilities. SC filed visit shows it was estimated that more than 80% of the kebele communities were practicing open defection resulting in diarrhea as one of the ten top diseases. Appropriate hygiene and sanitation practices, distribution of water treatment tablets, and establishing hand washing facilities and water collection at 65 TFP will be co</narrative>
