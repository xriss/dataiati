  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The submitted project responds to the outbreak of AWD (acute watery diarrhea) in the most affected woredas of SNNPR and Oromia (targeting Dara, Wonago, Dilla zuriya, Abaya, including 40 kebeles) and has been amended to additionally respond to incidents of  skin disease outbreak in the targeted SNNPR/Oromia woredas. This outbreak occurred during the implementation of AWD activities and there is urgent need to reach on that. Project aims to secure basic needs of affected population both in terms of access to clean water preventing further spreading and support of the health system in responding the AWD outbreak with special regard to youth and pupils who will be one of the most vulnerable groups to be affected by AWD and  skin disease. 
Project is complementary to the Government led nationwide response and fully covers the needs of AWD in terms of WASH and health services. The same proven approach will be used to counter the spread of skin disease. The proposed intervention is closely coordinated with other actors (governmental offices, IRC, etc.) to prevent overlapping of activities. The list of targeted kebeles has been discussed with above mentioned actors for better coordination of implemented activities and targeted population. 

The overall objective is to reduce the spread of AWD and  skin disease in the country, preventing further morbidity and mortality through integrated WASH and health response. 
Specific objectives target enhanced surveillance in health facilities, case management and prevention of further AWD or  skin disease transmission. 

People in Need are active in Gedeo zone currently responding to AWD from field office located in Dilla town. Following the response from internal funding sources in Wonago woreda a detailed assessment had been conducted. The initial response and further assessment of AWD response had been closely coordinated with Regional and Woreda health and Water offices and is comprised the following major activities responding best to the situation on the ground and acute needs of the targeted areas and population:

 Provision of Basic training on AWD, skin disease, and Rapid Response for facilitators (HEW, members of HDAs) and following community based surveillance, HHs visits for early detection of suspected cases and referral 
 Provide orientation training for school directors and teachers on AWD and Scabies Prevention and control strategies, and distributions of emergency kits to pupils
 Activate existing emergency taskforce and rapid response plan for the affected woredas 
 Provision of joint supportive supervision with partners
