   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Integrated response to protect and restore livelihoods of drought affected people (older women and men and other vulnerable community groups) in four woredas of Oromia National Regional State</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The project is designed to contribute to the ongoing emergency response by government and other humanitarian actors in order to prevent further deterioration of the food security situation through provision of supplementary food to malnourished older people and Persons with Disabilities (PwDs), provision of agricultural inputs to drought affected agro pastoralist farmers and improve access to clean and safe water for the most vulnerable households in four targeted woredas, namely Ziway Dugda of Arsi Zone, Adami Tulu Jido Kombolcha of East Shewa Zone, Girar Jarso and Abote woredas of North Shewa Zone of Oromia National Regional State.

The Woreda disaster risk profile of 2015 by the Disaster Risk Management Food Security Commission (DRMFSS), indicates that drought is a common phenomena in the four woredas with a 39.4% and 54.4% chance of happening in ATJK and Ziway Dugba respectively.The persistent occurrence of drought has resulted in chronic vulnerabilities and high poverty among the rural folks in the targeted woredas. According to the Government led multi agency assessment conducted in November 2015, the three woredas, Zeway Dugda, Adami Tulu Jido Kombolcha and Girar Jarso are among the priority one (severly affected) woredas while Abote Woreda is priority 2. The crucial emergency needs includes Food and Nutrition, seed and other agricultural inputs for the upcoming rainy season, WASH, and Livelihhood protection. The assessments also indicated that a total of 92,950, 133,979, 41,564 and 29,668 are needy populations, mainly women, older people and other most vulnerable sections require immediate emergency assistance in addition to the PSNP beneficiaries of Ziway Dugda, Adami tulu JK, Girar Jarso and Abote woeredas respectively. These crucial needs were confirmed by the findings of the  HelpAge Food and Nutrition assessment conducted in January- February 2016 which revealed a food gap and low dietary diversity score among the older people and people with limited access to local markets due to the lack of local production which has knock on effect to access and availability of essential basic commodities in village markets of ATJK and Ziway Dugba woredas. Older people with limited income and flexibility are more dependent on the village markets for essential food supplies than other members of the community.

The project contributes to the efforts of addressing the food gap of vulnerable HHs reducing the risk and vulnerability to the current drought. Supplementary feeding program is among the activities intended to address the immediate food needs of the needy households with older men and women and PwDs, while provision of agricultural inputs such as drought resistant improved seed, fertilizers and tools is the other major intervention so they can protect and restore their livelihoods. Moreover, effort will be made to link the beneficiaries with the existing cereal banks in the area to ensure sustainability and thereby realizing wider impacts. Relevant and selected agricultural tools will also be supplied to the households who are targeted for seed provision to enhance their capacity. Basic training on agronomical practices of drought resistant crops and prevention of post-harvest losses will be conducted to farmers and agricultural extension workers. The project will also utilize the existence of community institutions/groups for mobilization and ownership of the interventions. The project&#x2019;s WASH intervention includes rehabilitation of 6 shallow/hand dug wells, 3 water points, 3 springs and distribution of water purification chemicals with hygiene and sanitation promotion to the targeted communities.</narrative>
