   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Emergency Assistance to El Ni&#xF1;o induced Disease (Scabies) Affected Communities  in North Wollo zone, Amhara</narrative>
  </title>
  <description type="2">
   <narrative xml:lang="EN">The proposed emergency response project is designed in close consultation with WASH cluster lead agency (UNICEF) and other members   to respond to the priorities identified by the target community, Humanitarian Requirement Document for 2016, Ethiopia`s El Ni&#xF1;o response plan for 2016, and Ethiopia Scabies outbreak preparedness and response plan operational recommendation for interventions (FMOH - Dec 2015)  due to El Ni&#xF1;o induced drought and diseases (Scabies) outbreak. DanChurchAid (DCA) in partnership with the development wing of a local organization namely, Ethiopian Evangelical Church Mekane Yesus Development and Social Services Commission (EECMY-DASSC) designed this project carefully based on the need assessment that was conducted at the grass roots level with the relevant district officials and communities in January 2016. DCA and EECMY-DASSC have long years of rich working experience and full implementation technical capacity required to implement the proposed project.

Project goal, objective with the intended outcome are as follows:
Project Goal:  To contribute to the reduction of excess morbidity and mortality due to El Ni&#xF1;o induced drought in three  woredas of North Wollo zone, Amhara region.
Project Objective: Drought  affected communities in Raya kobo, Guba Laftu and Wadla  woredas of North Wollo zone are able to cope with and recover from El Nino induced  water washed disease (Scabies) outbreak  through capacitating and promoting emergency hygiene and sanitation practices and grassroots health structure.
To meet the proposed project goal and  objective, the implementation of this project will focus on realizing the following key outcome:
Outcome 1 &#x2013; Local health bureau structures and community capacity and awareness  enhanced  to  prevent and control  the impact of water washed diseases (scabies) .The Project will be implemented from 1 March, 2016 - August 31 , 2016.
This project targets 62532 individuals from four most affected prioritized woredas ( Raya kobo, Guba Laftu and Wadla ) of North Wollo zone, Amhara region. These end beneficiaries selected from the woredas will be provided with the planned scabies outbreak response interventions recommended by the FMOH plan through the proposed project. 

Needs of different group: To ensure equal opportunity and avoid impartial assistance, beneficiaries including women, men, children, elders and people with disabilities were involved during the designing of the project through the community consultation meetings/FGDs. In these processes, affected communities were able to analyze their susceptibility with regard to pertinent problems facing their community. Community members proposed ways on how they felt their problems could be solved. Beneficiaries participated in risk and problem analysis, identify the most affected groups (adult members are too old or too sick to work, or that have no adults, orphans, pregnant and lactating mothers) and identified immediate interventions/responses. Due considerations have also been given to include targeted interventions in ensure the special needs of women of reproductive age and other groups are well addressed.</narrative>
