(GOIL); and 36% owned by other investors. The Companys other shareholders are GOIL (17%); Beagle Limited, a UK-based investment company (10%); two US/Canadian investment companies (8%); and IFC (5%).  The remaining 30% is widely held.

Proposed IFC investment: A Loan of US$12 million for its own account and a B Loan of US$12 million for account of participant banks.  In addition, IFC may also propose an equity/quasi-equity investment in the range of US$2 million.    Location of project and Description of site    	All the Companys operations will continue to be located in north-west and central Guatemala.      Description of Company and Purpose of Project    	Basic, with production at end-1995 of around 13,000 barrels per day (bpd), is Central Americas only significant oil producer. The   project, which consists of the Company&apos;&apos;s 1996 investment program, is expected to generate valuable incremental net foreign exchange of around US$25 million per year, including government income in the form of royalties and government participation of US$19 million per year.  The Company, with 479 employees of which just four are expatriates, will continue to play an important role in hiring and training Guatemalan employees.  IFCs role in this project is to enable Basic to continue a successful growth pattern and improve its profitability; help ensure the Companys continued growth in compliance with international environmental standards; continue to facilitate a dialog between the Company and environmental NGOs active in the area; and provide and mobilize funds for Guatemala where there are virtually no commercial sources of long-term financing without a B Loan structure.        Environmental Category and Issues    	This is a category A project according to IFC&apos;&apos;s environmental review procedure.  Environmental issues associated with this project include compliance of the Xan Field&apos;&apos;s expansion with the World Bank&apos;&apos;s OP 4.04 (Natural Habitats), pipeline right-of-way impacts, oil spills, management of produced water and gas, access to protected areas and areas of high biodiversity, social and economic impacts to communities, worker health and safety.  An additional environmental issue is the Company&apos;&apos;s compliance with Government of Guatemala environmental requirements for the Xan to La Libertad pipeline and the implementation of environmental mitigation measures proposed in the corporate environmental audit completed by the Company in 1994.  A draft environmental assessment was made available to the World Bank Public Information Center on April 15, 1996.  Basic has held extensive consultations with a variety of stakeholders during the preparation of this draft EA.  These consultations led to commitments from Basic to conduct supplementary environmental studies that will detail the Companys environmental management commitments to demonstrate full compliance of the second project with applicable World Bank environmental policies and guidelines and also confirm the first projects ongoing compliance.    The  are  from the Public Information Center.
