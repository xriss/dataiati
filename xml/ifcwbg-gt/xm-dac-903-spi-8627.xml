   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Summary Of Project Information (SPI)       Project Name    Guatemala-La Fragua, S.A. (La Fragua or the Company)      RegionLatin America and Caribbean   Sector   Project No008627   Projected Board DateApril 1, 1998   Company NameLa Fragua, S.A.   Technical Partner and/or Major Shareholders    	La Fraguas shares are presently 80% owned by the Companys original founders, the Paiz family.  The remaining 20% are mainly in the hands of the public (original supporters of the founder), and retired and existing employees. The Company plans to become public by listing new shares in Guatemalas, Mexicos or New Yorks stock exchanges.    Project Cost Including Proposed IFC Investment    	The total project cost is estimated at about US$124 million.  IFCs proposed investment is expected to be in the form of up to US$20 million in an A Loan and a Convertible Subordinated C loan of up to US$5 million.    Location of Project and Description of Site    	The project will be located throughout Guatemala and El Salvador, covering the main cities, the interior and the more rural areas of the two countries.    Description of Company and Purpose of Project   (include IFCs Role and Development Impact)    	La Fragua is Guatemalas largest retail supermarket chain, with 49 stores located in Guatemala City, and 19 in the interior of the country. La Fraguas three-year Project will involve the following components: (a)opening about 48 new stores in Guatemala and 32 in El Salvador; (b) modernizing and refurbishing existing facilities and operations; (c) opening a state-of-the-art distribution center; and (d) modernizing and improving information and technology systems.  The Company expects to benefit from higher margins (as a result of lower fixed costs, improved efficiencies and economies of scale), to streamline and run more technologically-efficient operations, and improve its competitive position, while at the same time preempting local and foreign competitors wishing to enter the market.  IFCs financing provides La Fragua with long-term funding which would otherwise be limited and expensive through other sources for companies in Guatemala.  In addition, as La Fraguas first foreign lender, IFC could serve as a catalyst to encourage greater foreign investment in the Company.  IFCs participation would also improve the Companys corporate governance through improved reporting and better management practices, while acting as an agent of change in its expansion plans.  La Fraguas Project is expected to have the following developmental impacts: (i) the Companys expansion plans would assist in distributing to the less able population groups a wider variety of food and other basic necessity items (at lower or competitive prices) under cleaner and more hygienic conditions.  By delivering products in the interior at the same price as in the capital cities, the Project would foster a more competitive environment, while reducing traveling time and distances for the more remote communities. The Project would also improve the distribution of food and non-food items in Guatemala and El Salvador, by introducing best practice and modern retailing methods, and by bringing about technological improvements in logistics and distribution systems; and (ii) the Project will create about 1,800 jobs, primarily for women, contributing to social and economic growth in the more rural areas of the two countries. In addition, the Project would also provide uncommon employee-benefit packages and higher than average compensation rates.  The expansion plans would also foster better academical standards and training, and create career opportunities for the Companys employees and management, thereby improving the standards of living in the region in which it will operate.     Environmental Category and Issues    	This is an environmental review category B project.  Issues include land use and site location, liquid effluents treatment and discharge, solid waste management, use of non-CFC refrigerants, fire protection, safety and emergency response and general worker health and safety.  The sponsor will implement actions to address these issues and demonstrate that the Project will comply with applicable Guatemalan and Salvadorian requirements and World Bank guidelines. Liquid effluents will be treated and properly disposed.  Solid residues will be either recycled or properly disposed according to local regulations.  Non-CFC refrigerants will be used.  The sponsor will audit their current safety and emergency response practices and implement actions satisfactory to IFC.  Employees will be trained on occupational health and industrial safety issues.      The  is  March 2, 1998 from the Public Information Center.
