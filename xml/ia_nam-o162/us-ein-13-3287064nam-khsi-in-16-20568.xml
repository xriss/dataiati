   <narrative xml:lang="EN">Keystone Human Services International is beginning a partnership with The Hans Foundation to strengthen the inclusion of people with disabilities in community life in India and to create the Keystone Institute India, an educational institute on disability, community, and innovation.

This national institute will exist to provide training and consultation related to the creation of responsive community supports for men, women, and children living in India with disability. It will focus on supporting individualized alternatives to congregate care and institutionalization.
The Institute will work with others who care about individuals with disabilities: their families, advocates, allied organizations, and those with disabilities themselves. Leadership activities to seek, identify, and cultivate Indian leadership to head up the change movement for a more inclusive and just Indian society will be an important part of our work. The focus of this outreach is to improve the lives of those with disabilities by bringing communities together and developing responsive community-based supports.

By offering a framework for developing an inclusive society, the Institute will lay the foundation for welcoming people with disabilities into community life and for finding alternatives to institutionalization. Ultimately, it is our hope that this work will give new confidence to Indian communities that they can develop their own solutions that work for all people and establish a long term vision that will inspire, motivate, and create better life possibilities for all.</narrative>
